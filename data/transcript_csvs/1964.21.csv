1964.21,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,199.806,202.277,Is your client an intervenor?

1964.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,457.444,459.058,But which class?
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,459.058,465.846,"As far as classification, we do not have a term any longer that says first class, fifth class."
1964.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,468.402,468.409,Commodity.

1964.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,472.782,474.155,First class rate.
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,474.155,477.163,Quite low rated as the Commission did find sir.

1964.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,750.142,752.559,"Well, would you answer his question please?"
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,752.559,753.851,"Yes, sir."
1964.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,753.851,756.884,Is it that character of terrain there?
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,756.884,759.188,In my personal observation Your Honor --
1964.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,759.188,759.425,As a matter of fact --
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,759.425,768.189,"-- there exists one significant iron ore mine, and in the immediate vicinage, I see no industrial community."
1964.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,776.359,778.496,"Substantially, what the court said."
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,778.496,779.979,"Yes, sir."
1964.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1173.333,1189.024,"This -- the court here recognized that, and I read their opinion on page 391 that in the Missouri-Pacific case trade had already -- have always been interchanged between the two lines."
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,1189.024,1189.724,"That is correct, it really did."
1964.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1189.724,1196.029,Says the connection was to be used to interchange freight with formally had been interchanged between them via the Missouri-Pacific.
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,1196.029,1196.871,Very clearly.
1964.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1205.437,1207.364,In this case?
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,1210.781,1211.272,Quite significant sir.
1964.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1211.272,1215.777,-- and decisive distinction between this case and the Missouri-Pacific case?
1964.21,0,30022,john_c_danielson,,1215.777,1216.895,Yes sir.
1964.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1425.705,1439.06,We'll recess.

1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1652.855,1653.774,Not specifically.

1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1687.283,1689.289,No sir.
1964.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1689.289,1691.18,Did you construct a new one?
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1691.18,1705.131,"We constructed 262 feet of track Your Honor, and in my opinion this is not a construction of a line of railroad, it's a switching track yes sir."
1964.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1705.131,1710.424,(Inaudible)
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1710.424,1725.978,The Milwaukee and Ishpeming filed an application under Section 5 requesting authority to jointly use the main line of the Ishpeming for the purpose of returning the Milwaukee's locomotive to its own line.

1964.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1752.268,1753.773,(Inaudible)
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1753.773,1765.387,"I don't believe it is, because because what the Commission did rely on was not the fact that we had extended our line to a new destination which of course was not the case."
1964.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1791.408,1797.201,(Inaudible)
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1797.201,1808.436,"The switching track is not an extension but in my opinion, the Interstate Commerce Commission said the track is an extension because of these other effects."
1964.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1808.951,1810.289,(Inaudible)
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1810.289,1810.876,It is sir.
1964.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1829.33,1836.069,(Inaudible)
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1836.069,1840.62,"No Mr. Justice Black, I do not believe so."
1964.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1848.53,1849.588,(Inaudible)
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1849.588,1850.019,Pardon me.
1964.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1850.019,1851.658,(Inaudible)
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1851.658,1856.532,This is our case precisely because it is a switching track it is not an extension.
1964.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1856.532,1863.287,"Well, do you acknowledge any -- I don't know what you call it, expertise or something like that."
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1891.075,1892.922,"And very properly so, Your Honor."
1964.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1892.922,1893.111,Why isn't that -- ?
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1893.111,1894.29,But such cases.
1964.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1894.29,1896.483,Why isn't that this kind of a case?
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1896.483,1909.897,"In the cases where the expertise of the Commission should be respected, the issues are such as to involve factual administrative determinations."
1964.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1915.443,1933.069,"Why I remember forgotten the trial of the case but we have one here a couple of years ago whether or not -- in one trucking area, whether or not a given operation by furniture manufacturer was a contract carriage or private carriage."
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,1957.517,1958.629,"No, sir."
1964.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1997.708,2001.97,"Well yes, the legal issue is whether it's an extension or a switching line, isn't it?"
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2001.97,2002.577,"Yes, sir."
1964.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2002.577,2009.939,"Well, now how -- what are the standards which judges can apply to decide whether it's one or the other on these facts?"
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2009.939,2015.833,Congress has not set out in these sections of the Act any definitive standard.
1964.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2017.827,2018.819,To the court?
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2018.819,2019.484,To the courts.
1964.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2056.458,2060.176,"Well that was a seven mile long extension or something, isn't it?"
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2060.176,2069.463,"Yes, but the argument was made in that case, sir that the court should respect the Commission's expertise in deciding the question and this Court said no."
1964.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2072.183,2086.63,Mr. Long perhaps in respect with our record but when we assume the Commission found this extension not the Commission right?
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2086.63,2087.61,"No, sir."
1964.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2114.572,2116.844,296.
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2116.844,2117.744,296.
1964.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.398,2153.872,What if the Commission says that as probably the fact here that his was not only a switching track but a switching track between two different lines and one that had a substantial impact upon the traffic patterns in the two lines.
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2153.872,2155.278,"Mr. Justice White, I --"
1964.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.278,2158.277,Is that true or isn't it that --
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2158.277,2158.83,I believe this is --
1964.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.83,2162.709,-- there is no dispute about the facts that this is the fact here?
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2162.709,2163.331,"Yes, sir."
1964.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.331,2169.299,But it did have substantial impact on traffic and was the connection between two lines and it was new track that they never had before?
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2169.299,2170.854,"Yes, sir."
1964.21,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.008,2192.936,What's the purpose of giving the Commission power to pass upon an extension?
1964.21,1,24266,frank_m_long,,2196.222,2198.775,It's clear from decisions of this Court sir.
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3445.353,3448.607,"I'd like to answer several specific questions, if I may."
1964.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3516.234,3527.417,But for authorized the movement of through routes makes (Inaudible).
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3527.417,3529.744,If they had made such a finding Mr. Justice Black.

1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3533.342,3534.048,If they had --
1964.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3534.048,3537.507,(Inaudible)
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3537.507,3539.345,"Alright, let me make this point."
1964.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3581.38,3593.9,Can you justify the claim under 118 of designating something as an extension even more than nothing but conviction --
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3593.9,3594.858,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1964.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3594.858,3596.343,-- of a single --
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3596.343,3597.719,You raise this question --
1964.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3597.719,3598.532,-- through routes.
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3598.532,3601.432,-- you raised this question earlier Mr. Justice Black.
1964.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3644.851,3650.261,But you did raise in which case that this particular point been raised and decided?
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3650.261,3659.769,"Alabama and Vicksburg, it is decided at -- we've set out in two of the briefs."
1964.21,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3663.878,3666.109,Did that specifically settled that point?
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3666.109,3671.274,Specifically and the Tex-Mex case likewise specifically settles that point.
1964.21,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3687.441,3706.382,"Well in those case Mr. Danielson, goes so far as I read this excerpt at page 298 that the Commission were to say that the creation of the connection enable the defendants to compete for traffic which therefore was adequately served by other carriers, does it go that far?"
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3706.382,3719.886,"These are independent determinations of public convenience not of jurisdiction Your Honor, but we would take the position Mr. Justice Brennan that its findings on public convenience ought to be findings treated for the jurisdictional element as well."
1964.21,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3719.886,3721.778,For purpose is of one is an extension with in line --
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3721.778,3724.248,"Absolutely, no question."
1964.21,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3725.111,3725.567,"Oh, I see!"
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3729.373,3734.946,Section 118 having jurisdiction then requires the Commission to determine whether public convenience and necessity --
1964.21,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3734.946,3735.377,Yes.
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3735.377,3736.876,-- permit.
1964.21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3776.846,3782.232,"Talking about this case, nobody else is complaining."
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3782.232,3784.061,I am that complainant sir.
1964.21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3784.917,3790.265,"These carriers here are -- these carriers here are weakening themselves respectfully, so --"
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3790.265,3792.99,And at our expense because the record shows --
1964.21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3792.99,3801.166,(Inaudible) that the purpose presented to me speak in terms of what the carrier has built the expense and does it himself?
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3801.166,3828.749,"Or by another carrier establishing a line competing which is superfluous as the Commission found this connection to be, because prior to this establishment of this connection each and every law, each and every pound of sawdust if you will, every bit of traffic that moved was moving over the light density line which we had heretofore operated for almost 100 years in that territory."
1964.21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3828.749,3831.497,Who owns this railroad?
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3831.497,3832.5,Which railroad are we speaking of sir?
1964.21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3832.5,3838.845,The railroad that --
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3838.845,3839.677,This little one here?
1964.21,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3839.677,3840.471,Yes.
1964.21,2,30022,john_c_danielson,,3840.471,3849.627,"The ownership is established red 130 feet Milwaukee, blue 130 feet L.S.& I, blue another roughly 100."
