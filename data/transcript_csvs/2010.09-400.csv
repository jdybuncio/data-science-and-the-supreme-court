2010.09-400,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.903,"We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 09-400, Staub v. Proctor Hospital."
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,9.605,10.198,Thank you.
2010.09-400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,50.261,55.288,"Well, before we jump to agency law, shouldn't we take a look at the language of the statute?"
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,55.288,58.115,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,58.115,71.268,"And the statute says that a prima facie case is made out if it is shown that military service, anti-military animus, was a motivating factor in the employer's action."
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,76.435,76.812,That's correct.
2010.09-400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,76.812,83.122,"And the word ""motivate"" means to provide someone with a motive to do something, right?"
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,83.122,84.417,"Yes, sir."
2010.09-400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,84.417,92.805,"And the person who did something here was the person who discharged, discharged Mr. Staub, right?"
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,92.805,94.462,"Well, that's not the--"
2010.09-400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,94.462,104.549,So why doesn't it follow that the motivation that is relevant under the statute is the motivation of the person who -- who performs the action that is challenged?
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,104.549,110.328,"--Well, there is a -- there are a series of actions and decisions that yield this result."
2010.09-400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,116.467,122.667,"No, but the -- what is -- what is made illegal are certain employer actions, right?"
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,131.632,133.024,--That's correct.
2010.09-400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.352,168.381,But you say that those decisions that contribute have to be decisions by supervisory personnel.
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,188.276,196.005,"--Well, our standard is not whether it's a supervisor, but whether it's an official for whom the employer is liable under agency law."
2010.09-400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.133,273.254,The employer would be liable for these lower supervisory employees here why?
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,275.957,278.659,"No, they had other authorities."
2010.09-400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,280.737,288.856,Why do they stand in different shoes from a co-employee who also contributes to the ultimate decision to fire?
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,288.856,294.448,But it's -- it's the core responsibility of -- in terms of scope of employment.
2010.09-400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,362.682,367.759,Could I just ask where -- could I ask where your argument leads?
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,403.884,405.76,--It would.
2010.09-400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,407.522,416.174,"Even -- even if the employer at that time did every -- made every reasonable effort to investigate the validity of all the prior evaluations, still the employer would be on the hook?"
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,416.174,417.176,--Yes.
2010.09-400,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,423.097,424.204,"Well, that's a sweeping rule."
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,467.235,468.187,Yes.
2010.09-400,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,468.187,469.591,That's sweeping.
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,475.261,475.791,It's--
2010.09-400,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.791,477.059,He has to insure.
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,482.241,485.553,--Respondeat -- respondeat superior is absolute liability.
2010.09-400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,527.803,528.598,But there is--
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,528.598,529.628,But there is no--
2010.09-400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.628,545.451,"--There is this defense for the employer that, no matter that there was this ill will, there was enough else to warrant termination of this employee."
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,547.479,550.385,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-400,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,604.56,606.717,That isn't what the statute says.
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,642.53,649.291,"Well, I think that the kind of circumstances that the Court has pointed to would be at the remedy stage."
2010.09-400,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,709.344,723.308,Isn't that -- the government's formulation that the discrimination has to play a substantial role in the termination a limiting principle?
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,748.299,752.234,"Well, in that regard I think we would articulate the standard differently."
2010.09-400,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,752.234,753.31,Than the SG?
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,753.31,754.016,Yes.
2010.09-400,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,768.227,772.898,But it has to have some materiality to the decision.
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,785.439,789.061,--If I could go back to Price Waterhouse and explain how we got to this language.
2010.09-400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.076,833.746,"Mr. Schnapper, I guess this goes back to Justice Alito's question."
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,861.499,864.264,"That's not our position, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.729,919.551,"You want to hold the employer liable for the actions of these other officials, other than the one who did the firing."
2010.09-400,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,930.236,940.652,--It's our view that the language of the statute permits that distinction because of the discretionary nature of the remedy provision as opposed to the mandatory nature of 4311(c)(1).
2010.09-400,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,942.667,943.572,"Thank you, Mr. Schnapper."
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,956.101,958.818,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.747,1012.649,"Do you regard -- is that the same as a but-for cause, motivating factor?"
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1012.649,1014.057,--No.
2010.09-400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1041.731,1049.838,"Are you using proximate cause in but-for, or are you suggesting a different formulation of causation?"
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1049.838,1055.586,"In our view the ""motivating factor"" language captures the idea of proximate cause."
2010.09-400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1111.111,1122.306,"In that formulation as you've just articulated, where do you place your test of a subordinate setting in motion and playing a substantial role?"
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1128.008,1166.18,"--The -- the discriminatorily motivated actions in this case, the evidence interpreted in the light most favorable to Petitioner, were the decision of Mulally to write up Petitioner for this January 27th incident, and that was motivated by her hostility to him because of his status in the Army Reserves; and then the decision of Korenchuk to report that he had violated the terms of that January 27th warning, and that was also motivated by his hostility to Petitioner's membership in the -- in the Army Reserves."
2010.09-400,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1176.569,1192.357,"Your -- Petitioner's counsel argues that there is no issue of -- in the motivating factor test, it doesn't have to be a substantial role; it just has to be a motivating factor, so that the subordinates--"
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1192.357,1197.2,"--Well, this may just be a semantic disagreement."
2010.09-400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1214.648,1240.981,"What happens in the situation where a prior evaluation or some disciplinary action does have a substantial effect on the decision that's -- the employment decision that's made, but the employer has no notice that the prior evaluation or disciplinary action was based on a biased ground, or any reasonable way of finding out that it was based on a biased ground?"
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1242.588,1255.425,"--There would still be liability just as there is liability in the situation, which is quite common, where an employer gives a single official the authority to both observe an employee's behavior and make a decision to terminate."
2010.09-400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1271.654,1280.557,"How do you get around the statutory language that says that the motivating, it has to be a motivating factor in the -- in the action that is challenged?"
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1280.557,1286.554,--It -- it has to be a motivating -- the statute says a motivating factor in the employer's action.
2010.09-400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1286.554,1289.226,And the employer's action here is -- is discharge.
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1289.226,1301.065,"Yes, and the employer -- the employer is a corporation, and it's -- so you have to look at which individuals do you look at in figuring out whether it was a motivating factor or not, and the statute tells us that."
2010.09-400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1310.591,1320.713,"Yes, but those other people -- everybody who has been delegated authority under the -- by the employer are not -- is not involved in the action that's challenged--"
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1320.713,1321.555,They--
2010.09-400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1321.555,1324.025,--does not take the action of this challenge.
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1324.025,1330.443,"--They are not the last person who signs the piece of paper, but they certainly are part of the employer's--"
2010.09-400,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1330.443,1340.5,"So maybe then the test is whether they were delegated some of the responsibility for the challenged action, were they delegated responsibility for making the discharge decision."
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1340.5,1355.009,"--They -- they were delegated supervisory responsibility by the -- by the employer, the authority to observe the people under their supervision, to evaluate and report on their performance, the authority to initiate disciplinary proceedings."
2010.09-400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1376.863,1392.497,"What about a situation where a particular procedure such as the one here is set up for a discriminatory reason, and the employee is really upset with that, and so he, you know, starts a fire in the plant?"
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1403.851,1408.721,"No, even though, as you say, in a sense there would be but-for causation."
2010.09-400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1408.721,1409.381,Yes.
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1409.381,1425.966,"But it is not -- it is not under any standard of proximate causation, and not -- the initial discriminatory discipline or warning would not be a motivating or substantial factor in the ultimate decision to fire him."
2010.09-400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1427.935,1434.478,So you do accept that the traditional doctrine of an intervening cause is applicable in this?
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1434.478,1437.102,--Some independent intervening cause.
2010.09-400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1438.9,1441.24,"Well, but what -- what independent intervening cause--"
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1441.24,1442.881,Independent of the employer.
2010.09-400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1485.908,1490.845,"--Well, I'm sorry -- but I think the end there just kind of glided over the whole issue."
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1504.436,1512.243,"It is not, I think it -- one would hope it is not a foreseeable result of discipline given to an employee that he would then start a fire."
2010.09-400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1512.243,1517.257,"Well, I know, but the hypothetical is extreme to try to flesh out your position."
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1533.406,1545.728,"One would not normally think that, even if it's less extreme than starting a fire, that a course of misconduct by the employee is a foreseeable result of a discriminatory--"
2010.09-400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.728,1558.818,Wouldn't it -- wouldn't the employer's defense simply be: Anyone who starts a fire goes?
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1567.97,1569.452,--Yes.
2010.09-400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1569.452,1577.216,That just comes under the employer's defense as showing that the same action would have been taken.
2010.09-400,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1577.216,1577.981,Yes.
2010.09-400,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1577.981,1579.135,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1585.663,1588.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1625.133,1627.523,Let's look at the hypothetical.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1644.092,1644.747,Right.
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1644.747,1646.421,Absolutely a falsehood.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1696.448,1708.661,"I think in that situation, consistent with the ""cat's paw"" analysis, with the facts that you set up, the two supervisors so dominated her decision that there would be likely a finding that the case goes to the jury."
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1708.661,1708.926,How?
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1723.452,1730.794,"But there being no other input whatsoever beyond that, there still is the domination issue."
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1755.112,1756.032,"Well, that's the question."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1778.049,1786.375,"I think that is what the jury has to decide, but I'm not sure that case in the latter extended hypothetical gets that far."
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1786.375,1796.357,"Well, what this circuit's ""cat's paw"" theory does and what others do say, if she engaged in any investigation there's no liability."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1796.357,1799.356,I disagree with that a little bit.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1807.756,1809.429,What was it -- what was it here?
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1815.224,1816.363,Right.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1816.363,1832.106,"--takes him into Buck's office and Buck hands him the pink slip and says, ""You're fired"", that the jury could have credited that evidence."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1851.08,1854.044,I will answer that.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1862.541,1863.528,When?
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1863.528,1864.994,At the -- two times.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1886.125,1887.798,This is after he got his pink slip.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1909.975,1916.179,--I think the record shows he did give an explanation of his whereabouts.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1921.844,1923.388,After he was fired.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1923.388,1924.387,After he was fired.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1960.718,1972.526,"Did I understand you to say that you do agree with the Seventh Circuit's ""cat's paw"" approach to this?"
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,1972.526,1973.93,I do agree with it.
2010.09-400,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1996.438,2003.434,Before you -- how is that consistent with the statutory language that requires that this discrimination simply be a motivating factor?
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2003.434,2022.74,"The answer to that is, the statute sets forth five factors, four or five factors, and says that one of the four or five employment actions has to be a motivating factor in arriving at the decision."
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2022.74,2027.704,Can we -- let's look at the statutory factors.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2027.704,2028.316,Okay.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2036.138,2038.825,And where are you reading it from?
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2038.825,2042.183,"--From the third line -- well, I'm sorry, I can't tell you what line it is."
2010.09-400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.183,2044.028,Page 3 of the blue brief.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2044.028,2055.648,"It says that there are five actions that are prohibited: Denial of initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment."
2010.09-400,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2090.791,2091.758,"Well, I'm sorry."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2099.787,2100.707,Correct.
2010.09-400,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2100.707,2107.924,"And I understood your position to be that the supervisor has to have such dominant control that it's the ""Cat's Paw""."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2107.924,2116.718,"That the subordinate's motivation is imputed actually to the decisionmaker, and ultimately to the employer."
2010.09-400,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.718,2123.901,"Well, I guess where I'm having trouble following you is the total domination-motivating factor."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2128.557,2145.205,"Well, I think in the context of this case, Your Honor, it is not, because the definition of ""employer"" here not only includes Proctor Hospital, what you might call the ultimate employer, but it also includes the person who made the adverse employment decision."
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2169.896,2175.129,But that assumes that the employment decision is solely hers.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2182.098,2182.582,I agree.
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2189.514,2191.655,But -- but she's not acting in a vacuum.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2200.292,2203.774,"And in this case, she is acting on an awful lot of information."
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2204.414,2207.319,We are now talking past the individual case.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2207.319,2207.694,--Okay.
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2207.694,2218.675,"I am talking about just the legal analysis, which is: She is a decisionmaker, but there are multiple actors on behalf of the employer."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2249.021,2266.921,"That would lead to a never-ending chain of looking backwards all the time over the course of perhaps a very long employment history to scour the record to determine, is there one single or two single actions out there that may somehow have come forward and caused this termination?"
2010.09-400,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2266.921,2275.475,"Well, in most situations an employer comes in and says: I fired X for X, Y, and Z reasons."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2288.737,2305.198,"I'm not sure I thoroughly understand the hypothetical, but if the true decisionmaker there comes forward and says, I didn't know about this, I didn't rely upon it, I don't think that the animus can be imputed to the decisionmaker."
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.198,2306.247,Why is this so complicated?
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2307.682,2308.434,I don't think--
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2308.434,2312.056,"But the thing -- but it doesn't help you, I don't think, if it isn't complicated."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2322.534,2322.862,--Right.
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.862,2323.427,Right.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2325.174,2325.548,Correct.
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.548,2350.022,"Now, why don't we just stop there and just say, we have a statute, the statute says that if -- if a bad motive was a motivating -- had to be a motivating factor, discriminatory -- discriminatory motivating factor in the dismissal, then, unless you can prove an affirmative defense, you lose."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2398.406,2400.204,"No consideration of proximate cause, either."
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2400.204,2400.813,"Oh, no."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2422.615,2430.348,"Because to motivate -- to be motivated by one of these factors, there has to be some element of proximate causation."
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.348,2430.582,Fine.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2444.34,2445.214,I think that--
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2445.214,2448.466,That doesn't just sound like it was a motivating cause.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2450.307,2455.663,--I think that that is the Seventh Circuit's way of saying proximate cause.
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.663,2456.74,"Ah, okay."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2477.859,2480.781,I think you could say that.
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2480.781,2481.421,All right.
2010.09-400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.807,2495.068,"I think that you've misread -- I think that you've misread the ""cat's paw"" principle of the court of appeals."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2598.07,2605.725,"And I agree with that, and we get back to the notion that in this case, it was Ms. Buck who made the decision."
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2606.411,2606.567,But the--
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2606.567,2607.441,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2607.441,2626.435,"--But Ms. Buck never would have made this decision if Korenchuk hadn't come in and said: Here's Staub, he's goofing off; he was told to tell me when he was going to be absent, and he didn't."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2653.626,2654.874,Only on one respect.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.446,2680.271,"In any case, there was no indication, apart from Korenchuk's coming in, that Buck would have taken any adverse action against Staub."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2680.271,2682.533,I don't think we know the answer to that.
2010.09-400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.254,2684.518,That's not the point.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2727.938,2728.375,--Yes.
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2728.375,2733.5,"Then you can't agree with me, because my question was why would that be?"
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2807.107,2812.418,"And in B, the employer could not be liable."
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2830.582,2834.003,Because together they dismissed the employee.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2834.003,2834.518,"Oh, no."
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.518,2839.5,"One by supplying the false statement, the other by acting on it."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2839.5,2840.841,I disagree on that.
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2843.201,2844.718,They are both agents.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2863.662,2872.673,I have listened to the hypothetical long enough that I have lost track of who made the decision to fire him.
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2872.673,2876.967,I feel I'm going to get nowhere pursuing this hypothetical further.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2878.577,2879.481,Thank you.
2010.09-400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.481,2881.592,--Answer it as you wish or as you understand it.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2881.592,2893.197,"As I understand it, the second person in the hypothetical had no motivation whatsoever under the statute to cause the discharge and therefore the employer wouldn't be liable for that decision."
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2893.197,2908.284,"Well, your position is -- it coincides with the Seventh Circuit, but it is in opposition to the Secretary of Labor's commentary on how this works."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2935.99,2943.722,"Normally you would give weight to the government's position, but I think the government's position has to be consistent with the precise language of the statute."
2010.09-400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.722,2948.425,How does the Secretary of Labor administer this statute?
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2952.189,2956.954,"There can be a charge filed with the Secretary of Labor, which the Secretary of Labor would then investigate."
2010.09-400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2972.181,2978.506,"Well, why isn't this just governed by the standard principles of tort for concurrent actors?"
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,2994.109,3012.6,"I think that the problem with this situation is, is that one of the actors here, the decision that she made, being Mulally, and that's with respect to whom the most evidence of animus was adduced, didn't commit an action that would be actionable under USERRA."
2010.09-400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3021.631,3025.596,But we are -- but we are talking about the test.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,3038.684,3038.949,Sure.
2010.09-400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3038.949,3052.741,"--but to that general effect, the instruction given to the jury was really overprotective of your client, under the standard concurrent -- concurrent causation analysis."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,3052.741,3070.78,"The instruction may have been somewhat protective, but the problem is, prior to issuing that instruction the district court did no analysis whatsoever to determine if the instruction was warranted in the first place, and that was simply our point to the Seventh Circuit."
2010.09-400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3084.214,3088.398,Can I turn to the Secretary of Labor's regulations?
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,3120.075,3125.993,"I believe that is the only thing with -- there may be a section later on, Your Honor, in the regs that deals with--"
2010.09-400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3125.993,3127.959,--This is the one that the government refers to.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,3127.959,3129.382,--That is certainly the commentary that goes with it.
2010.09-400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3129.491,3132.615,That doesn't seem to me to be so damning of your case.
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,3138.94,3149.605,"Ms. Buck would have said: I let him go because he has this veritable tsunami of bad behaviors, what he is accused of is absolutely consistent with it, and I made the decision."
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3183.279,3196.134,"Could a jury find from the testimony before -- before it, that at the time he received his pink slip -- let's not talk about the grievance after--"
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,3196.134,3196.446,Right.
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3196.446,3219.606,"--at the time he got the grievance slip, he was not given any opportunity to explain that this charge was not warranted, that he had tried to reach Korenchuk on the phone to tell him, we are going to lunch, and was unable to."
2010.09-400,2,39104,roy_g_davis,,3222.858,3236.584,"Again, Your Honor, I believe the record says -- and I apologize, I can't quote it from the page -- that in fact Mr. Staub protested that what he was accused of, i.e., not being where he was supposed to be, was wrong."
2010.09-400,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3252.689,3253.781,"Thank you, Mr. Davis."
2010.09-400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3256.562,3270.042,"Mr. Schnapper, is that your recollection of this record, too, that he did state his version before he got the pink slip?"
2010.09-400,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3270.042,3272.991,I think it's somewhat unclear what happened.
2010.09-400,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.195,3307.584,"Well, I don't think anybody thought that Buck would have fired him just for that one absence."
2010.09-400,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3320.874,3326.997,But those aren't the versions in the written record at the time.
2010.09-400,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3394.95,3402.543,"Well, do you think that the standard for employer liability is different under this statute than under other federal antidiscrimination statutes?"
2010.09-400,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3404.415,3414.912,"I think there are particularly compelling textual reasons for the position we are urging here, other statutes have different language."
2010.09-400,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3418.253,3431.999,So if we were to hold here that the VII or under the ADEA or under the ADA?
2010.09-400,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3431.999,3439.931,"--Well, we think that would be wrong for some of the reasons we set out in our brief, but you could write an opinion that only addressed it under USERRA and left those other questions open."
2010.09-400,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3439.931,3444.556,Why would Title VII be different?
2010.09-400,3,23226,eric_schnapper,,3444.556,3457.268,"Of the language in Title VII is similar to 4311(c)(1), but the language that I just read about the purpose isn't in Title VII."
2010.09-400,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3528.925,3531.457,"Thank you, counsel."
