1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.946,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-5843, Dennis Sochor v. Florida."
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,10.678,14.061,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-5843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,20.576,21.614,"Could you speak up, please?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,21.614,23.625,"--I apologize, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-5843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,23.625,23.915,It is hard to hear.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,26.059,34.775,"I have a soft voice, I'm afraid."
1991.91-5843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,36.585,37.436,Yes.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,37.436,38.868,"Okay, good."
1991.91-5843,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.341,127.456,"Well, this Court has said in several opinions, I guess, that it's a State that... in which the judge sentences."
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,127.456,132.498,"--Justice O'Connor, it has said repeatedly that ultimately Florida is a judge-sentencing court."
1991.91-5843,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.131,307.523,"Well, they don't reweigh any mitigating circumstances, do you?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,307.523,309.604,"--Yes, sir, I believe that they do."
1991.91-5843,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.768,317.689,"Just the mitigating evidence, you say?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,317.689,323.323,"Well, Justice White, it's hard to tell really what the Florida Supreme Court does."
1991.91-5843,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,327.166,328.228,How about in this case?
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,337.373,341.134,--The judge said that there were no mitigating circumstances to outweigh--
1991.91-5843,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.134,342.366,And the supreme court affirmed that.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,342.366,349.201,"--The short answer to your question has to be qualified, I'm afraid."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,390.786,396.171,"Do you mean... I don't mean to put you off your argument, but don't you mean that the jury had mitigating evidence to weigh?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,398.633,399.712,"Justice Souter, that is correct."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,402.764,403.055,Okay.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,411.963,412.912,"No specific findings, yes, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,421.557,425.911,But what you mean is that there was evidence which had a mitigating tendency.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,426.53,429.882,"In part, yes, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,432.534,445.102,"Well, what I'm talking about... when I'm using the word circumstance, I'm talking about specific findings which are provided for by statute... the finding, for example in this case, cold-blooded or what not."
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,468.888,473.6,"Justice Souter, I'm afraid that... I hate to say it's not fair."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.818,493.315,"Yes, but the Florida statute, as I understand it, does not say there are certain facts which we will dignify by the term mitigating circumstances."
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,498.417,501.72,The statute has a list of mitigating circumstances.
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,501.72,502.11,It does?
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,502.11,502.431,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,502.431,512.436,And is the jury instructed to find them in the same... or fail to find them... in the same sense that it is instructed to find or fail to find aggravating circumstances?
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,512.436,512.996,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,513.488,523.195,"So that in this case the jury had mitigating evidence, but it in fact made no findings that mitigating circumstances had actually been proven."
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,523.195,531.599,"--Well, sir, it makes... yes, because it makes no find... specific findings of fact as to aggravating circumstances or mitigating circumstances."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,532.38,532.66,Okay.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,553.093,554.415,"Yes, sir, it's a general verdict."
1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,554.415,556.135,And it's an advisory verdict.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,556.135,558.559,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, that is correct."
1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,572.217,575.419,"Yes, but here it was not a life verdict, was it?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,575.419,575.92,"No, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.55,600.765,"We've had a couple of cases earlier on, Spaziano and then per curiam several years later, kind of explaining what we thought that process was."
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,600.765,613.033,The Florida process is that the jury in the first instance makes the determination as to whether it should be a death sentence or a life sentence.
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,641.691,644.513,"And the judge does make specific findings, right?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,644.513,645.955,"Yes, Justice Souter."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,645.955,647.235,"In other words, he doesn't come in with a general verdict, as it were."
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,650.467,651.408,"Yes, Justice."
1991.91-5843,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,651.408,654.361,In this case he found four aggravators and he found no mitigators.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,654.361,661.604,He found... he went through the so-called statutory mitigating circumstances and found that none of them applied.
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.944,691.587,I don't think it's ambiguous at all.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,709.709,713.259,"Well, he said that that evidence did not constitute nonstatutory."
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.882,717.153,No.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,726.69,727.461,"--Yes, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.326,739.248,"Oh, you think he meant that... what?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,739.248,741.328,I'm saying he was ambiguous.
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.328,742.789,I don't think it's ambiguous at all.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,750.605,757.479,"It's the sentencing order, Mr. Chief Justice, in the joint appendix."
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.823,766.334,It's on page 15 of your brief.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,766.334,771.069,"--Well, unfortunately, there is a typographical error in my brief on that."
1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.792,776.321,Thank you.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,776.321,778.514,I apologize for the typographical error.
1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.131,808.424,"Where it starts out: In summary, it is the conclusion of the court, after carefully and conscientiously weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, that there are sufficient aggravating circumstances to justify and warrant the imposition of the death penalty, and that there are no mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,811.325,817.36,"Well, he says that he is weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, so there is some weighing going on there."
1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.322,832.801,There is certainly... you have to read something else from an earlier part of the paragraph in to bring an ambiguity to that sentence: there are no mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,836.885,841.399,--All right.
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.261,845.092,"Mr. Caldwell, before you go on--"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,845.092,845.32,"--Yes, sir?"
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.32,848.623,--I'm concerned about what is just above what you've read.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,848.623,849.554,Paragraph 8?
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.554,860.27,"Paragraph 8 on page 353, which begins, stating the subject: any other aspect of the defendant's character or record and any other circumstances of the offense."
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,882.806,888.319,He didn't consider the other nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.
1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.617,918.647,But this was not a life verdict.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,918.647,919.989,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.557,1178.488,Excuse me.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1184.411,1185.843,--To the jury instruction.
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.843,1189.986,"--Yes, on cruel and... the heinous circumstance instruction, right?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1189.986,1191.026,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.026,1196.228,I don't understand why you say you are not procedurally barred.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1212.18,1213.98,"No, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1298.887,1302.45,"Well, then you should raise your unconstitutional objection at that point."
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1305.102,1307.834,--We did make the unconstitutional argument in the trial court.
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.133,1310.856,In connection with the instruction?
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1310.856,1313.297,Prior to trial we made that argument.
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.297,1314.018,Prior to trial.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1314.018,1314.987,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1327.686,1335.65,And Florida's rule is that you must in any event make a specific objection to the instruction or there is a procedural bar?
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1335.65,1341.665,"They frequently invoke that as a procedural bar, Justice Kennedy, but not always."
1991.91-5843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1342.626,1343.835,Why wasn't it invoked here?
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1343.835,1347.348,--It was... there was no specific... I'm sorry.
1991.91-5843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.143,1352.791,All right.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1357.917,1358.664,"It can be, yes, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1358.664,1359.185,All right.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1373.336,1374.346,"No, sir."
1991.91-5843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1374.346,1375.607,And the reason is?
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1375.607,1386.274,"Because this Court has held that where the court does not apply the procedural bar consistently at the time of the trial, it is not a bar to this Court's review."
1991.91-5843,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1408.947,1409.228,Yes.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1412.871,1415.082,--It's called fundamental error in Florida.
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.226,1436.677,"Well, why doesn't it make those cases distinguishable?"
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1445.893,1457.56,"Well, I submit that under Maynard there is because the State has been relieved of its burden of proving the elements of the circumstance, because the instruction given is constitutionally defective."
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.56,1459.3,Then any error is fundamental error.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1459.3,1460.943,"Oh, no, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-5843,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.394,1480.816,You see... you have to tell me why you think this is a fundamental error.
1991.91-5843,0,25128,gary_caldwell,,1487.109,1492.663,"No, the Florida... Florida uses fundamental error in a different way than the Federal courts do."
1991.91-5843,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.937,1514.769,"Very well, Mr. Caldwell."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1516.99,1525.515,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1612.721,1627.69,"In a case in which the jury does not... I'm sorry, a case in which the jury does recommend death, what is the articulation under Florida law of the weight to be given to that recommendation?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1627.69,1631.784,That recommendation is given the same recommendation as a life recommendation.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1652.768,1656.879,"No, but what weight does he have to give the jury's recommendation?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1656.879,1670.109,--He is not to give it any weight with regard to his findings with regard to the proper and appropriate sentence based on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances that are being presented to him at the sentencing proceeding.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1670.109,1675.993,"Well, if he doesn't give it any weight at all, why does Florida go through the process of having the jury make a recommendation?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1675.993,1680.656,Because the weight that's being given the recommended sentence is an appellate weight.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1688.291,1688.672,All right.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1694.015,1694.406,It's not--
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1694.406,1701.569,How does Florida articulate the degree of weight to which the appellate court should ascribe?
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1701.569,1710.037,"--Under the... under the appellate way, which is the Tedder standard, which is that the recommendation of life would be given great weight."
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1720.693,1721.053,Okay.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1722.553,1723.645,Death gets great weight also.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1723.645,1724.195,They both do.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1724.195,1730.447,"Because in fact, the great weight that is given the death recommendation equates to no mercy."
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1743.477,1745.908,Perhaps I'm under an misimpression.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1761.419,1763.079,That's an appellate review of that.
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.166,1779.331,But surely the appellate court doesn't impose a standard on the trial judge that the standard... that the trial judge doesn't have to apply himself.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1779.331,1780.212,That's--
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1780.212,1796.892,"If you're a trial judge in Florida, and you receive a verdict from a jury which recommends life, my understanding that the trial court's duty is to sentence him to life unless he can find that no reasonable jury could have come to that conclusion."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1797.623,1817.385,"--I think his obligation is to sentence and make a determination if there is aggravating factors that even qualify individual A for death: and second of all, determine if the aggravating outweighs the mitigation; and then third, he makes a statement with regard to why he believes no rational juror would have... would differ from this result."
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.385,1821.118,"But that is not inconsistent with the proposition I put to you, is it?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1821.118,1821.977,"No, Your Honor."
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.291,1837.098,But he cannot make that determination unless he finds that the jury has committed... has departed very substantially from the evidence.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1867.268,1867.949,--That's correct.
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1880.488,1881.066,I understand that.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1884.201,1884.419,--Absolutely.
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1884.759,1886.872,The standard is the one that I have described.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1886.872,1894.316,"--Yes, Your Honor, but that is applied in every case, whether it's death or life, as far as the trial court is concerned."
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1908.945,1909.966,Does that frequently happen?
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1909.966,1912.467,"--It's not that frequent, but it does happen, Your Honor."
1991.91-5843,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1912.467,1915.61,"There is a statement somewhere in the papers, this has never happened."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1915.61,1917.21,"No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-5843,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1918.452,1920.172,Although the Supreme Court of Florida has.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1920.172,1920.943,Pardon me?
1991.91-5843,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1920.943,1923.745,Although the Supreme Court of Florida has changed it.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1923.745,1924.296,Certainly.
1991.91-5843,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1924.296,1925.617,But not a trial court.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1925.617,1932.139,"There have... yes, Your Honor, that is not... it's not the... I would not... I couldn't give a percentage to it, but it is not unrare that it happens."
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.945,1989.629,"May I ask a question about the standard of review in Florida of a trial judge's statement in the finding that there are no nonmitigating circumstances, the difference between mitigating evidence and mitigating circumstance that Justice Souter indicated?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2026.351,2030.435,The Florida Supreme Court's appellate review is twofold.
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.05,2070.3,Did they do that in... did they do that in this case?
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2070.3,2071.091,Absolutely.
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.233,2074.884,"No, they did not in the aggravating."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2083.94,2096.775,"--That's correct, but they also go through the mitigation and... in the opinion of the court, and tell... and explain why it has been negated by other aspects of the record with regard... for example, of the mental health."
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.636,2130.981,"Is it your understanding that they, the Florida Supreme Court concluded that the mitigating evidence offered was untrue?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2130.981,2136.013,"I think it was... it was refuted, that mitigation--"
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.013,2137.996,I understand on the mental condition.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2137.996,2138.373,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2138.373,2144.218,"But as things like whether he supported the family when his father wasn't working and his alcohol problem, that that was untrue?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2144.218,2152.794,"Well, there are... there was evidence, for example, the very thing that you point to, that he, for a period of time, helped his father when his father was laid off."
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.924,2166.755,"Well, that's my point."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2171.506,2171.947,I don't know.
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.378,2175.749,Didn't they say that that's a matter for the trial judge which we don't review?
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2175.749,2175.98,--Yes.
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.161,2199.586,"Well, there was a reason in this case, namely that he relied on at least one aggravating circumstance that was improper."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2204.478,2214.256,"--Absolutely, because that would be a part of the harmless error analysis if... given everything as they... as it stands, absent that aggravating factor, would death be the same result?"
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.029,2220.97,Where did they do that?
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2221.519,2223.72,At the very... at the end of the opinion.
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.937,2249.138,Doesn't necessarily.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2249.829,2250.187,Absolutely.
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.187,2252.931,--anybody to reweigh the aggravating versus mitigating?
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2252.931,2253.199,Yes.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2272.532,2279.248,"Ms. Snurkowski, I apologize for what I'm afraid is going to make the confusion worse, but I've got to ask the question."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2287.122,2288.462,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2288.462,2303.321,"And you're saying in effect, that's the point at which the Florida Supreme Court considered the evidence, mitigating evidence, even though no mitigating factors were found for purposes of harmless error."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2316.521,2317.212,That's absolutely correct.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2317.503,2317.733,Okay.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2330.43,2336.424,"--Well, certainly, if it... if they had said the magic words, harmless error, we wouldn't be here."
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2337.705,2345.57,"Well, I don't know we would have or not, but they didn't say the magic words, and where can you find a harmless error analysis that considers mitigating evidence in that opinion?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2348.712,2370.748,"Well, as a matter of fact, the State would submit that the case authority cited right after that, Robinson, Holton, James, Francois, all are cases that stand for that very proposition: that a harmless error analysis can be made, and when aggravating factor has been struck and there is still exist... aggravating factors, and there's no mitigation or little mitigation, that death can be the appropriate sentence."
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2370.748,2374.429,"Well, let's assume that that's an appropriate statement of law."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2380.261,2388.108,But I would respectfully submit that that begs the question that the Florida Supreme Court does not do its responsibility or doesn't carry out its appellate function.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2392.881,2399.626,"You mean unless the Florida Supreme Court said we are not going to do harmless error analysis here, that we've got to assume that it did?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2399.626,2400.307,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2407.491,2410.984,How can you go through an analysis without analyzing anything?
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2413.855,2423.221,"--To the point that, if the Court is suggesting that there has to be expansive articulation, it's not there."
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.112,2468.689,"Certainly our Clemons case is not consistent with any submission that a court is deemed to perform its duty to reweigh the evidence, is it?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2468.689,2470.422,No.
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2470.422,2475.314,But isn't... It seems to me that that's what you're arguing to us here.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2475.314,2476.296,"Well, I don't know that a--"
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2476.296,2478.286,That that's quite inconsistent with Clemons.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2478.286,2481.118,"--Well, I don't know if a reweighing is the same as a harmless error analysis."
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2481.669,2482.22,Either one.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2482.22,2487.393,--The Florida Supreme Court has announced that it does not do a reweighing with regard to an error.
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2487.393,2488.124,That is true.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2488.124,2489.444,It will apply a harmless error analysis.
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2489.444,2491.186,Clemons said that either one would do.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2491.186,2492.055,Correct.
1991.91-5843,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2492.055,2498.85,"But that one had to be performed, and there was no presumption that the State performed it if it wasn't there on the record."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2498.85,2501.732,"And I would submit to the Court respectively that, in fact, it is on the record."
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.819,2619.841,"Before you go on, you do acknowledge that the harmless error analysis has to be done."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2619.841,2620.842,--Absolutely.
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.727,2648.409,"But you acknowledge that if one of the aggravating factors was inappropriate, the court itself would have had to determine that, beyond a reasonable doubt, there were no mitigating factors that the jury could have considered."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2650.73,2675.597,"That the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sentence is appropriate, that the results would not have changed what our standard is, that taking the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, that the State has come forward and demonstrated that what's left, the results would not change."
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.519,2680.79,Right.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2680.79,2682.863,"Because the... in fact, it doesn't have to be."
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.742,2690.507,"If that's what you mean by harmless error then, then maybe the sentence the court used is adequate."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2697.96,2701.964,"--But again, they're not making a finding."
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.862,2729.272,The same result would have happened.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2729.272,2729.813,Absolutely.
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.813,2733.045,The result in the recommendation from the jury.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2733.045,2733.516,No.
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.741,2775.452,Then I don't understand why you're talking about harmless error analysis.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2782.567,2783.887,--But the Florida Supreme Court has said it doesn't reweigh.
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.284,2812.847,--May I ask another question?
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2827.985,2830.509,Yes.
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2833.23,2837.382,Because the mere fact that they conclude something is not disproportionate really doesn't speak to the question whether error occurred.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2837.382,2844.798,"--No, it does not, but normally, you don't get to proportionality, because there's no purpose in trying to compare this case with another."
1991.91-5843,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.53,2852.793,"Well, you get to proportionality in this case because the last paragraph of the opinion responds to the argument that it was disproportionate."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2852.793,2869.503,"--I submit that then begs the question that in fact not only a harmless error analysis was done, but a proportionality analysis was done, which is mandated by the court's own decision in Brown v. Wainwright, which is the second prong of what I was suggesting to you at a previous occasion... earlier."
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2881.901,2900.013,"Is it fair to say that, in a close case, either a life or death sentence might survive a proportionality analysis, but that either a life or death sentence might be the result of error that was not harmless?"
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2900.013,2907.018,I don't know if I can answer the question because the Florida Supreme Court does not review life sentences.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2911.44,2914.592,"Oh, I see, so the only proportionality analysis... okay, we'll just modify my question then."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2940.629,2941.35,--Absolutely.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2941.35,2941.901,Okay.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2941.901,2946.032,"And there could be a basis upon which, in fact, they reverse xxx sentencing."
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2946.032,2958.141,"My only point is if you can't argue from the fact that they survived... that the sentence survived to proportionality analysis, that they must therefore also have conducted a harmless error analysis."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2958.141,2960.184,"Well, I beg to differ because I don't see--"
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2960.184,2963.784,"Well, I thought you just admitted something which is inconsistent with differing."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2963.784,2973.922,"--Well, the reason I... what I was going to say is I beg to differ because I don't believe that... you're putting the horse before the cart, it seems to me, when you're saying that they're going to do a proportionality review."
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2975.213,2975.924,"Well, they did it in this case."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2975.924,2977.364,--Absolutely.
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2977.364,2978.416,I'm talking about this horse and this cart.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2985.522,2993.226,"Because, I would submit to the Court, that in fact they point to cases that suggest that that's exactly what they do."
1991.91-5843,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2998.218,2998.598,Okay.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,3006.553,3006.784,Yes.
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.784,3007.024,Okay.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,3007.985,3008.496,Yes?
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3008.496,3013.429,I don't understand what you consider harmless error analysis to be.
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,3029.591,3030.97,"No, it's to--"
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3030.97,3032.853,It's to show that what would have come out the same?
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,3032.853,3036.914,"--The sentencer, who is the trial judge, would not have come out with the same result."
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3052.415,3065.572,"But you acknowledged earlier that he cannot impose a death sentence unless... if the jury had recommended life, unless no reasonable jury could have recommended life."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,3065.572,3066.283,"--Well, but that is... that's--"
1991.91-5843,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.283,3071.406,"So part of his determination, it seems to me, is the jury's determination."
1991.91-5843,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,3071.406,3086.816,"--But that's only after he has made a determination that in fact death is a viable sentence, one; and second of all, he in his own mind has determined that the aggravation that has been proven outweighs any... mitigation that has been presented."
1991.91-5843,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3185.612,3187.923,"Thank you, Ms. Snurkowski."
1991.91-5843,2,25128,gary_caldwell,,3190.665,3192.618,"Thank you, sir."
1991.91-5843,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3259.38,3261.851,"I'm sure if there are, Justice Scalia will ask them."
1991.91-5843,2,25128,gary_caldwell,,3262.212,3262.803,Okay.
1991.91-5843,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3265.404,3266.235,"Thank you, Mr. Caldwell."
