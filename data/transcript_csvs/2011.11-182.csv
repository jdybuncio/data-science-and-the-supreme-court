2011.11-182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-182, Arizona v. the United States."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,7.054,10.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.16,119.61,Mr. Clement--
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,119.61,119.877,--Yes.
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.877,136.205,"--could I interrupt, and turning to 2(B), could you tell me what the State's view is -- the Government proposes that it should be read on its face one way, and I think the State is arguing that there's a narrower way to read it."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,152.381,154.416,"That's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,168.926,169.676,Can I -- can I--
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,169.676,170.443,--Sure.
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,170.443,172.045,--just stop you there just one moment?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,221.293,230.398,"Well, it's different in one important respect, Justice Sotomayor, and that's why I don't think that the issue that divides the parties is only the issue of how long you can detain somebody."
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,243.139,244.908,"No, I understand that's their argument."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,246.358,246.524,--Okay.
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,247.374,258.216,"But I want to get to how -- assuming your position, that doing it on a -- there's nothing wrong with doing it as it's been done in the past."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,270.274,282.664,"--And with respect, I don't think section 2(B) really speaks to that, which is to say, I don't think section 2(B) says that the systematic inquiry has to take any longer than the ad hoc inquiry."
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,294.389,302.828,What happens if -- this is the following call -- the call to the -- to the Federal Government.
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,312.534,326.36,"--Well, I don't know that it speaks to it in specific terms, but here's what I believe would happen, which is to say, at that point, then, the officer would ask themselves whether there's any reason to continue to detain the person for State law purposes."
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,330.912,332.18,I'm putting all of this outside of--
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,332.18,339.434,"But -- but if what we're talking about is simply what happens then for purposes of the Federal immigration consequences, the answer is nothing."
2011.11-182,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,388.498,394.135,But how would the State officer know if the person is removable?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,398.77,401.472,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think there's two answers to that."
2011.11-182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.272,435.026,"If it takes two weeks to make that determination, can the alien be held by the State for that whole period of time--"
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,435.026,435.628,"Oh, I don't--"
2011.11-182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.628,437.128,--just under section 6?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,437.128,445.484,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, and I think that, you know, what -- in all of these provisions, you have the Fourth Amendment backing up the limits, and I think so--"
2011.11-182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,445.484,447.35,What -- what would be the standard?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,460.659,462.778,"--Yes, ultimately, it's a reasonable inquiry."
2011.11-182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,480.073,484.692,"How do they have -- well, the same question, but -- but I'm trying to think of examples."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,534.708,536.308,I don't want to represent that--
2011.11-182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,536.308,536.674,All right.
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,542.361,542.711,"--Sure, sure."
2011.11-182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,543.646,543.963,--What?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,543.963,547.281,--is that he's not going to be detained any longer than the Fourth Amendment allows.
2011.11-182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,547.281,547.665,"Oh, fine."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,547.665,548.248,And--
2011.11-182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,548.248,551.067,"But the Fourth Amendment -- for -- I mean, that's another question."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,599.983,603.018,"--I don't think it is, Justice Breyer, and here's why it's not."
2011.11-182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.378,622.063,"Anyway, if this is a problem, is it an immigration law problem?"
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,622.063,622.663,--It--
2011.11-182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.663,624.031,Or is it a Fourth Amendment problem?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,624.031,625.281,"--Justice Scalia, it is neither--"
2011.11-182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.281,627.983,Is the Government's attack on this that it violates the Fourth Amendment?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,627.983,636.922,"--No, of course the Federal Government, that also has a lot of immigration arrests that are subject to the Fourth Amendment, is not making a Fourth Amendment claim here."
2011.11-182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.009,643.776,That's a different argument--
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,643.776,655.317,But I do want to -- but I do want to be responsive and make the point that I think the factual premise that this is going to -- 2(B) is going to lead to the elongation of a lot of arrests is not true.
2011.11-182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.317,655.501,--All right.
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,687.788,689.74,I think what you could say--
2011.11-182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.74,691.09,Can I say that?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,691.09,692.942,--I don't think you can say just that.
2011.11-182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.942,693.275,No.
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,693.275,694.692,"I think you can say something similar, though."
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,786.585,790.004,--I want to make sure that I get a clear representation from you.
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,812.935,813.369,--Exactly.
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,839.336,839.786,All right.
2011.11-182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.252,852.512,"You'll concede that the -- that the State has to accept within its borders all people who have no right to be there, that the Federal Government has no interest in removing?"
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,852.512,856.798,"--No, I don't accept that, Justice Scalia, but--"
2011.11-182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.798,862.416,"That's all the statute -- and you call up the Federal Government, and te Federal -- yes, he's an illegal immigrant, but that's okay with us."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,862.416,863.118,--Well--
2011.11-182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.118,869.539,And the State has no power to close its borders to people who have no right to be there?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,869.539,877.11,"--Well, Justice Scalia, here's my response, which is all of this discussion, at least as I've understood it, has been about 2(B) and to a lesser extent 6."
2011.11-182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,895.506,895.839,--I think--
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,895.839,896.839,--but not with respect to the Federal--
2011.11-182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.839,900.808,"--I think Justice Scalia's question was the -- was the broader one, just as a theoretical matter."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,911.449,913.968,"--Well, and I think--"
2011.11-182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,913.968,915.837,And that is by reason of his alien--
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,915.837,919.204,--And I think my answer to that is no.
2011.11-182,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,931.096,940.452,"Well, before you move on to the registration requirement, could I take you back to an example that's similar to the one that Justice Breyer was referring to."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,971.804,975.958,"Well, if I can just kind of work back for a second."
2011.11-182,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,984.397,992.151,Why would it dispel reasonable suspicion if it's -- if the officer knows it's a state that issues driver's licenses to aliens who are not lawfully--
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,992.151,998.372,"--And that might be a situation where that's the case, and then -- then it wouldn't dispel the reasonable suspicion."
2011.11-182,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1046.637,1080.191,"--That may be the case, and I would like to ask General Verrilli about that; but, under the Fourth Amendment, presumably, if the officer can arrest, the state officer can arrest a person simply on the ground that the person is removable, which is what the Office of Legal Counsel opined some years ago, then presumably the officer could continue to detain that individual that I mentioned until they reached a point where the Terry stop becomes an arrest, at which time they would have to have probable cause."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1091.666,1093.618,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor."
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1169.766,1180.74,"--Counsel, could -- does section 6 permit an officer to arrest an individual who has overstayed a visitor's visa by a day?"
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1183.259,1184.559,They are removable.
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1199.035,1201.82,What is the definition of public offense?
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1201.82,1206.707,"--A public offense definition -- it's actually -- it's a petition appendix -- well, I'm sorry."
2011.11-182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1234.024,1241.214,"Counsel, maybe it's a good time to talk about some of the other sections, in particular section 5(C)."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1264.128,1266.913,"Well, it's certainly imposing different sanctions."
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1315.678,1316.295,Counsel--
2011.11-182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1316.295,1345.032,"--Would you agree that -- would you accept as a working hypothesis that we can begin with the general principle that the Hines v. Davidowitz language controls here, and we're going to ask our principal -- our primary function is to determine whether, under the circumstances of this particular case, Arizona's law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress?"
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1348.584,1350.436,I think it's an acceptable test.
2011.11-182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1364.726,1379.586,"But then the government on this section is going to come and say, well, there may be -- this must be -- this -- the enforcement of this statute, as Arizona describes it, will be in considerable tension with our -- with our basic approach; isn't that what I'm going to hear from the government?"
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1379.586,1384.74,"--It may be what you're going to hear, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think you just take the Federal government for its word on these things."
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1418.561,1433.238,"--Well, for those of us for whom legislative history has some importance, there seems to be quite a bit of legislative history that the -- that the idea of punishing employees was raised, discussed and explicitly rejected."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1433.238,1434.488,--Sure.
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1434.488,1441.492,The preemption language would be geared to what was decided to be punished.
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1453.633,1466.292,"But, Justice Sotomayor, there's a big difference between Congress deciding not as a matter of Federal law to address employees with an additional criminal prohibition, and saying that that decision itself has preemptive effect."
2011.11-182,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1526.514,1535.104,"They did provide -- I mean, your position was the Federal legislation regulates the supply side."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1571.46,1574.931,"--Two quick responses, and then I'd like to save time for rebuttal, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.11-182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1604.7,1611.52,"We'll give you plenty of rebuttal time, but I'd like to hear what you have to say about section 3 before you sit down."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1611.52,1612.687,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1637.921,1650.229,"Would double prosecutions be -- suppose that an alien were prosecuted under Federal law for violating basically the terms of 3, could the States then prosecute him as well?"
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1650.229,1655.549,--I think they could under general double jeopardy principles and the dual sovereignty doctrine.
2011.11-182,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1686.568,1710.033,"Mr. Clement, it seems that the -- I would think the largest hurdle for you is Hines which said, the registration scheme -- Congress enacted a complete registration scheme which the States cannot complement or impose even auxiliary regulations."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1728.561,1735.251,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that's part of the reason why I accepted Justice Kennedy's characterization of the relevant language in Hines."
2011.11-182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1801.193,1801.926,Can I ask you something?
2011.11-182,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1801.926,1802.159,"Well, in that--"
2011.11-182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1802.159,1804.145,Justice Alito.
2011.11-182,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1804.145,1817.803,"--In that regard, we are told that there are some important categories of aliens who can't obtain registration, cannot obtain Federal registration, and yet they are people that nobody would think should be removed."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1824.808,1827.426,I think it probably wouldn't apply.
2011.11-182,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1866.718,1869.753,"Well, of course, if you've entered the country illegally, you can't get a registration."
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1869.753,1871.372,"--Well, sure."
2011.11-182,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1871.372,1871.839,But--
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1871.839,1875.007,But that's not the narrow class we were talking about.
2011.11-182,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1875.007,1875.641,--I understand that.
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1882.328,1886.715,"Well, if you're in -- no, if you're in the country lawfully, I mean, you can try to register."
2011.11-182,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1894.453,1894.821,Right.
2011.11-182,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1894.821,1900.825,"But at the point that they stay 30 days and don't try to register, then that's an independent violation."
2011.11-182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1917.834,1919.953,"Thank you,--"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1922.472,1928.209,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1928.209,1933.613,"Before you get into what the case is about, I'd like to clear up at the outset what it's not about."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1940.1,1940.85,--That's correct.
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1940.85,1941.183,Okay.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1944.052,1947.337,We're not making any allegation about racial or ethnic profiling in the case.
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1978.456,1983.427,"General, could you answer Justice Scalia's earlier question to your adversary?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1997.687,1999.453,"--That is our position, Your Honor."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.208,2013.379,"All that means, it gives authority over naturalization, which we've expanded to immigration."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2034.776,2049.202,"Your Honor, the Framers vested in the national government the authority over immigration because they understood that the way this nation treats citizens of other countries is a vital aspect of our foreign relations."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2051.737,2053.606,But it's still up to the national government.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2095.183,2102.937,"--But they cannot do what Arizona is seeking to do here, Your Honor, which is to elevate one consideration above all others."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2120.918,2125.369,"Well, if that state does -- well, that's a question of enforcement priorities."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2147.282,2174.35,"I think the mandatory character of the Arizona law and the mandatory character of the obligations it imposes, especially as backed by this extraordinary provision in section 2(H), which imposes civil penalties of up to $5000 a day on any official in the State of Arizona who is not following section 2 or, as we read it, the rest of S.B. 1070, to the maximum extent possible, does create a conflict."
2011.11-182,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2192.644,2194.179,"Well, I have the same question as the Chief Justice."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2217.795,2219.914,"No, I think it's still a problem, Your Honor."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.436,2236.173,Do you have any example where -- where enforcement discretion has the effect of preempting state action?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2236.173,2239.292,"--Well, I think we should think about section 3 of the law, Your Honor."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.594,2260.039,"I'll point out another case of ours where we've said that essentially the preemption of state law can occur, not by virtue of the Congress preempting, but because the Executive doesn't want this law enforced so -- so rigorously, and that preempts the state from enforcing it vigorously."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2261.158,2284.154,"--I think the preemption here -- focusing for a moment on section 3 -- the preemption here flows from judgments of Congress, from the registration system that Congress set up in sections 1301 through 1306, from the decision of Congress in section 1103 in the law to vest the Secretary of DHS and the Attorney General with the authority to make the judgments about how this law is going to be enforced--"
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2284.154,2286.273,"--Well, they do that with all Federal criminal statutes."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2293.712,2300.966,--They can make -- they can engage in detention in support of the enforcement of Federal law.
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2313.673,2323.814,"Well, but you say that the Federal Government has to have control over who to prosecute, but I don't see how Section 2(B) says anything about that at all."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2337.991,2346.847,"--That's correct, but with respect to -- and let me address something fundamental about section 2."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2369.443,2369.643,Right.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2375.264,2381.568,"We do, Your Honor; but, before I take 3 and 5 off the table, if I could make one more point about 3 and 5, please."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2406.902,2407.235,Exactly.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2427.215,2434.701,"--Here's the other half -- here's the other half of the equation, Mr. Chief Justice, which is that they say if you're not going to remove them, we are going to prosecute them."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.772,2442.741,Only under section 3 and section 5.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2442.741,2451.93,"--Yes, but those are -- but what you're talking about is taking somebody whose only offense is being unlawfully present in the country and putting them in jail for up to 6 months, or somebody who--"
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2451.93,2453.497,"Well, let's say you're worried about--"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2453.497,2454.965,"--or like 30 days, forgive me; 6 months for employment."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2454.965,2455.265,--There you go.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2489.086,2492.721,"Well, we're not saying the state can't ask it in any individual case."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2494.573,2501.41,You think there are individual cases in which the state can call the Federal Government and say: Is this person here illegally?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2501.41,2504.029,"--Yes, certainly, but that doesn't make--"
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2504.029,2504.379,Okay.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2506.464,2507.014,--No.
2011.11-182,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2529.144,2536.567,"Well, suppose that every -- suppose every law enforcement officer in Arizona saw things exactly the same way as the Arizona legislature."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2547.958,2560.015,"--No, it wouldn't be, Your Honor, because in that situation they would be free to be responsive to Federal priorities, if the Federal officials came back to them and said, look, we need to focus on gangs, we need to focus on this drug problem at the border--"
2011.11-182,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2560.015,2569.888,"But what if they said, well, we don't care at your priorities are; we have our priorities, and our priority is maximum enforcement, and we're going to call you in every case?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2574.942,2575.675,"--Yes, well--"
2011.11-182,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2575.675,2576.644,--that would be okay?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2576.644,2584.214,"--Well, if there's a -- if there's a state policy locked into law by statute, locked into law by regulation, then we have a problem."
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2584.731,2585.181,General--
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2585.181,2586.666,"--I mean, the line is mandatory versus discretionary--"
2011.11-182,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2586.666,2611.465,"That's what I can't understand because your argument -- you seem to be saying that what's wrong with the Arizona law is that the Arizona legislature is trying to control what its employees are doing, and they have to be free to disregard the desires of the Arizona legislature, for whom they work, and follow the priorities of the Federal Government, for whom they don't work."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2611.465,2622.856,"--But they -- but with respect to immigration enforcement, and to the extent all they're doing is bringing people to the Federal Government's attention, they are cooperating in the enforcement of Federal law--"
2011.11-182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2622.856,2625.875,But the hypothetical is that that's all the legislature is doing.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2625.875,2641.384,"--Well, except I think, Justice Kennedy, the problem is that it's not cooperation if in every instance the officers in the state must respond to the priorities set by the state government and are not free to respond to the priorities of the Federal officials who are trying to enforce the law in the most effective manner possible."
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2641.384,2641.669,--I'm sorry.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2700.573,2701.006,Well--
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2701.006,2713.03,"Taking out the other provisions, taking out any independent state-created basis of liability for being an illegal alien?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2713.03,2715.148,--I think there are three.
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.268,2748.953,Sounds like racial profiling to me.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2748.953,2754.04,--And they're -- and given that what we're talking about is the status of being unlawfully present--
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2754.04,2763.046,Do you have the statistics as to how many arrests there are and how many -- and what the -- percentage of calls before the statute?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2763.046,2764.496,"--There is some evidence in the record, Your Honor."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.441,2783.227,What does this have to do with Federal immigration law?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2790.046,2790.68,--The--
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2790.68,2797.2,Are you objecting to harassing the -- the people who have no business being here?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2815.931,2819.133,"--And other -- and other people lawfully present in the country, certainly, but this is--"
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.133,2821.585,But that has nothing to do with the immigration law--
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2821.585,2822.268,--Hines is--
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2822.268,2825.554,--which is what you're asserting preempts all of this activity.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2825.554,2838.527,--Hines identified this problem as harassment as -- as a central feature of preemption under the immigration laws because of the concern that the way this nation treats citizens of other countries is fundamental to our foreign relations.
2011.11-182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.046,2851.037,"Well, let's -- let me just go back, because I think -- I'm trying to get focused the question I think others are asking, and one way to focus it is the same question I asked Mr. Clement."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2910.225,2910.758,--Yes.
2011.11-182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2912.042,2912.392,"And if so, what?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2912.392,2920.498,"--it would ameliorate the practical problem; but, there is still a structural problem here in that this is an effort to enforce Federal law."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2927.318,2929.204,It is--
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2929.204,2929.587,--and--
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2929.587,2931.306,--It is not an effort to enforce Federal law.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2945.13,2946.332,"--It is, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2946.332,2951.219,"--LESC, look, when somebody from Arizona calls, answer their question, and don't even bother to write it down."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2965.793,2967.429,That's correct.
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2989.309,2993.129,"Under 2(B), the person is already stopped for some other reason."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3014.226,3016.512,"--No, I -- I don't think that's right."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.293,3045.579,"Anyway, what -- what's wrong about the states enforcing Federal law?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3054.351,3056.103,"I think it could, but I think that's quite--"
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.103,3062.541,"But does the Attorney General come in and say, you know, we might really only want to go after the professional bank robbers?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3072.414,3073.748,"--Well, of course, no one would--"
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3073.748,3075.45,"Now, would anybody listen to that argument?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3075.45,3076.166,--Of course not.
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.166,3076.383,Of course not.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3076.383,3094.828,"But this argument is quite different, Justice Scalia, because here what we are talking about is that Federal registration requirement in an area of dominant Federal concern, exclusive Federal concern with respect to immigration, who can be in the country, under what circumstances, and what obligations they have--"
2011.11-182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3094.828,3095.778,"Now, are you talking about now or--"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3095.778,3096.147,--Yes.
2011.11-182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3096.147,3097.43,--or does this argument relate to 2 as well?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3097.43,3099.749,This is an argument about section 3.
2011.11-182,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3099.749,3102.768,"Well, could I ask you this about 2, before you move on to that?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3139.274,3141.909,"Well, in any individual case, that's correct."
2011.11-182,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3155.235,3170.078,"Well, what if they just, they stop somebody for a traffic violation, but they want to know whether this is a person who previously was removed and has come back or somebody who has just -- just within the last few hours possibly come -- well, let's just -- somebody who's previously been removed?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3172.462,3186.62,"--Well, I think -- I think it's correct that you can't, but there is a -- there is difference, Justice Alito, I think, between the question of any individual circumstance and a mandatory policy backed by this civil fine, that you've got to make the inquiry in every case."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3201.862,3204.047,What if they just rolled in Whiting?
2011.11-182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3207.549,3221.376,"Look, in the Federal statute, it says in 1373 that nobody can prohibit or restrict any government entity from making this inquiry of the Federal Government."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3261.584,3262.367,--So--
2011.11-182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3262.367,3264.953,What's the -- that's -- that's where I'm trying to push you.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3264.953,3265.386,--Yes.
2011.11-182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3265.386,3267.488,Because in my mind I'm not clear what your answer is to that.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3267.488,3267.788,I understand the question.
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3341.119,3343.404,Can I get to a different question?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3378.911,3382.779,"So let me just summarize what I think the three are, and then maybe I can move on to sections 3 and 5."
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3391.635,3392.019,Please move--
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3392.019,3400.991,"--With respect to -- in addition, we do think that there is a structural accountability problem in that they are enforcing Federal law but not answerable to the Federal officials."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3417.736,3423.44,"General, you have been trying valiantly to get us to focus on section 3, so maybe we should let you do that now."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3423.44,3424.923,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3523.52,3525.905,"Well, maybe 1306(a) ought to be amended, then."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3535.443,3543.599,"But it's a situation in which no reasonable person would think that the individual ought to be prosecuted; and, yet, very often, the states aren't even going to know."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3561.311,3571.516,"Again, I ask you, do you have any other case in which the basis for preemption has been you are interfering with the Attorney General's enforcement discretion?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3571.516,3572.682,"Well, this is--"
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3572.682,3576.051,I think that's an extraordinary basis for saying that the state is preempted.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3576.051,3587.442,"--I think what is extraordinary about this, actually, Justice Scalia, is the state's decision to enact a statute purporting to criminalize the violation of a Federal registration obligation."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3590.661,3593.18,It's not criminalizing anything that isn't criminal under Federal law.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3593.18,3593.813,--But -- but what--
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3593.813,3594.813,It's the bank.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3596.298,3597.115,"--Well, no."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3597.115,3600.167,--a state law which criminalizes the same thing that the Federal law does.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3600.167,3601.119,I think it's quite different.
2011.11-182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3647.748,3654.67,"Suppose -- suppose -- well, assume these are two hypothetical -- two hypothetical instances."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3666.811,3669.346,"You said that in your brief, didn't you?"
2011.11-182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3669.346,3685.106,"Also hypothetical is that the State of Arizona has -- has a massive emergency with social disruption, economic disruption, residents leaving the State because of flood of immigrants."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3696.08,3699.115,"Of course, they have legitimate concerns in that situation."
2011.11-182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3700.065,3706.536,"And can they go to their legislature and say, we're concerned about this, and ask the legislature to enact laws to correct this problem?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3706.536,3710.257,--They -- they certainly can enact laws of general application.
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3731.637,3732.637,"No, keep going."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3732.637,3742.728,"--They can -- they can engage in cooperative efforts with the Federal government, of which there are many going on in Arizona and around the country, in order to address these problems."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3742.728,3753.584,"General, didn't you say in your brief -- I forget where it was -- I thought you said that the Justice Department doesn't get nearly enough money to enforce our immigration laws?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3754.334,3755.986,"Of course, we have to set priorities."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3756.902,3757.319,Exactly.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3779.584,3787.34,"--Well, what I think they are going to do in Arizona is something quite extraordinary, that has significant real and practical foreign relations effects."
2011.11-182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3832.802,3835.238,So you're saying the government has a legitimate interest in not enforcing its laws?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3835.238,3836.188,No.
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3861.138,3869.309,"--General, when -- when -- I know your brief, you had -- you said that there are some illegal aliens who have a right to remain here."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3880.517,3881.985,"--I assume so, yes."
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3881.985,3884.269,You don't really have knowledge of what--
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3884.269,3889.223,"Well, they -- I mean, it can come in lots of different ways, but generally they will get a name and some other identifying information."
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3889.223,3889.689,--All right.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3894.943,3895.477,Yes.
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3914.106,3918.825,"Well, how does that database tell you that someone is illegal as opposed to a citizen?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3938.221,3940.105,The citizen problem is actually a significant problem.
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3942.14,3943.24,"I'm sorry, there is or there isn't?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3943.24,3943.542,--There is not.
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3967.99,3981.298,"So if you run out of your house without your driver's license or identification and you walk into a park that's closed and you're arrested, you -- they make the call to this agency."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3982.75,3984.2,"--Yes, and I--"
2011.11-182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3984.2,3985.119,--Figure out if you're--
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3985.119,3989.337,"--While I'm at it, there is a factual point I think I'd like to correct."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4002.812,4007.865,I had a little -- wasn't sure about your answer to Justice Kennedy.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4043.955,4046.323,"Well, it's a little more complicated than that."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4119.937,4125.074,"Well, can't you avoid that particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting these people?"
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4127.859,4128.409,I really think--
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4128.409,4131.06,--And send them back to the countries that are -- that are objecting.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4131.06,4131.56,--This is a--
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4131.56,4132.262,What's the problem with that?
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4132.262,4133.912,"--Well, a couple of things."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4197.889,4203.109,So we have to -- we have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please Mexico.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4204.109,4206.145,"--No, Your Honor, but what it does -- no, Your Honor, I'm not saying that--"
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4206.145,4207.161,Sounded like what you were saying.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4207.161,4213.481,"--No, but what I am saying is that this points up why the Framers made this power an exclusive national power."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4224.189,4235.33,"And your concern is the problems that would arise in bilateral relations if you remove all of these people, or a significant percentage or a greater percentage than you are now."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4254.475,4265.266,"Right, but the problem I'm focused on -- we're focused on, Mr. Chief Justice, is not our removal decisions, but Arizona's decision to incarcerate, and the foreign relations problem that that raises."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4268.318,4270.068,And that arises under 3 and 5.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4270.068,4270.587,Correct.
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4270.587,4271.47,But not 2.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4271.47,4276.741,"Well, 2 identifies the population that's going to be prosecuted under 3 and 5."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4286.68,4287.23,Section 5.
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4287.23,4298.351,"The -- I do think the fundamental point about section 5 here is that in 1986, Congress fundamentally changed the landscape."
2011.11-182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4362.111,4364.646,So field preemption; is that your argument with respect to--
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4364.646,4365.463,--It's both.
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4495.031,4495.981,"Thank you, General."
2011.11-182,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4495.981,4496.715,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4496.715,4498.366,"Mr. Clement, 5 minutes."
2011.11-182,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4498.366,4502.101,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4641.877,4646.596,You're inviting -- you're inviting the very sort of conflict that he's talking about.
2011.11-182,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4680.169,4680.919,Well--
2011.11-182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4680.919,4684.788,"Now, you may say we're not, because all we're going to show is -- what?"
2011.11-182,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4690.025,4697.548,"--No, we're going to say that we communicated with the Federal immigration officials and they told us this is somebody who's perfectly fine and doesn't have to register."
2011.11-182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4697.548,4699.831,No -- no Confrontation -- no Confrontation Clause problem with that?
2011.11-182,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4711.105,4717.359,"My supposition, Justice Sotomayor, is that they would use that call to not bring the prosecution, so the issue wouldn't even arise."
2011.11-182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4719.044,4719.511,"No, no, no."
2011.11-182,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4724.096,4727.067,--And they bring a prosecution under section 3--
2011.11-182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4727.067,4733.471,So how -- where do they get the records that show that this person is an illegal alien that's not authorized to be here?
2011.11-182,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4733.471,4734.071,--I--
2011.11-182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4734.071,4734.904,Who do they get it from?
2011.11-182,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4734.904,4736.923,--I think they would get it from the Federal authorities.
2011.11-182,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4802.948,4803.581,Finish your sentence.
2011.11-182,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,4803.581,4810.387,"--before 1986, the Government was not agnostic about unlawful employment by aliens."
2011.11-182,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4821.778,4823.744,"Thank you, Mr. Clement, General Verrilli."
