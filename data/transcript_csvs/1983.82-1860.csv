1983.82-1860,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.387,We will hear arguments next in Schneider against Robbins and Prosser against Robbins.
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,50.325,61.398,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the cases before the Court today, which are consolidated, arise out of a collective bargaining relationship."
1983.82-1860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,152.909,169.886,"What if the collective bargaining agreement says there will be a trust agreement, and uses certain words in describing the coverage, and then there is a trust agreement, and it uses the same words about coverage?"
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,169.886,173.869,"--If there is no question regarding the coverage, then I think that the--"
1983.82-1860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,173.869,175.82,"Well, there is a question about what the words mean."
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,175.82,179.742,"--Oh, if there is a question about what the words mean in the collective bargaining agreement--"
1983.82-1860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,179.742,182.85,"Well, and the same words are in the trust agreement."
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,182.85,193.424,"--With respect to the collective bargaining agreement, if the employer and the union have reserved to themselves the right to resolve the coverage question under the contract, I believe that is resolving of the contract."
1983.82-1860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,200.234,207.854,"Well, what is the case in this... what is the situation in this case?"
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,207.854,216.929,"In this situation, the collective bargaining agreements provided that the employers would make contributions on behalf of the regular employees--"
1983.82-1860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,216.929,217.273,Right.
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,217.273,222.005,"--and not on behalf of extras, casuals, part-times, seasonal, and temporary."
1983.82-1860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,222.005,223.084,Yes.
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,223.084,240.06,"The trust agreements, on the other hand, conditioned eligibility for benefits on employees for whom contributions were required under the collective bargaining agreement, so it goes back to what the collective bargaining agreement expressly provides."
1983.82-1860,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,240.06,247.557,But it is just as though the trust agreement had used the very same language as the collective bargaining agreement.
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,247.557,247.932,Correct.
1983.82-1860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.491,269.783,"Mr. Yates, in this particular case involving the Schneider company, as I understand it, the union was decertified--"
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,269.783,270.486,That's correct.
1983.82-1860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.486,273.501,--at the time the District Court dismissed.
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,281.621,291.368,"At the point in time when this case arose, which was 1978 and '79, the union was around."
1983.82-1860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,311.593,314.763,May I ask you another question?
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,360.777,368.024,"I believe they do, provided they do it openly and not in a sinister fashion, and I would like to take it back to these--"
1983.82-1860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,368.024,368.883,Is there any authority for that?
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,369.962,370.46,--Okay.
1983.82-1860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.77,421.628,"Well, they obviously have the right to enter into the collective bargaining agreement in the first instance."
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,421.628,421.846,--Yes.
1983.82-1860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.846,438.886,"But really the question is then, is that fixed, so to speak, because of the interplay with ERISA, and so the union can't tinker around with it after that, or waive some portion of the claim, or something like that."
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,550.061,552.061,"I agree with that, yes."
1983.82-1860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.061,562.79,"And if they decided there was vesting there, they then would... you still say they would not have the right to say, well, therefore there must be contributions made on behalf of... on account of that employee."
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,562.79,588.529,"I believe that once again there is a distinction between the funding obligation and the determination of employee benefits, and I believe it is within the discretion of the trustees to say that they will continue to provide benefits for an employee even if the union and the employer agree that contributions will not be made for that employee, just as in Kaiser the measure of the funding obligation was the number of tons of non-union coal produced."
1983.82-1860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.575,604.741,"So you could end up with a situation in which the union and the company would agree that we don't have to make contributions on behalf of Employees A, B, and C, but yet the trustees might be convinced they had a duty to pay pensions to those employees."
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,604.741,605.585,That's correct.
1983.82-1860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.498,631.497,May I ask just one other question?
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,636.057,643.851,"Under this contract, the contract did not expressly provide that the company has the right to submit grievances to arbitration."
1983.82-1860,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.115,649.114,"The procedures I read, it has to be initiated by the employee, and then go through the--"
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,649.114,649.474,That's correct.
1983.82-1860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,691.598,697.157,"--Well, would they have to go to the union to get the arbitration going, I assume?"
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,697.157,697.657,--Yes.
1983.82-1860,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,698.563,700.688,And what if the union won't do it?
1983.82-1860,0,21734,david_f_yates,,700.688,706.608,"I believe that the union has an affirmative duty to review why, and that goes to the heart of the entire issue here."
1983.82-1860,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,729.567,743.857,Mr. Bobinette.
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,743.857,762.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the rule of the Eighth Circuit has adopted a position of a presumption against arbitration, and allows the trustees to independently sue the employer and litigation the meaning and the intent of the collective bargaining agreement."
1983.82-1860,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,827.558,851.112,"Mr. Bobinette, in these particular cases, it appeared that both the collective bargaining agreement and the trust indenture referred to a right of the trustees to file suit for purposes of enforcing the collection proceedings and so forth."
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,864.793,869.884,"Well, it comes down to a question of determining what the intents of the parties are."
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.56,978.013,Could I ask you--
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,978.013,978.388,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.388,980.012,--Perhaps I misunderstood you.
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,987.509,988.258,Yes.
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.258,992.179,Do you think that finishes the issue?
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,999.207,1001.034,It is very well possible.
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.607,1016.232,"What do you mean, you never got to it?"
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1016.748,1018.465,"--No, no, the District Court never ruled on that."
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.117,1029.976,Then you lost in the Court of Appeals?
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1029.976,1032.255,"--Well, that issue was... yes, we did--"
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.255,1035.254,So what if it goes back now?
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1037.176,1038.925,"--Well, if--"
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1038.925,1040.253,Can you bring the union in?
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1040.253,1051.702,"--It would be our position that they are a necessary party to this action, and that would certainly begin to take care of some of these possibilities of inconsistencies and multiplicity of forums."
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.702,1053.029,So that is down the line.
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1061.791,1062.541,Yes.
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1062.541,1064.681,And doing what?
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1066.57,1069.663,"Well, waiting for the decision first, but ultimately, right."
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.663,1073.458,"Excactly, yes, but if you lose here, you are back in District Court litigating with the trustees."
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1073.458,1074.239,Yes.
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.239,1077.613,"And then the question is, can you bring in the union."
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1077.613,1080.111,That will be the next question.
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.819,1127.14,"I know, but you think... what do you think would happen if the union sits back, they aren't made a party to this suit, you lose here, go back to the District Court, and suppose that you win in the District Court and the trustees lose?"
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1127.14,1127.843,Yes.
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.843,1134.747,"Now, then the union wants to arbitrate, and it says, we don't agree with the District Court."
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1137.574,1146.21,"Under the Court's decision in W.R. Grace versus Local 759, I would think that--"
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.21,1147.443,What is the arbitrator supposed to do?
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1147.443,1151.848,"--The arbitrator will take evidence, and listen to it, and attempt to--"
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.848,1162.813,"And say, I am construing the collective bargaining agreement according to the intent of the parties, and if the federal court decided otherwise, it was just wrong."
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1164.36,1174.48,"--Well, just as the federal court judge has no right to substitute his judgment for that of the arbitrator, I think that we just get into the flip-flop of that."
1983.82-1860,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.365,1188.708,"--Well, they both can't be right, can they?"
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1188.708,1192.487,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1860,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.969,1242.093,"Well, but that would be an argument for making the union a necessary party, I suppose."
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1242.093,1243.545,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1860,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1261.803,1274.08,"But when the union and the employer have written up these agreements, and there's a trust indenture and it expressly says the trustees can sue, I think it makes your argument much tougher."
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1280.015,1295.367,--The question of whether or not they could have specifically provided for the trustees being able to arbitrate I think is a question.
1983.82-1860,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1295.367,1301.708,"Well, but maybe that is not necessary to answer here, because--"
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1301.708,1302.458,I'm sorry?
1983.82-1860,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1302.458,1310.642,"--Maybe we don't have to answer that in this case, because the agreements don't provide for it here."
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1310.642,1311.267,Correct.
1983.82-1860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.776,1331.853,"Mr. Bobinette, can I just ask you one question?"
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1331.853,1332.165,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1332.165,1343.113,Is there anything in the law that would prevent the companies and the union in future collective bargaining agreements from spelling out what procedure they think would be appropriate in this kind of situation?
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1343.113,1345.503,I know of none.
1983.82-1860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.665,1382.426,You do not think the trustees could be given the right to seek arbitration of a dispute of this kind?
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1382.426,1396.842,"--I think there are some serious questions as to whether or not involvement in the settlement of these types of disputes is alien to their fiduciary duties, and the way in which they conduct themselves."
1983.82-1860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.842,1398.232,I thought you were arguing that they should have asked for arbitration.
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1398.232,1398.654,Pardon me?
1983.82-1860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1398.654,1402.2,I thought you were arguing in this case that they should have sought arbitration.
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1402.2,1408.775,"They should have asked the company to arbitrate the issue, and that the company would trigger the... excuse me."
1983.82-1860,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.025,1410.4,The union.
1983.82-1860,1,18481,charles_w_bobinette,,1410.4,1419.818,"--the union to arbitrate, and the union would go in and arbitrate those particular issues if they felt as though the interpretation of the trustees was meritorious."
1983.82-1860,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1599.448,1608.007,Mr. Luplow.
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,1608.007,1620.769,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the respondent's Central States Pension Fund is the largest Taft-Hartley multiemployer fund in the United States."
1983.82-1860,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1787.576,1808.287,"Well, it sounds to me as though you would say that this collective bargaining agreement could not have expressly agreed or that the dispute in this case would be submitted to arbitration."
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,1832.167,1838.275,"That, Your Honor... I am not going to dodge your question."
1983.82-1860,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.632,1843.195,Yes?
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,1843.195,1845.257,But it is not an open question.
1983.82-1860,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.281,1862.562,"Your argument, the way you were putting it, sounded as though you agreed with the Third Circuit."
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,1862.562,1865.78,"Yes, I do."
1983.82-1860,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.78,1866.481,Yes.
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,1883.849,1885.365,"Yes, I would--"
1983.82-1860,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1885.365,1887.989,Would that violate any federal statute in your opinion?
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,1887.989,1936.938,"--No, because it is something that the trustees under 404, which we believe is the heart of ERISA, the prudent man rule, is something that the trustees would be empowered to do, because in the final analysis, as we perceive the statute, we are being held accountable, that the legislative history supports the fact that Congress wanted the buck to stop somewhere, and not to have it passing back between unions, employers, and so on, and that we think that the statute therefore enacting 404 gave us some broad discretion within the confines of the common law fiduciary duties, which ERISA codified."
1983.82-1860,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1936.938,1937.249,Mr. Luplow--
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,1937.249,1937.577,Yes?
1983.82-1860,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1937.577,1947.543,--could the trustees on their own decide that they want to delegate their responsibility for determining these questions to the union?
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,1947.543,1969.363,"My answer to that, Your Honor, is that we cannot delegate away core fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA, that ERISA has a specific provision that the fiduciary duties, the ultimate accountability, if you will, cannot be delegated to anyone else."
1983.82-1860,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1977.343,1978.561,All right.
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,2011.798,2013.235,Yes.
1983.82-1860,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2013.235,2014.875,You think you can do that?
1983.82-1860,2,39732,russell_n_luplow,,2014.875,2028.259,We think that if the result of the arbitration is such that it... as prudent men we think that the procedure or the process itself is infirm--
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3310.881,3311.522,"Yes, I do."
1983.82-1860,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3385.524,3388.132,I don't think that's a fair statement of their position.
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3396.55,3400.939,--By taking an adversary position as to how the contract should be construed--
1983.82-1860,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.939,3413.465,"They can take the position that this particular employee is in fact covered even though the union has said otherwise, but that is based on how they read the agreement, not a right to amend the agreement, isn't it?"
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3413.465,3415.543,"--Well, yes, that's correct."
1983.82-1860,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.804,3470.693,How do you know in this case that the union disagrees with the position taken by the trustees?
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3470.693,3471.568,--We don't.
1983.82-1860,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3473.581,3481.313,"Well, then you shouldn't say that the trustees are attempting to take a position contrary to the understanding of both parties."
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3492.184,3493.245,--That is correct.
1983.82-1860,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3493.245,3499.868,So you are going to really find out just in a different forum what your client and the union meant.
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3499.868,3505.303,"Our position is, the union has never raised the issue, and that, we think, is important."
1983.82-1860,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3505.303,3506.35,I understand that.
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3506.35,3516.924,"With respect to the inconsistent results, I think there is a legitimate concern of the trustees that there not be inconsistent results."
1983.82-1860,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3549.52,3556.25,"Mr. Yates, is there anything to prevent you from calling up the union and saying, do you agree with the trustees' reading of this contract?"
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3556.25,3556.625,Nothing at all.
1983.82-1860,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3556.625,3561.03,"And if you did that, you told the judge you both agreed, that might be a pretty good defense."
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3561.03,3565.138,The respondents have just stated that if they disagree with that interpretation--
1983.82-1860,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3565.138,3565.419,I understand.
1983.82-1860,3,21734,david_f_yates,,3568.543,3568.981,--Absolutely.
1983.82-1860,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3570.604,3573.244,We will resume at 1:00 o'clock.
