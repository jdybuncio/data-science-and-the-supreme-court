1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.774,"We'll hear arguments next in consolidated cases 72-694, 753, 791, and 929."
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,61.623,65.303,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,560.109,561.747,You are speaking now of part one aspect?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,561.747,565.078,"Part one, part one."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,859.147,861.039,To poor people as to indigents.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,861.039,864.992,"Indigents, the indigents."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1373.021,1395.389,"Those cases at least -- the ones I am familiar with, that is the Ohio case and the Pennsylvania case to be argued following this group of cases, those have provided various assistance across the board to parents whose children to go to the nonpublic schools, this one is directed to impoverish families, isn't it right?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1395.389,1396.534,May I just address myself to that.
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1396.534,1397.696,Am I wrong about that?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1397.696,1416.562,"Well I think you are right -- technically you are right and to some extent this is what the state of New York contends, as distinguishes them, but actually it's only technically right because Chapter 414 is a single package."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1425.325,1425.751,Right.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1425.751,1433.101,"It takes care of children, or parents of children with incomes over $5,000.00 through a tax credit."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1434.218,1435.861,Well that's part three.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1435.974,1436.649,That's part --
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1436.649,1437.884,You are talking now about part two?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1437.884,1443.592,"Yes, but as I say this is one single fact and --"
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1443.592,1448.131,"Well that's another question in this case whether or not it's severable, which you haven't come to that yet either."
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1450.111,1461.273,"Yes, part two if it were -- if it could be severed from the rest is applied to parents of children with incomes not more than $5,000."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1461.273,1464.704,"And in that respect, this case is different from the other three that you cited to us, is it not?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1464.704,1469.355,That case is -- this case is different from the -- it is not however constitutionally distinguishable.
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1469.355,1470.327,"Well, that is the question."
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1470.327,1472.288,"Well, I -- in my position."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1532.903,1536.498,"How about the categorical assistance programs, Mr. Pfeffer?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1563.305,1575.167,The AFDC payments or payments for poor children and the families which are used by those families for their --
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1575.167,1582.338,"Well I know, I basically know what the program is, I asked you whether it is made for children who go to parochial schools?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1582.338,1587.296,"As far as I know, there is no specific provision of their tuition to that."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.378,1591.242,Do you know?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1591.242,1592.49,I do not know for people beyond --
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1592.49,1593.645,"I do not need either and that's reason, I was asking you --"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1593.645,1623.098,"Sure, as far as I know the reason there is no such provision that is similar to the G.I. Bill of Rights which goes to everybody -- if it were -- if there were specific grant in there and I am fairly confident of it, a specific grant there for tuition to schools and that tuition was payable to schools which teach and practice religion, I believe will be unconstitutional."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.098,1631.462,"What about the grants for under the GI program, that -- to the tuition to Georgetown law school?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1631.462,1638.318,"Well, in the first place this indeed is pointed out in the various briefs."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1698.182,1709.907,"Well, would your position on that point be different, if it in a particular area that brought the case to us if they were 80 % Lutheran and 20 % Catholic?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1709.907,1710.874,Not the least.
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1710.874,1717.104,Would it make any difference of it was 80 % private nondenominational and 20 % --
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1717.104,1723.225,"Not the least, I am just pointing to the Court below is using this argument just the reversed way."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1785.906,1795.748,"Well, that's how justification of the welfare progress, particularly the Categorical Assistance Program for the AFDC for dependent children and fatherless families, isn't it?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1795.748,1795.974,"Yes, indeed."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1795.974,1812.244,"We had a case here, well it is Schwab against Lynx and I also have the captions wrong saying that the state couldn't cut off aid to a child who is attending a -- in his petition of higher learning."
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1817.472,1818.578,It might very well.
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1818.578,1818.808,Do you --
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1818.808,1822.693,Except on private and if you go to colleges.
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1822.693,1824.024,Let's assume it's a high School.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1824.024,1828.224,"Yes indeed I believe it would, I believe to that extend, it would."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1828.224,1829.031,You think the welfare --
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1829.031,1829.588,Because the difference --
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1829.588,1836.076,Welfare -- so funds have to be set -- cut down insofar as the children on welfare and family could go to parochial schools?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1836.076,1841.221,"Not necessarily, because this answers the question which the Chief Justice raised."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1991.921,1996.738,"That is the rationale, but how the hell in the world does that affect your First Amendment argument?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,1996.738,2000.958,"Because the money was used by them for any purpose, it's their money."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2000.958,2007.766,But in fact it was used for many of them to go to religious institutions (Voice Overlap)
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2007.766,2023.629,"In this case the money could only be used for that purpose, unless they come back, unless the parent comes with a receipted bills from a private school and as my -- the record shows, the brief shows."
1972.72-694,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.962,2035.379,But he -- the person cannot come with a receipted bill from a private nondenominational school.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2035.379,2036.677,Certainly.
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2066.152,2079.804,"But since you again emphasize those percentages, what would be the situation in your view if they were reversed 96 % private secular schools, 4 % private sectarian schools?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2079.804,2086.139,"If the money went for tuition, I don't believe it would be constitutionally distinct."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2086.139,2086.629,As to the --
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2086.629,2089.558,Because it's still -- it's still a money for tuition.
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2091.918,2095.524,"Well, then these percentages aren't of any relevance are they?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2095.524,2119.986,"They are relevant mostly towards the third point and it was pointed out by this Court, in Your Honor's opinion in Lemon and DiCenso that and in Walz too, Your Honor's opinion in Walz, that these statutes are all directed for practically one religious group, and I am just relying on like Your Honor said in those cases."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2121.653,2123.434,"The Walz case, it was not directed."
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2123.434,2137.41,Well that's why Your Honor upheld the Walz decision because of that pointed out -- you pointed out that it is not directed to one religious group and that's how you run and distinguished.
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2138.357,2145.635,"But we didn't concern ourselves with trying to weigh and measure the proportions, well then why should we here?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2145.635,2146.08,Well --
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2146.08,2148.159,Whether it's 964 or 496?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2148.159,2149.673,No.
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2202.538,2211.727,"But I don't understand that what -- that a majority are Roman Catholic or that a majority are religious because of course in Walz, they were all religious by definition?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2211.727,2211.924,And there was --
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2211.924,2212.988,And that was the case was about.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2212.988,2213.953,"Yes, yes."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2246.136,2252.475,Then I don't understand how you can conceive the constitutionality of the payments made under the G.I. Bill of Rights after World War II?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2252.475,2257.734,"Well, the answer I say Your Honor, is that this was not even restricted to religion."
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2257.79,2260.833,"No, but all that money went to aid religious institutions, did it not?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2260.833,2261.708,Yes indeed.
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2276.628,2278.672,They didn't pay to the school nor as they here?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2278.672,2295.255,"Well, no -- there is not here in a sense that it is not paid directly but there is here in the sense that the money is paid only if you pay tuition in the religious schools, if only if you pay tuition in --"
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2295.255,2295.962,If you pay tuition in private schools.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2295.962,2297.164,Yes private school.
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2297.164,2297.321,Nonpublic schools.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2297.321,2297.755,Private schools.
1972.72-694,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.557,2305.902,"But under the G,I, Bill although the tuition money went directly to the schools, it did not go through the hands of the recipient or the student?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2305.902,2307.846,"No, it did."
1972.72-694,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2311.584,2318.627,"But it certainly didn't, when I was on the G.I. Bill which was for some four or five years the tuition just simply went to the school."
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2318.627,2331.178,"That was changed after the -- the question was brought before Congress, and they realized that there was a constitutional problem thereafter the change of law, that the tuition money went directly to the G.I. not to the --"
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2331.178,2334.069,"But the G.I. has simply became the conduit then, did it not?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2334.069,2337.593,"Yes, the G.I. became but --"
1972.72-694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.593,2340.952,There's only – it was only tuition money that was paid to --
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2340.952,2343.038,He could use the tuition anywhere he wanted.
1972.72-694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.038,2344.993,"Yes, but only for tuitions."
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2344.993,2352.051,"Only for tuition, they could use it only for tuition, but for tuition in any college, a public college or private."
1972.72-694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.051,2353.05,Yes but including --
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2353.05,2354.061,No.
1972.72-694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.061,2355.277,Or in Grade School.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2355.277,2355.459,Yes.
1972.72-694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.459,2356.28,Or any high school.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2356.28,2382.85,"That's right, he can use it for any college but in respect to tuition limited specifically, limited specifically except for 4 %; for 4 % which I believe it is token and put in I don't believe it could purify the other non uses, limited specifically to religious schools in 96 % of the cases, I do not believe that could be upheld under any law."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2382.85,2410.112,"No, did they not under the GI Bill, have some process of inspection and certification after a period when there were some fraudulent schools, spurious operations, did they not then establish regulations under the statute which required the school to meet a particular standard so that the government checked on whether this money was being used wisely in that respect?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2410.112,2432.106,"If the -- Mr. Chief Justice, if they have done inspection, those standards involved surveillance of the schools in the sense which Lemon and DiCenso I believe it could not be upheld under Lemon and DiCenso."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2432.106,2435.703,Well there is a certain amount of continuing surveillance of all private schools --
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2435.703,2436.163,Yes.
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2436.163,2439.257,-- is there not to see that they meet the standards established by the Board of Education?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2439.257,2442.868,Yes that was that the Court pointed that out in Lemon and DiCenso.
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2442.868,2445.439,And that's not found objectionable?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2445.439,2455.064,"Yes because, it's not found objectionable but when it becomes two, the use of religious funds, the Court found it objectionable in Lemon and DiCenso."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2455.231,2461.846,I am speaking of the general surveillance of all non-public schools that's not the constitutionally objectionable?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2461.846,2493.262,"That's not constitutionally objectionable but on the other hand, that fact does not at least unless this Court overrules Lemon and DiCenso, that fact was not found to immunize that use of public funds for religious, for schools which could teach religion and secular subjects, that's what the Court held in Lemon and DiCenso and the Court, indeed as recently as last year and not in Wisconsin against Yoder."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2601.087,2604.356,You did not -- I think give us the citation of your Missouri case cited in your brief.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2604.356,2613.014,"It's 332 Federal Sub 275, 405 US 1050 from last year."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2615.073,2617.345,Will you repeat that last cite again.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2617.345,2620.81,405 US 1050.
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2620.81,2621.281,Thank you.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2621.281,2628.543,97 -- then let me say what a moment what the Court held in the Nebraska case.
1972.72-694,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.853,2664.847,Was this the parochial parents action --
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2664.847,2664.938,Yes.
1972.72-694,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.938,2668.864,-- to require the States to -- that's somewhat different context.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2668.864,2689.1,"No, it is -- this is -- well it's somewhere between dictum and holding but the Court said that, the Court said that this would be unconstitutional too under the Lemon and we breached them, wholly apart from the fact that entanglement comparable to that described in Lemon cannot be realistically be avoided; if plaintiffs have granted aid for parochial school purposes, particularly on a continuing basis."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2749.68,2752.234,Do you think that reverse of that is true also?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2752.234,2754.384,"Yes, I think the reverse of that is true."
1972.72-694,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2777.725,2779.907,Is there a difference Mr. Pfeffer?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2779.907,2782.2,Between exemptions or between deduction?
1972.72-694,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2782.2,2788.265,"Well, is there a difference between – yes, would a tax deduction make it be a different case?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2788.265,2798.411,"It might, the District Court -- in the case which was decided after this, which is not found tax exemption."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2798.411,2800.496,We will let you answer that after lunch
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2810.699,2819.668,I just want to answer -- complete my answer then I will reserve my time for rebuttal.
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2900.829,2902.192,Or medical deductions --
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2902.192,2903.627,Or medical deduction itself.
1972.72-694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2903.627,2905.804,-- for service three in a Catholic Hospital.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2905.804,2913.711,"Anything, if it were treated as a deduction then I think that it could -- a reasonable argument could be made for its, that is constitutional."
1972.72-694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.306,2988.264,"Whether it's a credit or deduction, neither does any business who had income, unless you have the monthly income to make sure ti was?"
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2988.264,2992.934,"Well, if you don't have and you get under the new --- they will give you the money in the form of tuition."
1972.72-694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.934,2993.441,That's right.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2993.441,2994.263,Under a statute.
1972.72-694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2995.914,2998.522,And a deduction wouldn't do any body good without it?
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,2998.522,2999.524,"That's right, that's right."
1972.72-694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.386,3006.215,Right.
1972.72-694,0,34959,leo_pfeffer,,3006.215,3012.88,"In Ohio and in some other states, they give you a negative income tax rate."
1972.72-694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3017.208,3021.485,"Very well, Mr. Pfeffer."
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3023.636,3028.315,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3213.448,3215.58,Is there a limit on that?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3215.58,3216.856,Yes there is.
1972.72-694,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3243.741,3244.872,Mrs. Coon.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3244.872,3245.137,Yes.
1972.72-694,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3245.137,3256.25,Are you going to address yourself to the precise manner in which this New York tax -- the portion of the statute dealing with tax operates?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3265.662,3271.142,"Yes, You Honor, I am."
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3312.256,3314.212,The credit is different.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3314.212,3316.631,A credit is -- a tax credit is different.
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3319.136,3321.121,It's just to forgiveness of what you owe the Government --
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3321.121,3321.73,Yes.
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3321.73,3322.414,-- it's a set off.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3322.414,3322.528,Right.
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3322.528,3323.836,It's like paying you money directly.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3323.836,3328.913,"Now in this particular instance, this comes off at the top."
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3352.094,3353.488,But it isn't.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3363.18,3364.181,"No, you do not."
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.181,3364.758,"No, you do not."
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3369.761,3379.152,"No, it is not, but it also is not a tax credit as that term is generally understood because the tax credit also amounts to a precise dollar amount."
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3379.152,3384.311,"But tax credit, is just the reduction of the amount of money you owe the government directly, that's what a credit is."
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3384.311,3397.57,"That's what a credit is and this is not, this is -- we submit equivalent legal principle to a deduction or exemption even though in terms of the actual mechanism by which it operates, it doesn't come out the same way."
1972.72-694,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3397.57,3407.417,"Well, isn't that close this too an exemption for that you get, for dependents on your Federal income tax return, isn't that closest analogy?"
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3407.417,3414.25,Well it is closest to analogy because your exemption is not related to an actual expenditure.
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3418.28,3428.925,"Yes, but that -- the exemption comes out of -- it serves to reduce your taxable income and that extend is like a deduction."
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3428.925,3435.491,"Yes and to that extent, this is precisely the same way that this does reduce your taxable income."
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3435.491,3443.209,I thought it was a gear to operate to actually reduce your taxes directly.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3443.209,3444.247,"No, no."
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3445.42,3451.286,"Well, maybe you'll expand this as Justice Rehnquist had suggested in the earlier question."
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3451.286,3457.448,New York State has actually had a history of tax credits which have not been related to specific purposes.
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3479.728,3480.708,And that's a true credit.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3480.708,3481.501,That's a true credit.
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3481.501,3484.248,A forgiveness of part of what you owe in taxes?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3484.248,3493.462,"Now, this on the other hand, the modification of gross income, starts at the top of the income tax return and this comes off before you compute your tax liability, comes off --"
1972.72-694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3493.462,3497.586,This should be like the box that goes over and how many exemptions you have.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3499.995,3507.573,"Yes, except there is -- it's figure is slightly differently since it's figured differently in amounts but it comes off at that part of the tax return, it comes off in that --"
1972.72-694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3507.573,3509.384,But it is a flat amount?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3509.384,3511.833,"No, it varies based upon income."
1972.72-694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3511.833,3512.789,That's right.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3512.789,3526.895,"The persons with an income of less than $9,000 or less, it's a thousand dollars, if your income is between -- I think it's 20,000 and 23,999, it's a $100 and above that it's a zero amount."
1972.72-694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3526.895,3527.874,Yes.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3527.874,3528.367,So that the --
1972.72-694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3528.367,3530.822,And it would be up in that level.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3530.822,3531.085,Right.
1972.72-694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3531.085,3531.607,On the returns.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3531.607,3540.233,"Yes, would be up at that point, it's up -- in that point of part of the return, before you start computing your taxable income and tax liability."
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3559.174,3562.46,"But that's the same theory about it, be as income $5,000 or $500."
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3562.46,3562.849,Yes.
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3573.574,3575.567,It's a very appropriate day to be discussing this?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3575.567,3575.991,Yes.
1972.72-694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3659.481,3670.663,So what -- if any -- if it only from the deduction if it is an exemption or a deduction if the -- it has a differential effect there depending on how much money you make?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3670.663,3677.612,Yes.
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3797.108,3802.454,"Is there any query in these papers, a tax form that shows us how this works?"
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3802.454,3804.236,No.
1972.72-694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3806.171,3809.487,That might be helpful to all of us.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3819.054,3820.905,Okay.
1972.72-694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3852.491,3858.011,Was the choice personally made in fact people are getting the --
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3858.011,3864.087,"Only if his income is less than $5000.00, then he would have to make the choice."
1972.72-694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3868.114,3876.578,"Well, the person but the -- I suppose a person could have too little income to get any benefit out of the creditors, is that true?"
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3876.578,3877.775,That's true.
1972.72-694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3877.775,3880.066,Which of that he would take a provision?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3880.066,3882.547,That I assume that would be true.
1972.72-694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3882.547,3886.632,Would that possibly be true if he had too much income?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3886.632,3887.83,Well --
1972.72-694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3887.83,3895.084,"Does it function at any point the way the medical deduction does in the federal, you had an analogy to that and I am not sure I followed it."
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3895.084,3902.904,"Well it's over -- if your income is over $24,000.00 a year, you cannot take --"
1972.72-694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3902.904,3903.644,None at all?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3903.644,3910.128,"You cannot take the tax relief and if your income is over $5000.00, you cannot take the tuition reimbursement."
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3910.128,3913.81,"You are eligible for the tuition relief only if your income is below $5000.00, is that correct?"
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3913.81,3914.752,Yes.
1972.72-694,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3914.752,3921.704,"Or I take it chances are if your income is under $5000.00, you would have no tax to pay anyway?"
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3921.704,3922.471,I would assume that that would be --
1972.72-694,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3922.471,3930.519,And I expect that is why the provision for -- the reimbursement to the extent it is --
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3930.519,3930.776,I would think so because there would be no.
1972.72-694,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3930.776,3933.55,-- of people under $5000.00.
1972.72-694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3936.159,3943.72,"But your deduction -- your deduction or exemption, whatever you call it or credit, whatever you call it, does not go progressively down up to 24, does it?"
1972.72-694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3943.72,3943.995,Yes.
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3943.995,3944.919,"Yes it does, goes progressively down."
1972.72-694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3944.919,3946.963,Progressively down and then ends at 24?
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3946.963,3951.257,Yes.
1972.72-694,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4231.813,4235.599,"Well that really doesn't answer your problem here though, does it?"
1972.72-694,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,4249.458,4251.53,"Yes, Your Honor, that's a correct statement."
1972.72-694,2,37810,porter_r_chandler,,4940.504,4943.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.72-694,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5042.788,5044.76,I gather it cannot be a profit making school?
1972.72-694,2,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5044.76,5045.611,Can't be a what?
1972.72-694,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5045.611,5046.592,Profit making school?
1972.72-694,2,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5046.592,5054.917,"Can’t be a profit making, you are quite right, Your Honor, a non-profit school that comes with every requirements of the compulsory Education Law."
1972.72-694,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5163.871,5168.859,"That would be, as a matter of this fact, that would be largely the Puerto Rican community, would it?"
1972.72-694,2,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5168.859,5169.657,Largely Puerto Rican.
1972.72-694,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5403.723,5409.129,He of course recognized that he knew about that when he paid the money to the school?
1972.72-694,2,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5409.129,5410.568,He knew that the money was coming.
1972.72-694,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5410.568,5411.862,Yeah.
1972.72-694,2,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5413.363,5414.707,"Yes, that's right."
1972.72-694,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5414.707,5418.333,(Voice Overlap) argument but I think you ought to --
1972.72-694,2,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5418.333,5431.425,"Just as the parent, the parent who paid the bus company in Everson, he knew he was going to get it back but when he got it back, it was his money I think, Your Honor."
1972.72-694,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5710.264,5716.182,Thank you Mr. Chandler.
1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,5717.763,5722.449,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,5843.264,5848.35,No they don’t but what I’m attempting to do is put into the total perspective of the educational aspect.
1972.72-694,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5848.35,5849.755,They’re paying sales taxes.
1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,5849.755,5857.89,"They are paying sales taxes, and they're paying if they own real properties, some type of real property tax."
1972.72-694,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6184.377,6188.365,"This comes to about 280 schools out of a total of around 2,000?"
1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,6188.365,6194.843,"2,000 non public schools in the state and about 280 of the schools are benefited by Section 1."
1972.72-694,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6194.843,6196.589,Almost under 15%.
1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,6196.589,6200.402,"Under 15, between -- about 12%."
1972.72-694,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6237.784,6248.346,"Well, I take it Mr. Haggerty if the heating system broke down under the statute, the entire heating system which also heats the chapel could be replaced, could it not?"
1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,6248.346,6255.198,"The heating system could be replaced to the extent that it would fall within the definition of a secular, non-ideological (Voice Overlap)"

1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,6263.773,6264.323,Yes.
1972.72-694,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6264.323,6267.041,"And under this statute, it could be replaced, could it not?"
1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,6267.041,6273.938,It could be replaced but we have built into the statute what we consider a statistical requirement of neutrality and that is that --
1972.72-694,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6273.938,6277.558,"I know but, that was my question, it could be, it could be replaced, could it not?"
1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,6277.558,6304.101,"It could be replaced, but our preposition in formulating the legislation was that we would never get to a position to where we would pay the total amount of the repair or replacement of the heating system because in no event can the cost reimbursed by the state be more than 50% of the comparable cost in the public sector and that we try to build in as a statistical degree of neutrality here."
1972.72-694,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6304.101,6313.258,"Well, my only point was, you may not be able to paint the chapel under this, but you can repair the heating system that heats the beside chapel, can't you?"
1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,6313.258,6319.355,"That's correct, but our purpose was not that you could provide for the total cost of repairing the heating system."
1972.72-694,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6319.355,6329.89,"But I suppose implicit in your answer is that in very few schools would the chapel exceed 50% of the total heated space, is that a reasonable assumption?"
1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,6329.89,6335.36,That's correct.

1972.72-694,3,30804,john_f_haggerty,,6360.074,6363.468,"Hopefully, we won't have to do that."
1972.72-694,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6527.967,6531.085,Thank you Mr. Haggerty.
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6569.378,6575.529,I think it may even give a rise to a question on Establishment Clause as well.
1972.72-694,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6575.529,6577.059,With Free Exercise --
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6577.059,6597.966,Or even more than Free Exercise -- Free Exercise and Establishment because Establishment Clauses as it is defined by this Court in a number of cases equally forbids aid to religion and aid to anti-religion.
1972.72-694,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6599.622,6605.136,"In my hypothetical, I wasn't assuming that they had a sign on the building that this is an anti-religious school."
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6607.679,6607.812,Oh!

1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6615.858,6616.02,Oh!
1972.72-694,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6629.428,6631.613,Does that give you any equal protection problem in this respect?
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6631.613,6664.384,"Well, I don't see, how it's – as a matter of fact this Court has all decided on the Nebraska case, the Nebraska case, that was the argument of the plaintiffs in the Nebraska case, that there was a violation of Equal protection because Nebraska, the case which I cited this morning, respect to a suit brought by parents of children attending private schools parochial schools, who claimed there was a violation of Free Exercise because the private schools were excluded/ The District Court unanimously rejected that this Court affirmed without any dissent."
1972.72-694,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6830.026,6833.893,Well Mr. Pfeffer you say this is a tax credit.
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6833.893,6834.05,Yes.
1972.72-694,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6834.05,6840.213,Now how do you define a tax credit as opposed to a deduction or an exemption when you are using that term?
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6840.213,6842.33,I do it in several ways.
1972.72-694,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6886.511,6898.905,Then your definition of tax credit is a broader one than the one which would simply say a tax credit is an amount you subtract from the otherwise computed tax (Voice Overlap)
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6898.905,6902.692,I would say that the First Amendment --
1972.72-694,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6902.692,6904.459,"Well, will you answer my question?"
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6904.459,6906.513,Yes.
1972.72-694,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6914.566,6917.923,But then it is a broader definition than the one I just mentioned to you?
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6917.923,6923.611,"It is a broader definition, yes indeed and indeed Mrs. Coon did conceded that."
1972.72-694,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6925.546,6942.58,(Inaudible)
1972.72-694,4,34959,leo_pfeffer,,6942.58,6946.698,I would deem that unconstitutional.
