2013.12-815,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.654,"We will next hear argument in case 12-815, Sprint Communications v. Jacobs."
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,7.62,10.956,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-815,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,76.548,83.237,"Counsel, one of the problems I have is I don't know how to define ‵‵ coercive ′′."
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,95.426,97.561,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-815,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,97.561,113.737,"--is it -- is it worthwhile using that distinction at all, or should we be thinking about going back to basic principles and doing something like the Second Circuit does, which is to say it's a sovereign interest rather than a personal interest?"
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,113.737,119.724,"Your Honor, we've argued that there is no magic to the -- to the word ‵‵ coercive ′′."
2013.12-815,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,156.449,162.253,Those were when most of them involved State proceedings.
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,162.253,163.437,Yes.
2013.12-815,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,185.017,191.004,"But then we went further in Pennzoil and in New Orleans -- well, perhaps not."
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,191.004,197.926,"Yes, the Court went further in a couple of different directions, and I want to try to address them separately, if I may."
2013.12-815,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.34,303.094,"Mr. Simeone, this -- the background of this case, I don't quite grasp."
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,318.639,320.172,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2013.12-815,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,320.172,326.126,Has the FCC had a proceeding to resolve it?
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,326.126,327.728,Yes.
2013.12-815,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,385.934,393.087,"Well, why wouldn't -- let's say you -- you -- there were no abstention."
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,411.549,424.642,We -- we strongly urged the IUB not to address these issues of Federal law.
2013.12-815,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.555,447.924,"Well, you could."
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,472.973,480.811,"To be clear, Your Honor, we actually aren't seeking to enjoin any proceeding in the State."
2013.12-815,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,488.999,491.834,You explained that.
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,507.646,508.513,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-815,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,623.171,634.396,"Well, what would have been the ruling, do you think -- what would have been the correct ruling if you had filed your Federal action while the case was still -- the issue was still pending before the Iowa board?"
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,644.084,647.053,"It would not be the same, Your Honor, but we do think that we should--"
2013.12-815,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,647.053,650.255,--Because it would be an -- because it would be Burford at that point or what?
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,650.255,662.463,--I don't think it would be -- I don't think it would be Burford because the State doesn't argue that there's a complex regulatory regime here of the sort that's covered by Burford.
2013.12-815,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,828.704,829.321,Mr. Simeone?
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,829.321,829.721,--Yes.
2013.12-815,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,829.721,832.923,Could I take you back to -- to the agency proceeding?
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,856.271,858.49,I can do my best.
2013.12-815,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,975.348,982.204,"On Dayton, if the only relief available had been reinstatement and back pay, would that matter?"
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,982.204,988.441,"No, I don't think it would matter, Your Honor."
2013.12-815,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1226.279,1228.297,"Well, those cases are different."
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,1244.776,1250.061,"Well, I think this really goes back, Your Honor, to the traditional principle that I started with."
2013.12-815,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1305.064,1312.737,"But then, if the question is whether something is tied to something that can be regarded as criminal or quasi-criminal, what about Middlesex County?"
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,1315.189,1317.305,"Well, Middlesex County is not criminal, certainly."
2013.12-815,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1363.92,1388.451,"What do you say about the argument that -- that once the IUB decided to go on with this proceeding, you didn't want them to, but they did, that that then became a proceeding for them to enforce the access charge?"
2013.12-815,0,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,1388.451,1397.724,"Well, I think, again, Your Honor, that that goes back to the differences between this sort of case and the Dayton case."
2013.12-815,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1458.065,1458.798,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1465.987,1468.587,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1527.542,1529.478,It seems--
2013.12-815,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1529.478,1535.215,"So -- but I mean, is there a different category, some of the normal regulatory interests are important and other regulatory interests are not?"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1564.567,1565.917,"No, Your Honor, we do not."
2013.12-815,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1565.917,1567.769,"Well, how do you -- how do you tell which--"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1567.769,1570.738,The -- let me give you two parts to that answer.
2013.12-815,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.647,1585.73,When -- when aren't they?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1585.73,1590.884,"I've got to take this case and make two changes to it, and I have an example for you."
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1647.388,1655.494,"--Counsel, what's left of Colorado River under your view of this case?"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1689.482,1704.141,"Well, first of all, let me say that the question of whether it's a unitary proceeding or whether there's a -- a fork in the road after the agency has completed its proceedings, that question is not part of the question presented here in this case today."
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1714.449,1718.084,"Well, the Eighth Circuit has decided that question."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1719.151,1719.936,There's--
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1719.936,1720.536,--They say it is.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1720.536,1726.023,"--There is, in fact, under our research, about a 4-3 split among the circuits on that question."
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1728.709,1729.375,"No, I--"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1729.375,1731.994,"And if you're going to get to that question, in fact--"
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1731.994,1734.127,--But why don't you get to the essence of that question.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1734.127,1734.613,--Thank you.
2013.12-815,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.638,1808.059,"Counsel, especially in cases that involve jurisdictional issues."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1853.106,1884.792,"The -- because it would, if you were to take that approach, it would result in a denial of abstention in cases like this one that present exactly the evils, the concerns that were presented in Younger in terms of disrespect for the State's ability to resolve Federal questions, the concerns of federalism, the concerns of avoiding duplicative cases in the courts."
2013.12-815,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.792,1894.6,Any purely civil case that raises that kind of an issue can arguably be subject to Younger abstention; is that right?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1894.6,1899.152,It would be up to the judges to decide whether there was an important State interest there or not.
2013.12-815,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1899.152,1913.161,"Are you saying then that in every State agency adjudication attended by State court review -- yeah, that would apply?"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1913.161,1915.096,"No, Your Honor, I'm not."
2013.12-815,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1915.096,1918.298,So can you -- so can you then -- we have only the two cases.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1944.616,1954.055,A State agency adjudication that did not involve the State agency attempting to enforce a State statute or State law.
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1967.815,1969.081,What was the State law here?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1970.6,1984.341,"--The State law here was Iowa Code Section 476.5, the filed tariff doctrine, which requires that, in this case, that Windstream charge Sprint with providing intrastate access services."
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1984.341,1986.027,That mimics the Federal law.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1986.027,1988.311,On the State side.
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1991.763,1995.482,But you don't derive any power independent of that Federal law?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,1995.482,1996.765,"Oh, no, I'm sorry."
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2013.427,2019.431,"By the way, there are other abstention doctrines that can take care of State interests, aren't there?"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2021.95,2023.366,"In appropriate cases, yes."
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2023.366,2046.898,"So I don't know why Younger as you're -- in following up on Justice Scalia's question, why Younger has to be the only vehicle, why we need to create more categories than NOPSI did to protect State interests when we have an awful lot of other doctrines that do that already."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2046.898,2055.354,I don't know that we're asking you to create a new category or a new extension.
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2074.834,2084.606,"By the way, have we ever used the Younger abstention in a case where the Federal plaintiff also filed the Federal -- the State action as well?"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2084.606,2088.594,Do you mean the State action before the board or before--
2013.12-815,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2088.594,2090.177,"Before anybody, court or a board."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2090.177,2094.212,"--Not that I'm aware of, no."
2013.12-815,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2161.606,2163.075,"--I'm sorry, it's going to what?"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2163.075,2163.725,--Reoccur.
2013.12-815,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2163.725,2164.242,Oh.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2164.242,2175.2,"The case would inevitably be before the board again, perhaps next time with Sprint -- with Windstream filing instead of Sprint or Sprint saying they're threatening us with disconnection again."
2013.12-815,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2217.793,2221.162,"Well, don't all -- it's sort of like the important State interests."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2238.79,2242.76,"If it can be backed up, as this one could."
2013.12-815,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2257.687,2268.912,"Well, my point is it doesn't seem like much of a limiting test, if you can say any time -- sort of any time anything bad can happen to you as a result of an administrative proceeding, that's coercive."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2272.797,2284.004,"--And what that, what that may go to, Your Honor, is the fact that the coercive-remedial distinction is not any easier to apply than the important State interest test."
2013.12-815,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2284.004,2292.091,"Well, could you give me an example of State administrative proceedings that would not fall within your understanding of the scope of Younger?"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2292.091,2307.703,"With respect to my own agency, for instance, a -- well, there is all the obvious examples, legislative action, the cases where there is no State agency or no State proceeding pending."
2013.12-815,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2334.52,2336.12,I think--
2013.12-815,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2336.12,2337.806,Why is -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2350.28,2352.232,Let me be clear.
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.337,2362.954,Does it matter if it's just purely Federal law?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2391.041,2398.879,If the Federal plaintiff brought the Federal action in order to enjoin the State court proceedings--
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.879,2399.296,"No, no."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2421.226,2422.026,--Yes.
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.026,2422.695,Yes.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2437.187,2438.787,Involving the same parties.
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.787,2439.956,Yes.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2439.956,2440.573,Yeah.
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2440.573,2445.675,"Well, I can't think of a -- doesn't it often happen that there are such cases?"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2466.172,2472.243,I think my authority for it is in this case -- in this Court's Younger abstention decisions.
2013.12-815,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2482.116,2484.152,"Well, suppose it's a licensing procedure."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2494.024,2496.71,"No, I don't think that would be a--"
2013.12-815,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2496.71,2497.126,Why?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2497.126,2500.595,--I don't believe that would be agency action in a judicial manner.
2013.12-815,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2500.595,2501.947,Why not?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2501.947,2507.666,"I'm assuming that they filed a -- a form, filled it out, gave it to the agency and it was denied."
2013.12-815,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2510.318,2515.338,"Well, suppose there's some -- there's an -- an administrative agency in the State that hears appeals from that."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2515.338,2536.685,"If the person applying for that license had then gone on to ask for a hearing before that department that hears administrative appeals, and it had a quasi-judicial proceeding in order to make that determination, then I believe that Younger would -- could apply there, if there's an important State interest attached to the denial of that license."
2013.12-815,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2536.685,2567.306,"--I guess, Mr. Lynch, the concern is, given that we think agencies are doing things that implicate important State interests most of the time, that's why they do them, that -- that your test, and not just your test, but the Eighth Circuit's tests, would turn agency adjudicators into the primary legal decision-makers in our system on all matters that they were -- you know, wanted to get into, including matters of Federal law."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2567.306,2580.464,"That would -- to the extent that the cases are brought before the State agencies in the first place, and the Federal issues are raised there, before it goes to the Federal court, that would be correct."
2013.12-815,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2580.464,2584.518,"That does seem like a big proposition, you know."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2589.32,2596.992,"I think that Middlesex combined with Huffman providing for the State a unitary proceeding does, in fact, provide for that result."
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2598.126,2599.109,Does Younger say ‵‵ before ′′?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2599.109,2600.494,--I'm sorry?
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2600.494,2601.494,Does Younger say ‵‵ before ′′?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2601.494,2602.813,No.
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2603.613,2604.03,You just said before.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2604.03,2604.53,--Middlesex--
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.53,2605.013,No.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2607.881,2608.716,--No.
2013.12-815,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2620.524,2632.749,Is it correct that under Eighth Circuit law the party that wants to bring the Federal lawsuit has to go to State court first?
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2632.749,2638.069,"--You mean following the agency proceedings, the unitary proceeding?"
2013.12-815,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2645.473,2656.28,"Well, I thought that -- I thought that Sprint said that they had to go to State court whether they wanted to or not or else they wouldn't be able to go to Federal court."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2656.28,2674.842,"I believe Sprint's argument -- I don't care -- don't want to speak for them, but I believe their argument on that point was following the board's decision, they feel that the Eighth Circuit law required them to file petitions in both Federal court and to invoke the judicial review process in State district court."
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.842,2691.12,"If Younger only applies to -- to State proceedings that are brought first, then I guess we could have a -- a criminal defendant, who's not yet one, bring an action in Federal court to say that the law is unconstitutional or something or violates a Federal law."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2699.541,2705.963,That would be the -- very much like the case in this Court's decision in Steffel against--
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2705.963,2716.819,So we've said they can't -- you can enjoin a criminal decision -- a criminal proceeding in a State court as long as the criminal proceeding wasn't brought first.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2719.271,2725.859,--As I read it what this Court has said is that there's no Younger abstention when there's no pending State criminal proceeding.
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2725.859,2726.377,"No, no."
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2731.378,2732.947,So -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2733.414,2734.347,--I'll ask you to clarify.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2759.182,2761.598,Yes.
2013.12-815,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2767.502,2768.035,All right.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2768.035,2768.635,--Okay.
2013.12-815,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2899.137,2908.592,"Well, then why wouldn't you say that Sprint was not the initiator of this State process?"
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2912.979,2913.996,I'm sorry.
2013.12-815,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2915.181,2917.181,Sprint -- Sprint withdrew its complaint.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2917.181,2918.966,Sprint was allowed to withdraw its complaint.
2013.12-815,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2918.966,2919.433,Yes.
2013.12-815,1,21153,david_j_lynch,,2925.62,2926.754,That is correct.
2013.12-815,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2948.569,2949.452,Thank you counsel.
2013.12-815,2,43283,timothy_j_simeone,,2951.787,2955.656,I hope to be very brief.
2013.12-815,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3078.954,3081.054,"Thank you counsel, counsel."
