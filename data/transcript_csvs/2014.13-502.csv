2014.13-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.417,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 13-502, Reed v. Town of Gilbert."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,8.992,14.118,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-502,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,61.733,64.342,"Well, what are -- what are you seeking?"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,79.895,87.337,"We're -- we're seeking the same as the -- the favorable signs, which, in this case, would be both ideological and political signs."
2014.13-502,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,88.61,91.375,But the ideological isn't time unlimited.
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,91.375,102.511,"--Well, but it's not allowed on the right-of-way, and so that's a major factor in this case because political signs are allowed on the right-of-way, and so the treatment that we're seeking is merely equal treatment under the First Amendment."
2014.13-502,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,102.511,105.323,"The same treatment as political signs, then, is that--"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,105.323,109.552,"The -- the same treatment as political signs that are allowed up in the right-of-way, that's right."
2014.13-502,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.547,122.977,Are you -- are you seeking unlimited placement?
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,122.977,123.782,We are not.
2014.13-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,143.071,147.723,"Your -- your argument does not turn on the fact that it's a church's sign, does it?"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,152.842,153.703,"Well, that's right."
2014.13-502,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,174.772,179.089,"Can I ask about the category for political signs, which is the most favorable?"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,206.889,215.928,"--But I think this Court has also said, for example, that -- that religious speech also handles that category of core speech under the First Amendment."
2014.13-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,229.012,229.605,I -- I'm sorry.
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,247.839,249.118,"--Well, that's right."
2014.13-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,253.006,257.615,Don't you think that political speech is more valuable than directions to the soccer game?
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,257.615,265.953,"--Maybe in some people's eyes, but the problem we have is -- is should the government be deciding what speech is more valuable than others, because that is exactly what it did in this case."
2014.13-502,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,271.951,286.444,"Well, let's -- let's take a sign that in all other ways is equal except that it says no signs on residential property except properties that are being sold."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,305.064,306.203,--I think it would be.
2014.13-502,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,331.943,334.917,What if it's commercial and it relates to a one-time event.
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,337.489,338.191,Right.
2014.13-502,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,338.191,348.576,"If the State and the city allow election-related signs to be put up in the right-of-way, then anybody who has a yard sale has an equal right?"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,348.576,354.084,"Well, I think -- I think commercial speech, under this Court's jurisprudence, can be treated differently, and that's one of the important things."
2014.13-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,380.363,383.935,Do you think directional signs is a valid category?
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,383.935,392.386,"The reason I don't think it is is because here, the direction is part of the invitation to come and worship or part of the invitation to come to a different event."
2014.13-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,426.436,439.882,"I guess you see the concern, if an affluent person wants to celebrate a birthday, he can put ""Happy birthday, Uncle Fred"" as many places as a political sign, and as for long."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,439.882,451.306,"Well, I think one of the issues is if the government has decided that its interest -- which, by the way, is what drives this, the interest in safety and aesthetics, which is the two interests the government proposes."
2014.13-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.539,466.221,"Your answer to the question is ""Happy birthday, Uncle Fred"" can have as many signs and for as long as the political campaign."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,466.221,467.494,--I think -- I think that is right.
2014.13-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,468.065,474.188,"That has -- that has to be -- seem to me -- what about historical marker, the birthplace of James Madison or whatever?"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,474.188,477.86,--I think the answer to that is the government is free to put up that marker without any--
2014.13-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,477.86,480.139,"No, no, it's privately -- privately owned."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,480.139,485.294,"--Well, I think if it's -- if it's allowing private speech, then we engage in the problem of valuing."
2014.13-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,491.107,503.24,"So again, under your view, ""Happy birthday, Uncle Fred"" and ""Save your soul"" and ""Birthplace of James Madison"" can all be up for the same length of time, same size."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,503.24,507.177,"I think it can, because otherwise I think we have a problem with content-based discrimination--"
2014.13-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.177,508.619,What about permanent signs?
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,514.684,516.604,"--It would, but in a different category."
2014.13-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.29,530.597,Within the permanent sign category--
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,530.597,530.814,--Yes.
2014.13-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.814,532.643,--they all have to have the same--
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,532.643,533.463,"I believe so, because--"
2014.13-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.463,535.223,"--except commercial, I assume."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,535.223,538.9,--And especially if -- most of the permanent signs are commercial signs.
2014.13-502,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,550.801,551.927,"Well, you characterize--"
2014.13-502,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,551.927,565.654,"Well, what would happen if one church has a -- always meets in the same place and it wants to put up a sign that says, every Sunday this is the place to go, and another church moves around, so it wants to put up a temporary sign."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,567.87,568.722,I think they would.
2014.13-502,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,600.074,604.462,--How do you create your temporary category without reading the sign?
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,624.595,633.405,"--I don't think it does, and the reason the way the temporary sign is defined here is merely a sign that's often intended and constructed not to be permanent."
2014.13-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,650.07,653.862,So your point is if it's -- if it's stuck in the ground with a little stake--
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,653.862,654.014,--Right.
2014.13-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,654.014,657.076,"--then it can be treated one way, but if it's in concrete -- but--"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,657.076,657.497,That's right.
2014.13-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,657.497,669.982,"--It seems to me that you are trying to find a, I don't know, a difficult way to deal with an issue that could be readily addressed just by seeing if the sign is for a limited event."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,690.065,707.464,"But I think what is important here is the fact if the city, the town has already agreed that an election is an event, and so we have an election that's an event, but yet that single event sign can be up for five months, and yet we have an event where that single event can only be up overnight."
2014.13-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.847,749.368,"Well, I mean, to say that an election is a single event in the same way as a football game, a cookout, a basketball championship, it's -- it seems to me is a very difficult thing for this Court to have to decide."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,769.569,769.927,--Certainly--
2014.13-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,769.927,784.495,But it seems to me you are forcing us into making a very wooden distinction that could result in a proliferation of signs for birthday parties or for every conceivable event that could be up for five months.
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,784.495,789.713,"--But I think the problem is there -- there already is that here, because we have an unlimited number of political signs."
2014.13-502,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,831.922,844.124,"Can the town say that signs relating to a one-time event, an election or anything else that occurs on a particular date, have to be taken down within a period of time after that event?"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,848.106,850.147,I don't believe it is.
2014.13-502,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,894.916,901.981,"I thought you said the way you distinguish between temporary signs and permanent signs is based on the -- the nature of the sign, not what it says."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,901.981,902.289,--Right.
2014.13-502,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,902.289,907.063,So that gets you over the problem Justice Sotomayor mentioned about having to read the sign.
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,907.063,907.253,Right.
2014.13-502,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,907.253,917.261,"But if this -- if there's a rule that says the sign has to be down within a certain period of time after the date of the event, which is on the sign, I don't see how you get around to reading the sign."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,917.261,930.02,"Well, what you would be reading is the date, and -- and the code requires the date to be placed on the sign both for when the sign is placed and -- and for -- you know, for what the event is."
2014.13-502,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,930.66,938.86,"So if somebody puts up a sign for a yard sale two days before the yard sale, then they can -- that can stay up for 48 days after the yard sale?"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,942.577,944.342,"--Yes, according to -- according to the code."
2014.13-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.498,977.844,What page?
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,977.844,983.419,--Page 10 of the amici brief on behalf of the National League of Cities on behalf of the town.
2014.13-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.018,1001.869,What page is this again?
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1001.869,1005.321,--This is page 10 on the National League of Cities' amici brief.
2014.13-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1005.321,1005.704,Got it.
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1005.704,1018.745,"It says you can regulate locational criteria, off-site signs, number of signs, spacing, setbacks, placement criteria, roof sign, ground signs, wall signs, projecting signs."
2014.13-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1063.615,1064.566,For the towns it might be.
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1085.994,1086.38,--Right.
2014.13-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1086.38,1097.755,"Now, if they say, okay, we'll make an exception for that, does that mean that they have to have an exception for everything, and pretty soon the entire State of Wyoming is just filled with clutter?"
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1097.755,1099.221,I wouldn't say everything.
2014.13-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1104.497,1107.172,"No, no, it's not a content-neutral category."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1162.537,1175.954,"--The definition we would propose is the same one this Court has used since the Mosley case about what is content-based, and that is if there -- the restriction or the regulation looks at the subject matter, looks at--"
2014.13-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1175.954,1187.597,"No, try -- try the criminal code and solicitation, where if you solicit for certain things you commit serious crimes, and if you commit certain -- solicit for certain other things, they are less serious and so forth."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1190.383,1190.848,"--Well, I don't think--"
2014.13-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1190.848,1193.378,"Or how does it apply -- you see, I'm -- I'm confused."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1194.805,1195.601,--Right.
2014.13-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.601,1201.692,--but I just have never been able to understand how they apply in many cases.
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1201.692,1206.669,"Only limited here to to free speech questions, not criminal laws, not--"
2014.13-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1206.669,1207.549,"No, no, I'm sorry."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1220.465,1220.668,--I do.
2014.13-502,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.668,1224.901,"--think of the U.S. Code, and what I want and hoping for is enlightenment."
2014.13-502,0,56090,david_a_cortman,,1224.901,1232.099,"I think if there is -- it's a conduct-related offense, we don't get into free speech."
2014.13-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1287.625,1288.623,"Thank you, Mr. Cortman."
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1300.384,1303.538,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1394.405,1402.934,"Well, I mean, you -- you obviously know the difficulty with that, which is how does the government decide when there should be an exception or how does a court decide when there should be an exception and when there shouldn't be?"
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1421.222,1439.574,"Well, I think the main problem with strict scrutiny in this context is it sends a signal to legislatures that they are on safer ground if they enact a broad and undifferentiated restriction on signs than if they try to tailor it only to those types of signs that actually cause the problem that they are trying to prevent."
2014.13-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.07,1492.318,"And you want us to sort -- sort these ordinances out one by one and examine each of these exceptions and say, you know, this is okay and this isn't okay?"
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1513.2,1521.854,"Well, Your Honor, it's a simple rule, but I think it's an extremely impractical rule that is going to foreclose experimentation and local solutions to local problems."
2014.13-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.837,1546.607,What is the problem?
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1554.953,1565.302,"--Well, I think towns legitimately should not have to be put to the choice if they want to prevent the proliferation of signs that would cause safety problems--"
2014.13-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1565.302,1571.0,"Or have the town put up the signs, in which case they can be as big as the town wants."
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1573.15,1573.539,"--Your Honor, I'm not--"
2014.13-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.539,1578.558,"So you're you're -- saying every private individual has to have a big sign, ""Children At Play"", right?"
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1578.558,1600.016,"--Well, I don't want to resist too hard the idea that the Government can put up any signs it wants, but I think the reason we think the Government could put up the signs here is not because the Government can say that it can speak on certain topics and private citizens can't, but because of the nature of the signs that are being put up, which means that some work has to be done here by the fact that the types of signs I described are safety signs."
2014.13-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1623.867,1629.536,"Counsel, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure your whole approach is not precluded by our decision in McCullen."
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1662.007,1681.638,"Well, Your Honor, I think the Court can deal with the competing interests in this case more easily not by getting bogged down in the definition of content-based and content-neutral, which I can address in a second, but by focusing more on the bottom-line question of whether this is an appropriate case for the application of strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny."
2014.13-502,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1681.638,1690.415,"When you use those labels in the context of the First Amendment, do they mean the same thing that they mean in equal protection?"
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1697.103,1705.487,"Well, I think there are a couple of flavors of intermediate scrutiny, both under the Constitution at large and under the First Amendment in particular."
2014.13-502,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1766.417,1767.556,Do you think that a--
2014.13-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1768.638,1769.402,Justice Sotomayor.
2014.13-502,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1769.402,1792.717,"Do you think that a library could say big books are preferable to little books and it so happens that big books are coffee books and little books tend to be mostly political, so we're going to put all the political books in the basement and all the big books on the main floor?"
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1798.48,1804.088,--I think a court might be reasonably fairly skeptical of that kind of distinction.
2014.13-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.085,1843.365,I don't see why.
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1856.334,1857.161,"Well, I think--"
2014.13-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.161,1861.249,"What you say about signs I assume applies to noise as well, right?"
2014.13-502,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1881.887,1884.071,"--I don't think that would be permissible, Your Honor."
2014.13-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1907.869,1908.896,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,1913.611,1916.438,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1964.999,1967.764,You can make that argument in all kinds of contexts.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2002.546,2012.198,"I think there is a difference, Justice Alito, in signs as opposed to speech because signs do take up physical space."
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2046.981,2049.134,"So if the sign here said,"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2067.706,2068.895,That is ideological.
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2075.139,2075.966,But it says also
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2091.884,2104.674,"I believe the way that this code has been interpreted, Justice Ginsburg, is that that would not be a directional sign because it's not saying turn right, turn left, go straight a few miles."
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2117.948,2126.102,"Mr. Savrin, could I ask what the -- your justification is for these specially generous provisions on ideological signs?"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2135.254,2144.345,"Well, specifically on the ideological signs is to protect the First Amendment right of anyone to speak on any topic at any time."
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2145.643,2149.313,So you are not even purporting to have a content -- neutral justification for this.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2160.262,2162.259,"--That would not be our position, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.594,2186.798,"Well, view point discrimination is quite different from content discrimination."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2198.215,2199.073,Not just view--
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.073,2214.863,"I mean, ideological signs, that is a content category, and there is as much a First Amendment right to give somebody directions as there is to speak about -- about being green or whatever else."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2218.786,2224.191,"--Justice Scalia, we would say that the -- they perform different functions."
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.877,2229.639,"They sure do, but is there a First Amendment right for these other messages or not?"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2229.639,2244.299,"--I think they would have a right to speak, and I think that they do have that right to speak and that intermediate scrutiny applies to regulations about how speech can be communicated as opposed to what can be communicated."
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2244.299,2251.969,"But you did say in your brief that the First Amendment does not require directional signs, so they could be banned altogether."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2251.969,2258.928,"I think if it's narrowly tailored and meets the intermediate scrutiny test in a particular jurisdiction, then--"
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2258.928,2260.447,"Well, that is a lot of words."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2275.371,2288.52,"--I think that it -- well, when you say offend the First Amendment, I think you would have to apply the intermediate scrutiny analysis and our position would be that it would -- that it could survive that analysis."
2014.13-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.441,2340.252,You say on -- suppose we're talking about the context of signs.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2350.996,2352.216,--Yes.
2014.13-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.216,2359.929,First question would be: Is there some category that you don't allow to put up signs?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2456.073,2457.609,"Yes, okay."
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.507,2528.16,"And political signs are there almost all year, on the rights-of-way."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2552.243,2556.022,"I have two responses to that, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2570.969,2577.949,Does this State statute have the same size and duration?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2587.023,2588.945,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it does."
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2588.945,2593.816,So you're saying that the town ordinance just mirrors the State?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2593.816,2594.584,Yes.
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2595.63,2597.552,And do you have that State law?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2597.552,2598.925,I do.
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.437,2612.246,"So your defense to a First Amendment complaint is, what, the State made me do it?"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2612.246,2634.048,"Well, our defense -- well, in part, yes, because we need to comply with the statute, and it doesn't make sense that, as a result, all signs need to be -- meet those provisions for purposes of preserving beauty, reducing clutter, so on and so forth."
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.048,2636.282,It makes a lot of sense if you believe in the First Amendment.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2636.282,2637.562,Well--
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.562,2646.667,"If you believe that neither the State nor the city is entitled to say politics is really important, as opposed to music."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2646.667,2652.68,"--The other consideration here, Justice Scalia, is that we're talking about public property."
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.228,2700.008,You say the street is not a -- not a traditional public forum?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2700.008,2702.691,--That is the certainly Gilbert's position.
2014.13-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2728.618,2739.346,"Well, how do you justify the -- the differing treatments of Petitioner's sign, on the one hand, and the weekend builder event signs and homeowners' association signs?"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2748.092,2758.028,"The homeowners' signs are not really directional signs, because they can only be within the residential community."
2014.13-502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2775.646,2778.629,Has anyone ever been denied one of those permits?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2778.629,2782.345,"I don't know the answer to that question, Your Honor."
2014.13-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2782.345,2790.269,"Suppose the Petitioners want to put up a sign that says, we're having a church service at 10:00 o'clock on Sunday morning."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2795.214,2803.322,"They could put it up 12 hours before, so that would be 10:00 o'clock p.m., and they could take it -- and they have to take down, I believe it's an hour afterwards."
2014.13-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2803.322,2810.524,"So they can put it up after dark on Saturday and then they have to take it down within an hour after, when, the commencement of the service, or--"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2810.524,2811.594,The end of the event.
2014.13-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2811.594,2812.37,--the end of this--
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2812.37,2814.053,The end of the event.
2014.13-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2814.66,2818.642,--Do you think that really gives them an opportunity to invite people to come to their service?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2818.642,2823.469,--The purpose of these signs is not supposed to be invitational; it's supposed to be directional.
2014.13-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2861.06,2865.686,"So they could put up a, quote/unquote, ideological sign that says,"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2891.73,2904.166,"The sign could say, Your Honor, where it is taking place, but if it is intending to guide travelers to that location, then it would need to comply with -- with the provisions."
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2905.133,2906.604,What is the -- what is the guidance?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2927.391,2928.227,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2928.227,2937.438,"This is not, as you described earlier, turn left on Main Street, turn right on Front Street."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2937.438,2939.704,It is the same function as that.
2014.13-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2941.127,2943.065,"What is this about, this argument?"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2961.038,2962.224,--That is what it comes down to.
2014.13-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2962.224,2963.538,"Well, my goodness."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,2969.725,2987.874,"Well, we would say that it has -- that the sign has an -- what this Court has termed an incidental effect on the expression of the Petitioners, that certainly they can have the ideological sign, the information that they want to include--"
2014.13-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2987.874,3002.602,"Suppose we said this: That where, in fact, the argument is of this nature, where, in fact, there are -- you can have a big sign and have everything on it except an arrow, and the purpose of the sign is, in fact, to tell people both what is happening and where."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3011.817,3020.65,"--Well, Your Honor -- our response to that, Your Honor, is that the directional signs, in order to work, need to guide travelers along the route."
2014.13-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3043.633,3054.469,"Does Good News -- does the Good News church have a number of signs -- just as illustration, how many signs do they have?"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3054.469,3057.452,"--I believe the number is 15, but--"
2014.13-502,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3064.822,3068.835,Can you see that car -- when you -- can you see that sign at all when you pass--
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3068.835,3069.668,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2014.13-502,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3069.668,3072.651,--Can you see that sign at -- all when you pass in a moving car?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3072.651,3072.851,Yes.
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.649,3103.685,Whatever that is.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3105.536,3112.926,"Well, the intermediate scrutiny test, I think, is if it's narrowly tailored, and also if there are alternative modes of communication."
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3141.911,3144.536,"Just, again, if I could understand--"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3144.536,3144.551,Yes.
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3144.551,3155.564,"--let's even assume that intermediate scrutiny applies, and just focus in on this special provision for ideological speech which allows very large signs to stay up as long as possible."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3168.948,3170.838,Because directional signs--
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3170.838,3171.54,"No, no, no."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3171.54,3172.18,--I'm sorry.
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3172.18,3179.288,"I just asked you for the exemption for ideological signs, for the specially generous provision for ideological signs."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3183.395,3186.113,Because the -- to protect the First Amendment right to speak.
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3186.113,3186.79,Okay.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3197.39,3198.81,If the--
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3198.81,3204.808,You are not justifying it on the grounds of safety or on the grounds of clutter.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3211.945,3214.319,--With respect to the ideological sign?
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3214.319,3214.602,Yeah.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3214.602,3220.13,"Yeah, the purpose of that is -- is it is content-neutral in terms of anything can be on that sign."
2014.13-502,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3221.378,3223.519,So that goes back to what Justice Scalia said.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3240.278,3250.944,"--And I would agree that that's what we're arguing, Your Honor, that what we're saying is that the First Amendment is -- guards against the abridgment of speech."
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3268.998,3276.294,"Well, maybe you think that, but the guy who doesn't like politics and likes ideology doesn't think that."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3276.294,3278.213,"Well, the--"
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3278.213,3292.458,"So we're -- we're supposed to sit here and say, oh, political speech is the most valuable and you can allow that, but ideological speech comes in a close second, and then what?"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3294.786,3295.566,"--Well, I--"
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3295.566,3297.036,I don't want to do that.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3304.421,3319.212,"--Your Honor, I think for purposes of ruling in this case, I think the question is whether or not the temporary directional sign is subject to -- is content-based in a constitutional sense such that it would be subject to strict scrutiny."
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.628,3333.549,"What is content-based in a constitutional sense, as opposed to content-based in a non-constitutional sense?"
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3333.549,3341.233,"Whether it puts the finger on a scale of ideas or viewpoints, whether the substance of it -- whether--"
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.233,3343.105,"That is viewpoint-based, not content-based."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3343.105,3345.492,"--Well, whether it favors or censors--"
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3345.492,3350.494,You want to eliminate content-based as the criterion and make it viewpoint-based.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3350.494,3353.159,"--No, Your Honor, that is not what we're advocating."
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3373.735,3377.629,Is there is there a difference between the function of the sign and the content of the sign?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3377.629,3378.516,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3378.516,3379.842,I frankly can't grasp that.
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3380.637,3381.358,"Well, it depends on how--"
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3381.358,3383.448,Doesn't its function depend upon its content?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3383.448,3386.447,"--In a literal sense, yes."
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3386.447,3387.149,"Oh, I see."
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3389.135,3390.405,"Well, both--"
2014.13-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3390.405,3391.113,Poetic?
2014.13-502,2,38333,philip_w_savrin,,3391.113,3392.072,--No.
2014.13-502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.246,3427.944,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-502,3,56090,david_a_cortman,,3431.064,3434.472,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-502,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3493.342,3495.302,It's just permissive for political signs.
2014.13-502,3,56090,david_a_cortman,,3495.302,3496.009,--That's right.
2014.13-502,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3579.097,3580.23,"Thank you, counsel."
