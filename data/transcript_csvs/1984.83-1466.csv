1984.83-1466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.004,We will hear arguments next in Supreme Court of New Hampshire against Piper.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,87.689,111.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in a recent swearing in ceremony, in several, as a matter of fact, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has admonished new admittees that in the court's view New Hampshire lawyers should not just be merchants of law, but instead should be servants of justice."
1984.83-1466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,163.856,168.557,But they may be nonresidents the next day and still practice in New Hampshire?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,168.557,173.561,"We suggest not, having acted in good faith with the New Hampshire Supreme Court."
1984.83-1466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,187.221,194.875,"Suppose one has been born, and a lifelong resident of New Hampshire, at that time becomes a member of the New Hampshire bar, and the next day moves over to Vermont."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,198.01,215.638,"Yes, and that, of course... therein lies one of the great challenges of our brethren in this case, because they seem to say that because New Hampshire does not revoke licenses if someone moves away, that somehow there is something wrong with this requirement."
1984.83-1466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,279.564,284.116,What is the requirement for taking the examination in the first instance?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,288.42,289.52,"Yes, precisely."
1984.83-1466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,289.52,290.203,Either one will do?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,290.203,291.121,Either one will do.
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,310.366,311.868,They don't care what happens after?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,311.868,312.785,"--Oh, they care."
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,314.154,315.954,What do they do if you move out?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,315.954,318.189,"Well, so far they haven't done anything."
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,318.189,321.058,"Well, then you have to answer my question they don't."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,321.058,321.858,"Oh, yes--"
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,321.858,329.746,The only thing they want is for you to be a resident of New Hampshire for... how long does it take to administer the oath?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,332.346,334.631,"--Moments, Your Honor, but I don't believe--"
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,334.631,335.298,"Well, is that it?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,335.298,335.816,"--No, it is not."
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,337.716,343.487,What else can you do to somebody who takes the oath and then leaves that night?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,343.487,344.589,Excuse me?
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,344.589,345.972,That night.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,345.972,349.541,"Well, I suppose that you could chase them, if that were you--"
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,349.541,351.659,I would like something better than supposing.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,351.659,368.621,"--Let me just simply say that the New Hampshire court doesn't, and the reason it doesn't is that it has found, and I think the facts in this case demonstrate that it need not in order to accomplish what it is trying to do in requiring the requirement in the first place."
1984.83-1466,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,404.294,407.329,"Mr. Gross, I suppose states vary on this, don't they?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,407.329,407.929,"Yes, they do."
1984.83-1466,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,407.929,415.435,"As I understand, in Virginia, for instance, the Commonwealth insists that an attorney... that residency is not enough."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,420.804,430.195,"No, and I might observe, Your Honor, that New Hampshire does not go as far as some states do in requiring residence at some point prior to the admission of the oath."
1984.83-1466,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,447.621,462.666,"Suppose Mrs. Piper here, living, as she did, just across the border in Vermont, maintained or joined a law firm that had an office in New Hampshire."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,464.082,485.912,"No, that would not be sufficient, and the reason it wouldn't be sufficient is because in order to achieve the New Hampshire court's purpose of sustained physical presence in order to provide availability for these tasks that the Court wants lawyers to perform over and above basic competence and ethical conduct, the requirement of an office doesn't seem to work as well."
1984.83-1466,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,496.72,500.022,"Suppose it is in my example, it was a primary office."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,500.022,506.509,"Well, in terms of a primary office, then I guess some line drawing would have to be done about whether in fact it was a primary office."
1984.83-1466,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,511.93,512.849,Suppose it was the only place.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,527.941,536.362,"Well, obviously, if it were the only place that one practiced, then it would assure physical presence for the purpose--"
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.362,538.03,"Well, I know, but that wouldn't be enough in New Hampshire."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,538.03,544.201,"--Not to meet the New Hampshire requirement, because the New Hampshire requirements go to more than 9:00 to 5:00 practice of law."
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.201,552.49,"Does the record show anything about what the lady's intention was with respect to an office, or where she was going to practice?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,552.49,556.858,Just give me a moment.
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,557.642,561.846,"Did she apply for an exemption, or for a waiver?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,561.846,570.1,"She applied... she initially, before she applied to take the exam, inquired whether an exemption might be available."
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,575.569,576.438,Is that in the record?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,576.438,577.038,"--Yes, it is."
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.038,579.223,Do you know where it is?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,579.223,583.842,"Yes, I will get... I will focus on that in just one moment, if I may."
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.127,586.794,Thank you very much.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,586.794,590.263,She was aware of the residency requirement to begin with.
1984.83-1466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.246,626.788,"The District Court said that the respondent, Ms. Piper, resided in Lower Waterford."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,626.788,627.371,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.371,629.154,Is that right across the river from Littleton?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,629.154,634.042,I don't know whether it's across from Littleton or it's across from Lyme.
1984.83-1466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.898,646.35,"Yes, but that's about 120 or 130 miles that the river is the boundary."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,650.237,651.487,"--Oh, yes."
1984.83-1466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.422,665.08,"I notice the rules that the court construe deal with taking the bar exam, and the admission of people who have just taken the bar exam."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,678.987,680.737,"Only by examination, Your Honor."
1984.83-1466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.737,682.105,It must be by examination.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,682.105,683.439,There is no admission on motion.
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.666,765.593,Doesn't it bear on the strength of your justifications for your rule if it is clear that a lawyer who is a resident of New Hampshire can move out of the state and still practice law in New Hampshire?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,778.334,780.619,"Yes, but I want to express once again--"
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.619,781.053,Yes?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,784.687,790.541,"--Yes, it does, and I would like to demonstrate to you why in practice it supports the justifications."
1984.83-1466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.34,1005.196,"Well, you are assuming, aren't you, Mr. Gross, that the lawyers in question do business as individuals when you say that the privileges and immunities clause applies to."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1012.552,1020.639,"--I believe the citizens... the privileges and immunities clause speaks of citizens, and so anyone who is a citizen could claim it."
1984.83-1466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.639,1023.158,We have held it doesn't apply to corporations.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1023.158,1038.167,"That may be the Fourteenth Amendment, but in any event, in New Hampshire, while we may practice as professional corporations, in respect to our duties to the court, we are always individuals, and we are held responsible as individuals to the court."
1984.83-1466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.783,1072.506,"Well, I think the argument is quite the contrary, that if they practice in the corporate form, they cannot get any benefit from the privileges and immunities clause which they now are urging to somehow insulate themselves."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1072.506,1074.875,"Yes, and I understand and accept that."
1984.83-1466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1123.189,1127.76,"Mr. Gross, do you think Bradwell versus Illinois is still good law?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1127.76,1133.747,I don't want to discard it.
1984.83-1466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1152.959,1161.164,"Well, do you think that Bradwell's holding that a state can exclude women from the practice of law without violating the privileges and immunities clause is still good law?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1161.164,1182.645,"Without violating... I don't think it is good law to say that a state court could exclude women from the practice of law for any reason, and to put the privileges and immunities clause in there, I guess, would raise some technicality with me about what the privileges and immunities clause is designed to do."
1984.83-1466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.268,1199.273,"Where do you think the privileges and immunities clause is found, I mean, what amendment?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1199.273,1206.427,"The privileges and immunities clause, in Article 4, Section 2 of the Constitution."
1984.83-1466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1230.828,1238.814,"Mr. Gross, I am just wondering if your argument would... I notice in your opponent's brief there are 269 members of your bar that have offices out of state."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1251.824,1257.562,"Well, therein lies another problem with a more restrictive rule, if Your Honor pleases."
1984.83-1466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.562,1259.495,I am not suggesting it would be a better rule.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1262.43,1266.584,"And I am addressing that, because I am concerned about limitations on the right to travel."
1984.83-1466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.672,1275.688,"No, I am not saying if you leave."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1288.98,1295.067,"--I think they might do that, but I don't believe that that would accomplish the objectives that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has in mind."
1984.83-1466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.067,1297.168,But you would think they would have constitutional power to do that?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1316.415,1323.403,"Well, you see, I don't believe that ties in with what the New Hampshire Supreme Court is trying to do."
1984.83-1466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.021,1328.49,All the reasons that you have explained would seem to me to support such a rule.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1328.49,1334.543,"--Well, one of the difficulties I have had is that I haven't been able to outline those specific reasons."
1984.83-1466,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.934,1350.303,"Right, and my rule would serve those same functions."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1350.303,1354.457,"--Yes, I do, and I think probably it would be more restrictive than the rule we have."
1984.83-1466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1479.521,1485.758,What if a lawyer from Alexandria wants to come up in practice in your state?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1489.543,1491.495,In order to be admitted?
1984.83-1466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1491.495,1492.145,Yes.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1492.145,1505.588,"Character and fitness, for openers, pass the bar examination, which consists of the Multistate Bar Examination and an essay examination, pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination, and show the residence requirement."
1984.83-1466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1505.588,1509.207,What if the lawyer has practiced for 20 years in Virginia?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1509.857,1512.592,There is no admission on motion in New Hampshire.
1984.83-1466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1512.592,1513.109,--No admission on reciprocity.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1513.109,1517.646,And we share that with several and I believe a growing number of states.
1984.83-1466,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1525.533,1542.511,"Mr. Gross, before you do that, and with reference to your last argument, do you think that In Re Griffiths, where the Court rejected the kind of argument you are making on behalf of lawyers, is relevant?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1542.511,1562.092,"--I don't believe the case is relevant, and I think it is not because I don't think that the case rejected an argument like the one I am making, because I think in Griffiths what the Court said is that alienage doesn't make any difference for bar admission under any circumstances, and we say that... we are not arguing with that."
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1576.065,1578.784,"Mr. Gross, just one thing before you sit down."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1590.909,1602.633,"--Your Honor, they are not available on a sustained basis to carry out the additional duties that the New Hampshire Supreme Court expects of them, and they are not there on a sustained basis to--"
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1602.633,1604.299,How does that hurt the state?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1607.851,1621.678,"--Well, it hurts the state in the New Hampshire Supreme Court's view, Your Honor, because the court believes that the administration of justice in the state is improved by activity by lawyers above and beyond their everyday practice of law."
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1621.678,1625.312,How will this one case affect that?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1625.312,1630.45,One case of a person moving in and practicing?
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1634.585,1635.937,Would 100 be de minimis?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1635.937,1637.587,Excuse me?
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1637.587,1639.306,Would 100 be de minimis?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1639.306,1640.789,Not in New Hampshire.
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1640.789,1642.508,What harm would it do?
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1642.508,1653.066,It would simply make it more difficult for the court to expect all New Hampshire lawyers to conduct themselves in the way that the court wants them to with respect to community activity.
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1653.066,1657.268,"Well, some of these New Hampshire lawyers have moved to... they don't have any interest in that, do they?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1657.268,1661.57,"And they are probably not practicing law in New Hampshire any more either, and so--"
1984.83-1466,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1661.57,1662.555,That's what I'm saying.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1662.555,1667.139,"--If they move away, then they are not New Hampshire lawyers any more."
1984.83-1466,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1679.383,1688.739,"You must, Mr. Gross, you must have attorneys admitted to the New Hampshire bar that go to Boston and come up and try cases in New Hampshire."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1688.739,1692.691,I am sure there are some of those.
1984.83-1466,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1692.691,1693.991,But you are not concerned with that.
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1693.991,1695.709,"Well, the court--"
1984.83-1466,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1695.709,1697.428,"This is the weak spot in your case, if there is any."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1697.428,1708.033,"--Yes, I have to say it is, and I have to say that my response to the point that it is a weak spot is that what we have is working very well with a minimal degree of restriction."
1984.83-1466,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1731.066,1732.868,"I suppose that is true of any state, really."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1732.868,1736.636,"--Well, it may be, but I think it is a matter of record in this case, Your Honor."
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.636,1761.601,"Mr. Gross, is there any record of waivers for people who say, I live across the border, I want to commute into New Hampshire and practice law, and I have a job with a law firm, I want a waiver, and if you will give it to me, I will take the bar, and go to work in New Hampshire?"
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1764.803,1772.143,"I can represent to the Court that there are no such waivers, that the treatment that Mrs. Piper was accorded by the court in this case is 100 percent."
1984.83-1466,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.143,1777.713,"Right, well, and so you feel the rule is that rigid, that it just doesn't make any difference."
1984.83-1466,0,35938,martin_i_gross,,1777.713,1781.599,"Well, rather than use the word ""rigid"", I would say applied uniformly."
1984.83-1466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1784.284,1788.604,Mr. Meyer.
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,1788.604,1825.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is our position under the standards of review developed by this Court under the privileges and immunities clause of Article 4 that it is incumbent upon New Hampshire to establish that out of state attorneys admitted to the New Hampshire bar would be the peculiar source of a substantial problem relating to legal practice, and furthermore, that the particular terms of the New Hampshire residency requirement are closely related to remedying the problem stated."
1984.83-1466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1825.46,1835.633,What provision of the Constitution do you rely on to say that the burden is on the state of New Hampshire rather than on the person in the position of your client?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,1835.633,1878.995,"Your Honor, I think under... although I don't think the Court's jurisprudence is that clear in allocating the burden of proof, it is my understanding of Hicklin and Toomer and the other cases interpreting the privileges and immunities clause in Article 4, and it is that we rely upon rather than the same clause in the Fourteenth Amendment, that once the applicant establishes that the measure is discriminatory against out of staters, and this measure is discriminatory on its face, that the burden then shifts to the state to establish, as Hicklin put it, that the out of staters are the peculiar source of a substantial problem, and that the particular measure is closely related to remedying the problem stated."
1984.83-1466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1878.995,1883.547,Do you think Camden changed that test somewhat?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,1883.547,1888.601,"Your Honor, I think that Camden is significant because it restated the case."
1984.83-1466,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1953.893,1957.011,"Mr. Meyer, before you get into that, may I ask you this question?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,1965.434,1982.728,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct, and I want to clearly distinguish the challenge raised in this case from the challenge, for example, raised in the case of Leis v. Flynt, where the lawyer in fact coming from out of state said he had a right under due process to practice without meeting the requirements of the state."
1984.83-1466,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1996.47,2003.142,One of those standards may be that the bar examination of your state must be passed.
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2003.142,2004.142,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2004.142,2022.537,"I thought your friend told us that in order to take the examination in the first place, the applicant must represent that they intend to make a residence in New Hampshire and practice law there, and that without that they are not even permitted to take the examination."
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2023.087,2024.805,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct."
1984.83-1466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2025.921,2029.523,That isn't quite and fully consistent with your earlier response.
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2033.244,2038.815,"--Your Honor, we don't think... yes, I would like to clarify our position."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.222,2062.995,"Well, do you think the state of New Hampshire can require you to come physically to Concord and take the bar examination, or do you think you can have it sent to you in Los Angeles?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2062.995,2067.713,"--No, Your Honor, we think the state of New Hampshire can require you to come to Concord to take the bar exam."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2068.815,2073.367,So they would be requiring you to reside in Concord at least for the day that you are in Concord?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2073.367,2081.889,"--Your Honor, the difference, and my client had no objection to actually going to New Hampshire to take the bar exam."
1984.83-1466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2112.694,2114.394,Mr.... Go ahead.
1984.83-1466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.394,2129.703,But your position is also that this rule is unconstitutional even if the applicant wants to have her principal office in Vermont.
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2129.703,2139.161,"--Yes, Your Honor, but I think an office requirement would be... I mean, that is a different... again, the constitutionality of that requirement is a different question."
1984.83-1466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.161,2150.017,"Well, would you be satisfied if we ruled in your favor to the extent that at least where the intention is to commute into New Hampshire to your principal legal office?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2150.017,2155.171,"Your Honor, I think satisfaction with that response would be an overstatement."
1984.83-1466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.288,2159.122,"Well, but how about satisfying your client?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2159.122,2159.741,"--Well, Your Honor, my client--"
1984.83-1466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.741,2161.691,"It may not satisfy your organization, but it may--"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2161.691,2164.207,"--Your Honor, I did want to make that distinction."
1984.83-1466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.52,2185.389,"--I see it, on Page 41, 42?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2185.389,2188.591,"--No, it is contained on Pages 12 to 14 of the Appendix."
1984.83-1466,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.316,2202.699,Yes.
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2202.699,2208.57,So that is the only information that I am aware of in the record with respect to her intention after admission.
1984.83-1466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2210.422,2221.662,"Mr. Meyer, in looking at the privileges and immunities clause issue, do we have to look at the threat posed by the whole class rather than as to the particular individual?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2221.662,2222.578,"--Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.639,2293.174,"Out of how many, Mr. Meyer?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2293.174,2298.042,"--Out of, in 1980, it was 1,987... in 1982."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2329.978,2333.465,"Mr. Meyer, let me go back just a moment to a statement you made."
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2342.504,2355.129,"Your Honor, the only information contained in the record is what I cited before, her statement to the Supreme Court that she had a possible job offer in Littleton, that she wanted to practice in New Hampshire to avoid conflicts with her husband, practicing in Vermont."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2425.373,2438.033,"Isn't your opponent's position basically that the requirement is working the way it is, that if you have 269 out of 1,900 living out of state, the great majority of those are not attempting to practice in New Hampshire?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2438.033,2440.699,"Your Honor, our response to that is, Number One, that he doesn't know--"
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.699,2442.568,Do you know?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2442.568,2448.389,"--No, because no statistics, no count has ever been made as to where New Hampshire attorneys live."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2448.389,2451.941,Then was this a proper case for the District Court to render summary judgment on?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2451.941,2459.696,"Your Honor, I think it was a proper case, because I think that the District Court had to rely on the information presented to it."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.283,2469.652,But your opponent argues the system as it is now is working.
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2480.793,2501.023,"--But, Your Honor, it was not necessary for the District Court to reach that issue, because even if the New Hampshire residency requirement has been successful in ensuring that most New Hampshire attorneys live in New Hampshire, we don't think that that is an adequate justification."
1984.83-1466,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2539.648,2546.818,"Mr. Meyer, on that particular question, what if the lawyer lives in Chicago, or San Francisco, or New Orleans?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2557.943,2569.251,"Your Honor, assuming that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has a right to make involuntary appointments, I do not believe that the court should be limited by the geographical location of the individual."
1984.83-1466,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2583.51,2587.812,Do you think as a practical matter they could perform those obligations?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2589.581,2592.616,"Your Honor, I think it depends not so much on where they live."
1984.83-1466,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2619.95,2622.068,It does impose a burden on the court.
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2639.847,2647.453,"Your Honor, I think that goes another justification asserted by New Hampshire, and that is availability for court appearances and for disciplinary hearings."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.943,2665.145,I wonder if that is an entirely satisfactory answer.
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2688.139,2688.408,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.408,2703.066,"Well, if this client is represented by the El Fideldo attorneys in Los Angeles, it is just going to mean several days, isn't it, before they can have a hearing, whereas if they were represented by somebody in Manchester or Concord it, could be tomorrow."
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2703.066,2714.975,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that the phone system... I mean, communication is obviously possible on an immediate basis in any event, but I don't think that an attorney can say to the court, you have to hold off the hearing because it is going to take us three days to get to New Hampshire."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.283,2740.591,"What about... I can hear the other side of the argument perhaps from you if you were representing the opposing party, saying that, look, I was in Los Angeles, but I am a member of the New Hampshire bar."
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2760.254,2761.67,"Well, Your Honor, two responses."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.863,2789.405,"Yes, but your answer to Justice O'Connor's question a while ago, the rule has to apply to everybody, and it can certainly address evils that aren't present in every single case or every single application."
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2789.405,2802.997,"--Your Honor, it is conceivable certainly that somebody from California would join the New Hampshire bar, but we don't think that that person, because he resides in California, can use that fact as an excuse for not being available for court appearances."
1984.83-1466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2823.994,2835.886,"Mr. Meyer, do you think that a state bar requirement that the person either live in the state or in an area immediately adjacent to it would survive scrutiny?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2835.886,2843.972,"Your Honor, I think that that is more defensible than the New Hampshire rule, but I do not think that that would survive--"
1984.83-1466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2843.972,2845.241,But would it survive scrutiny?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2845.241,2846.274,"--I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1984.83-1466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2858.465,2869.523,What about a state requirement charging out of state residents more tuition to go to a state university than in-state residents?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2889.27,2895.857,"Your Honor, it is my interpretation of Martinez v. Bynam that that sort of requirement would survive, and I think there is an important difference."
1984.83-1466,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2895.857,2896.023,Why?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2896.023,2917.02,"Because that involves a state's use of its own very scarce financial resources, and I think the state has a... and what this Court has seen to be a compelling interest in providing that residents who through their own tax expenditures help fund this public university have first shot at attendance there."
1984.83-1466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.315,2936.665,May I ask you a question about the record?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2949.889,2951.139,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1984.83-1466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.072,2958.393,"Is there anything in the record to provide a basis for the dissent's comment, or is that just speculation based on judicial notice?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2958.393,2963.697,"Your Honor, there is nothing in the record, and I want to make it clear that we are not relying upon discriminatory intent, and we don't think we have to."
1984.83-1466,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.354,2981.324,I am still not quite clear how you answered my question.
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,2982.208,2983.693,"No, Your Honor, there is nothing in the record."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3095.783,3110.191,"I suppose if a claim were made to them, whether they saw it as an undue imposition or not, if they felt that the result required was required by a decision of this Court, they would be obligated to reach that conclusion, whether they were happy with it or not."
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,3110.191,3134.908,"Yes, Your Honor, but they have not taken the position New Hampshire has, that simply imposing... that the New Hampshire... that the state... the federal... New Hampshire's position is in fact that the federal standard shouldn't apply, and the state courts that have looked at this, and I am referring to Massachusetts, New Jersey... New York, West Virginia, and Alaska, have all said that this Court's standards in Hicklin should apply, even in the area of state regulation of the bar."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3194.297,3198.815,"Mr. Meyer, you practice where, in Manchester?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,3198.815,3199.517,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.517,3205.088,How do attorneys in Manchester first find out about decisions of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,3205.088,3207.821,"Your Honor, they are generally sent to us by mail."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.821,3209.373,Advance sheets?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,3209.373,3210.073,Yes.
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3210.073,3211.659,"What, seven or eight months later?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,3211.659,3212.959,"Well, Your Honor, there are two services."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3217.978,3223.882,Do you also read about them often for the first time in the Manchester newspaper?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,3223.882,3228.351,"Well, Your Honor, I think in Manchester it is very difficult to rely upon what you read in the newspapers."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3230.886,3232.755,How about Concord?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,3232.755,3246.998,"Your Honor, there are frequently accounts of decisions in the New Hampshire newspapers, but I don't think that they are a reliable or necessary means of getting that information, and that if you as an attorney feel--"
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3246.998,3248.215,"They would be helpful, though, wouldn't they?"
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,3248.215,3254.502,"--Well, not, Your Honor, if you decide to subscribe to the more advanced slip sheet service."
1984.83-1466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3257.038,3261.507,Do you have any idea what percentage of the attorneys in New Hampshire subscribe to the slip sheet service?
1984.83-1466,1,31947,jon_meyer,,3261.507,3262.757,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
1984.83-1466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3362.29,3363.39,Very well.
1984.83-1466,2,35938,martin_i_gross,,3365.242,3366.275,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3367.708,3368.741,"Very well, the case is submitted."
