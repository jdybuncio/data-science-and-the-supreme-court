1991.90-1972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.148,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1972, United States v. John H. Williams, Jr.--"
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,11.369,14.522,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.129,174.444,"Well, Mr.... General Starr, do you take the position that never would it be appropriate for a Federal district court judge, as a matter of exercise of supervisory power over the courts, to dismiss without prejudice a case in which there is a glaring failure of the Government to present some evidence to the grand jury that would have a direct bearing on whether the suspect is indeed appropriately charged?"
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,174.444,176.457,Our position is no.
1991.90-1972,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.718,207.877,"Now, if the prosecutor offered known false testimony to the grand jury, do you think the court then can, in the exercise and supervisory power, dismiss?"
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,207.877,209.259,--I think it can.
1991.90-1972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,232.814,240.778,"What is your authority, Mr. Starr, for answering Justice O'Connor's question that the use of perjurious would warrant the dismissal of the indictment?"
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,240.778,245.681,--There is no authority in this Court that directly holds that.
1991.90-1972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.681,246.743,Then why does the Government concede that?
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,246.743,266.344,"The Government has no quarrel, Mr. Chief Justice, with the holdings of a number of lower Federal courts that have concluded that the integrity of the grand jury would be compromised if the prosecutor knowingly uses material... I would insert the word material... perjurious testimony."
1991.90-1972,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.389,279.975,And so that would be open to try... that would be open to a contested hearing as to whether the prosecutor did in fact use perjurious testimony?
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,279.975,283.815,"It has been, and the system has not suffered as a result of that."
1991.90-1972,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,302.699,316.818,"But just before we leave this point where you admit or concede, I think, but there is some room for court intervention if there is flagrant misconduct, use of perjurious testimony."
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,333.13,334.379,Certainly not the latter.
1991.90-1972,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.204,403.305,A befouled nest is not a grand jury hearing?
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,405.545,429.641,"I use that to make the point that courts have been concerned about the integrity of the grand jury's function that is compromised in terms of the independence of the grand jury's judgement, if that judgment has been influenced materially by evidence that is perjurious or manufactured."
1991.90-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.285,442.37,"Have the lower courts that have got into this, as you've suggested they have, do they rely on the supervisory power?"
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,442.37,448.114,"--They typically don't lay this out, Justice White, carefully."
1991.90-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.712,467.026,They don't say that it's connected with the requirement of having a grand jury indict.
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,467.026,490.721,"It has been suggested by authorities like Learned Hand and Henry Friendly that in fact you are getting at the core notion of what the founders had in mind, which is a grand jury whose integrity and independence is respected by the prosecutor, and the prosecutor fails to accord it that respect if it's using perjurious testimony."
1991.90-1972,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,494.785,502.418,"Well, no... no one in this... does anyone in this case suggest that there's a constitutional basis for--"
1991.90-1972,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,502.418,503.41,No.
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1315.394,1321.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.145,1388.132,"Well, in the preceding years, Mr. Lang, have people tried to enforce the Government's obligation by motions to dismiss?"
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1388.132,1405.003,"No, Your Honor, but I'm addressing again the argument or position that was made by counsel relative to the difficulty that would be incurred in the Government determining what was exculpatory and presenting it to the grand jury."
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.003,1423.366,"I think I understand that, but I thought another part of counsel's argument, which there's no need for you to address unless you want to, is that this rule would generate a number of... contested motions to dismiss in the district court, which do not exist simply with the departmental policy in place."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1423.366,1424.448,Yes.
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.032,1498.296,"Do the statistics reflect how many such contested hearings there were, as well as how many resulted in dismissal?"
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1498.296,1510.985,"I believe in a reply brief it refers to over 200,000 indictments... 204,000 indictments as opposed to the 10 cases that ultimately ended in that manner."
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1510.985,1520.502,Does it refer to the number of those cases in which there were hearings on a motion to dismiss which the Government... in which the defendant did not prevail?
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1520.502,1526.786,"No, Your Honor, because again that would not be a statistic gathered by the Government."
1991.90-1972,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.025,1683.577,"Mr. Lang, what do you mean, presented to the grand jury?"
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1699.177,1702.7,"Well, Your Honor, I appreciate that point, because actually--"
1991.90-1972,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.7,1706.832,"Well, it's one of the difficulties in evaluating what you're asking courts to evaluate all the time."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1708.494,1709.135,--That's correct.
1991.90-1972,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.135,1710.694,Depending on what your answer is.
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1712.357,1732.379,"Assuming the rule... assuming the rule, obviously in certain complex criminal situations... to take that one or several steps further... when you bring in the 50 boxes, to have a meaningful rule, there has to be a meaningful ability to understand."
1991.90-1972,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.379,1745.637,So the Government has to go through those boxes and the court's going to have to evaluate the quality of the Government's investigation and presentation of the consequences of that to the grand jury.
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1745.637,1749.59,"In this case, Your Honor, confining it to this case, the--"
1991.90-1972,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.59,1751.621,"No, I'm concerned about a general rule."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1765.362,1772.865,"--In order for it to be meaningful, Your Honor, and for there to be a meaningful rule, it would be our position that it would have to be a meaningful submission."
1991.90-1972,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1772.865,1774.267,And I think that's probably right.
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1775.988,1791.408,"Now, in this particular case, of course we have the luxury of the 5 volumes, which could very well have been read by the grand jury, as opposed to the 40 boxes, which fully explain the particular aspects of the balance sheet."
1991.90-1972,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.292,1862.455,"You're not just saying once it finds; you're saying after it finds, as it is obliged to do."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1866.208,1875.595,"Well, the rule would in our view, Your Honor, be confined to a situation of evidence in the possession of the Government."
1991.90-1972,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.134,1880.405,"No, but the Government has the 50 boxes."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1890.874,1911.706,"--If in the course of the investigation, and it had the 50 boxes in its possession, which were accumulated in the course of the investigation, it again would have the duty to go through the boxes, to find the... or the present the evidence in a circumstance."
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.534,1939.415,Mr.--
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1939.415,1940.867,Yes.
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1940.867,1966.944,"--Mr. Lang, why should the rule with respect to exculpatory evidence, which is involved in this case, be any different than the rule with respect to hearsay evidence, which the Court said in the Costello case was not a ground for objecting to a grand jury indictment, or to evidence improperly seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, which in Calandra, the Court said was not a basis for objecting to a grand jury indictment?"
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,1972.126,1992.372,"That line of cases support the notion that the grand jury should have before it all possible evidence, even though it be inadmissible, even though it be seized in some manner that wouldn't be... where it... wouldn't be allowed in the trial of the case."
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.247,2010.461,They also enforce the notion that the courts are not there to supervise the detailed operations of the grand jury.
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2010.461,2022.53,"That is correct, Your Honor, but again, assuming there are circumstances that create the supervisory duty of the courts under the Nova Scotia test."
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2022.53,2030.367,"Yes, but in Nova Scotia, we were talking about a very specific part of rule 6 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, as I recall it."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2035.54,2056.422,"Your Honor, Nova Scotia considered not only the rule 6(e) and 6(d) violations, but also considered conduct before the grand jury, such as the prosecutor yelling at a witness in the presence of a grand juror and also the prosecutor improperly summarizing some evidence."
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.056,2074.855,But were any of them outside of these... some sort of specific provision of law governing the operation of either the grand jury or some other part of the Government?
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2078.447,2078.587,No.
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2106.405,2111.929,"Yes, but before you get to the prejudice question, you need to find a violation of some obligation."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2114.71,2136.514,"--I understand that, Your Honor, but again, assuming that the violation in this case would emanate from the same source as the consideration in Nova Scotia, then you would have the violation for the purpose of the prejudice problem... the sources that I mentioned as far as that consideration."
1991.90-1972,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.514,2139.226,"Well, that's a rather substantial assumption."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2139.226,2142.028,"Your Honor, I might mention--"
1991.90-1972,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2142.028,2148.793,"Suppose, counsel, that in the case that we were discussing with Justice Scalia a few minutes ago."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2167.964,2178.643,"--Well, in this particular case, of course, under the Court's... hypothetical case, the documents would be before the grand jury."
1991.90-1972,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2180.033,2182.885,"Well, what I'm asking is suppose the grand jury doesn't do its job."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2193.142,2209.272,"--Well, the grand... again, the grand... assuming the grand jury felt that they had heard enough, I don't know what the prosecutor could do in terms of doing more than giving it to them."
1991.90-1972,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2209.272,2222.622,What my question is designed to elicit is whether... a discussion of whether or not there is a standard to which the grand jury must be held or a standard to which the prosecution must be held.
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2222.622,2225.072,"Well, and that's very correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1972,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2249.6,2258.264,"But so far as the defendant is concerned, if there's a defalcation, it's equally harmful in either case."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2258.264,2263.517,Equally harmful whether the grand jury doesn't accept the--
1991.90-1972,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.517,2268.56,"Whether the grand jury is remiss on its own, or whether the prosecution is remiss."
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2271.833,2273.645,--That is correct.
1991.90-1972,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2307.516,2322.487,"Well, Mr. Lang, what is the source of the rule that you would have the courts follow, the rule that would require a Federal court to review this and impose some sanction?"
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2330.631,2332.704,"Supervisory power, Your Honor."
1991.90-1972,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2332.704,2337.256,"Did the Tenth Circuit make clear that was what it was relying on, do you think?"
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2337.256,2338.596,I believe the Tenth Circuit did.
1991.90-1972,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2360.671,2364.034,And is that what you think the district court relied on?
1991.90-1972,1,31486,james_c_lang,,2364.034,2367.885,"Yes, Your Honor, and that is part of the opinion of the district court."
1991.90-1972,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3014.86,3016.984,"Yes, it was."
1991.90-1972,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.644,3216.572,"Well, are you suggesting that it be all right to have a rule, a supervisory rule, that just tracks your manual?"
1991.90-1972,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3216.572,3217.343,--I am not.
1991.90-1972,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.699,3241.88,"Suppose there's a motion to dismiss the indictment, and the allegation is that the Government had in its... had in its possession information that it knew would necessarily bar an indictment."
1991.90-1972,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3271.809,3274.66,"Well, he has power to do something about it, but he should not dismiss the indictment."
1991.90-1972,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.325,3283.565,"Well, there's flagrant misconduct."
1991.90-1972,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3286.907,3293.552,"But again, what is being urged here is a rule that goes against what is a pathological case."
1991.90-1972,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3304.559,3313.486,"Well, that may be true, but there may be a valid narrow... much narrower rule than the Tenth Circuit."
1991.90-1972,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3313.486,3317.539,But there are also narrower remedies than dismissal of the indictment.
1991.90-1972,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3372.543,3375.245,"General Starr, has the statute run in this case?"
1991.90-1972,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3379.058,3388.525,This prosecution can go forward because this case still lives and the statute is tolled while this issue is being litigated.
1991.90-1972,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3409.409,3411.372,"Thank you, General Starr."
