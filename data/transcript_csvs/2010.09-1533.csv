2010.09-1533,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.449,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1533, DePierre v. United States."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,8.229,11.149,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1533,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,79.858,86.573,"Mr. Pincus, if -- if I understand your interpretation correctly, it would exclude freebase."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,105.47,116.997,"Let me answer -- answer your question with a little bit of detail, Justice Kagan, because I think our reply brief wasn't as clear as it might have been, because the word ""freebase"" has, really, three different meanings."
2010.09-1533,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,221.344,228.448,"Mr. Pincus, if the -- the substance that is involved in this case was a rock-like substance and it wasn't a powder."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,239.788,243.271,"Well, I think there would be a factual question in this case."
2010.09-1533,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,264.98,276.006,Correct me if am I wrong about this -- I may have a misimpression -- but I thought you were objecting to a charge to the jury that charged cocaine base and didn't charge crack.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,276.006,296.297,"--We're -- we're objecting to the -- the fact that the district judge charged the jury and himself determined that in order for this very severe 100-to-1 penalty to apply, it was not necessary for the substance to qualify as crack cocaine."
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,299.654,306.401,"If we agree with you, how should a judge instruct a jury to determine whether a substance is crack?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,310.026,314.741,"A judge could use the definition in the sentencing guidelines, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,318.644,319.084,But in those--
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,319.084,322.676,"In those cases, we think there are three -- there are three elements."
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,346.682,348.117,--It has to have all three of those characteristics?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,348.117,349.353,--All three of those characteristics.
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,349.353,355.818,"But I thought you just said that freebase would qualify, and freebase would not have the second of those characteristics; isn't that right?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,358.77,364.659,"It would, because ammonia is one of the -- is one of -- it's ammonia and ether that have -- that are used to prepare freebase."
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,364.659,364.893,So if it had any base?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,364.893,365.579,Any base.
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.961,382.913,I don't understand that.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,416.542,424.712,"Well, respectfully, Justice Scalia, I think that Congress was focused on crack."
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,424.712,424.961,Crack.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,424.961,428.568,Because it -- because it was a substance that had particular characteristics.
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.568,428.849,That's right.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,430.85,435.83,"Well, we do -- we do want the meaning to be a substance with those particular characteristics."
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.578,446.748,It's essential to crack.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,446.748,448.39,Well--
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.39,450.496,"You wouldn't call it crack if it weren't made that way, would you?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,450.496,455.838,"--Well, I think in 1986, the definitions were not that clear."
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.431,502.788,"How does ""cocaine base"" suggest what you want?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,515.017,518.249,"--Well, I think in -- in three ways, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.041,569.667,All of them or just crack?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,569.667,572.585,"It was -- ""freebase"" was a word."
2010.09-1533,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,598.543,601.542,"Counsel, the provision refers to"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,622.896,634.751,"Yes, Your Honor, and we think the reason that Congress used that phrase was often in this reactive process at the end of the day the rock will not be pure cocaine in a rock form."
2010.09-1533,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,641.839,652.083,"It's kind of an odd way for Congress -- it's an odd way for Congress to phrase the provision if what they want to get at is crack, to say what we want to get at is substance which contained crack."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,680.713,684.399,"--Respectfully, I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1533,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,740.969,744.685,You kind of elided the point there in your verbal formulation.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,757.76,768.44,"I may be missing your point, Your Honor, but I think even cocaine in a crack form has other -- the rock that Congress was trying to get at has other things in it."
2010.09-1533,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,768.44,774.925,"And you're saying Congress is afraid that the sodium bicarbonate, we might not be able to get at that if we just say crack?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,774.925,805.833,"No, that the defendant, that the defendant would say this -- if it doesn't, if it didn't say a mixture which contains, if it said cocaine base, then the argument might well be, you have to -- you have to distill the substance to find out how much cocaine base is actually in it, as opposed to how much of it actually is cocaine in a rock form, as opposed to other things have been mixed in, instead of, as this Court decided in Chapman, it's the whole package that one weighs."
2010.09-1533,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,826.778,827.262,Counsel--
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,827.262,836.305,"Other than crack and free base, are there other forms of cocaine base that are actually in use in any substantial amounts in this country by drug users?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,836.305,841.366,"Well, I think we don't know, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,855.466,859.467,"Are there actually people in the United States who are smoking coca, coca paste?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,863.48,869.01,"They may not be smoking it, Your Honor, but they may be bringing it into the country in that form and then converting it into--"
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,869.01,871.01,Are you aware of cases where that's happened?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,871.01,883.52,"--There are -- the case that we point to regarding the cocaine that was intermingled in luggage and in the fiberglass of a flowerpot are both cases where it was not cocaine hydrochloride, it was cocaine."
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,894.671,919.91,"To go back to your definition of crack, just so I'm clear on it, if a substance -- in the second prong of your definition, if a substance is tested and chemically it is pure [C17H21NO4,] no trace of sodium bicarbonate, no trace of ammonium, is it possible for a defendant to be convicted and given the crack penalty?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,919.91,921.317,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,931.28,931.639,That's right.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,942.133,949.944,It is that it was prepared by processing sodium hydrochloride with a base or with baking soda or similar reactant.
2010.09-1533,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,949.944,953.409,"That means prepared from the powder, in theory--"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,953.409,953.955,Prepared from--
2010.09-1533,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,953.955,954.33,--is that right?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,954.33,954.782,"--cocaine powder, yes."
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,954.782,959.423,So you need extrinsic evidence about how this particular substance was prepared in order to satisfy it?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,965.187,983.522,"Your Honor, the courts have not required -- the courts applying the sentencing guidelines have said that a chemist can testify based on his knowledge, and they've found the sentencing guidelines satisfied, that in his professional opinion that's how this substance was prepared."
2010.09-1533,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,983.522,989.769,"Would it be enough for you if it had the right chemical definition and it was a rock-like substance, just those two things?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,998.531,1020.665,"I think that the element of the sentencing guidelines which we're picking up in our second element, Your Honor, is useful in making clear that this is a substance that was -- went from cocaine hydrochloride back to cocaine base, because I think that's one of the--"
2010.09-1533,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1020.665,1032.204,"I'm asking the same kind of question that Justice Alito is asking, whether the government has to show anything particular to demonstrate that it was prepared from powder cocaine."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1032.204,1038.859,--I think that the government doesn't have to produce -- doesn't have to make a physical showing.
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.098,1065.377,"Mr. Pincus, you've lost me."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1099.256,1102.692,"I may have misspoken in my response to the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.548,1111.0,Yes.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1111.0,1127.508,"--somehow meant that Congress was getting at the chemical, all chemical forms of cocaine because -- because that formulation was more sympathetic than thinking that it required a rock-like substance."
2010.09-1533,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1154.605,1155.014,--Counsel--
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1155.014,1174.551,"I think the question here is -- I'm sorry, Your Honor -- is the converse of that question, which is: But if it is 100 percent cocaine in its chemical form in a rock-like state, is that covered too, and I'm just trying to say: Yes, that's certainly covered, too, but so is the dirtier form of a rock that has other things mixed in."
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1174.551,1175.928,What if it's pulverized?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1182.892,1184.047,I think--
2010.09-1533,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1184.047,1185.532,--and smoke it after it's in that form?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1185.532,1195.401,"--Your Honor, I think our view -- that's one of the reasons that we would say rock-like or a solid that is otherwise smokeable, to deal with people saying: Oh, if it doesn't have to be a rock I'll pulverize it."
2010.09-1533,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1203.54,1210.723,--Can you get cocaine into a rock form without using a base?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1220.737,1222.453,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1222.453,1226.22,"And coca paste, what can you do with coca paste?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1236.074,1242.242,Coca paste is -- is the intermediate step for all downline products.
2010.09-1533,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1278.055,1283.944,"You mentioned leaves several times, and you talked about that in your -- in your brief."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1299.597,1301.797,"I -- I don't think they would, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1331.003,1333.956,Does that depend on the age of the leaf or if it's been in the sun or is--
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1333.956,1338.065,"--No, I think it's just -- you know, different leaves have different characteristics."
2010.09-1533,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1351.227,1352.198,"--No, no, no, no."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1352.198,1352.9,--Yes.
2010.09-1533,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.9,1355.447,I thought that the chemists said that it's always a salt.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1356.71,1356.991,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1356.991,1362.021,"--I thought that was the government's position, that it's a salt."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1362.021,1364.474,"That is the government's position, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1365.784,1367.286,"But you ended by saying oh, sometimes it's a salt."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1367.286,1385.995,"--Our position is that within the leaf, there is both -- there -- both forms coexist in -- in the natural state; that there is both the salt form and the form that is chemically cocaine, and the studies that we cite on pages 9 and 10 and in the footnotes on that page I think were very clear."
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.709,1405.142,As a practical matter what difference does it make?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1409.767,1412.407,"--They say they're not, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.715,1421.184,I don't think Congress knew what this chemical debate was all about.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1422.946,1423.653,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.653,1427.541,Let's assume that the government's right and -- or that you're right.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1436.537,1437.286,--We say it's both.
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.286,1439.205,"You say it's both, but it includes base."
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1439.205,1439.485,Yes.
2010.09-1533,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.238,1440.894,And let's assume you're right.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1441.096,1454.776,"--I think then that would mean that the -- the -- under the government's interpretation of the statute, offenses involving leaves, as long as there were more than 50 grams of them, would fall within clause III, and that doesn't make any sense."
2010.09-1533,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1454.776,1461.447,But you just said it's an academic issue because there's not a market for leaves or for paste.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1480.953,1485.59,"Well, Your Honor, we would like to go back to the judge, because in this case in fact the chemist didn't testify."
2010.09-1533,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1495.9,1499.242,It was -- it was -- the testimony was it was a rock-like substance.
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1507.22,1517.063,"The testimony was there was no -- there was no baking soda found, and that there was a -- that it was chemically basic."
2010.09-1533,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1534.869,1536.397,"The -- the district judge would be the finder, right?"
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1536.397,1538.116,The district judge would be the finder.
2010.09-1533,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1538.6,1540.066,Because you have no Apprendi problem?
2010.09-1533,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1540.066,1540.409,Yes.
2010.09-1533,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1542.534,1543.646,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1556.483,1558.733,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1533,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1574.023,1578.567,"I'm sorry, cocaine paste -- coca paste is smokeable in its paste form?"
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1578.567,1583.643,"--Yes, it is smokeable in its paste form, and that evidence was before Congress."
2010.09-1533,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1584.989,1585.503,All right.
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1616.646,1620.331,"Well, of course we don't think that that's right as a scientific matter."
2010.09-1533,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1633.621,1644.676,So you're representing that you will never prosecute someone who possesses coca leaves under subdivision (iii)?
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1644.676,1652.249,"--The Romanette provision, Romanette (iii), which would be the sentencing enhancement, we have never applied in any case to coca leaves."
2010.09-1533,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1655.217,1656.952,And you're representing to the Court that you won't?
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1656.952,1658.762,--We don't have a chemist who would testify that.
2010.09-1533,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1695.947,1696.793,"It's a bizarre term, Ms. Saharsky."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1712.458,1719.707,"It is an extra clear, extra precise way to think -- to speak about it, and we think that there's a good reason that Congress did that."
2010.09-1533,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1755.765,1764.73,"It's a strange way to be extra clear, to -- to use a different phrase that's meant to mean the same thing as another phrase."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1770.197,1772.79,"--Well, it's really just adding the extra word ""base""."
2010.09-1533,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1813.197,1819.709,"So why did it draft it to say ""cocaine salts, et cetera"", as opposed to"
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1834.406,1837.358,"--Yes, I think that it does that, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1860.615,1861.099,But why would it do that?
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1870.641,1871.737,"Well, it--"
2010.09-1533,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1871.737,1872.283,Couldn't--
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1872.283,1873.936,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1873.936,1877.731,"--it say ""cocaine and its isomers"" or something?"
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1888.662,1901.295,"The base form has to be somewhere in Romanette (ii), because the way that Congress drafted these two provisions together is that a large amount of substances are listed in Romanette (ii) and then a subset is pulled out in Romanette (iii)."
2010.09-1533,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1923.18,1932.644,"No, but you could have -- in Romanette (iii), they could have said 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base, period."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1945.995,1953.147,"I think that there is a redundancy, but I think it is understandable in light of the fact the courts had used the word ""cocaine"" somewhat imprecisely."
2010.09-1533,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1972.891,1980.031,"What is in (ii) now, on your reading, your expansive definition of ""cocaine base""?"
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1984.245,1993.866,"Well, there is, in Roman (I), coca leaves, except those from which all of the active substances have been taken out."
2010.09-1533,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2017.748,2021.84,What about optical and geometric isomers of cocaine?
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2030.603,2032.178,Yes.
2010.09-1533,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2073.315,2080.953,"They're all very exotic, but practically, what does the government prosecute under Romanette (ii)?"
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2084.28,2090.62,"I would say cocaine hydrochloride would be the primary one, which would be powder cocaine."
2010.09-1533,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2090.62,2091.322,--Yes.
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2099.522,2107.724,"Well, the things that would be under (iii) would be any form of cocaine base: That would be coca paste, freebase, crack, whatever you want to call it."
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2130.322,2139.848,It's my understanding here that -- that the problem in this case -- tell me if I'm wrong -- is because cocaine can become -- can be a salt.
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2161.495,2162.154,--Yes.
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.154,2164.478,And so that's why they have a higher punishment.
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2230.079,2231.265,Yes.
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.06,2240.745,"No, I don't care how it was made."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2270.341,2273.98,"--With -- with all respect, Your Honor, I--"
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.98,2274.276,"Certainly they could, right?"
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2274.276,2275.119,--I just -- I don't think it's that easy.
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.119,2276.211,"No, that's what I want to know."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2276.211,2276.947,Okay.
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2284.989,2285.285,We got that part.
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2285.551,2288.112,They're not going to start making guesses about how it was processed.
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2289.13,2289.458,That's fine.
2010.09-1533,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2289.458,2290.986,"But they don't need to do that, Ms. Saharsky."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2301.405,2302.341,--Fine.
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.473,2326.191,Can you make it in--
2010.09-1533,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.191,2328.847,I would assume that your major objection would not be that.
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2342.717,2345.435,"That is exactly how I should have started, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2345.965,2368.535,"But this is -- but this is, Ms. Saharsky, just a strange statute, where you are -- your definition creates all kinds of issues about why it is that Congress used two different phrases to mean the same thing, and then how it is that if they did use two different phrases to mean the same thing, you're effectively reading cocaine out of the statute in Romanette (ii), right?"
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2368.535,2369.331,No.
2010.09-1533,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2384.652,2387.089,"Well, but no, cocaine is the same as cocaine base."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2397.988,2400.504,"That is how Congress wrote the statute, though."
2010.09-1533,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2404.411,2410.908,But why would it say apples cost one dollar in Romanette (ii) if it was going to say apples cost three dollars in Romanette (iii)?
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2410.908,2421.683,"Because these definitions in Romanette (ii) preexisted in other parts of the Controlled Substances Act, in the definitions section in 802, in the definitions of controlled substances in Section 812."
2010.09-1533,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.508,2431.711,Is it--
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2431.711,2433.474,--And then it pulled out one thing for special treatment.
2010.09-1533,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.474,2446.296,--Is it not relatively common statutory drafting to include something in an earlier section which is also included in a later section that imposes a higher penalty?
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2484.032,2492.776,"Yes, you are 100 percent correct, and I think that the statutory language makes that clear because it says it has to be a mixture of substances described in clause (ii)."
2010.09-1533,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2492.776,2497.602,"Then, Ms. Saharsky, you do get the problem that Justice Breyer was trying to avoid."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2510.471,2514.066,I don't think that there is evidence that paste is less addictive than powder.
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.508,2551.61,"--But you define it in your brief, and this is very interesting to me -- you talk about it being a yellow substance that came directly from grinding up leaves, something like that."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2594.579,2595.92,--It--
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2595.92,2596.595,Or if--
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2596.595,2597.484,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.484,2597.874,--Go ahead.
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2597.874,2606.075,"It is the case that the paste, just like the freebase and the crack, can be smoked, and for that reason is seen as more addictive than the powder."
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2606.075,2626.988,"So now if I want to find a citation for the authority that paste, yellow, made out of leaves is in fact more dangerous and Congress could have thought that than -- more dangerous than ordinary salt sniffed, I will read what?"
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2629.003,2633.219,You would read our brief pages 30 to 33--
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2633.219,2634.124,"Well, what you've referred to, in other words."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2640.812,2641.202,--Right.
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2649.274,2650.51,What page is that of the brief?
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2651.648,2652.179,"--No, that's okay."
2010.09-1533,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2659.474,2660.114,"Okay, I'll read that."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2660.566,2667.659,"And one I -- the point I really wanted to make is that, you know, once the court says it has to be pasty, or it has to be yellow, you know, any of those things can be changed."
2010.09-1533,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2794.561,2824.158,"Well, my understanding of how coke -- how the paste is produced is the following: You start with the leaves; then people vigorously macerate the leaves by stomping on them for an hour or more; and then this mixture is -- this -- what's left is mixed with an alkaline material such as sodium bicarbonate, an organic solvent, such as kerosene, and water; and what you end up with is a gummy, yellowish solid called coca paste; is that -- that's correct?"
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2824.158,2825.718,"Yes, that's true."
2010.09-1533,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2835.011,2835.592,Yes.
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2856.006,2860.501,"Well, they all -- any of those would have impurities that are not cocaine base."
2010.09-1533,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2869.825,2877.789,So a DEA chemist could test -- could test a substance and say this is coca paste of the type that is smoked in South America by some people.
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,2889.846,2891.02,"I think it really depends, Your Honor."
2010.09-1533,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3031.689,3042.562,"Ms. Saharsky, coming back to Romanette (iii), you have 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause 2."
2010.09-1533,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3049.059,3050.853,"Yes, it could be pure."
2010.09-1533,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.309,3120.822,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-1533,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3122.916,3124.214,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1533,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.939,3161.306,"Yes, but she says there's no way -- and she does cite this professor from Yale and so forth, who says if the stuff has the base in it, it can be abused in ways that if it has the salt in it, it can't be abused."
2010.09-1533,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3163.229,3164.852,"But Your Honor, I--"
2010.09-1533,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3164.852,3165.884,That's her point.
2010.09-1533,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3167.975,3168.679,--I think that is her point.
2010.09-1533,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3196.98,3197.934,She says there is a reason.
2010.09-1533,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3207.382,3211.13,Our response is that it is -- it does not have the potency that crack had.
2010.09-1533,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3308.31,3309.605,It's the same with homicide and murder.
2010.09-1533,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3311.964,3319.821,"--Yes, but the question here is whether every homicide -- whether every lesser form of homicide is also capital murder."
2010.09-1533,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3348.498,3368.862,"Let's assume for the sake of a hypothetical that the statute was the same but that things were reversed; that the smaller universe of items was the salt rather than the crack, and so they put an enhancement in Roman numeral number (III) for salt rather than crack."
2010.09-1533,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3389.119,3391.307,--That particular argument would still apply.
2010.09-1533,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3406.052,3407.113,"Thank you, Counsel."
