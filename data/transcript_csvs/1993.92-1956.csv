1993.92-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.59,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-1956, Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall and Carlisle."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,14.93,17.973,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.907,183.41,"So, you think the duty to guard against emotional injury is a more limited one than the duty imposed by the Act to guard against physical injury?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,183.41,184.872,"Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1993.92-1956,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.744,252.697,"Well, is it possible, though, that the common law can change over time, and that a duty could evolve, and that perhaps the Act is broad enough to encompass those changing notions?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,259.613,262.124,"--Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, that's correct."
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,337.392,343.896,"Well, certainly these... these particular plaintiffs present rather appealing cases, don't they?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,343.896,353.352,"--I think that the facts, Justice Blackmun, are compelling, particularly, let's say, in the Gottshall case."
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,367.372,369.542,"Well, courts always dramatize facts, I suppose."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,369.542,382.391,"--In... in... in reaching to recov... to permit Mr. Gottshall to recover, they have established a rule of law that has a pernicious potential application in other cases."
1993.92-1956,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,409.469,414.512,"Well, under... under your zone of danger test, is there a triable issue of fact in Gottshall?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,414.512,419.066,"I do not believe there is, Justice Kennedy."
1993.92-1956,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.611,458.825,"If he had been rushing to help the victim and broken his arm, I assume that he would have been covered because of the rescue doctrine?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,458.825,461.644,Interesting question.
1993.92-1956,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,477.045,484.791,"Well, if... if the stress were related to his rescue activities, then it seems to me the same result might follow."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,484.791,501.971,"If his stress was related... the difficulty I have, Your Honor, is that we have to... I think it's appropriate... important to have a legal analysis that really can be applied by the courts in these claims."
1993.92-1956,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.705,569.557,"Mr. Wellington, in describing the standard for the Third Circuit, whether it's correct or not, I'm not clear on whether you are taking the position that the FELA is frozen in a certain time or whether this statute, which uses the words ""injury"", uses the word ""negligence"", whether this is a charter to the courts to use the same kind of dynamic interpretation in developing common law concepts so that, with respect to this Act, the Federal courts would be in the same position that State courts are, and State courts, over time, have changed the common law with respect to emotional distress."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,575.57,582.064,"--Your Honor, they are within the same position, but only within the confines of what Congress intended within the original statute."
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.383,604.488,"Well, was the original intent of Congress anything, or anything more definite at least, than the removal of certain defenses, so as to open up this kind of litigation?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,618.146,627.045,"--What we... what we need to look to, Justice Souter, is what the common law of negligence was at the time Congress enacted it."
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.144,637.55,"Well, you're saying that's what we need to look to, but my question was, what is there, either in the statute or... or in legislative history, that you can specifically point to that requires us to do that?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,637.55,643.335,--I bel... it requires us to... to not include emotional injuries.
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,643.335,646.957,Requires us to... to foreswear originality.
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,646.957,651.689,"I do not believe the Court needs to foreswear originality, and we're not arguing that, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,668.331,672.513,"Well, that, in effect, it seems to me, you're saying the Third Circuit was guilty of some originality."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,684.061,686.311,"It is not just the common law limit, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,700.663,704.683,"Well, what if... what if the Federal courts look at it and say the... the State courts are too timid?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,704.683,706.225,--Then--
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.225,708.247,That's... that's depending on the common law experience.
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,713.129,717.573,"--We are also constrained, I believe, Your Honor, by looking at the statute itself, though."
1993.92-1956,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.248,775.911,"Then we're going back to the question then that I asked, and I think you're giving a different answer now."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,851.649,857.185,"Your Honor, what I am saying... or... and our position is that both of those things are true."
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,940.78,947.074,"Well, Mr. Wellington, I take it... I'm going back to the facts of these cases... I take it you're not disputing the facts of these cases?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,957.111,961.583,"--I don't believe, Your Honor, that Mr. Gottshall was disciplined for that."
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,969.709,970.299,Well--
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,970.299,970.81,I do not--
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,970.81,976.044,--Is there a difference between criticism and reprimand by a supervisor?
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,976.044,979.095,"--Let us assume that there is not, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,984.138,985.21,I know what the legal question is.
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,988.441,992.334,"For purposes of these arguments, Your Honor, we concede these facts... we do, indeed."
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1040.174,1041.445,"Well, how would they be otherwise?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1041.445,1047.079,"--The... Mr. Gottshall's facts, Your Honor, were on a summary judgment basis, and I'm assuming--"
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1047.079,1048.401,"Yes, I'm speaking of the other one, though."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1048.401,1049.762,--Mr. Carlisle?
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1049.762,1050.262,Yes.
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1050.262,1051.634,"They are as they are in the record, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1051.634,1052.393,Okay.
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1055.084,1065.272,"With the facts that we have before the Court, Mr. Gottshall does not, under any common law analysis, state a recoverable claim."
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1074.417,1079.15,"May I go back to a question Justice Kennedy asked you earlier, and just change the facts slightly."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1083.253,1087.086,"Your Honor, no."
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1087.086,1092.3,"Does the... does the zone of danger, then, have to be created by an independent third party--"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1092.3,1093.361,The zone of danger--
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1093.361,1094.421,--Independent of the employer?
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1094.421,1103.597,"--The zone of danger, under common law analysis, is the immediate threat of a physical impact... an impact of immediate threat of a physical impact."
1993.92-1956,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1103.597,1113.455,"So, it's... it's simply... the answer is it cannot result from a... an existing condition of the employee without the impingement of some external force?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1113.455,1150.978,"Yes, it cannot result from a working condition, whether that working condition be heat, cold, heavy lifting, work, stress, because the result is, if the plaintiff is permitted to recover, not because he's been injured by that condition, but because he's... he's uncomfortable or afraid or concerned about working in that condition, you now open up as potential plaintiffs under the standard anyone who encounters a working condition... a supervisor, a strenuous activity, hours... they become damage plaintiffs under the FELA even before they've had an injury."
1993.92-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1155.313,1160.084,"Mr. Wellington, why do you... why do you pick that as the criterion?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1200.74,1203.993,"There are three... three answers, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.375,1255.998,"So, you say that test does apply, or it doesn't?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1255.998,1261.091,"--I believe it's... it's a thresh... I believe it's an element of a plaintiff's proof, even under a zone of danger test, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1262.473,1264.644,But the plaintiffs met it here?
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1264.644,1268.638,"--Yes, Your Honor, they both had physical manifestations."
1993.92-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.857,1277.504,"Do... do they get recovery for the physical manifestations only, or do they get recovery for the emotional--"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1277.504,1280.492,--They get recovery for the physical manifestations if they meet--
1993.92-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.492,1281.453,"--No, I understand."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1288.93,1291.01,--If... if they were... had a cognizable cause of action.
1993.92-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.621,1298.274,"Yes; well, why not give them recovery only for the physical manifestations, for the physical injury that they've suffered?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1298.274,1301.276,--If--
1993.92-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.276,1304.489,Even if that physical injury is caused indirectly--
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1304.489,1305.3,--By... by an emotional harm?
1993.92-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.3,1308.512,--By an immediate emotional injury which produces a physical injury?
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1308.512,1309.912,It... it's the same--
1993.92-1956,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.912,1311.644,What's wrong with... with doing that?
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1311.644,1334.198,"--What's wrong with doing that is I think the same problem we have with the decisions, is that you open up people who have not in fact been physically injured... and the way the statute was originally intended to apply... to... to saying I, nonetheless, because I'm upset with my supervisor, I can't sleep and I've lost 10 pounds; I have a damage claim for that."
1993.92-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1337.28,1337.741,Well--
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1337.741,1338.692,"--Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1338.692,1350.121,"--Well, when you're calculating damages, the damages are awarded for the physical manifestations really, are they not; not for the... what is claimed to be the underlying emotional upset?"
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1350.121,1351.942,"Not on these claims, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1388.827,1405.039,"There's a different test than perhaps as what is floating around here... that is, if you have a physical... if there's a physical impact, then you can recover for both emotional and other kinds of injuries, but that the impact has to be physical."
1993.92-1956,0,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,1410.732,1415.434,"Your Honor, what you've described is a basic negligence action, where someone is hurt."
1993.92-1956,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.361,1470.713,"Very well, Mr. Wellington."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1472.342,1479.419,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.824,1520.695,Why is that?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1553.067,1570.059,"The... this Court found in Kernan, for example, Kernan v. American Dredging, that Congress itself did not want the FELA to be limited to the specific types of injuries or the specific class of employees--"
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.059,1570.8,Is that in the statute?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1570.8,1572.12,--That's not in the statute.
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.348,1603.39,But you say that some injuries are covered today which clearly were not covered when it was passed?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1605.603,1616.028,"Not that it has acquired a different meaning, but that some specific injuries are covered today, and have been for many years, that are different from the types of injuries Congress was thinking about."
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.028,1617.14,Is that different from what I said?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1624.223,1626.026,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1633.51,1637.945,"So, it was covered when it was passed, Congress just didn't know it, is that it, and the courts didn't know it?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1637.945,1640.435,"--Essentially, Your Honor, yes."
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.323,1678.961,"I guess we can have different notions of causality today, too, right, that... or are we free to fiddle with that, as to what... how proximate the causality has to be?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1681.793,1690.167,"--I don't think that we can... we can say... that the courts can say, as common law courts, that causation is no longer required, but the--"
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.167,1692.959,"No, we can change what causation means."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1692.959,1703.017,"--I think that the Court could find causation in situations where previously, because, for example, of the lack of medical expertise, the courts were ill-equipped to draw causation."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1751.086,1758.062,"Well, Mr. Myers, we reserve the question of whether the FELA covered emotional injury in the Buell case, did we not?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1758.062,1759.825,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.825,1765.438,"So, it's... it's something that obviously this Court feels is... is undecided."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1765.438,1766.748,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1799.92,1814.258,"Mr. Myers, regardless of how the Court comes out on this, is there a State cause of action in addition, in a State which would recognize an emotional injury negligence claim?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1814.258,1815.049,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.846,1832.661,Even if... even if it's determined that the FELA just doesn't cover it?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1832.661,1837.714,--To say that the FELA... yes... the answer is yes.
1993.92-1956,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.07,1848.801,Have we said as much?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1848.801,1862.21,"I believe you said as much in the loss of consortium case, and I don't remember the name of it, where it was held that... that a wife could not bring a State cause of action for loss of consortium where she had no cause of action under the FELA."
1993.92-1956,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1868.765,1881.525,"So, to that extent, the FELA was not dynamic, if the FELA is limited to the... to the injury to the worker, and doesn't cover derivative injuries, the spouse's?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1881.525,1882.756,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1911.685,1924.174,"Although I suppose it's sufficiently dynamic... I'm just looking at the statute... it contains the word ""widow"", and husband, I suppose, it would be interpreted to be ""widower"" and wife of, today?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1924.174,1925.653,"--Yes, I... I would think so, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.653,1928.565,"Mr. Myers, does the dynamism work both ways?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1940.252,1941.644,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.644,1942.914,"So, it's kind of a ratchet?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1942.914,1945.946,"Moves one way, yes."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1947.118,1949.458,How can we... how can we tell that from the... from the language of the stature?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1949.458,1951.181,"Well, from the language--"
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.181,1952.34,"Yes, from the language."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1952.34,1963.009,"--Well, the language is... clearly states that any employee injured while he is employed by the railroad has a cause of action so long as the railroad is negligent."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.009,1971.905,"Yes, but supposing the common law definition of negligence constricts over a period of years, so that what was once thought to be negligent is no longer negligent?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,1971.905,1983.312,"The FELA has been... what this Court has stated is that the FELA, as a Federal statute, is not bound by State notions of common law."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.507,1997.033,"Well, then, if that is true, even though, let's suppose that the State concepts expand, the Federal courts would be free to contract."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2000.725,2011.522,"They're not bound by it, Your Honor, but I think, in that situation, the remedial purpose of the Act would warrant that the Federal courts expand with... with the expansion of State common law."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.522,2012.353,I don't understand that.
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2013.742,2017.505,"Well, you start with the premise that the statute is a remedial statute."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.505,2018.266,"Well, what... what does that mean?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2026.562,2033.167,It's meant to be remedial in the sense that it is meant to provide recovery for injured railroad workers.
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.167,2033.608,"Well, certainly."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2036.907,2043.412,"Well, the... the language of the statute itself, I think, is not... is not the answer to the question."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.412,2044.523,Then where do we look?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2044.523,2049.786,"I think we should look to this Court's prior decisions, in Kernan v. American Dredging--"
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.786,2053.76,And where... where did the Court in the Kernan case derive its interpretation?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2055.61,2064.896,"--Yes, it did look at the statute, and it found in the statute no basis to exclude certain causes of action and to include certain other causes of action."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.935,2081.547,And how do we tell what Congress intended again... from looking at the language?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2081.547,2083.188,Not just from looking at the language--
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.188,2085.349,From looking at committee reports?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2085.349,2088.471,"--Yes, Your Honor, the committee reports--"
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.471,2092.514,Do the committee reports indicate that a broad range of relief was intended?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2092.514,2096.697,--I'm not... I'm not familiar with the details of the committee report.
1993.92-1956,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2116.46,2119.051,"How about negligence, that's a limitation?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2119.051,2121.383,"Negligence is a limitation, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.546,2143.889,"Like he had a nagging supervisor, that would do it, right?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2149.492,2150.451,That would not be enough.
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.451,2151.022,It wouldn't be enough?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2151.022,2155.276,"It would not be enough, because it would not satisfy the requirement of negligence."
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.303,2168.364,"Well, a reasonable employer wouldn't... wouldn't have... wouldn't leave in place a supervisor who is always nagging people."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2168.364,2170.537,I think quite the contrary.
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.537,2171.436,Who is too tough.
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2171.436,2172.717,"I think quite the contrary, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.069,2174.899,You wouldn't argue that to a jury?
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2176.181,2182.535,"--Your Honor, I think that in any working situation, we're going to expect, and a jury is going to expect, there will be unpleasantness."
1993.92-1956,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2187.478,2190.599,"But, basically, that level is one for the jury to assess?"
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2190.599,2195.281,"That one is for the jury to assess, exactly, based on a case-by... a case-by-case basis."
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.281,2206.889,"But what... you know, even if we are developing a common law rule, we are not, like other common law courts, developing a common law rule for the totality of tort."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2210.992,2211.773,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.773,2216.157,"It's an area in which you have distinctive types of employers, distinctive types of employees."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2241.592,2245.806,"I think that Your Honor's point is... is well taken, in light of the previous question."
1993.92-1956,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2267.491,2273.604,"Is there an analog to that in the Jones Act, because, after all, we do want to keep the... the substantive rules consistent."
1993.92-1956,1,45597,william_l_myers_jr,,2286.324,2294.051,"Your Honor, I do not know if there is an analog statute that covers Jones Act employees, so I cannot answer the question directly."
1993.92-1956,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.191,2327.603,"Thank you, Mr. Myers."
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2331.334,2338.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1956,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2392.125,2398.787,"To the extent that there is a common law point of reference, isn't it American common law that Congress was presumably interested in?"
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2398.787,2401.95,"--Yes, Your Honor, I believe that is correct."
1993.92-1956,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2412.128,2418.963,"Well, common law is not... to use... it's not the brooding omnipresence, it's the law of a bunch of specific States, isn't it?"
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2418.963,2419.394,--Absolutely.
1993.92-1956,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.136,2501.38,"That's a Workmen's Compensation case, but why should it be a negligence case?"
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2501.38,2506.443,"--Good question, because that brings me over to Justice O'Connor, who I think asked a question, isn't there another remedy here?"
1993.92-1956,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.873,2540.075,I was going to ask that question.
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2552.755,2553.823,"--Judge, I... I believe I've cited--"
1993.92-1956,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.823,2554.474,Under Workmen's Comp.
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2554.474,2567.664,"--Goyden v.... I forget the defendant's name... a New Jersey case, which essentially holds that if in fact the emotional injury is causally related to an essential aspect of that employee's work, that emotional injury is fully compensable."
1993.92-1956,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2567.664,2573.227,"But in all... in all events, counsel, Workmen's Compensation statutes are not based on negligence."
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2577.919,2578.89,That's why--
1993.92-1956,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2578.89,2589.177,--If what you are saying is that this statute must somehow be construed so that negligence in this statute is parallel to Workmen's Compensation standards for recovery in the States.
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2589.177,2593.691,"--Judge... Justice, let me please comment on that."
1993.92-1956,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.787,2709.038,"We... we trust all of that, but... but why isn't... you're arguing to us policy questions... whether there is too much risk of... of runaway awards, whether the employer is going to be excessively burdened in trying to keep a happy work place."
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2723.996,2752.767,"--If I might return to the initial discussion that I had about the Dulieu case, Judge, I... Justice, I believe that it was in fact a duty that existed at common law that, at the time of the Spade v. Lynn and Massachusetts decision, there were these concerns about the administration... that is, fraudulent claims and unforeseeable liability or... excuse me... potential liability... caused the court to adopt certain crutches that in fact were really examples of meritorious cases."
1993.92-1956,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.613,2782.226,I don't think that... I... I think that injury just used to mean physical injury.
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2803.8,2805.152,--Let me... let me make a point under the Restatement.
1993.92-1956,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2850.543,2858.56,"Mr. Farrell, before you go on to the other point, isn't it the case that your opponents on the other side are not asking us to read out the entire class of injuries."
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2875.92,2876.999,--Let me address that--
1993.92-1956,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2876.999,2886.797,"And... and if... if it is not read... I guess the question should be, if it is not read totally out of the statute, then how, even on your premise, can we say that we, in effect, are defying the intention of Congress?"
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2886.797,2895.876,"--Your Honor, the problem with zone of danger tests... and I think it was a question that... that Justice Kennedy asked... is that it is so fortuitous."
1993.92-1956,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2897.485,2900.779,"Well, maybe... maybe it's a bad test, but that wasn't my question."
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,2914.967,2916.359,--I don't believe that we can.
1993.92-1956,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3188.848,3190.198,"Thank you, Mr. Farrell."
1993.92-1956,2,30241,j_michael_farrell,,3191.019,3191.42,Thank you very much.
1993.92-1956,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3191.42,3193.76,"Mr. Wellington, you have four minutes remaining."
1993.92-1956,3,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,3193.76,3194.801,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.168,3268.53,"Mr. Wellington, can I ask about the language of the statute."
1993.92-1956,3,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,3273.282,3274.454,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.454,3277.923,But your position is there was no negligence within the meaning of the statute?
1993.92-1956,3,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,3277.923,3278.444,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.444,3281.106,Because there was no violation of a particular duty to these two employees?
1993.92-1956,3,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,3281.106,3281.817,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1956,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.817,3282.498,"Yes, I want to be sure."
1993.92-1956,3,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,3300.67,3308.475,"We... we believe the duty, under the FELA, is to avoid physical impact or reasonable threat of a physical impact--"
1993.92-1956,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3308.475,3314.059,I'm talking about what they... they are arguing that there is a... a duty for the employer to use due care.
1993.92-1956,3,40787,ralph_g_wellington,,3314.059,3330.6,"--Due care, yes, that's... and even under a Worker's Compensation analysis that was brought up, that... people are able to recover for Worker's Compensation claims in different standards in different States, but, essentially, if there's abnormal stress and they can show it's related to the work place."
1993.92-1956,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3346.131,3348.084,"Thank you, Mr. Wellington."
