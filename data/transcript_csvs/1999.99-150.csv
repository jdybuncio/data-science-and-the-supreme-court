1999.99-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.565,"We'll hear argument next in No. 99-150, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.--"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,22.666,26.591,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.44,107.536,"Now, there were rather lengthy instructions given to the jury in this case."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,149.268,150.851,"Well, Justice O'Connor--"
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.851,151.554,--let it stand.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,151.554,160.478,"--In... in this case, we, Wal-Mart, contended from day one that the trade dress was not inherently distinctive."
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.447,171.307,"Right, but you submitted that question to the jury, and the jury, for whatever reason, has come back thinking it was inherently distinct."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,171.307,171.673,The case--
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.673,172.608,"I mean, that's how it--"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,172.608,174.007,--The case was submitted to the jury--
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.007,174.82,--came out.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,174.82,178.332,--under instructions that we suggest do not properly state the law.
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.332,179.339,Well--
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,179.339,181.18,They... they were instruction on Abercrombie--
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,181.18,182.75,--But you didn't preserve any objection on that.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,187.048,196.948,"--As this Court held in the Preponik case, Justice O'Connor, a rule 50 challenge to a judgment is tantamount to a challenge to the instructions."
1999.99-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.69,220.283,"Well, now, are you suggesting that if you simply challenge a judgment under rule 50, even though you made no objections to the instructions, that brings about a change... that brings about a challenge to each instruction?"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,220.283,221.798,"No, I wouldn't go that far, Your Honor."
1999.99-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.798,222.5,"Well, then what do you mean?"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,222.5,230.788,"In this case the legal landscape of the protectability of trade dress, particularly in product configuration, has been shifting since Two Pesos."
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.795,253.073,"Well, it just... it's hard to know how to define inherently distinctive."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,260.327,274.461,"Well, we submit, Justice O'Connor, that on closer inspection of the statute, that Congress has given us the answer to that, that Congress has said for product configuration trade dress, the old-fashioned rule works best."
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.364,294.416,Where... where did Congress say that we had to find that secondary--
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,294.416,307.07,"--In 1946, Congress adopted section 23(c) of the Lanham Act, which lists, among a whole litany of possible marks, configuration of goods."
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.534,321.68,"--Mr. Coston, before you get into that, I'm not completely clear on... on this first question about the instructions below."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,340.595,341.837,"--That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.837,343.572,--regardless of your... you're not complaining about the instructions.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,347.341,348.954,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.954,358.907,"So, we not only have to agree with you about the standard, but we also have to agree that if we apply that standard, no reasonable jury could have come out finding your... your client liable."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,358.907,361.922,Or... or it should be remanded to the Second Circuit for that evaluation.
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.797,411.164,"Well, this Court in that Two Pesos case basically said that we don't apply to a trade dress claim a general requirement of secondary meaning."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,428.68,428.845,Yes.
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,466.432,466.887,"Well, why should it always?"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,482.424,488.434,"I submit, Justice Breyer, that... that unless it had bristles, it wouldn't be--"
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,488.434,489.153,It does.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,490.983,491.139,--Right.
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,491.701,502.773,"The point is why couldn't you... since we said you could in Two Pesos, why isn't Two Pesos basically right that it may require something special and rather unusual, but not impossible?"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,502.773,511.616,--The... the grape brush I submit says nothing to the consumer about source.
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,511.616,513.341,"Oh, yes, it does after a while."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,513.341,514.244,After a while.
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,514.244,514.759,"I mean, sure... no, no, no."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,519.863,521.01,"Well, I... I agree--"
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,521.01,522.284,--It was like the--
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,522.284,532.418,"--that after a while the market would acknowledge that the grape hairbrush came from a certain company, but that's the point of secondary meaning, that it has to show to the consumer--"
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,532.418,534.45,--It's a whole line.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,543.671,555.847,"--Well, without fighting the hypothetical, my assumption would be that there would be some packaging that would accompany it and probably a brand name that no one would launch a new product without any other indicia of source."
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,555.847,559.651,I'm really saying I don't... I don't see why we have to... why should we overrule Two Pesos?
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,570.951,577.31,I think... I think the lower courts and certainly all trademark advocates are asking this Court to clarify Two Pesos.
1999.99-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,588.14,605.256,"--that you're making that we should... we should confine Two Pesos to the packaging and... trade dress, as I understand it, covers both the... the package that the product comes in and the product itself."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,612.509,613.852,"That is correct, Justice Ginsberg."
1999.99-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,613.852,621.215,But Two Pesos doesn't seem to make a distinction between the packaging and the product.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,625.379,628.585,Different courts have interpreted Two Pesos in different ways.
1999.99-150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,657.438,663.822,"Well, is the qualification that you're asking to confine Two Pesos to packaging cases as opposed to product cases?"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,663.822,667.717,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, to non-product configuration trade dress."
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,667.717,668.537,But it's very--
1999.99-150,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,668.537,668.968,--You say that no--
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,668.968,678.169,"--it's very difficult, frankly, to know whether it's product packaging or product configuration in many cases."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,680.202,683.053,"In the restaurant, I submit it was a... it was a package."
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,683.053,688.987,"Well, it's not all that clear, and I think there are many cases where it wouldn't be clear."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,695.171,695.438,I--
1999.99-150,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,695.438,696.715,--in knowing which is which.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,696.715,706.29,"--I agree, Justice O'Connor, there are cases at the margin when you're not sure if it's a package or a product, but in that case you look at how it's being presented to the consumer."
1999.99-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.624,737.684,"Well, but another way of avoiding the difficulty is to say don't try to separate them, that trade dress... that trade... the product and trade dress go the same way--"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,737.684,738.394,And--
1999.99-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,738.394,740.353,--and that Two Pesos would regulate both.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,740.353,745.637,"--And, Mr. Chief Justice, our alternative argument does just that, as do most of the amicus briefs."
1999.99-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,778.743,780.807,Is that consistent with Two Pesos?
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,780.807,784.483,"--I believe it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.467,826.514,"Mr.... Mr. Coston, whether I'm willing to accept your first argument, which is that configuration can never qualify as trade dress or... or your second one, which is... would apply a starchier test for configuration, depends for me largely upon whether aesthetics on a product, the shape of a product is pleasing, whether that is functionality or not."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,839.372,840.969,"--You are correct, Justice Scalia, that--"
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.969,842.334,--Do you think it's functional or not?
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,842.334,850.101,--I... I think in this case... and we argued that the... the appearance of this good was merely aesthetically pleasing.
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.196,862.086,"Well, you see, I see a big difference between let's... you know, kids like to... like to have brand name basketball shoes."
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,903.46,904.959,"Well, I agree completely with you, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.959,915.634,"--I... it seems to me that if... if beauty is... is functional, then you should get a design patent for it and... and protect... protect your right to that particular beautiful thing, but only for what?"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,916.826,918.57,For 14 years on a design patent.
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.57,918.721,Right.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,918.721,921.26,"Just a couple of observations, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.484,975.164,"Color is functional, and I think... color is functionality, which I think Qualitex came pretty close to saying, doesn't it?"
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,975.164,975.819,Yes.
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,975.819,977.486,Then... then shape would be too.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,977.486,978.741,I agree.
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,978.741,980.44,"I mean, there's no basis for a distinction there."
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.923,987.888,--Shape is not necessarily functional.
1999.99-150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.583,990.36,"--No, no, no, no."
1999.99-150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.616,995.373,--It may be if... if its purpose is aesthetic as opposed to the lump on the toe.
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,997.34,998.248,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-150,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,998.248,1004.809,But isn't... do we then have the same difficulty that we have with the difference between product and packaging?
1999.99-150,0,44197,william_d_coston,,1051.49,1053.044,"I think not, Justice Souter."
1999.99-150,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1078.061,1079.056,"Very well, Mr. Coston."
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1081.284,1091.844,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.725,1183.114,Right.
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1186.148,1186.851,Not at all.
1999.99-150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1186.851,1187.361,--or that we should--
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1187.361,1197.738,What I was trying to lead up to is that that is the utility... the utility that has been found in applying the so-called Seabrook approach.
1999.99-150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1229.838,1233.511,"--I'm not sure that I know how it would apply in this very case, however."
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1238.831,1239.778,This is--
1999.99-150,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1239.778,1242.373,I... I look at that thing and it looks pretty amorphous to me.
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1242.373,1246.172,--This is a very difficult case for that purpose.
1999.99-150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1277.269,1282.861,"Well, I take it you think that a properly instructed jury could rule for Samara in this case?"
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1282.861,1303.621,"--Well, what... what we suggest is that there is a responsibility on the courts to determine whether applying the Seabrook factors to the evidence that was before the jury, there is a basis for a finding--"
1999.99-150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1303.621,1305.364,"Well, I know it's the responsibility of the courts."
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1305.364,1305.528,--a reasonable basis.
1999.99-150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1306.088,1307.3,But I want to know your... your answer.
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1315.114,1321.635,"Well, we haven't taken a position on that in the case--"
1999.99-150,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1321.635,1322.007,You haven't taken a position.
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1345.786,1368.319,"--Well, I... what... what we learned from the Patent Office in looking at this is that it would be difficult for them to conclude, in a registration process, that there was anything inherently distinctive about the individual garments that were at issue here."
1999.99-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.078,1412.8,What about the aesthetically pleasing element?
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1421.729,1423.157,I--
1999.99-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.157,1427.501,"If... if that is a functional element, this case is over, isn't it?"
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1427.501,1439.142,"--Well, that... functionality is a separate inquiry from whether a characteristic is source identifying to consumers."
1999.99-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.165,1456.224,"I understand, but... but without proving secondary meaning, if it's functional, you're... you're home free."
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1467.563,1483.33,--It can... it can be if... if the ability to compete in this market is impeded by denying access to competitors to a similarly pleasing combination of very familiar elements.
1999.99-150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.33,1486.728,"Seersucker, watermelons, you know, collars, whatever."
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1486.728,1504.397,One could easily view this case as one where the copyright protection that was afforded from direct and duplication suffices and otherwise the industry is being too impeded here.
1999.99-150,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1504.397,1505.596,Don't we at least have to--
1999.99-150,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.596,1505.596,--Mr. Wallace--
1999.99-150,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1505.596,1520.625,"--Don't we at least have to say that the more important the aesthetic element is in the consumer's decision, the more difficult it is to prove inherent distinctiveness, the less likely that there is inherent distinctiveness?"
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1520.625,1525.535,"I... I think that is correct, Justice Souter."
1999.99-150,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.535,1526.881,"It isn't quite that, is it?"
1999.99-150,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1535.416,1539.72,"Well, there certainly would be no protection but not because there isn't inherent distinctiveness."
