1992.91-781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.841,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-781, United States v. A Parcel of Land."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,49.153,54.027,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,119.687,126.185,Then the innocent owner defense is available only to someone in the chain of title before the forfeiture occurs?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,126.185,127.856,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,168.605,170.011,May I ask there?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,176.461,183.036,"Well, Your Honor, our position... that is a... really an entirely different question."
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,183.036,183.88,"Well, I don't know."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,195.548,204.887,"Your Honor, the answer to that question lies we believe not in construction of the innocent owner defense, but in what the word ""proceeds"" means."
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,233.204,236.984,"Well, what if the drug dealer bought a house--"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,236.984,237.359,Yes.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,237.359,243.262,"--then sold it, and gave the proceeds to his companion who then bought another house?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,243.262,243.902,Okay.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,243.902,244.605,Would that be a different case?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,244.605,245.683,No.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,255.789,256.178,Right.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,256.178,258.661,That's proceeds as far as we're concerned.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,261.865,266.847,"So, the house is proceeds, and what about the money that the seller of that house got?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,266.847,274.14,--That... we think a fair construction of proceeds is that that's not proceeds.
1992.91-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.234,324.556,"Well, Ms. Wax, would your... how does your theory play out in terms of any mortgage that has been put on the house?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,324.556,325.962,Right.
1992.91-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.962,332.101,Does the Government take the property subject to the mortgage or not?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,332.101,349.891,"Well, Your Honor, I think that if the mortgage... the answer would be, under the theory I just stated, probably no in the sense that if the mortgage is a true business-like mortgage by just any old bank or--"
1992.91-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,349.891,350.172,Yes.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,355.998,356.795,--Right.
1992.91-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,356.795,365.821,--that the proceeds used to make the down payment were those of a drug transaction.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,365.821,366.228,Right.
1992.91-781,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,403.947,416.488,But do I take it that you submit the case to us on the theory that the Government concedes that a bona fide purchaser exception is read into the statute insofar as the definition of proceeds is concerned?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,416.488,431.904,"--We certainly think that's possible, Your Honor, that that... the issue of a comprehensive theory of proceeds is not directly presented by this situation because Ms. Goodwin's house is proceeds under a narrow theory, under a broad theory, under any plausible theory."
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.904,436.981,"Ms. Wax, let me understand what the Government's position is now."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,444.212,444.571,Right.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.571,447.101,--the house is covered.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,447.398,448.179,Definitely.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.179,453.568,"But if the house is then sold for cash, that cash is not covered."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,453.568,454.676,No.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.238,457.738,The house continues to be covered all the way down the line.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,457.957,464.61,"Well, I think what we're... the cash is covered because I originally bought the house with my drug profits."
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.61,464.985,Yes.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,464.985,466.547,That house is covered.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.547,466.906,Right.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,467.75,468.468,The house is proceeds.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.468,469.311,--The house is proceeds.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,469.561,469.795,Right.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.795,472.341,Then the house is sold and it's converted back into cash.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,472.341,472.544,Right.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.09,477.34,Right.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,477.34,478.229,Okay?
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.632,486.866,Sure.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,486.866,487.725,I am benefitted--
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.725,491.146,"The same would be true of the person that I sold the house to, though."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,500.064,500.408,--Right.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,500.408,502.22,I buy a house with the cash.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,502.22,502.517,Right.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.517,504.656,I then sell the house to somebody.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,507.514,507.873,Yes.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.873,509.155,The house is still covered.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,512.434,513.84,Okay.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.84,515.965,It isn't as I understand you.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,516.105,528.411,"Well, Your Honor, I think what's confusing people is that under conventional tenets of forfeiture law, once a thing becomes tainted, a res becomes tainted, it's tainted forever."
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.749,590.887,"Have we ever applied the relation-back doctrine, relation-back forfeiture, to anything except physical property--"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,590.887,593.401,Well--
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.401,595.791,--in contradistinction to cash?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,595.791,621.64,"--Well, Caplin & Drysdale concerns section 853(c), which is the criminal forfeiture provision that deals with proceeds, cash, and in that case, of course, the question was whether money that the drug dealer wanted to pay to his lawyer, whether the relation-back provision applied to that, and the Court said absolutely, positively it applies to that."
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.682,637.057,"Is... oh, go ahead."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,647.301,652.409,"Well, I'm not aware right off the top of my head of a case in which this Court has."
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.627,657.22,I'm not aware that we've done it.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,669.153,671.403,Not in any case of this Court that I'm aware of.
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.55,736.922,"In the hands of the wrongdoer, yes, but it's something else to follow it all the way down the chain from then on."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,736.922,737.391,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1992.91-781,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.391,746.169,"As I say, we've never... to my knowledge, we've never done that except in the case where the offending property itself is involved, not cash."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,746.169,760.164,"--But, Your Honor, we clearly... the statute clearly allows you to do that here because the statute says that all things of value furnished in exchange for drugs are forfeitable."
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.3,770.534,Ms.--
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,770.534,774.282,--black letter forfeiture law is it doesn't matter who holds--
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.282,779.561,"--Ms. Wax, does that mean... I just want to be sure, and I think that it really doesn't matter in this case that the woman is a donee."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,788.541,790.916,--The answer to that is no.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.884,792.118,"Well, why not?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,792.118,792.899,--are in different positions.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,792.899,796.773,But why isn't that precisely the same proceeds that went to the doctor?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,801.349,804.238,"Okay, well, I guess we're saying yes to that, Your Honor."
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.361,813.953,Proceeds are only proceeds that are received by way of gift?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,813.953,818.764,--In this case we're dealing with profits--
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.764,819.123,"Well, is that... am I right or not on that?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,821.201,821.404,--No.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.404,822.201,"--Well, your lawyer case--"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,822.201,823.184,The answer is no.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.184,831.838,"--seemed to be a categorical answer that if it's a third party that is an innocent... has no knowledge of the taint on the money, that you can trace it."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,831.838,835.335,"Proceeds can be two sorts of things, Your Honor."
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.847,853.656,But I don't understand why the full value matters if the criminal has transferred Government property to the doctor in payment of a debt.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,858.873,860.795,It's different for the following reason.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.037,878.303,But why not on the sale too?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,885.19,885.565,--Okay.
1992.91-781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.565,886.971,--in terms of the language of the statute.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,889.251,889.766,Right.
1992.91-781,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,889.766,890.875,--May I make a suggestion?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,890.875,891.828,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-781,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,891.828,901.293,Aren't you implicitly saying that at least... excuse me... at least one set of identifiable proceeds has got to survive?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,901.293,902.168,Precisely.
1992.91-781,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,902.168,911.539,"You said in the case of the BFP example of the sale of the house that you recognize the transaction as, in effect, converting the house back into money."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,972.78,975.279,"Your Honor, I couldn't have said it better myself."
1992.91-781,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,976.45,977.606,"Well, do you really want to say that, though?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,977.606,987.681,"--We think that that is a fair reading of the word... we're not talking about the innocent owner defense here, which is the subject of this case."
1992.91-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.836,1036.973,"Well, suppose a legitimate businessman goes in debt to a bank, and he has never been in the drug business before, but he's really squeezed."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1073.411,1075.582,That's a hard one.
1992.91-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.582,1076.8,They were financing his manufacturing concern.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1076.8,1083.499,That's a really difficult case there.
1992.91-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1085.858,1098.01,"It's... if... the money is surely the proceeds of the drug business, and they... and it's traceable right to the bank."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1098.01,1098.698,"--Right, right."
1992.91-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.462,1105.4,"Well, what about with the doctor?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1105.4,1107.398,"--I mean, in the hands of the person who originally--"
1992.91-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.398,1109.007,"Well, what about the doctor?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1113.161,1113.755,--Right.
1992.91-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.765,1130.232,"So, what's your answer to the hard case, the bank?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1130.232,1154.239,"--Well, I think on the... I think to be consistent, we might have to say that since the bank... I mean, it gave value in the sense that it gave him a discharge of his debts, maybe not in the form that we could take, but it did give the full value if it was a bona fide... you know, course of business exchange--"
1992.91-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.239,1154.801,"Well, certainly--"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1154.801,1157.659,--that the bank would have a good argument that we couldn't take the money from them.
1992.91-781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.659,1158.284,--It... certainly it had an interest.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1169.639,1172.825,"I think, Your Honor, that we would try and get the money."
1992.91-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1186.131,1187.319,"Well, but the money was paid to the bank."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1197.065,1197.378,--Okay.
1992.91-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1243.312,1248.512,"Well, you would take the position that the house belongs to the Government."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1248.512,1249.168,--Yes.
1992.91-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1249.168,1257.008,"But does it take just the equity, and is it free and clear of the mortgage, or is it not?"
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1257.008,1261.086,It would take that part of the equity--
1992.91-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1261.086,1261.414,What happens to the mortgage?
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1261.414,1264.241,--that was not represented by the mortgage.
1992.91-781,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1264.241,1267.943,You do not take the position that it takes it free and clear of the mortgage.
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1267.943,1276.815,"In that case, if we were to apply proceeds... well, let me back up."
1992.91-781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.786,1308.911,You're assuming--
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1320.0,1320.5,"Well, no."
1992.91-781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1334.696,1342.693,"Some of these examples have been perhaps repetitive, but they do have little factual variations."
1992.91-781,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,1350.394,1350.738,Right.
1992.91-781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.738,1354.158,--with money that is the proceeds of drug operations.

1992.91-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.07,2393.069,I think there's an argument as to what you mean as to xxx.

1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,2885.904,2892.089,"--I agree that if all those things are conceded, that would have to be the answer."
1992.91-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2903.787,2919.108,"Well, if the guy has enough money to set up this trust, he's got enough money to buy a... hire a good lawyer and take very substantial advantage or make sure that he has no control over it, and thereby he supports his little children with the proceeds from drug money."
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,2919.108,2933.711,"--That may be the very answer there, Your Honor, in that if he is escaping another obligation, the Government would attempt to seize the value that he was... of the obligation he was escaping, as I think we heard from the Government."
1992.91-781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2937.991,2941.053,"Well, he gave this house away to avoid a palimony suit."
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,2942.63,2955.593,"That may be an obligation too, and again, it is something that... that's what trials are about, and that is what one would decide at a hearing--"
1992.91-781,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2955.593,2957.03,But he has got no obligation--
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,2957.03,2957.498,--as to whether or not he had gotten the benefit.
1992.91-781,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2957.498,2965.854,"--He has got no obligation to make either his pal or his children millionaires, and that's still the consequence of the Chief's example, isn't it?"
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,2965.854,2966.323,Yes.
1992.91-781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.766,2993.093,Safely.
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,2996.451,3001.886,"I... Your Honor, I have grave doubts that the Government would accept it or that it would be safe, but it could happen."
1992.91-781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.273,3087.648,"Well, I--"
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3087.648,3088.195,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1992.91-781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.195,3110.499,"--I suppose that if... even if you took the bona fide purchaser for value approach in defining an owner, I suppose that you could make an argument that this... the lady involved in this case gave some value."
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3110.499,3113.7,You could.
1992.91-781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.7,3122.136,"And in most States, you would say... or in a lot of States, it would be jointly held property."
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3122.136,3124.119,That's true.
1992.91-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3131.429,3138.896,May I ask one question here?
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3153.28,3154.81,"I believe 7 does, Your Honor."
1992.91-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.966,3160.338,Part of 6 seems to deal with... securities used as instrumentalities.
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3160.338,3174.661,"--Yes, and 4... section... and 4... there's another section as well that deals with conveyances, for example, specifically, and they too have separate protections for innocent owners."
1992.91-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.466,3204.79,7 deals I guess generally with the problem of property owned by someone other than the criminal enterprise before the transactions that gave rise to the justification for forfeiture.
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3216.66,3218.801,"That's one of the other sections, yes."
1992.91-781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3218.801,3221.612,--But the proceeds has a whole different problem.
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3221.612,3255.769,"Your Honor, I would... as I had understood the Government's brief, they were taking the position... if you look at footnote 8, they had suggested in footnote 8 that the innocent owner provision had meaning only for people who took before the illegal transaction not for anybody after."
1992.91-781,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3398.633,3419.047,I don't know how that problem of an individual having no right to trace funds just exists with respect to the Government... Government's example and doesn't exist later down the line where you would apply the same clause to funds that have been taken by the Government.
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3423.983,3425.686,"I'm not sure I understand, Your Honor."
1992.91-781,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3425.686,3431.745,"Well, you say that the private owner of funds cannot trace funds."
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3449.425,3458.812,"What they were saying was that later on innocent owners could not take because if they're taking after the date of the criminal act, they take nothing."
1992.91-781,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3462.859,3466.903,"--Your client takes the funds, puts them... takes them over to the bank, gives them to the bank."
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3466.903,3467.356,Right.
1992.91-781,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3467.356,3468.544,The Government seizes them from the bank.
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3468.544,3469.23,Right.
1992.91-781,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3469.23,3470.37,How can she get them back?
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3476.494,3479.18,What I'm saying is she can't enforce against the Government--
1992.91-781,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3479.18,3479.399,Right.
1992.91-781,1,32433,james_a_plaisted,,3479.399,3481.803,"--a third party, her debt from B, and I agree."
1992.91-781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3495.095,3497.484,"Thank you, Mr. Plaisted."
1992.91-781,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3499.812,3505.7,"Your Honor, Justice Scalia was right, that we haven't focused very much on the language of the statute."
1992.91-781,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3555.446,3556.337,"Thank you, Ms. Wax."
