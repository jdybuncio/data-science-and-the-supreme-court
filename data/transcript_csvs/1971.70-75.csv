1971.70-75,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.719,"This morning in number 70-75, Moose Lodge against Irvis."
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,9.719,11.511,Mr. Chief Justice --
1971.70-75,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,11.511,26.335,"Just suspend for one moment, Mr. Wiener?"
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,28.252,31.011,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,288.451,294.084,"What specific was the Moose Lodge's motion to amend the judgment, is that -- where in the record is that?"
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,294.084,300.235,That is at page 42 of the appendix.
1971.70-75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,305.87,308.11,Does the affect of it would have been to --
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,308.11,311.582,Permit any member to bring Mr. Irvis in as a guest.
1971.70-75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,311.582,312.65,Only Mr. Irvis?
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,312.65,315.415,"Well, anybody similarly situated."
1971.70-75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,315.415,316.008,Anybody similarly situated?
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,316.008,318.726,Yes.
1971.70-75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,440.533,442.619,You are saying that there is no longer a case of controversy?
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,442.619,454.313,"Yes, Your Honor, and having done our duty by raising the jurisdictional question, I ask for the substantive issue."
1971.70-75,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.666,800.903,"Colonel Wiener, wouldn’t a logical conclusion from that affirmative statement of right of privacy means that state couldn’t chose to prohibit the type of discrimination that was found here?"
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,800.903,809.714,I think very clearly so on the analogy that we used in the brief where the it was the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.
1971.70-75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.662,855.216,You wouldn’t carry that to the extent that saying hence it would be illegal for Pennsylvania to deny a liquor license to a establishments that discriminates?
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,855.216,861.059,"If that private I would, definitely, definitely because if it is private you can discriminate."
1971.70-75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,920.4,923.531,You answering that liquor license is like water or electricity?
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,923.531,924.529,It would.
1971.70-75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.169,995.009,Is this position essential to you prevailing in this case?
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,995.009,1007.755,"Well, I have three positions and the second one is which I'll -- one is the affirmative right to privacy and the inability of law or government to dictate social relations."
1971.70-75,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1133.907,1145.919,"If your adversary is correct Mr. Wiener, is in your view is the so called bottle club in the same category as the licensed liquor dispenser?"
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1145.919,1168.728,"I am told that having a bottle, well -- I am told that having a locker system, that is every member having his stick or stock of liquor in your locker, not selling liquor, not buying liquor from the club that that would not require a liquor license."
1971.70-75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1168.728,1172.608,"But (Inaudible) the liquor and it is selling, isn’t it?"
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1172.608,1182.105,"Yes but the state doesn’t say that if you buy a bottle of Old Overholt and take it to your home, you can exclude people you don’t like or prefer not to associate."
1971.70-75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.105,1192.259,"I didn't say that, but it is a nevertheless selling a liquor to enliven a party that may discriminate against a --?"
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1192.259,1203.173,"Well, that is the extent to which you would go and the -- the irrationality of the decision becomes apparent when you look at some of the other restrictions."
1971.70-75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.238,1239.877,"Well, (Inaudible) that there maybe state action, but there is no state action that denies equal protection of the law?"
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1239.877,1240.416,Exactly.
1971.70-75,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1260.707,1268.63,Mr. Wiener you said that Pennsylvania doesn’t call for any license of a so called locker club.
1971.70-75,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1271.253,1285.664,"Your Honor, I am not an expert of liquor regulation in the several states, but if you -- if you say that Pennsylvania is so pervasive, you got to have to test the other 50 states to see whether there are differences."
1971.70-75,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1605.29,1608.714,"Thank you, Mr. Wiener."
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1610.897,1614.713,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.084,1836.355,"May I ask you, what happened to litigation in the Pennsylvania courts, wasn’t there a --?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1836.355,1865.657,"Yes, Mr. Justice white the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission and I speak only from hearsay, we have nothing to do with that case nor did my client have anything to do with that case, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission itself brought an action in the state courts, seeking to hold that his private club was in fact a place of public accommodation, I believe on the grounds that because it allowed guests to enter, it should then be so held to that extent."
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.657,1866.811,Under the Pennsylvania --
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1866.811,1868.619,Under the Pennsylvania law.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1884.263,1885.986,What about the Supreme Court?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1885.986,1897.793,I understand that the Human Relations Commission has filed a petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court requesting the Supreme Court to hear it and at best I know no action has been taken on that petition.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.793,1899.674,That issue is still pending in Pennsylvania --?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1899.674,1902.949,That issue would be considered still pending.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.949,1906.597,There was now a constitutional issue involved in that?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1906.597,1908.855,There was not.
1971.70-75,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1908.855,1911.948,Issue under the state law is whether or not it is a place of public accommodation?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1911.948,1916.116,As the Human Relations Commission has brought it under Pennsylvania Human Relations Act.
1971.70-75,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1916.116,1929.522,"Right I understand, under the state statute this case as I understand it further, it is conceded that for purposes of the constitutional issue before us that this is a bona fide private club?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1929.522,1930.84,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1971.70-75,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1934.458,1944.762,Would this apply to the -- require that the an all black club (Inaudible)
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1944.762,1955.63,I think an all black club whose only purpose was to provide social and fraternal amenities to it's membership would be in the same position.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.63,1963.472,And but you do anything to do with race and not at all with private clubs.
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1963.472,1973.497,"Mr. Wiener has raised the question based on the lower court statement about ethnic clubs, religious clubs and we have answered it this way at great length in our brief and I'll argue this."
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.497,1975.618,Right now --
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,1975.618,1981.083,The answer is yes and no Mr. Justice White and the answer is this way.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.347,2040.071,What about all male clubs?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2040.071,2041.241,All male clubs?
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.241,2042.344,All women clubs?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2042.344,2049.702,"We still don’t have a constitutional amendment as I believe, forbidding discrimination on grounds of sex."
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.702,2051.405,That is the Equal Protection Clause?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2051.405,2055.668,"Well, that is as far as I know there has been no ruling on that point."
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.668,2056.792,What is your position on that?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2056.792,2059.135,On all male clubs?
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.934,2074.532,"So that is just across the board, say a restaurant just refuses to --"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2074.532,2079.579,"A restaurant is a normally a public place, a person who is entitled to go."
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.579,2081.844,"And Equal Protection Clause does it, it would have protected --"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2081.844,2084.53,A restaurant sure has waived any rights to privacy.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.53,2086.918,"Well, I am just saying women would have an equal protection?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2086.918,2089.319,Yes in that respect.
1971.70-75,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2089.319,2100.097,"I had been interested years ago in Moslim religion and in the Moslim churches around the world, but I have never been able to get into the Moslim church."
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2105.403,2108.323,I would probably have to ask further why you were stopped at the door?
1971.70-75,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2108.323,2112.568,Because they said I was white.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.568,2120.636,The answer is they are Muslims not Moslims. [Laughter]
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2120.636,2132.739,"Like Mr. Wiener in his discussion of liquor laws, I am going to have to retreat to the point of saying I know little or not about that to try to expound on the depths to which that would go."
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.338,2223.956,"You say than he had never been denied access to the club, and nevertheless brought this suit that he would have a proper case?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2223.956,2227.473,Yes I think the same -- that result inevitably follows Your Honor.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.473,2237.007,"And so that you are saying that any black person, any Negro could have brought this suit and should --"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2237.007,2238.299,The problem --
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.299,2239.911,give a standing to litigate the case?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2239.911,2240.499,That is correct.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.325,2260.251,His being denied and interest was just a proving the discrimination?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2260.251,2263.192,it tuned -- it was the catalyst which proved our point.
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.192,2266.191,What about a white person raising the same issue?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2266.191,2269.684,You mean I think the white person who was the member of the Moose Lodge?
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.695,2282.23,Standing whether he was discriminated against that club or not ?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2282.23,2284.164,"Yes, I think that is true."
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2284.164,2286.8,Did Mr. Irvis want to drink?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2286.8,2291.105,Mr. Irvis was taken to the club by a white member and they sat down at the bar.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2294.978,2298.11,Why is that not under stipulation?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2298.11,2299.613,I believe it is Your Honor.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2299.613,2301.572,It is?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2304.91,2315.652,"Yes on page 32 of the appendix, Mr. Wiener points out in the opinion of the court, food and beverage were requested."
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.652,2318.462,I Just read the stipulation.
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2318.462,2320.409,Food and beverage --
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.409,2324.342,My whole point was all you want was to get to the liquor license?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2324.342,2325.808,That is correct.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.808,2328.686,And how much good will that do to Mr. Irvis?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2328.686,2339.699,It will put Mr. Irvis in a position of being a Negro citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who knows that a private club is not being aided by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in its discrimination.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2339.699,2341.631,What about the restaurant license?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2341.631,2343.299,The restaurant license?
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2382.709,2386.786,"I was talking about the restaurant license, I didn't say one mumbling word about --"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2386.786,2403.325,"The restaurant license Mr. Justice Marshal as we understand it it is only a sanitary license, that is we only used the phrase restaurant license, we where talking only about that license which indicates that the City of Harrisburg has inspected the restaurant kitchen facilities and found them to be sanitary."
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2403.325,2405.077,And must continue to do it?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2405.077,2415.367,"And must continue to do it, but that to is for the protection of the public, protection of those persons who use the restaurant, it is not the type of license that has special benefit to it."
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2415.367,2420.422,What was really driving that is really motion that was made to modify?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2420.422,2426.492,The motion that was made to modify was a motion which would have allowed Mr. Irvis to be admitted as a guest.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2426.492,2428.01,And any others?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2428.01,2432.499,"I would assume it would have to be any others, Mr. Wieners has so stated."
1971.70-75,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2432.499,2436.309,Would explain to me why you oppose the motion to modify?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2436.309,2441.493,Yes I can answer both of those questions I think at the same time.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.24,2524.51,"If I understand Mr. Wiener correctly, at no time did he ask to be a member?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2524.51,2525.148,That is correct.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2525.148,2526.252,Legally or otherwise?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2526.252,2527.55,That is correct.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2527.55,2535.884,And in this case is based not -- this case it has never been tried or membership point raised?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2535.884,2536.56,That is right.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2545.904,2547.266,But can't serve liquor?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2547.266,2555.806,We are only asking that Pennsylvania’s liquor licensing participation be removed from whatever Moose Lodge wants to do.
1971.70-75,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2615.182,2622.466,(Inaudible) to show the number of private club's license to sell liquor in the state of Pennsylvania?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2622.466,2623.855,No it does not Mr. Justice Powell.
1971.70-75,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2623.855,2624.907,Do you know?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2624.907,2625.99,Off hand?
1971.70-75,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.755,2663.687,"Mr. Rubin, am I right in thinking some of your earlier comment about the proposed amendment to the by laws that at the time Mr. Irvis sought service in the Moose Club, he was not refused as a guest pursuant to any written provision of the bylaws?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2663.687,2671.866,That is my understanding Mr. Justice Rehnquist that he was simply refused service and he was told he was refused service because he was a Negro.
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2680.843,2691.378,I suppose you are aware that in some states the so called locker clubs are regulated under the same licensing authority as other liquor licenses?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2691.378,2699.771,I would have to answer that Mr. Chief Justice by saying that I am not really aware of it and I am not sure whether we were talking locker clubs as one thing.
1971.70-75,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2719.785,2725.164,Mr. Rubin I have one little problem of proof.
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2742.265,2749.767,Yes it clearly states that on page 32.
1971.70-75,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2749.767,2758.339,Paragraph 11 merely says that plaintiff entered the premises and requested service of food and beverage.
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2766.837,2768.024,I would have to look.
1971.70-75,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2771.071,2775.695,"I know, but I am looking for proof."
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.695,2781.835,You would say that the parties litigated the issues on that assumption?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2781.835,2786.029,Oh yes there was no question about that Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-75,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2836.607,2839.583,That would certainly be true if it didn’t have any heat or light too?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2839.583,2842.908,"That is true, but the heat or light is supplied to you, to me and to everyone else --"
1971.70-75,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2842.908,2847.118,In our case it's supplied to a club that discriminates racially?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2847.118,2861.013,"That is correct, but we think the proper constitutional line is if the government is doing something on a special places, if there are some special benefit, not freely available to all and this is the case with the liquor license."
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2861.013,2864.391,"Whether freely available or not, liquor license --"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2864.391,2869.458,"No, there are many places in Pennsylvania tpday where there are no license is available because the --"
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2869.458,2874.4,(Inaudible)
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2874.4,2896.843,"Well, I can only go outside the record Mr. Justice White on that by telling you that any recent case of which I am familiar, when a new municipality elected to have a licenses, there would was such a rush for club licenses that everyone was trampled, so there seems to have no end to the desire for these restrictive licenses in Pennsylvania just like the fact that there are 4000 --"
1971.70-75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.843,2908.983,If you would be disqualify out of all the clubs seeking (Inaudible) you think it's permissible to disqualify those clubs who discriminate?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2908.983,2928.873,"I would disqualify those who discriminate on grounds of race and I want to make it perfectly clear, I previously indicated in my answer to your question that there are certain clubs which discriminate in which racial discrimination may take place as a consequence of a nature of a discrimination and that makes discrimination."
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2974.419,2996.128,"What would you say about a club which, a club like Moose which served the person in the position of your client and then struck the host club member from membership, had no direct action with respect to the person served, but the conduit?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,2996.128,3016.651,"There it is there is a case as I recall Barton case in this Court in which it would have -- it would have stated that the white person who was affected by the discrimination practiced against his black brother would have a cost of action against his club, would have standing to raise that."
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3016.651,3018.241,What if he did not raise it?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3018.241,3034.602,"Well, he has the right not to raise it as well as to raise it, but we would have indicated that Mr. Ingleheart who happened to be the white member who took Mr. Irvis to the club would have been able to bring a case under those circumstances."
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3034.602,3036.796,That is not the direct issue?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3036.796,3039.099,That is not the direct issue here.
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3039.099,3055.17,"So you are indicating I take it that that kind of a sanction against the members for bringing inadmissible guests would be something that the guest in the position of your plant could not reach, is that what you are suggesting?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3055.17,3061.315,I don’t think that Mr. Irvis is harmed by a sanction against the guest because there was no sanction.
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3062.365,3068.473,"Well, you say -- isn't he harmed in the sense that this fellow can't take him back to the Moose Lodge again?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3068.473,3077.125,"That is true and I think that is Mr. Ingleheart, that would be his right of action to raise it, just like I think, yes sir Mr. Justice Powell?"
1971.70-75,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3077.125,3100.988,"I'd like to go back to discussion merely as to the distinction you draw between race and sex as a basis for discrimination and I have in mind the numerous court decisions which do not allow states to discriminate on the basis of sex with respect to admission to state institutions, schools and the like."
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3111.814,3119.868,"Well, it really is my position that we are slowly reaching the point where that will not be allowed."
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3156.992,3165.55,But who is -- what does male sona bath have a reason.? [Laughter]
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3165.55,3167.118,I just going to have to avoid that question
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3176.288,3183.107,(Inaudible) large number of club license affected that they are much cheaper?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3183.107,3185.381,The License it self is not expensive.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3188.708,3192.955,What is the difference between the regular license and the --
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3192.955,3198.063,The differences are only in the fact that basically the club has more freedom in the use of it's license.
1971.70-75,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3209.885,3212.075,But that is the value that it can stay on longer.
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3212.075,3218.911,That's one of the values certainly one of the values.
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3299.202,3307.727,"Mr. Rubin, how does the state share in terms of that language, share in the discrimination?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3307.727,3313.789,The state would share Mr. Chief Justice in the same way that the state would have shared in Barton.
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3322.263,3326.51,"Well, suppose they give up their liquor license and continue to do just what they were doing?"
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3326.51,3327.447,That is perfectly alright.
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3332.573,3336.753,Even they refuse to serve him a cup of coffee?
1971.70-75,1,27910,harry_j_rubin,,3336.753,3337.868,That is correct.
1971.70-75,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3347.295,3349.145,Thank you Mr. Rubin.
1971.70-75,2,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,3349.388,3351.903,"Mr. Chief Justice, yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-75,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3428.816,3435.813,Mr. Wiener what are the Caucasians?
1971.70-75,2,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,3438.661,3458.496,"It is not restrictive to someone who hails from the region of the Caucasus Mountains and it's seems to me that insofar as there seem to be conflicting interests involved, Congress has drawn the line in two provisions of the Civil Rights Act and it is our view if you are going to respect."
