1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,180.802,183.182,That was a war time trip.

1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,183.944,214.889,"On a merchant -- on a merchant vessel which was under Yugoslov flag and at that time I would say that who was really the Government of Yugoslavia was to say the least, a very murky question although King Peter was in England and apparently was recognized but there were MihailoviÄ‡ and Tito fighting in Yugoslavia and also the Germans had occupied Yugoslavia so that there might have been several interpretations of who was really in charge of Yugoslavia at that time."
1963.353,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,214.889,224.481,(Inaudible)
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,224.481,224.94,Yes.
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,335.076,343.561,You don't -- you don't take issue with the fact that his departure was an execution of the order -- order of deportation?
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,343.561,343.737,No.
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.592,347.938,I understand that.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,347.938,348.269,Yes.
1963.353,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,351.0,355.053,"(Inaudible) rather than involuntary, is it?"

1963.353,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,608.675,615.414,Is it only -- this is only because the departure under an order for deportation that they've presented.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,615.414,617.527,Well that is what is said but I --
1963.353,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,617.527,619.19,But that's -- that's the argument.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,619.19,620.422,That's the argument of the Government.
1963.353,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,620.422,621.858,Yes.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,621.858,638.877,"The provision in the law which is being use as for the purpose of this Act, and the alien ordered departed carries out his deportation order but it doesn't seem to me that there's any compelling reason that this would be admitted into the concept of residence."
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.877,638.981,Could he -- could he --
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,638.981,639.46,Suppose --
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.46,640.722,Excuse me.
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,641.357,641.828,(Inaudible)
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.828,644.534,Did he arrive back in the United States on the same ship?
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,644.534,645.108,Yes.
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,650.218,653.021,And where was it headed when he left?
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,653.021,654.838,It was on the west coast from San Francisco --
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,654.838,657.904,-- where was the ship when he -- when he boarded the ship?
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,658.932,661.206,"To South America, that's the West Coast."
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.224,666.186,And did they know he's going to come back here from Chile?
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,666.186,667.583,I assume so.
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,705.09,713.375,"What were the -- what was he legally permitted to do when he took that ship to San Pedro, California?"
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,713.375,713.617,Well --
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.617,716.414,So far as -- so far as coming back into this country?
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,716.414,723.049,"Well, theoretically what he was permitted to do is to come back to the country and ship out within 30 days."
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,723.049,724.453,"Just as a -- as any foreign sailor, (Voice Overlap)."
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,724.453,728.427,As any foreign seaman and that he didn't do.
1963.353,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1031.796,1050.917,"(Inaudible) -- is it that -- it's not possible to have this voyage considered a break in residence because the voyage was from San Francisco to Chile and back to San Francisco, is that it?"
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1050.917,1059.77,"Well, the definition of residence is the place of general abode and the place where the man had its principal actual dwelling place in fact."
1963.353,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1060.957,1063.207,"Well, that was the United States when he left."
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1063.207,1064.899,And it was when he returned.
1963.353,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1071.476,1079.065,Well I thought -- I thought the -- you put some emphasis on the fact that he had to come back to the United States.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1079.065,1079.702,That is right.
1963.353,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1079.791,1081.303,"Well, is -- is that established?"
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1086.221,1103.367,"Well, he didn't get off the ship and although the Government filed -- said something about that he had a Yugoslav passport from our own experience with these so-called Yugoslav passport that that's a paper saying that he's Yugoslav and except to -- to the Yugoslav Government but it certainly wouldn't have admitted him to any other country."
1963.353,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1111.007,1123.634,Well then I am -- I am correct in appreciating your argument to be that there could have been no break in United States residence because this departure was a departure which had at the end of it a return in the United States.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1123.634,1124.318,That is correct.
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.673,1135.64,"Well, wouldn't you -- would you have the same argument if they (Inaudible) then to England?"
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1135.64,1140.934,"Well if it -- I had been to England and England had accepted him, if there's evidence that England would have accepted him, I would --"
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.934,1141.168,Yes.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1152.617,1157.449,"Well, I would say that probably, I would take the same position because of the following reasons."
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.07,1171.368,Well the same argument would apply -- apply if he went to Yugoslavia and came back.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1171.368,1174.242,"Well, that's quite possible."
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.6,1223.284,"Well, you wouldn't suggest though that they couldn't have deported him to England, you said he wanted to."
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1223.284,1226.819,I think they couldn't deport them on that particular trip because that vessel didn't go there.
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1226.819,1228.864,"Well, I know but they could've deported him to England."
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1228.864,1231.86,"If they had deported them to England, we would've another set of facts and that was --"
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.86,1236.459,"So, it isn't the fact that he wasn't -- that they couldn't force him to leave the country because --"
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1236.459,1236.769,(Voice Overlap) --
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.769,1238.194,-- there was no place to go.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1239.959,1240.876,"Well, that is what the Government says."
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.876,1241.248,But it says that on his trips --
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1241.248,1242.361,I have no knowledge.
1963.353,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.361,1247.171,-- they say -- it's just that on this trip you say he didn't go anywhere else.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1247.171,1254.743,"Well, I have no knowledge that actually people were deported to England because my recollection at that time is that it was quite difficult to get ships across the ocean to England."
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1272.071,1280.051,Is there any indication that he knew the destination of this vessel when it sailed away from San Pedro in 1942?
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1280.051,1281.312,"Well, there's nothing in the record."
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.395,1290.666,"As the -- when you're drawing on your recollection of that era, I'm drawing on my own recollection of that era, sailors just didn't know where their ships were going because this was a matter of security."
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1290.666,1292.683,"That's -- that's quite possible, yes."
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1292.683,1292.826,And they were not told.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1292.826,1294.573,"But that -- well, I don't know."
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.573,1296.26,Even junior officers were not told.
1963.353,0,22650,edith_lowenstein,,1296.26,1296.465,No.
1963.353,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1300.274,1301.003,(Inaudible)

1963.353,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1466.348,1470.962,What country was he deported to?
1963.353,1,40464,richard_w_schmude,,1470.962,1474.321,He was deported from the United States Mr. Justice Goldberg.

1963.353,1,40464,richard_w_schmude,,1753.792,1756.366,Excuse me.
1963.353,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1758.171,1761.159,This probably hasn't any real relevancy but I'm just curious.

1963.353,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1769.511,1778.472,"I -- I may say frankly, this seems to me rather a technical application and I just wonder why even 25 years here, why are you sending him away?"
1963.353,1,40464,richard_w_schmude,,1778.472,1790.146,If I may recite just a few of the facts in the exhibit to familiarize the Court with the facts surrounding his residence in the United States.
