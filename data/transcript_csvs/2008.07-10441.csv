2008.07-10441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 07-10441, Corley v. United States."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,9.022,21.413,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: FBI agents delayed presenting Mr. Corley to a Federal magistrate judge in order to obtain his two confessions."
2008.07-10441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.0,91.724,"Before we -- before we get to the statute, McNabb-Mallory are exercises of this Court's supervisory authority over the lower courts?"
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,91.724,92.874,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,92.874,103.699,"And they were both pre -- Miranda decisions, when now the defendant is told of his right to remain silent."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,123.427,135.318,"This Court could, but for several prudential reasons, this Court should not overturn McNabb and Mallory and should not find them to be no longer valid considerations."
2008.07-10441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,198.755,203.826,Are you arguing that the language in subsection (c) codifies the McNabb-Mallory rule?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,203.826,211.249,"I -- I'm arguing that the exact language, whether it is ""codification"" or ""leaves intact"", doesn't matter."
2008.07-10441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,212.799,227.342,"Well, there's a very big difference, isn't there, between saying we're codifying this rule, we're making it a statutory requirement, and saying, assuming that this supervisory rule that was adopted by the Supreme Court remains in place, we're creating an exception to it?"
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,230.294,232.377,"--Your Honor, it does the latter."
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.86,281.225,"Well, it would be consistent with the second purpose that you gave to say that there's a 6-hour safe harbor or whatever term you want to call it, and beyond 6 hours, the Court is free to reexamine its supervisory rule in light of what Congress has provided in (a) and (b) of the statute."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,281.225,285.094,"--Well, but again, the language of the statute is ""time limitation""."
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,297.819,307.175,"It is a little bit odd to say that Congress has built a statute around a supervisory rule, but taken away the authority of this Court to reexamine the supervisory rule."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,307.175,311.162,I'm not actually saying that Congress has taken away the authority of the Court.
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,353.906,357.774,"Well, you were trying to get to page 7 of your yellow brief?"
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,357.774,358.691,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,410.207,416.878,Or it may just mean that the confessions beyond 6 hours may be excluded solely because of delay.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,427.935,433.322,"Within the 6 hours, he cannot exclude solely because of delay, even a voluntary statement."
2008.07-10441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,464.757,479.934,"Well, they have that textual problem, but you have at least an equally big textual problem because you want to read the first sentence of subsection (a) completely out of the statute based on some supposition about what Congress was intending to do."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,491.742,494.86,"Your Honor, we don't disregard the text of subsection (a)."
2008.07-10441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,518.29,525.463,"And if you read subsection (c) the way you do, it makes subsection (a) mean something quite different from what it says literally."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,525.463,526.496,No.
2008.07-10441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,559.35,566.29,"Well, now what you're -- you are not arguing that there is a specific provision that controls a general provision."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,581.216,582.916,"With respect, no, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.941,640.504,Why -- why can't you argue that what happens when you're not within the safe harbor is simply that the time period cannot alone govern?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,655.348,658.883,"--That, again, is the government's interpretation."
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.335,711.415,But -- but 3501 itself: (a) says that it shall -- shall be admissible in evidence if it's voluntarily given; and (b) says what factors will be taken into account in determining whether it's voluntarily given.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,711.415,712.684,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.29,723.84,I agree.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,726.692,728.46,--So the two terms--
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.46,733.431,"And so if you're outside of that safe harbor, you cannot rely upon the time alone."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,737.883,749.623,"--Your Honor, because the effect is, again, to allow for a confession to be inadmissible solely based on delay if it's outside of the 6 hours."
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.623,750.289,"No, no."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,772.703,780.642,"Well, what the -- what the Congress said was that delay alone cannot be a basis for inadmissibility within 6 hours."
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.642,781.225,Right.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,781.225,787.796,"That leaves in place McNabb -- Mallory, under which delay alone is a basis for inadmissibility."
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.796,788.296,No.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,799.417,800.019,But that--
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.019,810.709,"--and (b) says it's voluntary if you take into account the -- the five factors, one of which is the period of time before arraignment."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,810.709,813.177,"--Your Honor, that depends."
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.754,831.305,But they are synonymous as used in (a).
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,831.305,833.49,"Well, as used in subsection--"
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.49,838.144,(a) says that if it's -- it's admissible if it's voluntary.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,838.144,840.028,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,859.142,868.331,"Well, is it your position that the McNabb-Mallory rule serves purposes other than to ensure the voluntariness of the statement?"
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,868.331,868.981,Yes.
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,869.564,871.115,And that's what you're trying to reach here?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,871.115,872.065,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,872.481,881.337,"But if that's true, then why is it that we would suppress the confession if it's completely voluntary?"
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,889.241,889.943,--It's protecting--
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,889.943,893.744,--something other than voluntariness and suppressing the confession?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,893.744,895.68,--It's protecting the right of prompt presentment.
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,902.5,906.452,But why do we want to avoid delay in presentment?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,914.475,917.694,"Well, voluntariness is certainly a part of it."
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,925.014,932.687,"What do those rights have to do with a confession that's conceded, for our analytic purposes, to be voluntary?"
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,932.687,939.423,--Because the confession itself was obtained through exploitation of the delay.
2008.07-10441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,961.504,967.924,Do you need fundamental principles when you've got rule -- rule 5 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,976.014,977.298,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,983.202,995.51,But all you're doing is -- is trying to have an enforcement mechanism for this by the wholly unrelated remedy of suppressing the confession if it's voluntary.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,997.26,1005.032,"Well, the purpose of McNabb -- Mallory was actually to cut the line a bit short of having to actually make a voluntariness determination."
2008.07-10441,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1026.195,1029.647,So you say a confession can be coercive and still voluntary.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1029.647,1032.433,"It's -- yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.285,1061.485,May I ask you this?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1072.176,1074.31,--There is no other remedy available.
2008.07-10441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1098.059,1098.827,Why would that be the case?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1103.462,1105.147,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1105.147,1112.301,Your argument is you don't trust district judges to make accurate determinations as to whether the confession is voluntary or not.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1115.52,1117.055,It's not that we don't trust them.
2008.07-10441,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1142.67,1146.955,What's the purpose of the -- of the requirement of prompt presentment?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1146.955,1150.324,--The purpose of the right of prompt presentment is several-fold.
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.127,1222.419,"Mr. McColgin, what do you do with the problem that the proviso only makes a delay longer than -- than 6 hours nondestructive of the admissibility of the confession if this -- the delay beyond 6 hours is found by the trial judge to be reasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest available magistrate judge or other officer?"
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1233.394,1236.429,"We have to remember, Your Honor, that--"
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.429,1247.819,"You see, if you take the government's position that it really doesn't matter, it gets thrown back into (b), and you can take all those factors into account, and the ultimate question is whether the confession was reasonable."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1265.864,1267.614,"--No, Your Honor, that's not our position."
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.434,1273.117,Right.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1273.117,1276.902,"Or longer, depending on transportation, means of transportation."
2008.07-10441,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.177,1318.563,"Well, that certainly is a very back-door way of doing it, isn't it?"
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1318.563,1326.567,"Not at all, Your Honor, because once we look at the structure of the statute, what it's doing is carving out the first 6 hours from McNabb-Mallory."
2008.07-10441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1341.058,1345.195,But why was -- why was it appropriate to have a special rule for transportation?
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1369.477,1375.981,"Because the first question, again, is just whether to exclude the confession altogether from the McNabb-Mallory determination."
2008.07-10441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1386.272,1388.64,So basically -- I don't mean this disparagingly.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1390.257,1391.925,"Correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1391.925,1398.096,"Somebody from a State thought of it and nobody else said, well, gee, let's pile on some other express provisos."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1399.663,1400.615,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1412.589,1413.039,I see.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1413.039,1425.497,"Your Honor, the government also relies on 402 as a basis for arguing that McNabb-Mallory has been basically overturned by Congress."
2008.07-10441,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1447.743,1461.753,"At least one time limit that has been complied with -- that's the Fourth Amendment, how long you can keep somebody seized without taking them before a magistrate."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1465.222,1466.555,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.963,1506.299,I just had -- had one question.
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1512.269,1523.661,"--As legislative history, yes, Your Honor, because the 3501(c) was modeled on the D.C. legislation, which established clearly a 3-hour time period."
2008.07-10441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1529.147,1531.047,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-10441,0,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,1531.047,1531.766,No further questions?
2008.07-10441,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1532.349,1538.586,Mr. Dreeben.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1538.586,1556.715,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's important in this case to go back and look at the original rule of exclusion that this Court developed in the McNabb case in 1943 and then reiterated in the Mallory case in 1957."
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.055,1620.657,"May I just ask before you get to those, Mr. Dreeben?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1628.811,1635.5,"--Justice Stevens, I'm not sure that there is any evidentiary sanction that could be imposed."
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.5,1636.95,"No, not -- apart from an evidentiary sanction."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1636.95,1642.738,None has arisen in the case law that I could point Your Honor to.
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1657.163,1670.673,"So at the time that Mallory and McNabb were decided, the Court thought that an extra rule was necessary to give the government an incentive to comply with prompt-presentment requirements."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1674.625,1690.635,"No, I don't think that they are, Justice Stevens, because the -- the critical thing that the Court was doing in Mallory and McNabb was trying to come up with a way to ensure that suspects were advised of their rights to protect against abuses in the interrogation process."
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.938,1708.346,"No, but I'm not -- we're not talking about a constitutional problem but a rule problem encouraging compliance with the -- the -- with the rule that requires prompt presentment."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1708.346,1710.464,I think that what the Court was after--
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.464,1719.737,"To the extent that -- I'm suggesting to the extent that that was a motivating factor in McNabb, it seems to me that it would be precisely the same motivating factor in today."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1719.737,1722.939,"--Well, I think that it was not the sole motivating factor in McNabb."
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1722.939,1730.176,"Not the sole, but -- but to the extent it was a motivating factor, that seems -- it would have equal strength today as then."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1730.176,1732.46,"No, I do not agree that it would have equal strength, Justice--"
2008.07-10441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.46,1739.964,"Mr. Dreeben, wouldn't -- wouldn't you still have this disincentive which -- wouldn't you still have this disincentive, which is considerable?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1752.208,1753.308,"--Well, certainly, Justice--"
2008.07-10441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1753.308,1754.824,Isn't that enough of a disincentive?
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1763.314,1769.968,"--Yes, excessive delay can be a -- it is by statute a factor that will be taken into account in determining voluntariness."
2008.07-10441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1769.968,1773.586,"But we're talking about rule 5, and rule 5 doesn't say a word about voluntary."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1801.32,1808.176,I think it's unenforceable by the exclusion of a confession that results from what a court concludes is unnecessary delay.
2008.07-10441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.791,1834.576,But isn't there -- I'm sorry.
2008.07-10441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1834.576,1838.878,Rule 5 says without unnecessary delay.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1851.17,1860.859,"Justice Ginsburg, what happened in this case is that the suspect was given his Miranda rights and waived them and agreed to give a confession."
2008.07-10441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.003,1883.974,I -- I must be losing the thread of the argument.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1897.049,1897.815,That is correct.
2008.07-10441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.815,1919.064,"And so long as the length of the -- the delay can still be considered as one of the elements in determining that the -- that the confession is involuntary, there is still a degree of incentive based upon only the confession."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1932.722,1936.157,It is certainly challengeable on voluntariness grounds.
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1939.359,1944.013,It's still true they have everything to gain and nothing to lose by continuing to interrogate him.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1944.013,1945.363,"--Well, they do have something to lose--"
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.363,1949.0,"If they -- if they don't get the confession within 6 hours, they haven't got it."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1954.903,1969.746,"--Well, Justice Stevens, to the extent that it is correct that a waiver of Miranda rights waives the prompt-presentment right and prevents an objection based on whatever survives of McNabb-Mallory, the officers are doing nothing wrong if they obtain a valid Miranda waiver."
2008.07-10441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1975.65,1980.785,"Isn't there a -- a new factor, now that the Court has decided Miranda?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2048.829,2066.891,"Well, Justice Souter, I think that's purely a question of policy of whether there should be such a strong exclusionary rule that mandates the barring from admission into evidence of a purely voluntary confession where there's no dispute about its voluntariness because the officers delayed beyond 6 hours."
2008.07-10441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2066.891,2067.66,"Well, I agree with you."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2079.883,2094.81,"It's a policy context that I think Congress has decided in two different enactments, and I think that if this Court were to reach it as a matter of policy, it should revisit the balance that it reached in McNabb-Mallory because of the changed legal context."
2008.07-10441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.731,2104.599,I knew you were going to get to 3501 eventually.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2104.599,2107.368,I am glad that I have finally reached it.
2008.07-10441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2199.81,2201.996,"If that's the answer, why do we need (c)?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2204.198,2215.32,"--Congress never needed (c); (c) in the government's view was always superfluous, even at the time when it directly said delays shall never be the ground for suppressing a confession."
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.906,2246.108,"But it doesn't, Mr. Dreeben."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2248.893,2257.416,That's the limitation on a -- the period during which a court cannot rely exclusively on delay within the meaning of the statute.
2008.07-10441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2287.332,2304.008,"So you are really asking the Court to overrule McNabb-Mallory because you say Congress provided 6 hours, no McNabb-Mallory, but after 6 hours the test is voluntariness -- only voluntariness."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2309.246,2317.102,"--That's correct, but the modification, Justice Ginsburg, is that I think Congress has displaced McNabb-Mallory."
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2374.538,2378.14,What is the -- what if the other reasons apply?
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2383.127,2385.246,"I think that's right, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2385.246,2385.829,Okay.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2439.029,2439.981,"No, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2439.981,2440.831,"No, of course it doesn't mean that."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2440.831,2441.414,If there's--
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2441.414,2453.704,"So if it doesn't mean that, then why does it mean that we should ignore this other rule of evidence contained in rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2453.704,2455.323,"--Well, that's precisely my point, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2468.981,2479.022,"Well, there are -- there are, in other words, as you've heard, a number of things that can happen when you hold a person, let's say, for 40 hours or 29."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2519.914,2523.282,"--Well, McNabb and Mallory are not constitutional decisions of this Court."
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2523.282,2523.682,"No, of course not."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2523.682,2526.984,They were attempts to effectuate a particular policy choice.
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2538.458,2546.029,"Does it say anything in the legislative history, which interests me, that the purpose of (a) is to overturn Mallory and McNabb?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2546.029,2560.639,"No, Justice Breyer, and I -- I will concede to you the legislative history on the point that section (a) was considered to overrule Miranda and subsection (c) was addressed to McNabb-Mallory."
2008.07-10441,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2560.639,2574.131,"Mr. Dreeben, Justice Breyer suggested that there are rules of evidence other than those based on the Constitution or McNabb-Mallory that might result in the exclusion of a confession."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2589.691,2592.593,I think in theory rule 403 is such a rule.
2008.07-10441,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2606.103,2612.424,--Have you -- are you familiar with cases in which a defendant's confession has been excluded under -- under 403?
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2612.424,2614.791,"--No, Justice Alito."
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2614.791,2617.327,"You realize I wasn't focusing on the word ""confession""."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2638.324,2638.791,Yes.
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2638.791,2639.457,And I think you're right.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2660.237,2664.039,I think the general principle is what the Court ought to be focused on here.
2008.07-10441,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.01,2672.228,The reason I brought that up is not to be technical.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2709.468,2717.49,--I think it would be quite extraordinary for the Court to decide to revive its supervisory powers decisions in McNabb and Mallory.
2008.07-10441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.494,2730.882,"Mr. Dreeben, I tend to think that what we should be focusing on is the language of -- of 3501."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2803.68,2824.593,"I think the statute, as we read it, contains some overlap in voluntariness requirement, and we interpret the voluntariness reference in subsection (c) to really mean otherwise voluntary; in other words, not to be deemed involuntary solely on the basis of delay, but otherwise voluntary."
2008.07-10441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.128,2830.83,"Well, I'm reading it that way, too."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2834.199,2834.765,--Right.
2008.07-10441,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.765,2844.571,"Then when you have a proviso, which refers to the time limitation contained in this subsection, it's a time limitation upon voluntary confessions."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2844.571,2854.946,It's a -- it's a limitation on the time during which a judge may not rely on delay alone to find a confession inadmissible.
2008.07-10441,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2881.846,2891.286,"Then why didn't the statute say, instead of saying inadmissible, shall not be found involuntary solely by reasons of delay?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2894.154,2909.68,"It is, and I think the reason that it was written that way, Justice Souter, is it was a direct attempt to make clear that McNabb-Mallory shall not operate in the 6-hour period after arrests and before presentment."
2008.07-10441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2989.382,2990.665,That's -- that's rule 5.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2990.665,2991.751,--No.
2008.07-10441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3003.975,3009.795,"But you have said without the exclusionary rule, rule 5(a) has no teeth at all."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3033.911,3034.611,Justice Ginsburg--
2008.07-10441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3034.611,3037.196,Exactly what McNabb and Mallory were trying to get--
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3037.196,3059.728,"--There is a crucial difference between this Court deciding that there is a command in the Rules of Criminal Procedure and we as a Court are going to back it up by an enforcement mechanism, which is the supervisory power route, and Congress saying what we intend is that a violation of this rule produced inadmissibility of a confession."
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.629,3096.734,"Mr. Dreeben, do you think the rule 402 argument is strong enough to prevail even the section -- the statute had never been enacted?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3096.734,3100.12,"--Yes, I do, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.12,3105.44,"The statute was really unnecessary to overrule McNabb and Mallory, in your view?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3105.44,3114.629,"Well, Congress focused on the problem of confessions in section 3501 and it dealt with McNabb-Mallory in section 3501(c)."
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3120.45,3124.568,But it was a superfluous and unnecessary answer if your interpretation of the rule is correct?
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3124.568,3127.103,"It came many years before, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3169.18,3173.5,"We could never acknowledge -- never recognize a new privilege, then, for example--"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3173.5,3174.584,--No.
2008.07-10441,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3174.584,3176.702,--from psychiatrists or something like that.
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3176.702,3195.581,"No, I -- I think the Court did that and quite properly did it, Justice Stevens, because rule 502 of the Federal Rules of Evidence -- it's 501 or 502 -- says that principles of privilege shall be developed in light of reason and experience, and so it was a specific grant to this Court of the authority to do that."
2008.07-10441,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3282.853,3294.243,"--Is there any indication of the rules advisory committee, any of their notes, that 402 was meant to overturn McNabb-Mallory?"
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3294.243,3294.727,--No.
2008.07-10441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3343.724,3345.676,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2008.07-10441,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3345.676,3346.242,Thank you.
2008.07-10441,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3346.242,3349.628,"Mr. McColgin, you have 4 minutes."
2008.07-10441,2,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,3349.628,3351.846,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-10441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3372.927,3377.563,"Well, it may not have been intended to do that, but doesn't its language on its face cover that?"
2008.07-10441,2,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,3377.563,3390.955,"--Not at all, because it was statutorily based and it was viewed as being statutorily based because it was it was based on the existing statutes at the time of McNabb which were seen as precluding presentment delay."
2008.07-10441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3490.384,3499.823,"Well, but that -- that sort of flagrant conduct would not be an issue if this had been done within 6 hours, right, assuming that it was a voluntary confession?"
2008.07-10441,2,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,3499.823,3500.606,That's correct.
2008.07-10441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3500.606,3506.06,"The purpose of the law enforcement officers, if it's voluntary, is irrelevant under 6 hours."
2008.07-10441,2,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,3506.06,3509.964,"As long as it is under 6 hours, that's correct."
2008.07-10441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3518.987,3531.295,"Well, doesn't it seem odd to focus on flagrant conduct at 6:01 as being as important as you're emphasizing, but not -- but totally irrelevant at 5:59?"
2008.07-10441,2,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,3531.295,3535.247,--There has to be line-drawing in this sort of case.
2008.07-10441,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3564.765,3567.348,"Can a defendant waive the right, the 5(a) right?"
2008.07-10441,2,21246,david_l_mccolgin,,3567.348,3578.089,"Yes, Your Honor, as long as it is waived within the 6-hour time period, and as long as it's an express waiver of the right to a prompt presentment, it can be waived."
2008.07-10441,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3589.796,3590.463,"Thank you, counsel."
