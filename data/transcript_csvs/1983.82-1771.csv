1983.82-1771,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.388,We will hear arguments next in United States against Leon.
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,11.262,26.616,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before I state the facts of this case, I would like first just briefly briefly to review the governing principle of law against whose background the statement of facts should be more helpful."
1983.82-1771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.903,289.604,"Well, on that basis... perhaps we just ought to reverse on that basis, that they acted consistently with the Fourth Amendment."
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,289.604,297.553,"--That brings into play, Justice White--"
1983.82-1771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.553,299.6,Another Illinois against Gates.
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,299.6,304.863,"--Another Illinois against Gates, and of course my response to that is twofold."
1983.82-1771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,331.821,335.226,So you assume that we wanted to do something else.
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,335.226,344.005,"--Exactly, and I will also assure you that if you are interested in reviewing fact bound probable cause cases from the Ninth Circuit, we can bring many more of them here."
1983.82-1771,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,345.443,361.811,"May I ask, though, along the same vein, Mr. Solicitor General, supposing we decide this case exactly as you urge the Court to do, and a magistrate in the future is confronted with an identical fact pattern."
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,364.607,392.783,"--Whether the magistrate should issue the warrant or not depends on factors other than what the Court would give in deciding this particular case, because the relevant decision in guiding the magistrate whether to issue the warrant or not would be Illinois versus Gates, and not this case."
1983.82-1771,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.783,399.718,"Well, but if this case is... Assume an exact duplicate of the facts of this case, which are quite different from Illinois against Gates."
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,404.357,404.982,That is correct.
1983.82-1771,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,404.982,412.743,"And we don't reach the good faith rule unless we first decide, it seems to me, that there is no probable cause."
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,412.743,418.288,"Well, in our view, those are two completely separate issues."
1983.82-1771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.184,449.4,"Well, you haven't challenged here the Ninth Circuit's determination that there was a violation of the Fourth Amendment."
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,454.335,457.897,"That is exactly right, and... that is exactly right."
1983.82-1771,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,463.754,466.612,"I guess your answer to my question is, you are really not quite sure what the magistrate should do."
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,466.612,471.876,"--Well, and that that is not an issue... We deliberately have not briefed it."
1983.82-1771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.343,478.779,"Well, you know what magistrates in the Ninth Circuit would be bound to do."
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,480.434,484.402,"That is correct, and if that is a serious enough--"
1983.82-1771,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,484.402,487.962,"And in other circuits, if the rule was different, they would not issue the warrant."
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,487.962,488.883,--Precisely.
1983.82-1771,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,504.581,509.626,"General Lee, I guess this case was decided before Illinois versus Gates?"
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,509.626,510.047,That is correct.
1983.82-1771,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,510.047,521.152,And does the record in this case establish that the police actually had information available about the reliability and credibility of the informer?
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,524.136,533.6,"We have characterized this informant under the usual standards as an informant of unproven reliability, the same as in Illinois versus Gates."
1983.82-1771,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.08,704.14,What does it do to encourage proper action by the magistrate?
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,704.14,705.078,Let me turn to that.
1983.82-1771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.577,746.952,If I may interrupt--
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,746.952,747.296,--Yes.
1983.82-1771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.296,748.53,--I assume that is usually the case.
1983.82-1771,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,755.434,755.793,That is correct.
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1498.744,1516.082,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the proposition advanced by petitioner in this case as well as being unconstitutional is unnecessary, unmanageable, and illogical."
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.725,1665.302,How do we reach that conclusion?
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1665.302,1667.614,"--Well, the realities--"
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1667.614,1669.208,Is there some testimony on that?
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1669.208,1672.159,"--There is not testimony, Your Honor, but there is--"
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.159,1676.047,"I mean, it is judge shopping the way prosecutors and defense counsel do it?"
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1676.047,1689.182,"--I think that the cases, at least, Carancos in the Second Circuit, the studies that have been done, all recognize that... and no one is saying that all magistrates are rubber stamps."
1983.82-1771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.663,1832.956,"There is either something wrong with them or something wrong with the law, I suppose, if they couldn't get it right in a month."
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1832.956,1841.39,"It was something wrong with the facts, that they couldn't show that there was probable cause to believe that contraband would be found in a particular location."
1983.82-1771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.776,1856.134,"If you were a magistrate, would you have issued this warrant?"
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1856.134,1859.196,A magistrate--
1983.82-1771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1859.196,1863.474,Do you think a reasonable magistrate could have issued this warrant after--
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1863.474,1864.459,--As to my client--
1983.82-1771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.459,1865.989,--after Illinois against Gates?
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1865.989,1867.677,--It was issued before Illinois versus Gates.
1983.82-1771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.677,1868.224,"I mean, but after Illinois."
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1868.224,1876.189,"After Illinois versus Gates, as to Defendant Del Castillo and as to my client, a reasonable magistrate would not have issued that warrant."
1983.82-1771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.769,1921.781,"Well, but all probable cause is is a certain degree of association, and there is no magic cutoff point between what... The Court of Appeals there was just as consistent with innocence as guilt."
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1927.559,1931.822,"--Your Honor, mere association I didn't think was consistent with innocence as guilt."
1983.82-1771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.822,1940.287,"Well, certainly association with a narcotics dealer, being seen with him is some evidence that you may have some propensities of that kind yourself."
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1940.287,1963.513,"Well, I don't think that this Court has ever held, Your Honor, on any facts, anything close to this, you can get a warrant for a man's car or a man's house, and if that is the case, if this case comes within either Gates or within a supposed good faith exception, there is nothing left to the warrant clause."
1983.82-1771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.669,1980.037,"Well, you could, on that basis, you could win, I suppose, win your case even with a good faith exception, because any... what you are submitting is that any fool would know you shouldn't get a warrant on these facts."
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1980.037,1991.127,"--I am saying... we did argue in our brief as to my client that even within a good faith exception we would win, but that, as I was arguing--"
1983.82-1771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.127,1996.702,"Well, you could still win, right here, even if the government wins."
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,1996.702,2003.544,"--That might be, Your Honor, but it seems to me that there are overriding considerations."
1983.82-1771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.743,2010.243,Exactly.
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2010.243,2017.084,"Nevertheless, as this Court speaks, it sends a message to law enforcement officers, to the public about our constitutional rights."
1983.82-1771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.783,2035.234,"Well, what kind of a message would it send out if we said, there is a good faith exception, but it doesn't do the government any good here."
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2043.62,2046.198,"--Well, I said Mr. Del Castillo."
1983.82-1771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.176,2062.285,"Well, it certainly wouldn't say--"
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2062.285,2062.863,--exclusionary--
1983.82-1771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.863,2065.565,--It certainly wouldn't suggest you ought to be careless.
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2065.565,2069.704,"--What it would say, though--"
1983.82-1771,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.704,2072.67,It would suggest that you ought to be careful.
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2072.67,2088.946,"--You didn't make it this time, but if you have to make a mistake, don't make it on the side of constitutional behavior, make that mistake on the side of unconstitutional behavior, because if you are wrong, the evidence can still be admissible."
1983.82-1771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2107.079,2109.922,"Well, isn't that true under Illinois against Gates now?"
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2109.922,2114.982,"Well, if that is true... One point."
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.49,2145.876,"If this gentleman had been seen on the porch of this dealer five times in seven days, how would that affect your position?"
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2145.876,2148.984,It wouldn't affect it at all.
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2148.984,2150.765,Twelve days.
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2152.265,2168.71,"Well, of course, I suppose, obviously... he was seen one time in one month, but I suppose... Well, I don't... Your Honor, if he was seen 12 times in 12 days, I don't think that means you could search his car."
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2178.691,2184.611,"Let's make it 12 days at 12:00 noon, which would eliminate the daughter, probably."
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2187.937,2193.684,"--Maybe she has graduated from school and is in between things, and is home at 12:00."
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2202.541,2203.884,"With known drug dealers, you are talking about?"
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2208.725,2221.424,"It is not probable cause or close to it, at least under any case that I have ever seen either from this Court or from any other court."
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2329.818,2334.565,You think there would not be a civil suit against the magistrate because of his judicial immunity?
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2334.565,2335.518,He is immune.
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.407,2341.796,Immune from a civil damage suit?
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2341.796,2343.498,As I understand the law.
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2355.884,2358.602,That doesn't mean he is immune from the suit.
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2358.602,2367.193,"Well, then all that happens is that you... well, but there is a finding within the criminal case that he acted in good faith."
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2769.389,2772.091,Very well.
1983.82-1771,1,18118,barry_tarlow,,2772.091,2773.638,Thank you.
1983.82-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2773.638,2784.978,Mr. Cossack.
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,2784.978,2800.017,"Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the Court, I would first like to start by answering Justice Rehnquist's question as to whether or not probable cause would be found under the Gates decision as to my clients, Mr. Sanchez and Ms. Stewart, who were the object of the tip."
1983.82-1771,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3207.432,3223.017,"Mr. Cossack, if the thrust of the Fourth Amendment inquiry is probable cause, what about the case where there is in fact probable cause but the magistrate simply makes some kind of a mistake or error, a slip of the pen?"
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3223.017,3225.61,Are you suggesting that--
1983.82-1771,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3225.61,3234.061,Is there no room there for any kind of a so-called good faith exception for the officer executing such a warrant?
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3234.061,3241.667,"--Are you suggesting a situation, Your Honor, where there was probable cause in fact, the magistrate reviewed it, and decided there wasn't probable cause?"
1983.82-1771,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3241.667,3246.946,Or maybe even decided there was and made some error on the warrant.
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3252.911,3265.376,"I think, Your Honor, as... I am referring to the case that we heard this morning, which is fresh in my mind... there may be limited applicability of a good faith exception."
1983.82-1771,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3265.376,3275.777,"How about the case, then, where there is in fact probable cause but the police officer made an error in filling out the affidavit?"
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3275.777,3276.762,So that--
1983.82-1771,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3276.762,3281.478,And the magistrate acts on it erroneously and issues a warrant.
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3288.007,3300.08,"--Are you suggesting, Your Honor, that the magistrate acted erroneously on an incorrect warrant and came to the conclusion that there was probable cause when in fact the police officer in good faith misstated facts?"
1983.82-1771,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3326.742,3333.677,Is it your view that error was committed both by the magistrate and the police?
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3333.677,3340.081,"Well, it is certainly my view that error was committed by the magistrate."
1983.82-1771,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3340.081,3341.862,Primarily?
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3341.862,3343.033,Primarily by the magistrate.
1983.82-1771,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3345.111,3351.312,"The police actually appeared to act with considerable diligence, once they got the tip."
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3351.312,3353.092,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1771,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3434.763,3442.307,Have we ever held explicitly that the exclusionary rule applies to the action of the magistrate?
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3442.307,3456.598,"No, Your Honor, but you have suppressed cases in which the magistrate has found probable cause where there isn't probable cause, so in effect by implication you have said that it goes to the--"
1983.82-1771,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3456.598,3460.783,I think you are asking us to make a finding we have never had occasion to make before.
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3460.783,3488.178,"--No, I am asking you to say, Your Honor, that the... to go ahead with what I believe you... this policy has always been... the exclusionary rule does go to magistrates and their activities, and I believe that that is based upon the grounding that the Fourth Amendment not only... or that the exclusionary rule not only deters police conduct but upholds the integrity of the probable cause area of the Fourth Amendment."
1983.82-1771,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3488.178,3499.955,"Well, apart from the integrity point, I think this Court has said a half a dozen times at least that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful police conduct."
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3499.955,3502.735,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1771,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3502.735,3509.326,Have we ever said the purpose was to deter unlawful conduct by the magistrate?
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3509.326,3523.899,"No, Your Honor, but I don't think you have ever had presented to this Court a situation where the government is attempting to say that because a magistrate erred and not a police erred, there is... somehow that the rights of the individual are somewhat less affected as they are today."
1983.82-1771,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3523.899,3524.228,Yes.
1983.82-1771,2,38932,roger_l_cossack,,3532.63,3533.816,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1771,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3533.816,3534.191,Right.
