1985.85-5487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.196,We will hear arguments next in Smith against Murray.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,25.157,33.893,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case, Smith versus Murray, presents three issues that I would like to discuss briefly here."
1985.85-5487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,345.057,357.705,What you are suggesting is that that should be treated the same way under the same rules as though it had been offered by the prosecution in the case in chief where guilt was--
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,357.705,359.285,"That is right, Your Honor."
1985.85-5487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,386.483,392.597,"--Mr. Snook, when did you make the prosecution aware that you were not going to use the document yourself?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,392.597,397.101,There was no... there was never any document filed.
1985.85-5487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,402.124,408.89,"Even though the prosecution knew you had secured the appointment of a psychiatrist, had you not?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,408.89,414.673,"Well, the defense had asked that another examiner, Dr. Pile, be appointed."
1985.85-5487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,440.129,454.227,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Snook, that in the penalty hearing at the second stage the same rules of evidence apply across the board as in the basic prosecution?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,454.227,457.9,--They don't apply exactly across the board in the same way.
1985.85-5487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,534.351,538.775,Has the highest court of Virginia passed on that issue in this case?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,538.775,569.563,"Not specifically on the question... I guess the reason it would matter is if there was definitely a question about some evidence being aggravating, some evidence being mitigating, and I suppose the question of whether the door had been opened, the Virginia Supreme Court has never gotten into questions of whether the door was open to a particular kind of testimony or any of the other kinds of considerations that would sometimes get in the way of the trial court."
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.738,597.882,"Mr. Snook, in your argument, are you going to sometimes cover the waiver point that you didn't ever raise this in the state court system?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,597.882,598.804,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-5487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,604.357,609.28,"Well, did you object when the doctor which was called to the stand by the prosecution?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,609.28,610.001,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-5487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.771,612.813,On what grounds?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,612.813,626.34,"The specific ground, the ground was basically... well, let me see if I can find the exact language."
1985.85-5487,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,631.175,631.904,Excuse me.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,632.555,634.097,"--I am sorry, Appendix Page 4."
1985.85-5487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,672.132,679.905,"Well, before you get there, Mr. Snook, what if your client had elected to put his mental state in issue?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,679.905,688.461,"If he had elected to put his mental state in issue, there are a whole variety of possible rules that one might come up with."
1985.85-5487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,732.24,740.517,"If your client had put it at issue but didn't choose to call Dr. Pile, could the state have done so?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,740.517,780.472,"--I think if they had chosen to put mental condition in issue by saying, call in one of the other psychiatrists, call in Dr. Dimitris, as an example, to say what he ultimately said in cross examination, which night arguably be mitigating, at that point the prosecution might then be allowed under some rules to call... and certainly under the ABA rules to call Dr. Pile in to rebut exactly the point raised, in other words, not to go further and say that we get to put on evidence of future dangerousness, but specifically addressed to the question of the mitigating circumstances as to which Dr. Dimitris would testify."
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.298,793.02,Are you suggesting that all these niceties are governed by the United States Constitution?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,793.02,800.985,"No, in fact, most of these niceties are probably to be determined in the first instance by state law by the state statutes."
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.745,804.097,We are talking about Virginia.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,804.097,805.179,--I understand.
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.179,807.86,What has what Texas has said got to do with this?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,807.86,819.288,"I was going to distinguish between the Texas statute and the Virginia statute, where Virginia makes future dangerousness and mitigating circumstances totally separately distinct issues, whereas Texas does not."
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.361,834.988,"But even though the substantive standards in states may differ, isn't ordinarily the order of proof and who can testify to what and what issues you can testify to based on state law?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,838.859,859.062,"No, and in fact, as I say, if it were not for the fact... basically every single possible formulation of the test, if it involves any consideration at all of in what order the proof is to come in, it still comes down to the fact, because in this instance Dr. Pile was the first witness."
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.052,876.145,What error is this you are referring to?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,876.145,879.936,The error of allowing Dr. Pile to testify at all.
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.837,883.599,Are you saying that is a constitutional error?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,883.599,901.391,"--It is a constitutional error where Dr. Pile is allowed to testify after having been appointed to assist the defense, to give assistance to the defense, then be called in to testify, basically applying the same Gibson versus Zahradnick rationale."
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.391,904.373,What case from our Court supports that proposition?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,904.373,909.005,This Court has not explicitly stated that.
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.317,981.874,"Could I ask you, is there some... was there any challenge to the aggravating... the vileness aggravating circumstance?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,981.874,983.524,--Not really.
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.245,988.657,"And that was sustained by the Fourth Circuit, and everyone has sustained that."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,988.657,993.452,We acknowledge that under Virginia law the evidence is sufficient for finding vileness.
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.452,998.153,And so the only problem is the future dangerousness?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,998.153,998.904,Yes.
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.872,1024.56,"Well, the Forth Circuit certainly decided that as long as the vileness aggravating circumstance was left undisturbed, it was quite proper to sustain the death penalty."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1024.56,1029.984,"And that was based on their, I would argue, misreading of this Court's ruling in Zant versus Stephens."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.984,1035.669,"Well, I know, but insofar as it was an interpretation of Virginia law, we certainly accept it."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1035.669,1043.473,"Well, first of all, I would note, Your Honor, that at the time that this decision was handed down, there had been no statement by the Virginia Supreme Court."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.473,1047.046,"That may be, but has there been since?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1047.046,1050.149,The case of Tuggle versus Commonwealth--
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.149,1060.905,At least the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit thought that it would be wholly consistent with Virginia law to sustain a death penalty on the basis of one of two aggravating circumstances.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1060.905,1065.009,--I don't believe that they stated that as a matter of interpretation of Virginia law.
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.009,1067.35,"They acted on it, didn't they?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1084.901,1096.107,"That's right, and in so doing they cited Zant versus Stephens and they cited Zant versus Stephens as the opinion appears on Page 165."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.107,1101.691,"--Well, the point the evidence being admissible, the inadmissible evidence here only went to one aggravating circumstance."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1101.691,1104.102,"That is right, but in fact--"
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.102,1112.53,Do you think Zant... you think Zant is contrary to the way they interpret this?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1112.53,1132.332,"--No, what I think is that in Zant versus Stephens, this Court was faced with a question of whether evidence that was inadmissible as a matter of... an aggravating circumstance that was invalid as a matter of state law would create a federal constitutional violation, and this is not that case."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.196,1161.611,"Well, there is no question that the Fourth Circuit thought that the death penalty should be sustained because of the single circumstance."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1161.611,1162.272,That is right.
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.989,1175.42,I understand.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1183.537,1191.04,"--Well, as I say, I don't think that they were focusing as much on Virginia law as they were on a misreading of this Court's decision in Zant."
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.04,1200.676,"You are not really claiming that there is an inconsistency in Virginia law, are you, that the Fourth Circuit's decision is inconsistent with Virginia law?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1200.676,1202.437,"No, I am not claiming that."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.147,1213.674,"Yes, but you are raising a question as to whether or not the death... under Virginia law the death penalty should be sustained when the jury has found two circumstances and one of them washes out."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1213.674,1214.585,--That is right.
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.585,1222.029,"You are saying that you really don't know what should happen under Virginia law, whether there should be a new sentencing hearing or not."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1222.029,1235.079,"Well, after Tuggle versus Commonwealth, I assume the Virginia Supreme Court would say that if the Zant versus Stephens situation exactly on those terms came to Virginia, that the Virginia Supreme Court would hold as the Georgia Supreme Court did."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.606,1265.34,A federal violation that only want to one of the aggravating circumstances.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1265.34,1266.021,Yes.
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.021,1272.054,And you are saying that that should taint the finding of the other aggravating circumstance?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1272.054,1274.235,"No, not that it should taint the finding of the other aggravating circumstance."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1274.235,1275.056,What should it be?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1275.056,1276.286,But that it should--
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.286,1280.279,"Because there was the violation, you automatically set aside the death penalty."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1280.279,1296.058,"--Because there was the violation and because this Court cannot be sure under Virginia statute which permits the jury to find life for no reason at all except simple mercy, there is no way to know what factors the jury was considering."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.058,1297.981,So you do get back to Virginia law.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1297.981,1299.031,Yes.
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1299.031,1311.42,"Supposing this were coming from the Supreme Court of Virginia rather than the Fourth Circuit, and the Supreme Court of Virginia had written exactly the opinion that the Fourth Circuit had except that as to matters of Virginia law, of course, it would have spoken with finality."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1314.932,1315.493,Yes.
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1315.493,1318.646,Even though all the state law questions were resolved against you.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1318.646,1325.828,"That is right, because the basic problem is the Fifth Amendment problem, not the state law problem."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.828,1338.898,You would still have to be then arguing that the federal violation tainted the vileness finding and hence the Virginia Supreme Court could not write this kind of opinion.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1338.898,1353.769,"Your Honor, I don't understand this Court's decision in Zant versus Stephens as saying that every finding of an aggravating circumstance must be tainted in a case in which in admissible evidence has come in."
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.147,1372.872,"Yes, but the evidence that came in wasn't the least bit relevant to the finding of vileness."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1372.872,1373.95,--That is right.
1985.85-5487,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.95,1375.863,Not in the least.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1383.027,1406.892,"What we end up with, Your Honor, if we accept the position that it has to taint every single factor is that if you have a case in which there is no question about vileness, then the Commonwealth is free to do anything it wants to, commit the most egregious errors possible, and know that if they get the death penalty, that death penalty is unchallenged."
1985.85-5487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1408.524,1425.786,"Do you concede... perhaps you have answered this before, but do you concede that there is no weakness or impairment or flaw in the determination of the vileness and wantonness of the crime?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1425.786,1426.797,"Yes, I concede that."
1985.85-5487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1437.586,1441.259,"Way don't you address it, because as far as I am concerned it is determinative?"
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1441.259,1441.979,All right.
1985.85-5487,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1443.031,1446.743,May I just ask one question before you proceed?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1461.212,1462.992,That's right.
1985.85-5487,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1462.992,1465.914,And may I ask you this question?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1471.417,1473.831,"That is the point that we have argued all along, Your Honor."
1985.85-5487,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1473.831,1474.83,You agree that the--
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1474.83,1475.781,"Yes, we do."
1985.85-5487,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1475.781,1479.244,--that counsel for the defendant should not have cross examined--
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1479.244,1480.045,"Yes, we do."
1985.85-5487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1552.321,1561.558,"--Unlike Murray versus Carrier, I suppose, here counsel made a deliberate decision not to argue this on appeal."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1578.197,1582.872,But it was a case in which they did not do what they should have done to research the question.
1985.85-5487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1588.896,1592.519,It was certainly consistent with Virginia law at the time.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1592.519,1592.957,--It was.
1985.85-5487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1592.957,1595.659,The Fourth Circuit had not issued its holding.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1595.659,1596.661,That's right.
1985.85-5487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1596.661,1600.163,So why isn't he bound by it?
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1600.163,1657.188,"Well, if in fact he is bound by that, and if in fact he is bound not to... if counsel is not supposed to take a good, close look at Gibson, and if in fact he is not supposed to understand that the issue is still in dispute and to understand that this case will ultimately reach a federal court, all of which, I submit, counsel is bound to do, particularly in a capital case, maybe not in a shoplifting case, but it is certain that a capital case is going to result in coming to the federal courts, that he ought to be looking at federal law, that particularly in... Gibson versus Commonwealth pointed that out, where there were cases coming down right and left in other jurisdictions cited in Criminal Law Reporter and other places where the amicus brief raised the issue, and there wasn't even any sort of attempt to supplement the record or supplement the assignments of error... I don't know whether such a happening could occur under Virginia law, but even if... they didn't even try, and if they had tried, maybe the situation would be different."
1985.85-5487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1657.188,1663.523,"Well, Engle versus Isaac says that perceived futility alone doesn't count as cause."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1663.523,1664.404,That is right.
1985.85-5487,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1664.404,1667.376,"And that is what we have, and we have a deliberate choice."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1667.376,1682.517,"And not only is perceived futility but it is specifically futility that is perceived because counsel did not do what reasonable counsel would have done, which is to at least follow up on the statement in Gibson versus Commonwealth--"
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.517,1687.76,We didn't grant certiorari on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1687.76,1694.275,--But if in fact ineffective assistance of counsel as being cause can be considered in rebuttal--
1985.85-5487,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.275,1699.787,"Well, that is the Murray against... whatever that case you mentioned was."
1985.85-5487,0,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,1699.787,1717.549,"--Right, but even if we don't have ineffective assistance of counsel, I would argue that the policies of Engle versus Isaac, the policies of Wainwright versus Sykes all deal with this equitable discretion, and that in fact the question is whether there is an adequate state ground adequately serving state interests."
1985.85-5487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1747.208,1750.771,Mr. Kulp.
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1750.771,1765.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we respectfully submit that the Fifth Amendment issue is not properly before the Court because of this Court's ruling in the case of Wainwright versus Sykes."
1985.85-5487,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1904.853,1907.327,"Mr. Kulp, let me interrupt you for a minute."
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,1918.283,1923.285,"They do in this respect, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.756,2309.302,"Yes, but can you use that as a justification for putting inadmissible evidence in, that they might have gotten the evidence from another source?"
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2309.302,2310.374,Justice Stevens--
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.374,2312.274,"If you assume for the moment it is inadmissible, which--"
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2312.274,2315.126,"--No, sir, we don't really say that."
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.248,2329.284,"--If you assume it is inadmissible, and if you also assume it would tend to make the jury more likely to impose the death sentence, what difference does it make that there is another... I don't understand your argument relying on the other aggravating circumstance."
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2329.284,2343.494,"--Well, I think in this case that the evidence is so clear on the aggravating circumstance of vileness that whether this evidence had been introduced or not introduced, or whether you had had any finding or any evidence at all--"
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.494,2344.806,That is the harmless error argument.
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2346.296,2347.147,"--Yes, sir."
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.147,2350.339,But that is quite different from the rationale of the Court of Appeals.
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2350.339,2363.149,I think the Court of Appeals viewed the case in the context that the evidence of the bus incident had nothing to do whatsoever with the vileness finding.
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2363.149,2367.654,And you have just agreed that would not be a sufficient rationale if it was prejudicial evidence and inadmissible.
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2367.654,2377.731,"Well, I don't... Justine Stevens, I don't think that just any type of evidence would call for a harmless error rationale necessarily."
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2395.88,2400.004,It seems to me that... but then it is not a Zant argument.
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2402.906,2403.707,"Well, I think--"
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2403.707,2407.37,"--There is... theoretically, at least, there is quite a difference between the two approaches."
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2407.37,2429.022,"--I think, though, that in Zant the Court recognized at least in a footnote in Barclay versus Florida the Court indicated that it had applied federal harmless error standard in Zant, and I think that what the Court did in Barclay is a similar situation as to what the Fourth Circuit did here."
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2484.608,2486.391,"No, they said something quite different."
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2486.391,2488.522,"Well, I think that--"
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.522,2497.368,"They said, as I understand them, that as long as there is one aggravating circumstance supported by the evidence, it doesn't matter how much error there is with regard to the other aggravating circumstance."
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2505.221,2510.845,"--Well, that is what they said, and that is basically what the Virginia Supreme Court has said in the case that Mr. Snook mentioned."
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2510.845,2512.718,You are making sort of a different argument.
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2515.52,2518.722,"I don't want to limit myself, Justice Stevens--"
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.722,2519.163,"--No, of course not."
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2519.163,2533.532,"--to just that argument, because if this Court should not accept that rationale, then we think we have a harmless error argument, so we would certainly take the position that the Fourth Circuit--"
1985.85-5487,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.532,2536.604,But the harmless error argument is one that you would be asking us to make the harmless error determination.
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2540.275,2567.493,"--Well, I think you can, Justice Stevens, read the Fourth Circuit opinion, and the reason I say that is because in one of the footnotes they talked about the counsel, they didn't believe that counsel probably was ineffective because they said we don't think that there was any prejudice, and I believe, and if you look at the District Court opinion, they clearly found no prejudice from the failure to raise the Fifth Amendment issue."
1985.85-5487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.009,2611.243,"--The Fourth Circuit law is clear on the admissibility of this evidence, or not?"
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2611.243,2616.066,I don't think it is absolutely clear.
1985.85-5487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.929,2624.321,Under Gibson how would the admissibility of this evidence be decided?
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2624.321,2641.862,"--I think that the admissibility, of this evidence would really come under the Conquiss versus Mitchell case, not the Gibson case, and the reason I say that is because in Gibson the facts were that the court ordered the examination."
1985.85-5487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.616,2703.903,What did the Fourth Circuit... how do you think... the Fourth Circuit said it didn't want to avoid deciding the merits in this case and then promptly didn't decide it.
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2703.903,2705.565,I don't think they did.
1985.85-5487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.536,2715.459,You would have thought they... I gathered from what they wrote that they thought... this panel thought Gibson controlled--
1985.85-5487,1,31319,james_e_kulp,,2715.459,2717.502,"--They may have, Your Honor."
1985.85-5487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2762.591,2769.386,"Mr. Snook, you have three minutes remaining."
1985.85-5487,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,2769.386,2770.167,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1985.85-5487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2817.13,2824.254,Do you think it requires the Supreme Court of Virginia to take up a case where the issue is presented only in a way that is contrary to its rules?
1985.85-5487,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,2824.254,2825.596,"Your Honor, the one point that I--"
1985.85-5487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.596,2826.584,Do you?
1985.85-5487,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,2826.584,2829.496,"--Not... first of all, there is no... well, okay."
1985.85-5487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.788,2857.996,You think this Court feels better about a state court opinion which passes on a lot of the questions that weren't raised in that court than it does about an opinion which just passes on questions that were raised?
1985.85-5487,2,33126,j_lloyd_snook_iii,,2857.996,2873.066,"If in fact you accept what Mr. Kulp is suggesting, that this Court ought to give great deference to what happens below because of that mandatory appellate review, yes, I would think you would feel better about it if in fact they reviewed the record in its entirety."
1985.85-5487,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2957.994,2959.753,"Thank you, gentlemen."
