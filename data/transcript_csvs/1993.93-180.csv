1993.93-180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.908,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-180, the Boca Grande Club, Inc., v. Florida Power & Light Company."
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,36.385,39.457,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-180,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,131.587,138.152,"Mr. Pope, I suppose the disposition of this case will depend in large part on the disposition of the case we've just heard."
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,138.152,140.363,"I would agree, Your Honor."
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,252.897,260.07,"May I ask you, Mr. Pope, just so... has there been a determination in the litigation as to the proportionate responsibility of the co-defendants?"
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,260.07,267.556,"There has been a... Your Honor, there has been no determination of Boca Grande Club's contributory fault for the collision."
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.18,291.272,So there would not be an issue on remand as to what the--
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,291.272,291.983,"No, sir."
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,291.983,292.862,--correct division was?
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,292.862,296.735,"No, sir, at least not as the case presently stands."
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,297.806,302.639,"The reason I raise the question... the plaintiff isn't here, as I understand it... is not a party to this proceeding."
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,302.639,303.591,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,303.591,308.181,And conceivably could have an interest in what the allocation could be if Boca Grande is out of the case.
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,308.181,321.211,"Yes, sir, and I would also believe that the claimants would have a great interest in this Court's decision in the McDermott case, since the verdict and judgments in the State court of Florida are on appeal at the present time."
1993.93-180,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.211,340.153,"Well, if the Court in the preceding case were to adopt a proportionate fault rule... I don't know that it will, but if it did, what would be our best disposition of this case, just to vacate and remand?"
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,340.153,364.039,"Justice O'Connor, I believe that would be correct, because the cause of action upon which Florida Power & Light Company sues... namely, the contribution claim... would cease to exist as a matter of law, because it could not be paying more than its proportionate share of the fault, period, so there would be no... the contribution as a theoretical right would exist, but not for them."
1993.93-180,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,428.409,439.669,"But if this Court went the other way in the McDermott case, then wouldn't the Great Lakes... wouldn't that have to be reconsidered, or--"
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,439.669,443.45,I'm sorry--
1993.93-180,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,443.45,447.403,--If this Court adopts proportionate fault as the rule--
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,447.403,448.174,"--Yes, ma'am."
1993.93-180,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,448.174,455.017,--then doesn't the Eleventh Circuit have to rethink its position?
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,455.017,456.7,"Yes, ma'am, that's correct."
1993.93-180,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,470.648,475.981,So Great Lakes would essentially be wiped out if this Court should adopt the proportionate fault.
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,475.981,477.013,That's correct.
1993.93-180,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,477.013,488.25,There was some suggestion that the Edmonds case impeded the Eleventh Circuit from adopting a proportionate fault position.
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,488.25,534.94,"The suggestion was that the Edmonds result dictated that with respect to the seamen, who were the personal injury claimants in the Great Lakes scenario, which is... it starts with Ebanks, it goes to Self, and then it goes to Great Lakes v. Tanker, that Edmonds... the decision of this Court in Edmonds, recognizing joint and several liability, placed one of the defendants, the Great Lakes defendant in that case, in a situation where it, as a 30-percent-responsible-for-the-collision party, would end up paying 100 percent of the damages, whereas the 70-percent-at-fault party, the Chevron vessel, which had already made a settlement with all of the personal injury claimants, would not be responding unless contribution were allowed."
1993.93-180,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.94,540.643,"You say that the State court action is still alive, it's not dead."
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,552.09,552.701,"Yes, sir."
1993.93-180,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.701,555.192,"But that's not the case, you say."
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,555.192,556.134,"No, sir."
1993.93-180,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.134,557.476,The State action is still alive.
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,557.476,566.451,The State action was... the settlement between Boca Grande Club and the Polackwich-Richards claimants occurred in... I believe it was September-October of 1990.
1993.93-180,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.689,658.172,I don't understand what you mean.
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,659.913,671.02,"I'm sorry, because what happened in the Great Lakes case was that Chevron early on settled with all of the personal injury claimants who were crew members of the other vessel."
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.406,803.605,"--Would you help me, Mr. Pope?"
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,813.052,837.708,"Your Honor, I believe... and I will advert to a decision, the recent decision of the Florida supreme court, because I heard the word Mary Carter agreement in an earlier argument, and there is a decision that was just announced in the Florida supreme court along with several other decisions that had to do with Florida's adoption of a comparative fault regime which outlawed Mary Carter agreements."
1993.93-180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.83,871.905,"Is that a Mary Carter agreement, what you've just described?"
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,871.905,872.453,"Yes, sir."
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,964.072,970.708,"Mr. Pope, I hate to... I'm getting an education from you, so I hope you don't mind one more question about the Mary Carter--"
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,970.708,971.068,"Yes, sir."
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.068,971.589,--formula.
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,984.235,987.038,"As I understand it, that would be an illegal agreement in Florida whether it--"
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.038,987.899,So secrecy is not an element.
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,987.899,988.68,--Secrecy has nothing--
1993.93-180,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,988.68,992.643,You just can't agree that your position in the litigation will be X rather than Y.
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,992.643,1011.453,"--Correct, and as I understand it, it does not matter whether the agreement is secret or not secret, the interest the court was trying to protect is the integrity of the ongoing trial process, and parties can settle... great... but apparently in Florida it was becoming more of a problem than maybe it should have been."
1993.93-180,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1297.821,1307.137,Why can't the plaintiff argue against proportionate fault if the plaintiff has settled for less than the settling defendant's share?
1993.93-180,0,21387,david_f_pope,,1307.137,1322.037,"I agree, I think the plaintiff would argue against, because it would want the benefits of joint and several liability, but we are not here in this case to question the applicability of joint and several liability as to the parties that go forward with the litigation."
1993.93-180,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.813,1530.682,"Thank you, Mr. Pope."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,1532.525,1536.515,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-180,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.244,1656.345,I'm not sure... I'm really not sure I understand your argument.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,1665.89,1674.786,"Well, Your Honor, the settling parties have the incentive, perhaps, not so much between them to magnify the nonsettling defendant's fault."
1993.93-180,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.639,1692.787,I'm really not sure I understand.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,1692.787,1693.288,"--Yes, sir."
1993.93-180,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.288,1694.42,So go through it slowly for me.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,1694.42,1695.161,Okay.
1993.93-180,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.888,1738.979,"Oh, I see, you're assuming... your whole argument is resting on the predicate that we adopt the pro tanto rule."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,1738.979,1739.958,"--Yes, Your Honor, and let me--"
1993.93-180,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.958,1740.368,I see.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,1741.179,1742.541,--and I think I need to restate my preface.
1993.93-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1947.616,1950.047,"--Well, what would the issues be in that hearing?"
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,1950.047,1953.921,"--Your Honor, I'm not certain that the cases have clearly told us that."
1993.93-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1982.519,2000.731,"Well, good faith, at least to the uneducated, of whom I'm certainly one in this area, sounds like... you know, honest... honest belief, or something like that, but I gather from what you say it means some... it isn't just to see if there was a fraud in the settlement."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2003.002,2006.435,"The... that's the way the cases read, as I read them, Your Honor."
1993.93-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.189,2029.599,"Well, what would collusion be?"
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2037.416,2043.66,My understanding of the cases is that... and this may or may not sound like definitional collusion.
1993.93-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2060.969,2062.991,Why is that collusive?
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2062.991,2075.09,"--It may not be definitionally collusive, Your Honor, but the same cases that speak to the need of a good faith hearing use in tandem with the discussion of collusion the necessity to assure that the proceeding is fair."
1993.93-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.663,2083.706,Fair not just as between the plaintiff and the settling defendant but fair also to the nonsettling--
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2083.706,2091.65,"It seems to me that they're speaking of a global fairness, which is the whole point, and which undercuts the efficiency that's claimed by the proponents of the settlement bar rule."
1993.93-180,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.013,2106.481,"--Well, Mr. Markman, you... don't you... don't most of the jurisdictions that use the pro rata or proportional rule also require good faith hearings?"
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2106.481,2107.43,"They do, Your Honor."
1993.93-180,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.43,2120.23,"Unless they adopt the variant of it, where the nonsettling defendant can... you know, can opt one way or the other, but those that just employ a straight pro rata, they also have a good faith hearing."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2120.23,2121.412,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-180,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2121.412,2123.973,So... and you're willing to accept that disposition.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2125.883,2130.057,"No, Your Honor, we're... I guess maybe I didn't make my position clear."
1993.93-180,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.352,2158.455,"I see, but with a proportional credit approach, you still insist that there be contribution."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2158.455,2162.088,That issue isn't even addressed.
1993.93-180,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.919,2164.408,I think there's some confusion here.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2168.332,2171.774,"--Well, there's a lot of confusion in the terminology in this case."
1993.93-180,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2171.774,2178.128,"But there isn't any... if you have the proportionate fault rule, then there isn't any question of contribution, isn't that right?"
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2178.128,2178.607,That's correct.
1993.93-180,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2199.862,2202.893,And when does a good faith hearing have any place in a proportional fault rule?
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2203.544,2204.496,--There's no requirement of a good faith hearing--
1993.93-180,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2204.496,2205.024,There's neither.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2205.024,2207.258,"--in that setting, and perhaps I used the wrong terms earlier, Your Honor."
1993.93-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.804,2227.15,"So you agree that if proportionate fault as recognized by... is adopted, no good faith hearing is required?"
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2227.15,2228.489,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-180,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.674,2252.315,"You agree to that, but do the courts that apply the proportionate fault rule agree to that?"
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2255.557,2256.178,I--
1993.93-180,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.178,2272.691,"I mean, there... if what you're worried about is fraud, there is always the possibility, even under that system, of the settling defendant being paid off, in effect, to participate in the trial in order to shift more... a higher percentage of the blame on the nonsettling defendant."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2279.704,2283.968,"--It does, Your Honor, dispense with the necessity of a good faith hearing for this reason."
1993.93-180,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.48,2307.212,"Well, it's not unfair for the plaintiff."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2319.461,2321.221,I agree--
1993.93-180,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2321.221,2321.942,It's a good deal for him.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2321.942,2322.861,"--I agree with that, and that--"
1993.93-180,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.861,2324.303,But that's okay.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2325.385,2326.394,"--Yes, and that--"
1993.93-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.394,2335.138,"But a defendant always... one... jointly liable defendants always try to foist liability off on the other defendants, don't they?"
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2335.138,2354.582,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but the critical flaw in the settlement bar approach is that the process of that foisting will always be visited, the result of that will always be visited on the nonsettling defendant, and as compared to the proportionate credit approach, the parties can cut their own deal and they can live with it."
1993.93-180,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2369.443,2370.324,Mr. Mark--
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2370.324,2372.535,--grossly disproportionate placed damages against--
1993.93-180,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2372.535,2373.476,"--I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2422.566,2428.931,"--Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that that, with all due respect, is perhaps we have the finder of fact and juries in this case."
1993.93-180,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2449.525,2451.346,"You're saying we don't, but why shouldn't we?"
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2456.457,2463.173,My belief is that if they are going to try to collude in that fashion they're going to have to prove it up.
1993.93-180,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2483.246,2490.482,"He knows that unless some court is going to say, if we're outlawing Mary Carter in other situations, we had better look to good faith here."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2490.482,2498.418,"Your Honor, I just don't... it's our position that the good faith hearing, because of the way the system operates overall, isn't a necessary appendage."
1993.93-180,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2503.721,2505.322,You're... you're always a defendant.
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2505.322,2508.055,"--Well, perhaps, Your Honor."
1993.93-180,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2508.055,2511.495,"Or you're always the defendant who's left, rather, I should say."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2511.495,2512.026,That would seem to be the case.
1993.93-180,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2512.026,2529.37,Do you know of any system that has the proportional fault approach that has its extra hearing because of the risk that the settling defendant will get together with the plaintiff and insulate the plaintiff from any showing of fault on the plaintiff's part?
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2530.028,2541.196,"Your Honor, I am not aware of a jurisdiction that has adopted a proportionate credit approach coupled with a good faith hearing requirement, and I think the reason probably is the one I began with, and that is efficiency."
1993.93-180,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2560.789,2572.758,"--Your position is the one that most deters settlements though, isn't it, because then the settling defendant is uncertain, is always vulnerable to the contribution suit."
1993.93-180,1,41738,stuart_c_markman,,2572.758,2577.71,"With the preface that we're equally happy with the proportionate credit approach, I would say no."
1993.93-180,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2652.92,2655.853,"Thank you, Mr. Markman."
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2657.125,2668.603,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-180,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2821.714,2823.083,The plaintiff being the boat owner.
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2823.083,2825.137,"--The plaintiff being the boat owner sues everybody, as you would expect."
1993.93-180,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2877.619,2882.012,"But Mr. Mann, is that type of collusion a problem if we do not adopt the pro tanto rule?"
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2882.012,2882.703,No.
1993.93-180,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2908.389,2915.233,Do you agree that if we adopt the proportionate fault rule there's no need for good faith hearings?
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2915.233,2915.754,Yes.
1993.93-180,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.67,2924.18,"Jesus, don't give us another version."
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,2924.54,2928.862,"--No, I think that it's useful to explain."
1993.93-180,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3021.062,3041.566,"So you're saying that the same interest which leads courts under some circumstances to outlaw Mary Carter in other circumstances would lead simply to a mandatory disclosure rule, and therefore you can adopt proportionate reduction without running the risk of adding another collateral hearing to the enterpri... to the proceedings before they're done."
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3041.566,3043.328,You certainly can do that.
1993.93-180,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3047.29,3049.403,"Oh, I think we agree on the separateness of the question."
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3089.908,3091.368,--That's right.
1993.93-180,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.942,3117.935,"Mr. Mann, what is the Government's position on the variation of the proportional liability rule that has been proposed?"
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3117.935,3121.428,I guess I'd like... there seems just... there's two new rules.
1993.93-180,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3156.152,3156.991,But you don't favor that.
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3161.295,3161.876,Okay.
1993.93-180,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.417,3166.718,Right.
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3166.718,3172.362,"--under which the nonsettling defendant can choose between the pro rata and pro tanto approaches, we don't favor that rule, either."
1993.93-180,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.728,3212.878,But at least you could say he got what he deserved.
1993.93-180,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3212.878,3224.364,"--Well, that's our view of why we don't like... we would disagree with the one recovery rule, is that the plaintiff... we think the plaintiff gets what he deserves, and we think that the nonsettling tortfeasor pays what they deserve."
1993.93-180,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3243.899,3244.898,"Or a television show, maybe."
1993.93-180,3,21387,david_f_pope,,3250.624,3255.667,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-180,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.354,3406.245,"Thank you, Mr. Pope."
