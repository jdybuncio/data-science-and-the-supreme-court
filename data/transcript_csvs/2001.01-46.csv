2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.688,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 01-46, the Federal Maritime Commission v. the South Carolina State Ports Authority."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,11.878,28.635,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The adjudication of a Shipping Act complaint by the Federal Maritime Commission is an administrative regulatory process through which the agency makes findings of fact and applies its interpretation of the Shipping Act to those findings of fact."
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,31.19,36.288,"Well, why isn't that adjudication, if it applies the law to findings of fact?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,36.288,41.131,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is adjudication, but what we're suggesting is that it's not judicial."
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,50.059,59.483,But doesn't it involve a decision as to whether this particular respondent before the commission has violated some provision of the act?
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,59.483,64.602,"Yes, and in that sense, Your Honor, it is an exercise of ad hoc regulation."
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,67.792,75.136,"Well, you could say the same thing about a court, that it's not making an... making an ad hoc regulation on these particular facts."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,75.136,86.091,"However, Your Honor, in the case of a court and a decision issued by a court, such an order would be self-executing, whereas a Federal Maritime Commission regulatory determination is not self-executing."
2001.01-46,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,101.168,101.878,Suppose Congress--
2001.01-46,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.878,113.931,"--Well, presumably a State would feel... would hesitate not to appear because it might ultimately be enforced against the State by the Attorney General, isn't that right?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,113.931,116.838,"Yes, I think that is correct, Justice O'Connor, that a State might--"
2001.01-46,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.838,123.771,"Well, if the State is compelled to participate, does that alter our analysis of it?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,123.771,136.998,"--No, I don't think so, because the extent to which the State feels compelled by a potential action by the Attorney General of the United States is compulsion that arises from an action of the Federal Government itself in the name of the United States."
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.998,146.182,"What if a... is a private plaintiff entitled to take a decision, or order, whatever you want to call it, of the commission, and seek to have it enforced by a court?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,146.182,150.747,"Yes, Your Honor, under the Shipping Act a private plaintiff is permitted to go into a Federal district court--"
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.747,155.494,And would the Eleventh Amendment defense raised by the State there prevail?
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,155.494,160.326,--I think that that case would present a much more significant Eleventh Amendment issue.
2001.01-46,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,177.622,195.126,"Do you concede that at least as to reparation, where as I understand it the Government can go into the district court to seek reparations, only the private party, at least as to seeking dollars from the State agency, that the Eleventh Amendment would preclude that?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,195.126,214.0,"Well, in its order in this case, Justice Ginsburg, the commissioner finds that it would like to see its reparation orders deemed to be enforceable by a Federal district court, so I can't concede that they wouldn't be, but what I can say is that determination is not within the agency's jurisdiction."
2001.01-46,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.158,232.662,"Mr. Hughey, why do you assume that if this is not judicial action, sovereign immunity doesn't apply?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,252.534,256.326,I don't know whether foreign sovereigns can be summoned before the--
2001.01-46,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.326,262.171,"Well, but the State sovereign immunity is just what... the sovereign immunity that they had at international law."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,293.345,301.66,"--Well, I think that one can turn to the text of the Eleventh Amendment itself for some guidance on this issue, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-46,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.66,316.801,"No, you can't, because the Eleventh Amendment is just... we have held that it represents just a reflection of the fact that the States retained that sovereign immunity that they had before the formation of the Federal Republic, and--"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,316.801,321.318,"It's a reflection, Your Honor, of the immunity from coercive judicial process."
2001.01-46,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,327.004,346.977,"--That's the conclusion, but what Justice Scalia's asking, and I think we're interested in, is whether there's any precedent that you could cite, any historical source that says that an administrative tribunal can summon a sovereign before it and render a judgment."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,346.977,353.516,"--Well, if I may suggest a different side to that is that there is no precedent to suggest that it can't."
2001.01-46,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.148,365.628,"Well, but if it's the dog that didn't bark theory, it seems to me that cuts against you."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,369.59,374.924,"No, I think it has been done since the Shipping Act was first passed, and it simply--"
2001.01-46,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,374.924,376.401,I'm not talking about the Shipping Act.
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,388.561,396.929,--This Court held in California v. United States that the Shipping Act as a regulatory statute applies to all State-run courts.
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.345,409.078,"But California v. United States, the United States was a party, so there was no Eleventh Amendment question there."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,409.078,423.82,"No, the question I think was whether the entire statute, which at that time included a regulatory procedure that could be initiated by private complainants, whether the entire statute, which was a coherent regulatory scheme, applied to State-run ports, and that's what the Court held."
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,434.769,439.201,"But the case itself, United States v. California, raised no Eleventh Amendment problem."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,439.201,440.902,"No, that's correct."
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,454.305,490.737,"Is there any... I mean, it's sort of an interesting question, but I wonder if there are laws or rules which say that the Congress says that any ship, including ships belonging to foreign States that enter New York Harbor, will abide by the rules of the New York Harbor Authority, and if they don't, you can... there's some argument about whether the pilot comes on or something, that ship, including a military ship of a foreign nation, or any other, has to adjudicate the controversy in front of the New York Authority or other... I don't know how that works, but maybe you do."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,496.412,508.481,"--Yes, I would think so, and the commission does have some jurisdiction over foreign-operated and... foreign operated vessels that are owned by sovereigns."
2001.01-46,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,526.897,550.177,"How do you get around the, sort of the principle of dignity which has been emphasized in every case, I think, since Seminole, and it's been given a prominent place in the reasoning of the court majority in those cases, that it's the dignity of the States, and so on, which must be preserved."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,579.825,583.942,"I think I would have two responses to that, Justice Souter."
2001.01-46,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,590.086,594.289,"Well, that leaves the question in a... unanswered, I guess."
2001.01-46,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.249,599.19,--Justice Souter says the sovereign immunity interest is co-extensive with the dignitary interest.
2001.01-46,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,602.23,603.857,Let's assume the co-existence.
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,605.068,610.326,"--Well, I think the answer would be, then, that sovereign immunity doesn't apply, that a State's dignity is not offended."
2001.01-46,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,610.326,612.092,I certainly agree with you.
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,626.897,637.745,"Well, I think that the dignity of the State is less offended by this type of regulatory adjudication, given the fact that the agency has no coercive power to compel anything from the State."
2001.01-46,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,637.745,640.572,I... it seems to me intuitively just the opposite.
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,664.012,673.601,"Well, I think the offense to the dignity interest of the State occurs when a State is forced to do something which is the result of a coercive act."
2001.01-46,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,674.982,680.124,"Everything was fine in Seminole and all of them, until we got to the point of judgment?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,682.87,683.388,--No.
2001.01-46,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.345,704.79,"Well, they could have made them appear and just said, you know, we understand that... just as you're saying, we understand that an order can't issue against you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't show up."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,714.886,730.476,"Well, I think with respect to your hypothetical this Court has found the power of coercion or contempt is the judicial power necessary to the exercise of all others, so I don't think that a court could just tell a State, well, appear and we're not going to be able to issue an order against you."
2001.01-46,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.929,745.43,"Well, but the court can't say it, but the Eleventh Amendment says it."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,762.134,775.708,"Well, yes, the State can move to dismiss any suit that's filed against it in a court, but I still think that it's the threat of coercive judgment against the State that is the reason that the State can--"
2001.01-46,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.708,777.548,There is no threat of coercive judgment.
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,783.702,797.713,"--I don't think that analysis should apply to this statute, Justice Scalia, because under the Shipping Act the agency can... cannot compel an appearance by the State."
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,825.862,828.23,Does the commission have contempt powers?
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,828.23,829.132,No.
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.284,841.281,"Well, if it issues its process to a State and the... like the entity in the present case, and the entity simply fails to show up, what can it do?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,841.281,855.505,"If the entity failed to show up, Mr. Chief Justice, the commission could issue an order telling it to show up, but again, that would have to be enforced by a Federal district court, and if--"
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.505,857.841,"At the behest of the Attorney General, or--"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,857.841,858.204,--Yes.
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,869.084,879.308,"--And what would be the Eleventh Amendment situation there, when the commission went into district court to try to enforce its order to require appearing?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,879.308,886.412,"Oh, I would suggest that there would be no Eleventh Amendment problem there, because the enforcement action would be in the name of and by the United States."
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.412,887.506,It would be by the United States?
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,887.506,887.762,Yes.
2001.01-46,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,894.295,907.474,"How many agencies have a pattern like this, where they determine the rules by rule-making, this kind of adjudication, and a commission-initiated proceeding?"
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,907.474,919.997,"I know that the Surface Transportation Board, which used to be the NSA Commerce Commission, has this authority, and I think that the Federal Communication Commission does, but I'm not entirely certain of that."
2001.01-46,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.136,953.027,"Well, Congress could certainly handle that by making it very clear by legislation that if the State runs one of these operations, the State waives its sovereign immunity."
2001.01-46,0,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,954.872,963.389,I'm not sure if that kind of waiver is still acceptable after this Court's opinions of recent years.
2001.01-46,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.625,995.134,"Very well, Mr. Hughey."
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1000.451,1013.737,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: States enjoy no sovereign immunity from Federal executive branch action, even when it takes the form of adjudication."
2001.01-46,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1050.275,1052.846,But I'm not... I don't understand the argument.
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1069.945,1070.686,No--
2001.01-46,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1070.686,1074.51,But here we have a private party.
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1076.585,1082.003,"--But we have a private party that's not initiating a lawsuit, but is initiating executive action."
2001.01-46,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.342,1113.63,"Yes, but--"
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1113.63,1115.614,--the executive branch and explain why there wasn't a violation.
2001.01-46,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1115.614,1118.27,--But the commission isn't just like kind of an ombudsman here.
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1123.566,1139.582,"Well, they do resemble adjudication, and that's part of the process to formalize and regularize this process of getting complaints from citizens and response from others, but I don't think the formalization and regularization of that process turns it into a judicial act."
2001.01-46,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1140.601,1153.246,"Well, isn't it the case that if the State defaults and says, you have no jurisdiction over me, and the commission therefore comes to a conclusion... we'll leave the word adjudication out of it."
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1162.846,1165.71,"--Well, first I want to clarify something."
2001.01-46,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1175.721,1177.758,Let's assume it's not contrary.
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1204.073,1208.174,It is... it would be enforceable through a judicial procedure under the Shipping Act.
2001.01-46,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1208.174,1236.126,"So... if that is so, there's something much more involved here than merely an agency of the National Government taking a complaint seriously and investigating it, and the difference is that in the... under the act, its conclusion on the investigation becomes an enforceable order at the behest of the National Government in a district court, and isn't that the difference?"
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1236.126,1247.891,"But I don't think it's a critical difference, because the reason that that becomes enforceable, subject to whatever defenses there are, the reason that becomes enforceable is not because it's the midway point in some litigation."
2001.01-46,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1255.129,1273.145,"Well, the Federal Government could have an interpretation of the Shipping Act and go into it... assuming there is otherwise a statutory jurisdiction here, the National Government could have a view of the shipping Act and go into the district court and say, this is our considered view, and the other party would have an opportunity to oppose it."
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1289.006,1289.006,"--Well, there are some challenges that can be brought to that, and I guess the problem with this--"
2001.01-46,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1289.006,1295.849,Could they have a trial de novo on the merits?
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1295.849,1297.593,"--No, they can't, under the current system."
2001.01-46,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1297.593,1306.542,"Could they collaterally attack and say, look, it doesn't mean anything to us, because we can't be hauled in front of the commission by a private party."
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1310.574,1312.889,"I don't think it currently is, but if that's--"
2001.01-46,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1312.889,1325.55,"No, I don't think it is, either, and that's why your argument that this is nothing but a way for the National Government to take a considered view of a complaint and come to a conclusion seems to me beside the point."
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1325.55,1336.382,"--Well, it... but the point, I think... first of all, if the problem is the level of review that's given at the end of the process, then that's what should be adjusted, not throwing out the entire proceeding ab initio as the Fourth Circuit did."
2001.01-46,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1367.897,1383.929,"Well, Mr. Clement, when I began to read your brief and I sensed that the sky was falling, and so I was turning my pages to see all of the horrible things that were going to happen to the Federal scheme if the court of appeals judgment stood, and I didn't see much there."
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1403.859,1414.318,--What there is a tradition of is the executive branch having the flexibility to determine how it is going to enforce Federal law.
2001.01-46,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.59,1457.678,What about the labor board?
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1457.678,1458.478,What's that?
2001.01-46,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1458.478,1460.051,"What about the labor board, universities?"
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1460.051,1461.091,"Well,--"
2001.01-46,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.091,1462.659,State universities and the labor board.
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1462.659,1465.321,"--I don't know the specific application, but--"
2001.01-46,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1465.321,1478.915,"No, but I'm thinking that the universities often have unions, and I gather that... why hasn't the labor board been involved in adjudicating complaints about the State university as an employer in respect to the labor unions?"
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1478.915,1480.153,--Well--
2001.01-46,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1480.153,1480.841,Maybe it hasn't.
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1482.643,1489.785,"--I mean, but one thing that's certainly clear about the labor board is that that's a perfect example of an administrative agency that decides to proceed by adjudication."
2001.01-46,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.785,1490.43,I'm not arguing with you.
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1492.713,1500.601,"Well, another example is the Railway Labor Act, because the Railway Labor Act is... defines its jurisdiction coextensively with the Interstate Commerce Commission."
2001.01-46,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1588.83,1593.315,"Well, it's not... you keep speaking about an Eleventh Amendment bar."
2001.01-46,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1602.334,1609.865,"--But in this particular context, I think the text is relevant, because this is not a free-floating, pre-existing notion of sovereign immunity."
2001.01-46,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.683,1620.825,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,1622.969,1637.091,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the question of whether sovereign immunity protects a State from a private suit brought before a Federal administrative tribunal."
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1693.977,1698.553,"Mr. Dean, but that was an Article I court that just adjudicates."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,1730.873,1732.627,"We've made that clear throughout this proceeding, Justice."
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1732.627,1733.241,All right.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,1748.147,1751.843,"That's exactly... that is exactly what does not happen in this case, Your Honor."
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1797.166,1797.86,Can the private party ask--
2001.01-46,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1797.86,1799.94,--have standing?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,1799.94,1807.78,"They have to show cause for intervention, Justice Kennedy, just like any other private party would do."
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1809.801,1823.62,"But could a private party say to the commission, commission, here's a serious complaint, something wrong has been done, I don't have the resources to prosecute it, would you please investigate it?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,1823.62,1824.494,"Oh, absolutely."
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.414,1902.457,"Well, is that statutory liability, is that enforceable by the commission without court order, or did it have to go to court to do it?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,1902.457,1929.428,"--Ultimately, if push comes to shove and there's a confrontation, they have to go to court, but Mr. Chief Justice, I think anybody faced with a statutory liability of the United States imposed by Federal law considers that a sanction, and we do not have the opportunity to protect our interests, to say, no, no, no, this wasn't a violation, this is what we did, when the agency, the only standard for the enforcement of the agency's order in court is whether or not it was duly and regularly issued."
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1944.462,1947.044,Could I go back to your opening statement?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,1983.246,1984.03,The court below held--
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1984.03,1988.59,"Whatever they held, I want to know what the reasoning of it is."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,1988.59,1991.15,"--Well, the reasoning... the judicial... you don't need to find the judicial power."
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.15,1992.132,You don't?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2003.524,2015.129,"This is a case brought by a citizen of the State of South Carolina, like Chisholm v. Georgia, I might add, against the... against a... the State of South Carolina."
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.033,2024.196,"All right, fine, it's not within the scope of the Eleventh Amendment."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2024.196,2025.577,It's Hans v. Louisiana.
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.577,2050.878,"Oh, no, no, I want to know if it is with... forget the fact... I think it is within the scope of the Eleventh Amendment if a... I believed, as far as I know, when a citizen of a State sues the State itself, of which he is a citizen, it is an interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment, and I didn't know that for that purpose you didn't have to find the judicial power of the United States, so I'm open to that argument."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2050.878,2051.177,Well--
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.177,2054.244,"I want to know, is this the judicial power?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2062.045,2080.281,"--First, it is... we have stated it is the judicial power, but you need not find that, and I'll give you the reason it is the judicial power of the United States, is because this agency acts as an adjunct to the court, just as this Court has held in Northern Pipeline and--"
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2080.281,2081.396,Do all administrative--
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2081.396,2085.976,--Did you say it was the exercise of judicial power?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2085.976,2091.721,"--It is the exercise of... the Shipping Act entails the exercise of judicial power, Justice Stevens."
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.566,2112.516,"Does the Federal Trade Commission exercise the judicial power, does the State Department, does the Commerce Department, the Post Office... I mean, what is the principle under which this is or is not?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2112.516,2113.753,"Well, the--"
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2113.753,2120.489,"What about the President, let's say, when he's... you see the point."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2120.489,2128.681,"--In your book, Justice Breyer, you call this an uneasy constitutional area, and I certainly agree with that."
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.798,2196.308,"You know, now that I can quote one of my favorite authors, Justice Scalia, he says it is no doubt true that all such administrative bodies adjudicate, they determine facts, apply a rule of law to those facts, and thus arrive at a decision--"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2196.308,2196.852,Well--
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.852,2199.849,--but there is nothing inherently judicial about adjudication.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2199.849,2200.404,"--Granted, but--"
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2200.404,2203.145,Then what is it that makes it the judicial power?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2203.145,2208.377,"--What is it that makes it subject to sovereign immunity, or what is it that makes it the judicial power?"
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2208.377,2210.446,The judicial power is what we're all... and I'm--
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2210.446,2226.212,"Well, the judicial power, if you look at a proceeding, an administrative proceeding like the Shipping Act, and this Court held that, held this in the Far East Conference case, it said, you can't take one isolated aspect of it."
2001.01-46,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.886,2247.508,--All executive action does.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2261.593,2262.302,"--Well, this is--"
2001.01-46,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.302,2268.873,"Ultimately, the court is the moment of truth, but that doesn't convert every executive action into an exercise of the judicial power."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2268.873,2271.662,"--I know, but this is clearly not purely executive action."
2001.01-46,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.753,2284.11,"Ah, so if this wasn't an independent agency, it would be different?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2284.11,2291.508,"--No, but let me... both in Hensel and in Artistani, and in this Court's decision in West v. Gibson--"
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.508,2293.118,Would you... may I just interrupt you?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2298.276,2301.913,--Like... the claims court was within the Department of Treasury at the time these decisions were handed down.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.969,2311.465,"Well, but that's not answering my question."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2311.465,2312.846,--and its officers are not subject to executive supervision.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.846,2314.116,What is your answer to my question?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2319.177,2320.206,No.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.825,2333.972,"In the statuary process, but clearly an executive agency within the Department of Commerce or Department of Agriculture, or something like that."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2333.972,2339.172,"--It was... the court of claims was in the Department of Treasury at the time, and customs officials have done--"
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.172,2341.55,You're a little too fast for me.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2341.55,2341.966,--I'm sorry.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.966,2343.049,What is your answer?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2346.329,2346.601,It is.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.601,2347.214,Okay.
2001.01-46,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2347.214,2350.121,Let me ask you a slightly different question.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2356.83,2359.274,No.
2001.01-46,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2359.274,2359.514,Why don't you lose?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2359.514,2360.447,The court below said it was irrelevant.
2001.01-46,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2360.447,2360.81,Pardon me?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2360.81,2363.471,"The court below said it was irrelevant, and I agree with that proposition."
2001.01-46,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2363.471,2364.468,And it's irrelevant because?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2364.468,2367.247,Because sovereign immunity--
2001.01-46,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2367.247,2372.82,"Sovereign immunity... in other words, you've got a sovereign immunity argument which is at least distinct from the Eleventh Amendment argument?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2372.82,2373.386,--Absolutely.
2001.01-46,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2373.386,2373.748,Okay.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2373.748,2377.631,"And the United States has a sovereign immunity argument, and they apply sovereign immunity--"
2001.01-46,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2377.631,2378.868,That's what I thought.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2378.868,2382.367,--The United States applies its sovereign immunity in proceedings just like this.
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2406.735,2413.572,"Well, but sovereign immunity for the United States may not be co-extensive with sovereign immunity for the States."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2420.26,2432.826,"Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with that proposition in the abstract, but in this particular case, I think there's a lot of similarity, and I'll give you exactly... I'll tell you exactly why I think why."
2001.01-46,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.703,2442.298,Excuse me.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2444.34,2455.951,"--Well, in Alden and in Hans and... the Court has held that the privilege of Federal sovereign immunity... State sovereign immunity is a reciprocal privilege to the privilege enjoyed by the States."
2001.01-46,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.951,2460.127,By reciprocal you mean that it's co-extensive?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2460.127,2463.194,"Co-extensive mirror image, yes, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.972,2515.327,"Well, you don't think the States have--"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2515.327,2515.652,--Pardon me?
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.652,2520.506,"--the exclusive right to determine when their money will be spent in a proceeding brought by the United States, do you?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2520.506,2521.071,Excuse me?
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.071,2530.26,"You don't say that the States have the same power over their own money that the United States has over its money, in an action brought by the United States?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2530.26,2530.618,I do.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.618,2534.506,There's sovereign immunity... even in an action brought by the United States?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2534.506,2539.978,"No, this Court has held that they have consented to suit, so it doesn't apply in that area."
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.978,2542.724,So they don't have sovereign immunity in cases brought by the United States.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2542.724,2552.564,"That's correct, but in this constitution of the State of South Carolina that was adopted 9 years before this Constitution was adopted, there is the same Appropriations Clause."
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.919,2560.394,But that was before the Supremacy Clause was adopted in the Federal Constitution.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2560.394,2564.127,--But this is a constitutional principle Justice Stevens.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.13,2572.036,It is not a constitutional protection... principle that protects the States from liability to the United States.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2572.036,2575.823,--I ask you this question as a hypothetical.
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2576.58,2578.852,"No, counsel doesn't ask questions."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2580.228,2581.738,"--I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2608.543,2609.215,Mr. Dean--
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2609.215,2611.519,"Now, you have these two comparable constitutions."
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2613.407,2613.994,--Mr. Dean--
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2613.994,2616.244,"I don't know the answer to that question, Justice Stevens."
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2616.244,2626.404,"--you recognized a case called Ex parte Young, and let's say that the private complainant says, okay, I'm not going to sue the State court authorities."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2654.522,2662.298,"That suit belongs in Federal court, and I doubt very seriously that the commission has that statutory jurisdiction."
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2690.02,2692.095,But you haven't answered the question--
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2692.095,2693.396,"I'm sorry, Justice--"
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2693.396,2694.362,--why couldn't the FMC say--
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2694.362,2701.748,--I don't believe the Shipping Act gives the FMC jurisdiction over individuals who are employees of entities that are engaged in--
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.748,2707.194,"--Not employees, the commissioners themselves, the members of the State body."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2707.194,2715.135,--The officers of the... I don't believe the Shipping Act gives the FMC jurisdiction over officers of entities that it regulates.
2001.01-46,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2726.676,2748.97,"But if that matter were clarified so that Congress, wanting the FMC to have this third way of regulating said, in the case where State agencies are involved you can sue the individuals, individuals who compose the entity--"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2748.97,2753.002,"Well, the proper way for the Federal Maritime... as I said, I don't think the FMC has that jurisdiction."
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2833.866,2842.783,"--Well, you really don't need your third argument, do you, that the State sovereign immunity is co-extensive with Federal sovereign immunity?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2842.783,2868.916,"I don't need that third argument, Mr. Chief Justice, that's quite correct, but what the United States asserts, says about administrative proceedings, if they were purely executive action... for example, if it was purely an executive branch matter, this... the United States has come into this Court on numerous occasions most recently in Artistani and West, and asked this Court to intervene in what they now say is a purely executive branch matter."
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2888.095,2890.026,"Oh, what is the boundary?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2918.154,2920.367,--If the President does something and the President--
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2920.367,2921.988,"No, I'm just asking... my question is--"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2921.988,2925.3,--Hans... Hans v. Louisiana is the only place you need to go.
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2925.3,2927.844,"--In other words, Hans you say is outside the scope of the Eleventh Amendment."

2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2930.89,2934.175,"All right, so Hans does not have to do with the Eleventh Amendment."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2934.175,2936.57,It does not by its terms have anything to do--
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2936.57,2937.178,"Okay, it does not."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2937.178,2937.898,--it reflects the--
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2937.898,2944.186,Then how do I discover the scope of this principle of State sovereign immunity outside the Eleventh Amendment?
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2944.186,2947.898,"--Well, the same way you discover the principle of Federal sovereign immunity."
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.146,2966.847,"But as I understand your argument, it's not limited to the reparations part of the case."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2967.194,2967.615,No.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.615,2970.831,--also a request for a cease and desist order.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2970.831,2972.677,"Although I might add, Justice Stevens--"
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2972.677,2974.693,You don't really need the reparations for your position.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,2974.693,2984.191,"--that the pure participation in this lengthy proceeding has had consequences for the Treasury of the State of South Carolina, but nonetheless, it's much broader than that, yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.485,3037.589,But let me just--
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3037.589,3039.381,"--based on unanswered allegations, or unanswerable allegations."
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3039.381,3041.482,"--May I interrupt you for just a moment, please?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3041.482,3041.871,Justice Stevens.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.871,3047.61,"Let's put the reparations to one side, and let's assume you're dead right on the monetary aspect of the case."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3064.751,3079.023,"No, it's far better, Justice Stevens, to have a person come to the agency, present its concerns to the agency, and the agency approach the State of South Carolina, one sovereign to another sovereign."
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3098.026,3098.773,"No, but if you have--"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3098.773,3100.41,--has the right to preempt the Congress.
2001.01-46,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.41,3117.13,"--If you have an issue such as this in which the agency thinks there's a colorable basis for a proceeding, do you think the only way they can proceed against you formally is to first of all get all the information ex parte from the private parties, and then make up their own mind as to whether to bring a formal proceeding in the name of the agency?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3117.13,3142.639,"Just like the Department of Justice does when it enforces the laws against the States, yes, Your Honor, that is the proper way of doing it, because we can and will address those allegations at that time, but I can assure you that the... this case implements policies of the State of South Carolina that are important to it, the regulation of gaming ships, the Johnson Act Congress has said it's up to the State of South Carolina to make those policies and to implement those policies--"
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3142.639,3150.746,"Well, but the Johnson Act certainly didn't say that South Carolina was exempt from the requirement of the Shipping Act, that it not discriminate."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3150.746,3168.171,"--No, but I can... that's correct, but in... any regulatory system has at its core the right to make discretionary, discriminatory judgments about what does and does not comply with the policies of that regime."
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3168.171,3168.853,Well--
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3168.853,3176.469,And the FMC is now sitting in judge... as a judge of the... of our implementation of State law as authorized by the Johnson Act.
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3176.469,3190.091,"--Well, certainly you're not suggesting that the Shipping Act in its prohibition against discrimination can't be applied to South Carolina other than on a sovereign immunity basis, are you?"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3190.091,3201.883,"No, we're not, but what we're saying is that if they exercise the executive discretion that they ought to act, that the Constitution envisions them enacting, that they would approach us as a sovereign, we'd say, these are our sovereign interests, they'd say, they are their sovereign interests--"
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3201.883,3202.304,"Well, yes, but--"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3202.304,3204.741,"--ultimately they would trump ours, if there was a disagreement--"
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.741,3205.163,--Yes.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3211.92,3233.877,"--That's true, but in this particular area the Congress has decided that the sovereign State of South Carolina gets to do the regulating, Mr. Chief Justice, so we would come down and we would have two different regulatory regimes, and we would approach each other, and we would resolve the differences between them, and if they disagreed, if ultimately they disagree, they could bring a complaint against us, which they have the right to do, and we would defend it, and we would participate."
2001.01-46,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3238.928,3248.357,"It would not be, perhaps, as intellectually satisfying as resolving the case specifically on the merits."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3254.8,3257.019,--There is no statement that waives sovereign immunity.
2001.01-46,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3264.011,3267.509,But there's no clear statement by the Congress of the United States intending abrogate--
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3267.509,3268.912,"Oh, no, clearly not."
2001.01-46,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3360.587,3362.624,--But only to the extent they're seeking a money judgment.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3362.624,3366.96,"--No, Your Honor, I think the sovereign immunity--"
2001.01-46,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3366.96,3368.389,"Well, Hans was purely a money judgment."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3368.389,3374.171,"--Yes, but they held that the Court was... they held the State immune from the proceeding."
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3393.824,3395.179,But Hans was a court case.
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3395.179,3396.891,--Hans is a court case.
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3396.891,3400.581,"Well, I mean, it's not a case, then, in which they say it's not the judicial power--"
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3400.581,3402.235,Just like Federal sovereign immunity is a court case.
2001.01-46,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3402.235,3408.795,"--And why is it a case in which they say... isn't it... I mean, I'm back on my judicial... forget it, I'm sorry."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3408.795,3409.712,My time is up.
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3409.712,3410.597,"Thank you, Mr. Dean."
2001.01-46,2,44415,warren_l_dean_jr,,3410.597,3411.797,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-46,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3411.797,3413.573,"Mr. Hughey, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2001.01-46,3,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,3413.573,3424.688,"If I could keep going with your inquiry, Justice Breyer, I think we are suggesting that there is a line in this case, and that line is Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
2001.01-46,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3510.443,3513.376,Why is it that you cannot fine the State?
2001.01-46,3,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,3513.376,3531.44,"I think the United States has suggested that because the commission and the Attorney General don't have the authority to enforce a reparation order against a State, that the authority to fine the State for not complying with that reparation order would not be an appropriate interpretation of the Shipping Act."
2001.01-46,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3539.824,3548.896,Could the commission substitute the commissioners of the South Carolina Ports Authority for the port authority itself?
2001.01-46,3,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,3548.896,3572.79,"I'm unsure of that, Justice Ginsburg, but we would suggest that the pleading requirements of Ex parte Young need not be imported into the Shipping Act, and that a request for, for example, a cease and desist order against the ports authority would, under the Shipping Act, be sufficient, and that the complaint need not name the commissioners of the ports authority themselves."
2001.01-46,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3576.315,3587.83,"I think what Justice Ginsburg's question went to, you're saying you don't have to name the individuals, but suppose that we held that you couldn't name the State, do you think you have authority to name the individuals?"
2001.01-46,3,38006,phillip_c_hughey,,3587.83,3590.075,"I'm unsure of that, Justice Scalia."
2001.01-46,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3612.582,3614.198,"Thank you, Mr. Hughey."
