2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.31,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-1132, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith v. Manning. Mr. Hacker."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,9.31,28.345,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In language that differs distinctly from the ""arising under"" language of Section 1331, Exchange Act Section 27 confers on the Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty created by the Exchange Act and its regulations."
2015.14-1132,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,101.275,137.46,"Now, does your -- does your test depend solely on what is alleged in the complaint or what might be proven under a -- a more generally worded complaint? Suppose the complaint in this case made no reference to any Federal regulations but -- I'm not that familiar with the pleading rules in New Jersey, but suppose they would -- it was, you know, notice pleading and so there's no reference to the regulations but they -- they sought to prove their case by arguing that the New Jersey -- the New -- the rule in New Jersey should be the same as the Federal regulation."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,138.89,141.78,"The way you put it at the very end, the answer is no."
2015.14-1132,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.735,173.25,"So they could amend the complaint, and then we wouldn't be here, because they could amend the complaint to say that we're suing under New Jersey law and New Jersey law mirrors the Federal law."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,174.945,190.77,"The way I would put it is we wouldn't have been here if they had written that complaint to start with, but because removal -- jurisdiction is tested at the time of removal, if they amended their complaint now, it wouldn't change the fact that there's Federal jurisdiction based on the face of the complaint at the time of the -- of removal."
2015.14-1132,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.77,200.27,"Well, is the Court obligated to do a search of all Federal laws and regulations to know if this complaint might have a Federal cause of action?"
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,200.27,201.1,No.
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.82,209.4,But what you said --
2015.14-1132,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.4,217.91,"Let -- let me ask you: This -- this -- this -- let's assume, as Justice Alito assumed, that New Jersey is the same as the Federal system, notice pleading."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,230.645,232.31,Most complaints -- sure.
2015.14-1132,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,234.59,237.055,Let's say just under notice pleading under Federal standards.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,237.055,244.41,They would almost certainly set forth the -- the statute under which they're pleading. They're identifying the duty so that the Court understands what the nature of the claim is.
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.74,254.63,But they -- but they don't have to do that.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,261.98,296.02,"That's -- that's right in a limited sense that -- I think this Court would recognize and has recognized inartful pleading doctrine where, for example -- if you use this complaint as an example, if they had just literally whited out, deleted the references to Reg SHO as such but were clearly unambiguously pleading violations of its requirements with the same capital L, Locate, capital C, Close-Out requirements, you would unmistakably understand the complaint to be based on violations of the Act -- of the Exchange Act regulation seeking to enforce those duties. Then sure, the fact you didn't cite it wouldn't change the fact."
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,296.02,302.695,"Well, that imposes quite a -- quite an onerous task upon -- upon the Federal district court, it seems to me."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,319.31,338.48,"Well, but that -- that only goes to the question in an artful pleading situation, which this case doesn't present, and would be, you know, the next third, fourth, fifth case down the road. But certainly in -- in -- the defendant, you know, who moves or seeks jurisdiction, the party seeking to establish jurisdiction, would have to identify for the court the defendant's theory as to why the complaint seeks to enforce Federal duty."
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,350.85,352.62,I just don't understand how.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,352.62,353.96,-- about regulation --
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,353.96,363.0,"Meaning under Pan Am, we looked at the operative paragraphs of the complaint, not the general pleadings or background."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,379.32,380.14,A -- a couple of points.
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,392.64,394.17,"No, it looked at the operative paragraphs."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,394.56,394.74,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,395.09,397.825,The operative paragraphs here are the causes of action.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,397.825,420.975,"But then turning to this complaint, the -- the -- the court looks at the causes of action, each of which obviously incorporates, explicitly incorporates all of the prior conduct alleged as the basis for the violation of the cause of action and the -- the prior allegations and the causes of action themselves. The causes of action themselves are all about what the complaint -- the Respondents describe as illegal short-selling."
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,433.62,438.11,"Without the Federal law, would there be a duty under State law not to short sell?"
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,438.11,439.2,Not under this complaint.
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,440.42,444.545,Please go back to answer my direct question: If there were no Federal law.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,444.545,452.21,There is -- the answer is no. The Third Circuit itself said there is no analogue under New Jersey law to Regulation SHO.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,458.09,461.904,"Well, New Jersey -- New Jersey law certainly prohibits fraud."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,468.02,469.09,They -- they're saying --
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,469.09,472.52,"""This"" being what the -- the violation -- what you say is the violation of the Federal law."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,472.52,472.73,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,487.08,507.37,"So do they have to expand their allegation and say, okay, we're not going to call it ""a Locate,"" but we think it's fraud when you're, you know, short-selling this and you're supposed to have -- and you haven't borrowed this much, blah, blah, blah? In other words, just creating a parallel duty -- which I understood you to tell Justice Alito that would be okay."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,512.41,514.52,"Well, they're -- they're definitely not just using a -- a shorthand."
2015.14-1132,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,528.14,529.36,Then why isn't this just like --
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,529.36,529.63,But --
2015.14-1132,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.63,547.94,"There are -- there are many, many instances in which there is a State claim, say a State claim for negligence, and the negligent conduct is alleged to be violation of a Federal safety standard."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,562.815,565.66,Well -- but the language of this statute is different.
2015.14-1132,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,593.5,603.695,"So in your -- in your view, you have to -- if -- if -- if this Court finds that the section here, Section 27, is the same as ""arising under,"" you lose?"
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,603.695,605.75,"Well, no, but for a different reason."
2015.14-1132,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,618.78,619.19,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,632.71,658.82,"Not that it arises under Federal law, but that a suit under that State's standard says it is a violation of State law to violate Reg SHO -- for example, if New Jersey law said it is a violation, it is a -- you know, the statutory tort to violate Reg SHO, if that was the statute, and you brought a suit under that statute, you were -- and it was seeking to enforce the duties created by Reg SHO. That's why this language is different from ""arising under,"" because the suit was clearly --"
2015.14-1132,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,658.82,661.16,But what's the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,661.16,674.82,"It would not necessarily be -- it would be -- only be a suit ""arising under"" if it was necessary, but under this language, it would be a Federal court action because that suit would be a suit seeking to -- brought to enforce duties created by Reg SHO."
2015.14-1132,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,674.82,677.355,I don't understand. Necessary for what?
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,677.355,678.29,I'm sorry?
2015.14-1132,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,678.29,682.72,You said that it would be only a suit if it were -- Federal suit if it were necessary.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,682.72,683.44,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1132,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,722.955,732.365,"Mr. Hacker, just looking at the language, I mean, I understand your interpretation of it, but it seems to me that there's, you know, a -- just as good interpretation which says the opposite."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,760.35,766.155,"A couple of points, though. Remember, the statute doesn't say is the suit brought to enforce State law."
2015.14-1132,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,766.155,767.52,But State liabilities.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,767.52,770.415,It's also not said -- said brought to enforce State liabilities.
2015.14-1132,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,814.25,817.59,And you would say that's a duty created under this chapter.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,817.59,820.63,"Right, created -- the Reg SHO in this situation is a duty created --"
2015.14-1132,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,820.63,823.155,But why isn't it created under State law as well?
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,823.155,827.035,Because the -- the cause of action is created in State law.
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.09,877.815,"I think that's sort of ambiguous in the statute. Let's assume you have a State statute and a Federal statute, both of which impose the same duty. Okay? And someone brings a suit only under the State statute; does not -- does not even mention the Federal statute. As I understand your case, you would say that that person is suing to enforce a duty under Federal law."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,885.52,886.26,And I agree with you.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,911.89,912.48,So you would have no --
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,912.48,913.295,-- to enforce New Jersey duty.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,913.295,926.22,"You would have no case if New Jersey passed a law saying, as a matter of New Jersey law, we hereby adopt, you know, everything under the Securities Exchange Act, including, in particular, Regulation SHO."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,936.29,936.53,No.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,941.835,942.47,"Yes, it is."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,954.15,954.76,Sure.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,954.76,963.55,"Even though it's precisely the same at the same level of detail, you have to say under your theory that if you sue just under the New Jersey law, that's okay."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,963.55,970.5,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because there New Jersey is leaving to Congress and the SEC to decide what the law is."
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,979.205,979.89,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,979.89,983.93,The duty is created by the -- by the Exchange Act and its regulations.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,983.93,994.54,"No, the duty under New Jersey law is passed by whatever statute they enact saying we -- us too, we want to do it as well, as a matter of New Jersey law."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,994.54,998.34,But they can do it separate. They can establish their own independent duties.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,998.34,998.4,Yeah.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,998.4,1007.78,"But when they consciously choose not to create an independent duty, but to say that we're going to -- literally, in the hypothetical you're adopting, they're literally saying we're incorporating the Federal duty."
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1008.44,1010.535,And as New Jersey -- as New Jersey law.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1010.535,1011.09,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1024.05,1037.17,"But then you're going to be in a situation where the judge is going to have to try to figure out whether State law exactly mimics Federal law, or whether there are minor deviations from Federal law."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1040.78,1044.46,"Well, all jurisdictional tests will have, you know, challenges at the margin."
2015.14-1132,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1044.46,1046.21,I don't think this is a marginal question.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1057.515,1061.725,"I think, in practice, there is quite a clear margin because States make different choices in this."
2015.14-1132,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1089.01,1126.655,"Why couldn't the New Jersey Supreme Court -- why couldn't the New Jersey Supreme Court say this is our interpretation of a provision of the -- the New Jersey Uniform Securities Act, with respect to short selling, this is what it means, and without ever referring to Reg SHO, adopt basically the same or exactly the same rule that is incorporated in that regulation? Would you say that then an -- that an action under that provision of the New Jersey Securities Act would be one seeking to enforce a Federal duty?"
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1126.655,1126.83,No.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1147.47,1148.07,But it seems to me --
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1148.07,1148.52,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1148.52,1151.475,The only one who benefits from that are -- are printing companies.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1160.29,1160.86,"Well, no."
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.83,1207.52,"What if -- what if the State law says -- and I'm not sure this one doesn't. What if the State law says, we are adopting the disposition of the current regulation in, you know, in -- in 2015; all right? That's all it says."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1215.32,1218.97,"I mean, that would be an unusual way for a court to conduct itself, but if it did that --"
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.97,1219.91,Why? Why? Why?
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1219.91,1221.11,"Well, I've never seen it before."
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.11,1222.93,The court likes this regulation.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1231.01,1242.225,"I think that's right if the court said and made it clear that we find, as a matter of New Jersey fraud, that under New Jersey fraud law, if you don't get a Locate in accordance with SEC requirements --"
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.225,1243.59,Current SEC requirements.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1243.59,1249.16,"Yeah, and that could change. And it's clear that it's an independent -- independently created duty, but none of this is at issue here."
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1249.16,1252.2,Isn't that what the court is going to do when it hears this action?
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1252.2,1252.77,I'm sorry?
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1252.77,1262.23,Isn't that what the State court's going to do when it hears this action? There's nothing about the alleged causes of action -- they allege theft and fraud.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1270.345,1273.4,"But -- well, they also allege unjust enrichment and negligence --"
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1273.4,1274.34,All of that.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1274.34,1274.66,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1274.66,1284.38,"Now, that might be something you could object to at trial if they try to say State law is the same as Federal law and can't prove it."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1306.51,1306.83,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.68,1343.9,"Surely they mean the current regulations, right? And you've just told me that if the State law applies only to the current regulation, it is not adopting Federal law, right? So this complaint is referring to the current regulation. How do you know it's referring to that regulation as it may change in the future?"
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1343.9,1346.06,"Well, it's -- well, it's referring to past conduct."
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.85,1347.955,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1347.955,1350.93,-- because you violated the regulation as it exists today.
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.82,1355.1,Fine.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1355.1,1356.3,-- the SEC would require.
2015.14-1132,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.3,1366.355,"Because that regulation is a good regulation, and it ought to be New Jersey law. But if that regulation changes, we -- we don't say that it ought to be New Jersey law."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1366.355,1368.65,Let me try an exercise.
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.1,1412.09,"Then they'll lose under -- they brought a claim -- look, is it a necessary -- as a Federal issue, Federal issue is whether what they've done violates Regulation SHO."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1431.01,1432.75,"We think it is, but that's --"
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1432.75,1433.11,What do they --
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1433.11,1434.305,-- not the question here.
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1434.305,1435.655,I didn't ask you that.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1437.28,1439.23,We -- we think it is necessary --
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1439.23,1440.01,You think it is necessary.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1440.01,1440.13,-- but --
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1440.13,1440.535,Fine.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1441.57,1442.15,All right.
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1442.15,1444.685,Now they presumably think it isn't necessary.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1445.54,1445.93,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1445.93,1452.515,"So if it is necessary and you're right, then this case should have been brought under 1331."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1452.515,1453.19,That --
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1453.19,1455.7,"It wasn't, and we're not deciding that."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1460.6,1461.09,Correct.
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.09,1476.275,"Okay? If we assume it is not necessary, if we assume that the conditions for 1331 are not met, and therefore it doesn't get into Federal court for that reason, why would anyone want a case like that in Federal court when the States want to adjudicate it?"
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1476.275,1478.11,Because Congress wanted it in Federal court --
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1478.11,1480.19,And what is the evidence that Congress wanted that?
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1480.19,1481.28,The language of the statute.
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1481.28,1497.06,"And all you're left with is, you say, read the language of the statute, don't look to the purpose, don't look to surrounding -- don't look to the surrounding rules of law which actually make very little necessity for this to be in Federal court, and don't look to anything else."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1497.64,1497.96,"Your Honor, I --"
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1497.96,1499.12,And I agree you have your language.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1499.12,1499.61,"I'm sorry, but --"
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1499.61,1500.22,You have the language.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1501.88,1503.43,"No, I -- but I couldn't disagree with you more."
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1503.43,1503.68,Okay.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1504.415,1506.84,"The language, first of all, I think is unambiguous in our favor."
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1527.19,1529.315,So why -- why isn't the SEC here?
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1529.315,1532.54,"There's -- I mean, the SEC makes its own decisions."
2015.14-1132,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1538.345,1539.23,Curious.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1539.23,1539.79,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.0,1547.74,You are relying on a different language.
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1566.18,1566.505,Right.
2015.14-1132,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1566.505,1576.92,"So with respect to every one of those statutes, Public Utilities Holding Company, Federal Power Act, Connally Hot Oil, the same argument would apply to those statutes."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1576.92,1579.51,Those are all similarly narrowly prescribed statutes.
2015.14-1132,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1596.73,1601.98,"And you think we can reach that interpretation, even as to the Natural Gas Act consistent with Pan American?"
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1601.98,1602.42,Yes.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.53,1622.315,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.14-1132,0,62624,jonathan_d_hacker,,1622.315,1627.855,Thank you.
2015.14-1132,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1627.855,1633.98,Mr. Stris.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1633.98,1662.66,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is well-settled that jurisdictional statutes will not be interpreted to intrude on State judicial authority unless Congress makes its intention clear. Petitioners ask this Court to interpret Section 27 of the Exchange Act to strip State courts of jurisdiction, to decide State law-created claims when such claims have already failed the Grable test."
2015.14-1132,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1670.73,1675.79,"Why do you think, Mr. Stris, this different language was used in these ten statutes?"
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1675.79,1706.805,"So my -- my best answer is to mirror, essentially, what our amici public citizen and the State securities regulators have said, which is at the time that certainly the '33 Act and the '34 Act were passed, the Federal question statute had an amount-in-controversy requirement. Now, I understand that my friend, Mr. Hacker, points out in his reply that there's a current statute, 28 U.S.C. 1337, that was enacted in 1948."
2015.14-1132,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1739.55,1742.28,The amount in controversy wasn't very high.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1746.515,1749.28,"I don't know that that's true, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.14-1132,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1751.7,1754.435,"If it was $3,000, something like that?"
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1754.435,1755.47,Well --
2015.14-1132,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1755.47,1756.25,Or even less?
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1756.25,1778.86,"If we're attempting to ascertain why Congress would choose to use this language instead of other language, I would submit that any amount-in-controversy requirement, if they felt they didn't want that for purposes of Federally-created claims -- so this is going to segue into my first point -- we think the most natural reading of Section 27 is as a creation test. And so if that's what --"
2015.14-1132,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.86,1781.675,"$3,000 is probably a lot of money today."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1781.675,1782.755,I'm sorry?
2015.14-1132,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.755,1785.9,"$3,000 is probably a lot of money today."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1785.9,1787.69,"Well, I don't --"
2015.14-1132,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.69,1791.87,"Would you like to have 3,000 1934 dollars?"
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1791.87,1792.16,Yeah.
2015.14-1132,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1795.5,1799.15,"That's a yes-or-no question, counsel. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1799.15,1807.29,"I would like any money that anyone on the Court or in the courthouse would like to give me, and I'll be taking collections after -- after the argument."
2015.14-1132,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1807.29,1812.37,"If -- if -- if your answer is correct, why do they need to use the term ""exclusive""? Why don't they just -- just -- just --"
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1812.37,1812.78,So let me --
2015.14-1132,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1812.78,1814.61,-- there is jurisdiction in Federal court.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1817.545,1817.8,"No, no."
2015.14-1132,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1917.87,1918.46,Over --
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1918.46,1918.98,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1132,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1975.36,1976.935,But Congress must have --
2015.14-1132,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1976.935,1977.265,Yes.
2015.14-1132,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1977.755,1985.69,"Congress must have had in mind a certain category of claims that it did not want adjudicated in State court, correct?"
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1985.69,1986.21,I agree.
2015.14-1132,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1986.21,1986.71,All right.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2032.58,2047.08,"I -- I don't think you've gone wrong, but I think that that position is firmly supported by history, if we look at the context. And let me explain what I mean. So at the time the Exchange Act was passed, there were only three express rights of action, and they were very minor."
2015.14-1132,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2102.565,2114.08,Supposing that you had brought this claim specifically to enjoin violations of this SHO regulation.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2120.62,2128.77,"Well, I think as a factual matter, Justice Ginsburg, that couldn't happen because the conduct would have already occurred."
2015.14-1132,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2196.775,2209.92,"Can I ask you to describe your complaint? In other words, Mr. Hacker has a certain characterization or description of your complaint, and the -- and the -- the role played in your complaint by the regulation."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2219.045,2225.13,"I understand, Justice Kagan. So I think there's been some misunderstanding of what we're alleging."
2015.14-1132,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2334.54,2360.15,"Well, I just -- yes. I mean, but there are parts of your complaint that go in much greater detail and focus on the Federal Rules. I -- I think Paragraph 33 says, you know, as set forth in detail herein, the defendants violated the trading rules and regulations requiring that they actually deliver shares they owed to the DTCC to settle short-sale transactions. That's a duty imposed by Federal law."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2360.15,2362.5,"This is a very important point, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.14-1132,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2398.13,2404.21,"Well, along these lines, look -- look at Count 9, 100a of Appendix to the Petition."
2015.14-1132,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.95,2405.73,What page is that?
2015.14-1132,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2405.73,2416.0,"100a. ""Each defendant enterprise owed plaintiffs a duty of care in their capacity as gatekeepers of the market."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2428.265,2433.535,"Look, I'm not going to suggest, Justice Alito, that Reg SHO isn't relevant as a background proposition."
2015.14-1132,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2447.96,2454.22,But that doesn't seem to -- that doesn't seem to be relying on Reg SHO as a background proposition.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2462.955,2465.32,I -- I -- I would characterize it a little bit differently.
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.2,2519.31,That isn't what it's saying.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2538.235,2538.54,New --
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2538.54,2541.245,Or is it a duty of care imposed by SHO?
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2541.245,2545.0,"It's a duty of care, Justice Breyer, imposed by New Jersey State law."
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2545.0,2545.9,Which State law?
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2545.9,2549.615,New Jersey Statute 3:3-49.
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.355,2570.345,And so the exact words there that the duty of care is referring to are what?
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2570.345,2571.95,I believe it says --
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2571.95,2572.62,If you know.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2572.62,2578.24,-- you can't engage in deceptive or manipulative conduct.
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2578.5,2579.16,I see what you're saying.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2579.16,2582.43,What we attempted to do here -- we may lose on this point in State court.
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.43,2582.58,Okay.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2619.02,2619.34,Okay.
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.35,2624.72,I'm doing it for argument because --
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2624.72,2624.83,Yes.
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2624.83,2634.99,"-- I'm really concerned about I can't clarify in my mind the difference between somebody being thrown out in an arising under case, and yet getting back in under Section 27."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2650.165,2650.65,Well --
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2650.65,2660.525,"So -- so then, if -- if it is not sufficient to get in under arising under, why in heaven's name should it be to get in under 27?"
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2660.525,2664.96,"Well, I mean, obviously, I'm not going to resist, but what I would --"
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2664.96,2671.66,"You're not going to resist my conclusion, but you see, it's -- it's -- I -- I need clarification, because I'm not sure I've thought it through correctly."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2671.66,2673.715,So here -- here's my best attempt to clarify.
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2816.15,2817.425,"Right, something."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2827.395,2827.745,Okay.
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2827.745,2846.87,"I'm looking for a way to see if we really have to answer all these difficult questions that have been raised, which are pretty tough. And so I was thinking, look, here's what you look to. Judge, see if it is a necessary thing, and if so, whether it falls under 1331."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2876.09,2876.61,So --
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2876.61,2881.615,"Does it meet the four criteria for arising under? If so, kick it out."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2882.955,2885.415,"So, Justice Breyer, here are my -- here are my thoughts on this."
2015.14-1132,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2887.24,2893.0,May I just clarify? I thought it was conceded there was no arising under jurisdiction.
2015.14-1132,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2893.0,2893.62,That's true.
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2896.815,2901.935,"That -- that's how -- that's how I understood -- that's how I understood the question. And so as to the general rule, here are my thoughts."
2015.14-1132,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3031.49,3041.99,"Mr. Stris, I guess I don't understand why you're resisting just say saying this language ought to be interpreted in the same way as arising under jurisdiction is interpreted."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3061.725,3062.485,"No, that's true."
2015.14-1132,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3062.485,3075.73,"So -- so why isn't that just sort of the simplest thing to do is, we have a test, it's a four-part test, and this language seems to fit that test pretty well, and that's what we should do, we should just have one test."
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3075.73,3080.585,"Well, so Justice Kagan, I won't resist too hard because obviously we win under that -- under that outcome."
2015.14-1132,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3171.56,3178.37,"So in light of SLUSA, the issue that's before us would apply only in individual actions and small class actions?"
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3178.37,3182.15,That's -- that's exactly right. And I think maybe I'll -- maybe I'll close with this.
2015.14-1132,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3277.99,3284.135,"Well, just out of curiosity, why is it so important for your client not to be in Federal district court?"
2015.14-1132,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3284.135,3285.9,So I think there's a few reasons.
2015.14-1132,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3339.955,3348.02,You said that you could prevail in this case without showing any violation of the SHO regulation.
