1967.1015,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,41.342,"Number 1015, William C. Witherspoon, petitioner versus Illinois et al."
1967.1015,0,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,46.066,48.484,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.1015,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,48.484,49.201,Oh!
1967.1015,1,16091,attorney_general,,51.857,58.636,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors and may it please the Court."
1967.1015,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,98.774,105.126,The motion is granted.
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,107.246,114.556,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, may it please the Court."
1967.1015,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.593,794.706,I'm not sure I understood that.
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,796.136,798.418,Since 1961.
1967.1015,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,798.418,802.943,Is the jury required in the recommendation of sentence?
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,802.943,804.687,It is permitted to but not required.
1967.1015,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,804.687,806.105,Permitted to but not required to --
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,806.105,806.128,Yes sir.
1967.1015,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,806.128,809.096,And it does recommend the death penalty and that's not binding on the Court.
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,809.096,810.324,It is not.
1967.1015,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,810.843,820.357,"And if it makes no recommendation at all, is the judge authorized to impose the death penalty?"
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,820.357,822.78,It is.
1967.1015,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,822.78,825.607,It's not really as that much bearing on this case but I just want to know.
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,825.607,844.56,Not on this particular case but it might if the Court sustains our position and the position is applied generally throughout the country.
1967.1015,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,844.56,848.852,The jury had to fix them you said it?
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,848.852,849.867,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1967.1015,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,849.867,853.262,"And its options were death, life or a term of years."
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,853.262,861.219,Yes Your Honor and neither as this statute that is involved in this particular case.
1967.1015,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,861.219,862.956,Which one is defended?
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,862.956,864.008,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
1967.1015,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,864.008,866.108,Which one you say it involved in this case?
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,866.108,885.917,"It is the one that was in effect of the time of trial which is of the jury that is required to or have the option to fix the penalty of death, life imprisonment or a term of years not less than 14 years and that decision was binding on the Court."
1967.1015,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,885.917,887.804,This case was tried at that time.
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,887.804,892.98,"It was, Your Honor."
1967.1015,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1020.474,1029.018,Does it work the other way Mr. Jenner suppose he says that I certainly agree with the death penalty and think of it to be imposed in every murder case.
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1033.991,1045.866,"If he would go so far under the Illinois law as to say that, if Your Honor pleases, then the defendant has the right to exercise a peremptory challenge."
1967.1015,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.866,1046.832,Not a cause?
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1046.832,1049.824,Not a cause.
1967.1015,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1049.824,1059.153,"Suppose Mr. Jenner he merely says I'm opposed of the death penalty and nothing else, what is the practice?"
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1059.153,1075.046,"The practice as Your Honor you'll find from the appendix to our opening brief in which the actual examination of all the jurors here, it is that if he says that he has opposed to the death penalty, he is excused for cause if he is challenged by the state."
1967.1015,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1075.046,1078.169,I wonder why he wouldn't be excused because the other way.
1967.1015,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1080.116,1084.06,Do you have some cases on that?
1967.1015,2,16305,albert_e_jenner_jr,,1084.06,1086.07,I don't have a case --
1967.1015,3,21658,donald_j_veverka,,3797.749,3801.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.1015,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3983.631,3987.44,Am I not correct that we -- Mr. Jenner is not arguing about these six.
1967.1015,3,21658,donald_j_veverka,,3989.842,3991.127,"Right, Your Honor."
1967.1015,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4028.29,4039.419,"Well to the contrary, couldn't it mean that he, like some other people, believe the 10th Commandment, thou shall not kill, and no more?"
1967.1015,3,21658,donald_j_veverka,,4039.419,4040.19,"No, Your Honor."
1967.1015,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4041.915,4052.039,"Well, does the average juror knows what the exact meaning of “a proper case”?"
1967.1015,3,21658,donald_j_veverka,,4052.039,4053.277,"Your Honor, I would say this."
1967.1015,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4070.922,4082.598,"Yeah, but the -- are you suggesting that every one of these 47 people who were excused for cause heard the interrogation of these few?"
1967.1015,3,21658,donald_j_veverka,,4082.598,4082.958,"I think, Your Honor --"
1967.1015,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4082.958,4084.285,"The record doesn't show that, does it?"
1967.1015,3,21658,donald_j_veverka,,4088.771,4089.491,That's true.
1967.1015,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4089.567,4099.287,"And I gather that what you're suggesting to us is that when this brief question was asked, this was because the jurors had heard the more lengthy interrogation of the others."
1967.1015,3,21658,donald_j_veverka,,4110.062,4119.144,"Your Honor, I'm saying that if this prospective juror states that “I would not return to death penalty under any circumstances”, that that clearly shows and actual bias."
1967.1015,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4119.144,4121.328,That shows it to whom?
1967.1015,3,21658,donald_j_veverka,,4128.595,4128.837,When he says --
1967.1015,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4128.837,4133.653,"And that, it seems to me, is what is the -- whether it should be the duty of the counsel to find out."
1967.1015,3,21658,donald_j_veverka,,4133.653,4139.33,"When he says, “I would not impose a death penalty under any circumstances,” that indicates that --"
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6118.379,6122.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6157.119,6159.334,That's the discretionary with the Court.
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6159.334,6161.99,I do not think that it's discretionary with the Court.
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6161.99,6167.059,"Well, is it usually done in cases where you've got a clear-cut statute like this?"
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6167.059,6176.071,"I would say this, that I -- I think -- well, I think I have to emphasize the point that Mr. Veverka made toward the end."
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6284.589,6297.639,"Mr. Zagel, I suppose the practice in Illinois would be that when you get a jury for a capital case, the clerk of the jury says, “All of you who have conscientious scruples against capital punishment are excused.”"
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6299.389,6304.759,"Well, I very much doubt that that would be alright.I think one needs the intervention of the Court."
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6304.993,6315.978,"Well, if 96 people come into the courtroom and the judge says, “All of you who have conscientious scruples against capital punishment are excused,” is that alright?"
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6315.978,6319.807,"Well, that has been done and it has been approved in the State of Illinois."
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6322.934,6324.673,"It hadn't been approved by this Court, has it?"
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6324.673,6347.726,"No, it has only been approved in the State of Illinois but the better practice and the practice followed in this case has been to qualify each juror individually and I would ask as -- that you notice Mr. Veverka has previously noted the instance in which a judge was somewhat reluctant to accept the juror's -- for original assurance that there was a conscientious scruple."
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6354.339,6364.541,"Well, do you seek to sustain that portion of the statute which says that a man should be excused if he's opposed of the death penalty?"
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6364.541,6368.239,I don't seek to sustain that portion of the statute.
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6398.662,6403.75,Is there -- would you have any -- do you have any cases to support that theory?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6403.75,6425.12,"Well, I -- in footnote 4, the respondent Woods brief, I put in every case that I could find in Illinois that dealt with conscientious scruples with the disqualification for cause and all of -- none of them has dealt specifically with the problem which is in itself and indication of the fact that trial courts do not ask the question, “Are you opposed?”"
1967.1015,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6434.496,6437.258,Do you think that's the standard problem applied in this case?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6437.258,6442.179,I think that that was the standard the trial judge was applying with this limitation.
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6501.906,6503.119,What -- I didn't get that.
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6504.093,6509.388,"The judge said that on -- on a few occasions, on four or five occasions."
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6522.287,6523.425,Who's brief was it?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6523.425,6527.233,"The petitioner's brief, Mr. Witherspoon's brief."
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6527.233,6528.487,Page 7?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6528.487,6539.569,"Page 7, he makes reference in the third paragraph on that page to the situations where the trial judge did make it clear that that's what he was seeking."
1967.1015,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6542.101,6544.321,Perhaps I don't fully understand it.
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6558.252,6559.996,"No, I am not saying --"
1967.1015,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6559.996,6562.3,What -- what is it you say the statute is?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6562.3,6567.991,I am saying that the practice in Illinois -- and I think it is a --
1967.1015,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6567.991,6568.946,That's not my question.
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6571.347,6582.87,I say the statute is directed to the securing of jurors who are willing under the law and evidence to return a death penalty verdict if justified.
1967.1015,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6582.87,6586.61,Irrespective of any conscientious scruples they may have against death penalty?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6586.61,6601.174,"I think that the statute makes the assumption, not unjustified assumption, that the persons with such conscientious and religious scruples will have a great difficulty in returning such a verdict."
1967.1015,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6603.448,6606.72,"You still haven't answered my question, with all respect."
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6609.671,6614.773,Our position is the statute is designed -- the purpose of the statute is --
1967.1015,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6614.773,6615.489,Not the purpose.
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6616.705,6617.875,The statute --
1967.1015,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6617.875,6622.111,Specifically in what case does the statute permit a challenge for cause?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6622.111,6628.524,The statute permits a challenge for cause when a man expresses conscientious or religious scruples against inflicting the death penalty.
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6630.523,6633.253,I say that that is perfectly constitutional.
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6633.253,6634.627,Without more?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6634.627,6642.514,I think it is -- it is perfectly constitutional without more and I point out two things in this connection.
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6737.831,6742.736,May I repeat the question one of the other justices asked you?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6753.279,6755.322,"Well, I think -- I think they'll know in two ways."
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6770.292,6774.404,What is the difference between a scruple and a conscientious scruple?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6774.404,6777.285,"Well, I -- I think a scruple might be sufficient."
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6782.805,6783.765,I beg your pardon.
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6783.765,6788.131,Sometimes it's referred to as a conscientious or religious objection.
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6797.675,6801.737,Do you think every prospective juror should know those distinctions?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6801.737,6816.46,I think that it is a reasonable assumption to say that a prospective juror will either know what it means or will do what Mr. Salazar did and ask what the question meant.
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6852.69,6854.438,But all of them were not asked that.
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6854.438,6867.963,"Not all of them were asked that but I cannot believe that you could reasonably say that not every one of them heard that, and I think that in itself it strongly clarifies the meaning of the question."
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6908.875,6915.91,Can I assume that some of the jurors do not know what a proper case is?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6915.91,6923.158,I -- I think that it is possible that some of the jurors may not be aware of what a proper case is.
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6931.048,6953.496,"So there is a possibility -- there's a two-pronged possibility of a juror and a judge at the prosecute -- the defense counsel being on a different understanding based on the lack of communication, one as to what is a conscientious scruple and two, what is a proper case."
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6953.496,6964.735,"Well, it seems to me that there is that possibility, although I would state again that it is not uncommon for a juror like Mr. Salazar did to ask what is meant by a proper case."
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6964.735,6975.299,"Well, I suppose the juror ends up and says, “I think that if there is a proper case, I could put my conscientious scruples aside.”"
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6975.299,6982.535,"Well, if a juror were to state that he could return a death verdict in a proper case, then he would be qualified."
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6982.535,6983.401,He would be qualified?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6983.401,6984.495,He would be qualified.
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6984.495,6995.711,"And so, these 41, you don't know how many of them might have gone to that point if they had been questioned?"
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,6995.711,6997.87,"Well, I would say this."
1967.1015,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7010.358,7019.394,"Well I understand you correctly, you would have no objections of the defense counsel going into as far as he wanted in the hope of getting this out of the way."
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,7020.319,7021.426,Within -- within limits.
1967.1015,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7259.153,7260.982,Can I ask one question with the Illinois law?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,7270.592,7273.7,"Well, there are cases where they could have but not in this case."
1967.1015,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7273.7,7274.572,Why not in this case?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,7274.572,7281.296,The evidence was just -- it could not have justified a manslaughter verdict.
1967.1015,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7283.066,7289.125,Would the Court -- Illinois Court have set it aside in panel to a new jury or what?
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,7289.125,7302.739,"If they're -- under Illinois law, if an instruction is submitted, which is not justified by the evidence and a verdict of guilty returns, the Illinois Supreme Court will set aside the verdict period and reverse the case outright, there be no remand."
1967.1015,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7302.739,7306.016,Even though it's in favor of the lifetime penalty.
1967.1015,4,33731,james_b_zagel,,7306.016,7309.555,Even though it's in favor of -- even though it's in favor of the defendant.
1967.1015,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7325.95,7327.265,Mr. Granucci.
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7327.265,7330.82,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.1015,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7358.934,7373.449,"Now, do you go as far as to say that -- that less than a assurance on the part of the juror that he could not bring in such a verdict, that they should disqualify him for cause?"
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7373.449,7375.699,"Your Honor, California goes no further."
1967.1015,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7375.699,7376.631,I know they do.
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7381.209,7401.984,"We think on behalf of the 23 states that have joined us, we should state that it is not unreasonable to hold that implied bias, namely opposition or scruple as a ground from which a conclusion may reasonably draw that the juror would be unable to fairly consider the issue of penalty."
1967.1015,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7401.984,7410.022,Even that -- even though that is not -- you're not concerned with that under the California law?
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7410.022,7411.869,"That is quite correct, Your Honor."
1967.1015,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7411.869,7412.985,Alright.
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7416.793,7416.936,Thank you.
1967.1015,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7416.936,7417.721,Take five minutes more.
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7417.721,7418.639,Thank you.
1967.1015,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7475.397,7476.762,"You mean, that's an equal protection?"
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7476.762,7477.678,An equal protection.
1967.1015,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7477.678,7479.177,I suppose it might be different.
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7485.129,7492.428,"If it infected the fact finding process, Mr. Justice Brennan, it might be taken into account but it wouldn't be determinative."
1967.1015,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7492.428,7495.987,"Well, didn't -- and wasn't that distinction drawn in Linkletter?"
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7495.987,7496.624,"Yes, but it was --"
1967.1015,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7496.624,7502.609,"And actually, all the courts' confession rules and Gideon rules, those are all fully retroactive, aren't they?"
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7502.609,7502.84,That is correct.
1967.1015,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7502.84,7507.446,And why -- weren't they made so on the ground that --
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7507.446,7509.594,"That -- that is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1967.1015,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7520.995,7523.705,It doesn't come readily to my mind.
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7523.705,7536.971,The stovall involved a case where there had been confrontation in the absence of counsel and there was some concern that -- of improper suggestion and some concern about unfairness of the trial.
1967.1015,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7612.336,7613.362,I misunderstood you there.
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7618.159,7636.251,"Well, Your Honor, I don't know what rule the Court is going to announce, but if the Court were going to accept the theory of the amicus on the side of the petitioners, then it would be error to exclude for cause, even those who are actually biased."
1967.1015,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7639.396,7648.245,"Well, we have before us particularly in our case and our particularly state involving a particular standard of exclusion."
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7652.547,7657.022,"California's standard of exclusion, Mr. Justice Stewart, is more restricted."
1967.1015,5,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7664.698,7671.505,Just on the -- we're talking now about your procedure for determining for the penalty or guilt.
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7671.505,7674.393,"Mr. Justice Douglas, we have a bifurcated trial."
1967.1015,5,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7674.393,7675.077,I understand.
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7675.077,7677.853,Jurors are examined in the beginning of the trial.
1967.1015,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7691.971,7715.629,"If we were to hold that in this case, that this statute cannot stand because it doesn't show that a man cannot render a verdict, a capital verdict, would that -- would that do anything to the 75 convictions you were talking about in your state?"
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7715.629,7716.994,"It might not, Your Honor."
1967.1015,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7717.778,7718.796,"Well, wouldn't it?"
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7718.796,7726.797,"I -- if you were to hold only in the terms of your question, it would not."
1967.1015,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7735.897,7736.955,"Yes, very well."
1967.1015,5,39374,robert_r_granucci,,7736.955,7743.342,"Thank you, Your Honor."
