1995.94-1941,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.967,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 94-1941, United States v. Virginia, and Virginia v. United States."
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,11.41,15.602,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1941,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.199,183.129,"As you read the findings of the district court and the assessment of those findings in the court of appeals, what is your understanding of those courts' conclusions as to the extent to which the adversative method would be altered and affected by the admission of women?"
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,183.129,191.557,I think there's general agreement on what would have to be changed by the admission of women in physical terms.
1995.94-1941,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,195.769,196.55,There is not?
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,196.55,199.412,--There is not agreement about how to characterize the change.
1995.94-1941,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,216.773,231.342,Do we have the institutional competence at this level and are we required in order to decide this case to make our own assessment of the extent to which the adversative method a) would change and b) whether that change would be detrimental to the school?
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,231.342,232.924,No.
1995.94-1941,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,232.924,233.753,Is it for us to decide?
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,233.753,236.154,"No, I don't think that's necessary in this case."
1995.94-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.727,265.646,"Didn't both of the lower courts make that finding, that the effect of admitting women would be to destroy the adversative method?"
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,265.646,266.204,Yes.
1995.94-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.835,269.507,"Now, you say that's wrong, but both of the lower courts found that, didn't they?"
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,269.507,282.186,"--They... that finding was based entirely on a stereotypical view of women and men which says that women... men cannot administer the adversative method to women, women would not be able to survive with the adversative method."
1995.94-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.186,283.675,It was not based on expert testimony?
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,283.675,285.478,Expert testimony was in turn based on--
1995.94-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.478,286.179,But it was--
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,286.179,286.958,--exactly those characterizations.
1995.94-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.958,287.579,--I see.
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,291.192,294.525,"No, they can't be dismissed as stereotypical, Justice Scalia."
1995.94-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.525,294.995,What does stereotypical mean?
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,298.505,310.232,"It means what the experts really said, which is not that all women can't do this, but that most women can't do this, and we are willing to accept the finding that most women can't do this."
1995.94-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.979,321.351,As I recall the experts--
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,321.351,322.03,--even those women who can.
1995.94-1941,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.03,344.978,"--it was not that women can't do it, it was that it would interfere with the kind of relationship among the students that produces the adversative method, that men and women would not engage in the same kind of adversariness that men and men or, perhaps, women and women would, that the sexual difference would make a difference."
1995.94-1941,0,37685,paul_bender,,349.749,352.952,It has to do with whether men will perceive that women can take the heat.
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1561.191,1564.303,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1995.94-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.795,1597.325,"Mr. Olson, may I ask you right there a question that has troubled me right along about this argument?"
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1604.811,1605.492,Yes.
1995.94-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.492,1606.822,What does Virginia do for them?
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1606.822,1616.749,"Well, what Virginia has done is devote 98 percent of its educational resources to single... to coeducation, and it's created two single sex education programs--"
1995.94-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.749,1622.834,But what does it do for the male who wants to go to an all male school but not VMI?
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1622.834,1630.838,"--Well, the problem, Justice Stevens, is that you cannot create a school without an adequate student body, and resources are limited, and the Government's--"
1995.94-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.838,1640.274,Are you then saying there are fewer males who want single sex education... most of those would like the VMI program rather than a less--
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1640.274,1646.609,"--What I'm saying is, Virginia has allocated a certain amount of its scarce educational resources to single sex education."
1995.94-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.639,1653.534,"--Yes, but if most people who want single sex education don't want VMI, it's discriminating against them."
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1653.534,1670.264,"--I think that what the judge... unless... as long as the State is going to be permitted to have single sex education at all, then it must turn over to experts in education the best method, to divine the best method that would succeed for the young men or the young women that seek out and would benefit from single sex education."
1995.94-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.918,1680.391,It doesn't help the young man who doesn't want the adversative method at all.
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1680.391,1681.002,--That's correct.
1995.94-1941,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.002,1686.315,And I would assume that most men who want single sex education don't want the rigorous training.
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1686.315,1690.419,"Well, I... the marketplace in part comes into play here, and the fact that resources are limited."
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1702.227,1702.998,"But Mr. Olson, didn't--"
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1722.112,1734.049,The... there were a number of women's only public schools in Virginia that chose themselves to go to coeducation because of the demands that occurred and that the trends that were away in the seventies--
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1734.049,1734.919,Demands from whom?
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1734.919,1738.211,--The trends that were away from single sex education.
1995.94-1941,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1746.857,1748.069,But Mr. Olson--
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1748.069,1748.629,There's no stereotypes.
1995.94-1941,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1748.629,1761.408,"--We get back to the posture of this case, and one issue we have to decide is whether Virginia can provide single sex education to just one sex, to just men."
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1763.939,1765.159,It... well--
1995.94-1941,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1765.159,1766.571,And you want to defend that.
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1766.571,1767.132,--Well--
1995.94-1941,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.132,1774.596,You want to say it is not a violation of the Constitution to provide a single sex education just for men.
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1774.596,1776.138,--It was the posture--
1995.94-1941,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1776.138,1777.006,"Well, isn't that right?"
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1777.006,1777.978,--It is the posture of this--
1995.94-1941,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.978,1780.209,"I mean, that's one of the cases we have before us."
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1780.209,1790.697,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor, and the point at which time that liability decision comes up is a point at which Virginia is providing public resources, pursuant to two constitutional amendments, to private schools."
1995.94-1941,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1820.656,1823.829,"Well, I guess that gets us into the second question, which is remedy."
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1823.829,1829.172,"Yes, it does, and there are essentially three choices here."
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.789,1848.395,"Mr. Olson, just to clarify, Virginia didn't choose to do that, because you are, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, defending keeping things just as they were."
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1856.901,1859.832,"--But at the time of that liability decision, Virginia had a choice to make."
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1867.687,1873.471,"So are we... is that first judge... your brief, the cross appeal, do we take that as being moot?"
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1873.471,1874.603,"--No, it is not moot."
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1927.647,1928.799,But why are those the only choices?
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1941.425,1942.016,--Yes.
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1942.016,1944.578,You could have that program at Mary Baldwin.
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1956.927,1964.834,"Well, if VMI went private, then the State of Virginia would no longer be supporting through its public resources in the same way single sex education for young men."
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1981.643,1984.107,But couldn't you continue with VWIL no matter what?
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1991.681,1992.282,If--
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1992.282,1996.654,"--creating more women who have that capacity, couldn't you continue VWIL?"
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1996.654,2014.494,"--You could continue it with... well, I submit that if this Court decides that the VMI program is unconstitutional because it's unique and has its own tradition and faculty and that sort of thing, then a single sex program that denies men the opportunity to participate in that program will be held unconstitutional on exactly the same grounds."
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2018.408,2028.934,"I don't understand that, because you set yourself at a... you're assisting a program at a private school for the reason of promoting diversity, is that not so?"
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2028.934,2040.354,"--The effort is, by Virginia is to promote diversity by creating opportunities in a very, very large coeducational system for people of both sexes to make the choice of single sex education."
1995.94-1941,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.354,2045.246,"Well, Mr. Olson, when this lawsuit was brought Virginia funded VMI."
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2048.788,2049.389,Yes.
1995.94-1941,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.511,2059.665,And what percent of a student's expenses in that case would be covered?
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2059.665,2078.969,"I'm not sure that the record is completely clear, but the single sex institutions for women in Virginia derive something... I believe the record indicates something between 5 and 10 percent of their resources from either the Federal Government or the State government, plus there's the factor that the Federal Government and the State government provide tax deductions--"
1995.94-1941,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.969,2092.889,"Well, I know, but what I'm trying to get at is, is the assistance that is provided by Virginia to these private schools comparable in dollar amount to the assistance that is provided to VMI?"
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2092.889,2094.768,--It was smaller in total amounts.
1995.94-1941,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2098.763,2099.672,Yes.
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2099.672,2103.145,"--that was going to those programs, it was smaller than the amount by which Virginia supported VMI."
1995.94-1941,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2130.302,2132.835,May I ask you one more question about liability?
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2192.774,2197.388,"--I... if I understand your question correctly, I agree with you, and let me restate it as I understand it."
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2238.354,2240.676,"But Mr. Olson, how do you factor in title IX?"
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2259.128,2290.577,"--I don't think that that has been definitively decided, and I can't cite the case for you, Justice Ginsburg, but I believe that the one case that has dealt with the issue has suggested that a new system that is... there's a single sex system from its beginning would meet the definition in 20 U.S.C. 1681 (5), that the words traditionally and continually from its inception may be interpreted to apply to a new institution, but that question has not been decided by the courts."
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2290.577,2295.322,I thought that the text of the statute says something about if you've been that way from the beginning--
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2295.322,2295.963,It--
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2295.963,2298.785,"--you can continue, but that new schools cannot--"
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2298.785,2302.896,"--The words of the statute say, that traditionally and continually from its establishment has been."
1995.94-1941,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2310.262,2312.613,--Was there no interpretation of that by the Department of Education?
1995.94-1941,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2315.045,2315.836,--I'm not aware of any.
1995.94-1941,2,37685,paul_bender,,3257.825,3258.555,"No, not at all."
1995.94-1941,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.261,3270.284,"Wait, only private single sex education that gets any assistance from the Government."
1995.94-1941,2,37685,paul_bender,,3270.284,3271.434,"--No, I don't think that's true, Justice Scalia."
1995.94-1941,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.818,3279.36,"Can States give money to segregated schools, racially segregated schools, for example?"
1995.94-1941,2,37685,paul_bender,,3279.36,3280.64,--Can States give money--
1995.94-1941,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.64,3281.191,Yes.
1995.94-1941,2,37685,paul_bender,,3281.191,3281.842,--to racially segregated schools?
