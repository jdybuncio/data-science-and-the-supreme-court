1989.89-624,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.737,"We'll hear argument now in Number 89-624, Maislin Industries v. Primary Steel."
1989.89-624,0,42353,thomas_m_auchincloss_jr,,11.974,14.008,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1657.612,1660.681,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-624,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1701.324,1717.401,"Mr. Merrill, Mr. Auchincloss said there was no evidence in this case that the... there was ever any agreement on the part of the shipper and the carrier that the carrier would file the tariff, file the new rate."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1717.401,1727.958,"There was no evidence of an agreement, but there... the Commission specifically found that Primary, the shipper, relied on Quinn, the carrier, to implement the proper... implement properly the quoted rates."
1989.89-624,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1729.908,1732.827,So the Commission found that the shipper relied on the carrier.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1732.827,1739.933,"--The Commission's finding was that the shipper relied on the carrier to do everything that the law requires to properly implement the negotiated rate, yes."
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.933,1741.016,Doesn't every shipper do that?
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1747.42,1752.574,It probably is true that most every shipper assumes that the carrier will comply with the law.
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.991,1764.799,"If that alone were a justification for departing from the tariff, from the filed rate, it would always be a justification for a departure."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1764.799,1775.772,--What... I think the important point here about the Commission's reliance element is that there can be no evidence that the shipper had knowledge that the carrier in fact was not intending to file the rate in the tariff.
1989.89-624,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1806.876,1814.997,"Mr. Merrill, do we take this case on the assumption that the tariff rate was a reasonable rate?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1814.997,1818.533,"Justice O'Connor, the Commission did not reach the rate reasonableness issue."
1989.89-624,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1819.218,1826.455,"In our addressing the legal issue, do we need to assume that it was a reasonable rate?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1826.455,1832.876,I don't think the legal analysis should turn on whether the rate was either assumed to be reasonable or assumed to be unreasonable.
1989.89-624,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1833.526,1835.661,"Well, I am answering my question, then."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1838.763,1839.53,--Yes.
1989.89-624,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1839.53,1850.92,And then tell me whether the statute 1070... 10761(a) requires the carrier to collect the filed tariff.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1850.92,1852.939,"The statute does require that, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-624,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.939,1858.293,And are there criminal penalties and civil penalties potentially for not doing that?
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1858.293,1859.043,"Yes, there are."
1989.89-624,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.482,1880.372,"Well, then how can the Commission say, under those circumstances, that not collecting the tariff is an unreasonable billing practice?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1880.372,1882.658,I think what the Commission has done here is not--
1989.89-624,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.658,1885.693,It just... it seems very hard to understand.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1885.693,1890.245,--The Commission is not forgiving carriers of their obligation to file rates and tariffs.
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.696,1947.314,We are going to compel you to continue to violate it--
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1947.314,1948.097,"--No, we are going--"
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.097,1948.88,--is what they have said in effect.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1948.88,1956.886,"--We are going to declare it an unreasonable practice for the carrier to obtain a windfall, essentially, based on its own violation of the statute."
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.886,1965.209,"But in answering Justice O'Connor, you... you... you spoke as though the only obligation of the carrier is to file the tariff rate."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1965.709,1966.442,"No, there is--"
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.442,1968.811,It... it is his obligation to charge the tariff rate.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1968.811,1982.802,"--It's... it's stated in... the first sentence of 7061(a) says the carrier must file, and 7062(a) says the same thing, and then the second section of Section 7061(a) says the carrier must only charge and collect the rate at tariff."
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.802,1983.635,"Well, then let's charge and collect that."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1984.952,1985.568,And the carrier violated that provision.
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.568,1991.139,"--What the Commission said, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, is that complying with that is an unreasonable billing practice."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,1991.139,1996.193,"No, the Commission has not said that simply not collecting the tariff rate is an unreasonable billing practice."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.687,2040.889,Even though the undercharging may have put it into bankruptcy.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2040.889,2047.744,"--It's possible that the carrier, through its own improvidence... went into bankruptcy."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.444,2049.043,I would think creditors.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2052.879,2058.533,"--Yes, but I don't think there is any conflict between the bankruptcy laws and the Commission's negotiated rates policy."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.802,2074.395,"Well, they... I would suppose, if... if... if the... if the carrier had an obligation to collect a rate that it didn't collect, that it... somebody owes it something."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2074.395,2075.545,"That's correct, but the carrier is--"
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.545,2078.929,"And the creditors ought to insist that the trustee bring a lawsuit, which he did."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2078.929,2082.331,--The carrier has no right to collect a tariff rate that is found to be unreasonable.
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.154,2093.039,"I know, but we judge this case as though the rate was reasonable."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2093.039,2106.681,"And similarly the Commission has found in negotiated rates that if the carrier has committed an unreasonable practice, which is defined by these elements that I have summarized, that the finding of an unreasonable practice should supersede the filed tariff rate and prevent full collection."
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.803,2322.857,"Mr. Merrill, can I ask about this, what the unreasonable practice is again?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2336.097,2338.116,I think that is correct.
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.116,2350.941,"And it would not have been an unreasonable practice if they had been agreeing to the lower rate, and charging the lower rate all along, and then continued to charge the lower rate the last time around."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2354.828,2355.961,You may have no collection action--
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.961,2362.832,You said it was essential to the whole thing that there had been the prior practice of both agreeing to and actually billing the lower rate.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2362.832,2366.719,--I don't think the attempt to collect the rates adds anything to the unreasonableness.
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2371.087,2376.824,"So the unreasonable practice, then, is not trying to collect the higher rate, it's just what?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2376.824,2377.291,It's the--
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.291,2378.241,Agreeing to the lower rate.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2378.241,2380.243,--Agreeing to the lower rate.
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.33,2387.899,But that is not a billing practice.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2387.899,2389.999,--That's a solicitation practice.
1989.89-624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.44,2402.392,"Part of the element is the failure to file, is part of the unreasonableness."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2402.392,2404.409,"The failure to file is a key part, yes."
1989.89-624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2406.094,2406.811,You didn't mention it.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2406.811,2415.966,"--I have already mentioned them, 10761(a) and 10762, imposes on the carrier the duty to file the rates for its transportation services in tariffs."
1989.89-624,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2418.151,2426.591,"Well, but you could say that in any case where the carrier agrees to a lower rate, doesn't file a tariff for that lower rate, and then bills the lower rate."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2434.613,2441.517,"Well, the Commission's not... again, I mean, the petitioners try to suggest that the Commission has repealed the filed tariff doctrine."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.324,2456.46,xxx reason to depart from the tariff.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2456.46,2456.81,No.
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.69,2485.88,I suppose the Commission's approach would cover the situation where the... where the shipper wants a lower rate and... than he knows in the carrier's tariff.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2497.02,2499.555,"No, the Commission's policy would not apply in a case--"
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.555,2500.355,"Well, why not?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2500.355,2514.047,"--Well, because the statute, Section 11902 of the Interstate Commerce Act, which is part of the Elkins Act, imposes treble damage liability on shippers for knowingly accepting a rebate from the tariff rate."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.873,2529.825,"So the... the shipper has to be innocent, is that it?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2529.825,2530.409,--That is correct.
1989.89-624,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2544.418,2548.22,Was there a finding to that effect here?
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2548.22,2572.836,"--Yes, I think the Commission again found that... that the... I can't recall the precise language at this moment, but on page 42a and 43a of the Commission's decision in this case there is discussion of the states of mind of both the carrier and the shipper."
1989.89-624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.851,2598.403,"Mr. Merrill, may I ask you a question about the Commission's policy?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2612.579,2613.296,In other words you have--
1989.89-624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.296,2615.347,You have discrimination between negotiated rates.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2615.347,2618.899,"--One tariff, and one shipper negotiates, the other one doesn't?"
1989.89-624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.899,2619.766,"No, no, no."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2630.94,2633.059,I see.
1989.89-624,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.713,2647.236,"See, that triggers a concern that isn't necessarily shown by the record of this case, the possibility of discrimination, which has always been something that--"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2647.236,2647.619,--Yes.
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.565,2722.5,--Is it common practice not to adhere to the filed tariffs?
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2722.5,2723.35,"No, no."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.919,2726.619,"Well, what did you just say?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2726.619,2729.806,"--It's a common practice to negotiate a rate, with the expectation--"
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.806,2731.09,"Yes, but this is a tariff rate."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2731.09,2733.842,--With the expectation that the negotiated rate will then be filed in the tariff.
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.476,2746.065,"Well, then... then it is common practice not to... common practice to agree to charge a rate that is not on file with the Commission."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2746.065,2746.499,--No.
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2750.886,2752.469,"Well, there was no such understanding in this case."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2757.04,2760.242,--There was no specific proof of an agreement to file a tariff in this case.
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.242,2762.644,"Well, and you say it is irrelevant whether there was or not."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2762.644,2771.717,"Well, the Commission's policy is that what is relevant is whether or not the shipper relied on the carrier to do what was necessary to comply with its... the law, which includes filing the tariff rate."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.3,2772.95,All shippers do.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2788.928,2795.748,"--I think... I agree with you, Justice Scalia, that people who do business normally assume that the people they are doing business with will comply with the law."
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.13,2821.03,"--Mr. Merrill, could I ask this."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2837.159,2838.492,"I have no idea, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2839.361,2840.211,"Well, that might make a big difference."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2845.848,2855.471,--The Commission has not entertained very many cases on the merits since 1980 alleging unreasonable motor carrier rates.
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.573,2858.456,xxx the concept.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2858.456,2859.105,What?
1989.89-624,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.105,2859.94,They don't have to.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2860.807,2870.313,"Well, the shippers don't like the concept either, because the shippers can go out and get different quotations and tariff rates from different carriers."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.99,2973.964,"Do you know of any instance where the Commission has gotten after some carrier for negotiating a rate lower than the tariff rate, and in short just plain violate the statute?"
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,2973.964,2982.969,"--The Commission, I don't know the names of the cases, but I asked and I was told that the Commission has had enforcement proceedings within the recent... 1988 and 1989, against carriers--"
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.969,3007.637,"Because if you say this is this... this practice is just common everyday occurrence around, and the Commission isn't doing anything about it, it sounds like the whole business of requiring carriers to comply with the statutory requirement of charging the same to everybody is just hash."
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3007.637,3009.187,"--Well, I don't think it's that bad, Justice White."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.926,3019.576,How are they doing that?
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3019.576,3025.279,"Well, one way... well, first of all, this proceeding is largely retrospective in orientation."
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.283,3082.133,It's like estoppel?
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3082.133,3088.353,"It's... I hate to use that word, because these old cases from this Court say that no estoppel is permitted--"
1989.89-624,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.353,3088.889,Exactly.
1989.89-624,1,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3088.889,3089.805,--but it's a Commission--
1989.89-624,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3232.681,3233.866,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
1989.89-624,2,42353,thomas_m_auchincloss_jr,,3236.818,3238.518,"I do, Your Honor."
1989.89-624,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3355.145,3356.528,"Thank you, Mr. Auchincloss."
