2018.17-1077,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.48,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1077, Lorenzo versus the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Heim."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,8.48,22.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Janus Capital, this Court held that only the maker of a misstatement can be held liable for that misstatement under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b)."
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,80.4,84.72,"Excuse me, Janus was a private cause of action, correct?"
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,84.72,85.48,"Yes, Your Honor, it was --"
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,85.48,86.56,Under 10b-5?
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,86.56,88.36,"Yes, Your Honor, under 10b-5(b)."
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.36,94.84,"I -- I understand what Janus said, but I don't know how it squares with 17(a)."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,152.56,180.44,"That's true, Your Honor. The -- the subsection that you quoted is actually from Section 17(a), subsection (2), which is not -- was not charged by the SEC and which Mr. Lorenzo was not accused of violating. And we agree that subsection (2) may be a better way for the SEC to proceed if they're going to try to hold Petitioner liable as a primary violator, because it -- it almost fits very closely here because that's the equivalent of Rule 10b-5(b)."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,180.44,198.88,"But the same point can be made, Mr. Heim, with respect to 10b-5(a) and (c) and also with respect to 17(a)(1) and (3), right? That the idea is -- is, look, Janus was a decision that -- it was a very textual decision."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,214.12,218.72,"Well, Justice Kagan, 10b-5(b) only addresses misstatements."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,232.36,240.88,So you think that (a) and (c) are sort of any -- everything except misrepresentations or omissions? Is that your position?
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,240.88,243.48,We -- that is essentially our position.
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,258.48,266.12,So take this case. Mr. Lorenzo here sent false financial information to potential investors.
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,300.36,302.64,"We do, Your Honor, for several reasons."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,303.08,304.12,We do what? We?
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,304.12,312.72,"We do not think that he engaged in any conduct that violated 10b-5(c) because, in order for 10b-5(b) to have any meaning, it --"
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,312.72,331.32,"I guess I'm wondering, just take -- I understand that argument, and it's, I think, a serious argument. But pretend that 10b-5(b) was not in the statute for just a second, and you're entitled to come back to it, but just pretend it wasn't in the statute."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,342.04,344.28,"No -- no, Your Honor, for a couple of different reasons."
2018.17-1077,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.68,371.88,"I tell you, all the content -- I mean, the email begins with a summary."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,414.76,440.88,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the court below found that there was sufficient attribution in this email to Gregg Lorenzo because it does start off by saying that it's being sent at the request of Gregg Lorenzo. And the record -- and the D.C. Circuit, after looking at the Commission's findings, found that Gregg -- Frank Lorenzo was not the maker of the statements in the email. And one of the reasons for that finding was because it was attributed at the start of the email to -- to Gregg Lorenzo."
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,440.88,441.44,But -- but do we have a --
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,441.44,446.44,"Mr. Heim, if I understand your position, it's irrespective of that fact."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,469.6,469.8,"Well, no."
2018.17-1077,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,492.4,499.88,"Did he make a misstatement? Did he personally make a misstatement? I think -- I thought your answer was no, he did not make a misstatement."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,499.88,501.68,"No, he didn't, and that was what the D.C. Circuit found."
2018.17-1077,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,501.68,501.92,Okay.
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,516.04,533.28,"Because Mr. Lorenzo didn't engage in any additional deceptive conduct other than making -- once he was deemed to be not the maker of the statement, our view is, consistent with the majority of circuits that have considered this question, is that some other inherent deceptive conduct would have to be engaged in by Mr. Lorenzo."
2018.17-1077,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,533.28,535.92,"Well, just take the language of (c)."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,540.52,544.6,"Well, because (c) talks about conduct."
2018.17-1077,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,550.44,563.68,"Well, you -- you say (c) can't include any verbal conduct? It has to be something else? I don't quite know how you're going to engage in a fraud without -- without saying some words."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,563.68,565.36,"No, Your Honor, that's not our position."
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,602.64,602.84,I have a problem with --
2018.17-1077,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,602.84,605.56,"Well, I don't see why you need to get into aiding and abetting."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,621.0,643.56,"Well, there's an important distinction to be drawn there because the concept of primary liability really ties into an active -- the statute and the regulation discusses concepts of using and employing, which implies a certain level of active conduct. Here, in this case, we have two emails that were sent moments apart, and the content was essentially prepared by his boss, Gregg Lorenzo."
2018.17-1077,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,643.56,647.44,I'd like to go back to my question on that point.
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,689.52,690.56,"Well, no, Your Honor."
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,707.44,708.8,"I'm sorry, I'm having --"
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,708.8,709.24,If I could --
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,709.24,711.84,-- I'm having a problem from the beginning.
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,726.92,727.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,727.96,748.52,"I don't understand, once you concede that mental state, and he has the act of putting together the email and encouraging customers to call him with questions, not to call his boss with questions, how could that standing alone give away your case?"
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,748.52,748.76,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,748.76,776.56,"I mean, that -- that makes him both the maker of a false statement, whether his boss shared it or not, and I know the courts below thought differently, but it's also engaging in an act, practice, or course of conduct which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person. Whether he was a maker or not, he was encouraging the customers to call him directly about buying or -- buying what was being offered."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,776.56,802.88,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think you're tying into what our position is with respect to what more would be necessary to convert over Mr. Lorenzo into a primary violator, because, if those customers had, in fact, called Frank Lorenzo, which they didn't, and he would then have repeated the statements or he would have engaged in some other type of deceptive conduct, but merely producing and sending the emails is such a low bar that the D.C. Circuit said for --"
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,802.88,836.4,"But, Mr. Heim, we've made very clear in Central Bank that this idea of primary and secondary, if your actions fit within the language of the particular provision of the statute that you're charged on, then you're a primary violator of that provision. Right? And even if, given some other language, you wouldn't be, or given, you know, some more common -- you know, some -- some other understanding of what it means, if you fit within the language and you violate that language, you're a primary violator."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,846.2,850.08,"Well, Justice Kagan, our view is that you can't take that language in -- in a vacuum."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,875.68,905.88,"Well, because -- that is useful because there are some people who don't fall within the language of the statute and, nonetheless, can be charged as an aider and abetter under Section 20, if the SEC does it, if it's not a private action. But what we said in Central Bank is, look, if you do the thing that's -- that is described in a particular subsection of this statute or of the -- or of 10b-5, the rule that implements it, then you're a primary violator as to that subsection."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,905.88,924.76,"Our view is that Mr. Lorenzo did not engage in conduct sufficient to form a violation of 10b-5(c), for instance. When -- when you look at the case law, it has a much higher standard for what constitutes violations of those provisions. So, in order for Mr. Lorenzo to have become a primary violator, he would have had to engage in more active misconduct."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,936.32,946.84,"Well, those would have been bad too, but I guess I just don't get why the act that he did engage in is not an act that operates as a fraud?"
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,946.84,948.4,"Well, for two reasons, Your Honor."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,955.28,969.96,"Well, that's -- you're quoting me (a) and I was using the language of (c), although, honestly, one could just as well use the language of (a) because we've said that a -- a fraudulent device is just a scheme to defraud."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,969.96,977.64,"Well, Your Honor, it -- it has a certain level of -- of intentionality behind it in terms of Mr. Lorenzo."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1024.2,1061.0,"I have to say I think that that works against you, that principle, because, you're right, that all of 10b-5 is coming off of 10(b), which refers only to manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances, but it's well understood that misrepresentations or omissions are manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances, and just those misrepresentations alone. I mean, if -- if some of your arguments were correct, if you took them to their logical extent, you would have to say that misrepresentations and omissions don't fall within that language of 10(b)."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1061.0,1071.76,"Well, Justice Kagan, that's when you get into the importance of the Janus decision because, once Frank Lorenzo is determined not to be the maker of those misstatements, in our view, it takes him out of the category of misstatements and --"
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1071.76,1076.0,"I understand, but your argument would also take out the makers of those misstatements."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1076.0,1082.16,Not necessarily because the makers of the misstatements would have primary liability.
2018.17-1077,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1095.6,1103.32,"Well, but I thought -- I thought you said just a short while ago that simply sending an email is -- is -- is not enough."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1103.32,1104.6,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.17-1077,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1104.6,1125.76,"So then you -- your distinction depends solely on the content of the email? In other words, it's -- it gets down to the basic question of whether or not Frank Lorenzo was involved at all in the drafting? So, for you -- for you to prevail, we have to understand him as -- as, I guess he argued at one point, not even reading the email?"
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1125.76,1148.56,"No, Mr. Chief Justice. That -- I don't think, in order for us to prevail, you have to make that finding. Our position is that the Court should establish the test that Mr. Lorenzo's conduct has to be something that's inherently deceptive, and that would be sufficient to push him over the line from being somebody who is not the maker of the misstatement but could still somehow be held liable under Rules 10b-5(a) and (c)."
2018.17-1077,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1148.56,1179.64,"So why wasn't it -- I mean, I -- I thought he sent his email around to people and said this company, which he knew was worthless from their filing, has $10 million in assets, which he knew wasn't true, and also had $43 million other to -- to back it up, which he knew wasn't true, and his defense was, well, I only sent it because my boss told me, his -- the other Lorenzo. And so, fine, then he's not the maker. But it seems pretty bad."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1193.08,1194.08,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1224.44,1227.2,I'm -- that's what I'm having trouble with.
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1237.68,1237.84,Well --
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1237.84,1242.12,Because it doesn't talk about making statements.
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1275.32,1282.92,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, just to be clear, our position, as was the D.C. Circuit, was that Mr. Lorenzo was not the maker of -- of these statements."
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1282.92,1283.84,He wasn't the maker --
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1283.84,1284.2,Right.
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1284.2,1285.04,-- but he had the scienter.
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1285.04,1286.16,"He had the scienter, but that's --"
2018.17-1077,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1286.16,1287.64,And you're not disputing that.
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1287.64,1291.88,"Correct, but that's not the test in terms of whether he would fall into one category or the other."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1314.96,1323.88,"Well, you -- you're suggesting that because (b) refers specifically to misrepresentations, that those misrepresentations do not fall within (a) or (c)."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1337.92,1340.68,"(a) and (c), Your Honor, are closer together."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1348.16,1377.44,"Well, no, but we have to understand what the statute is about. You're presenting one view of the statute, which is that each of these -- or the rule, which -- which is that each of these different sections is -- is apart from each -- is apart from the rest, that each prohibits a different thing from the -- and I guess I'm suggesting a different view of the statute, which -- which is -- which (a) and (c) make pretty clear, that these are very overlapping."
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1394.0,1398.68,"Well, Justice Kagan, we don't dispute that there could be some overlap between the different subsections."
2018.17-1077,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1418.16,1424.12,"But then I'm going to ask you again, what's the difference in meaning between (a) and (c)?"
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1424.12,1426.28,"Well, the -- they both deal with conduct."
2018.17-1077,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1487.76,1506.96,"Can I ask you just some basic questions? The -- there's no doubt, is there, that at the time this email was sent, Lorenzo knew full well that the company was worthless?"
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1506.96,1515.52,"Well, we -- we did not challenge the scienter finding, which was also conceivably, and as set out there, a recklessness finding."
2018.17-1077,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1525.4,1528.32,And the record is a little confusing.
2018.17-1077,0,63063,robert_heim,,1539.16,1553.16,"Well, the -- the -- well, there is inconsistencies in the record, but, overall, the -- the import of the testimony taken together was such that it was Gregg Lorenzo that was the -- the creator of the email and the maker of the statements."
2018.17-1077,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.48,1574.96,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1574.96,1604.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's decision to send emails that grossly misrepresented the financial prospects of his client and to give illusory promises designed to deceive investors into backing a business that he knew was failing constitute a quintessential securities fraud. His conduct falls within the plain text and the common-sense meaning of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and subsections (a) and (c) of Rule 10b-5."
2018.17-1077,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1604.12,1604.56,Why didn't you charge --
2018.17-1077,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1604.56,1605.2,It sounds like the --
2018.17-1077,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1605.2,1605.44,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1077,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.44,1612.0,It sounds like the argument your -- your client made in Janus that was rejected by this Court.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1612.0,1627.0,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in Janus, the provision at issue was 10b-5(b). And the government is no longer pressing a 10b-5(b) charge in this case. The -- the Janus opinion, from start to finish, is very clear that it's interpreting the term ""make"" in Rule 10b-5."
2018.17-1077,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1627.0,1634.72,But the essential argument on the other side is that the argument you're now pressing is just an end run about Janus.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1652.0,1664.6,"Well, Your Honor, a couple of points in response to that. First of all, Janus will still have significant meaning, especially in private actions, because Janus limits the number -- limits who can come within 10b-5(b)."
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1730.12,1731.88,"Counsel, that's not how I understand the argument."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1756.24,1757.44,"Yes, Justice Gorsuch."
2018.17-1077,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1757.44,1757.84,Okay.
2018.17-1077,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1759.48,1760.84,"Well, are you? Because there's another statute --"
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1760.84,1761.4,"Well, if I -- if I --"
2018.17-1077,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1761.4,1763.2,"-- too, which is Section 17."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1763.2,1764.2,That's true.
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1767.24,1768.76,I'm just talking about 10(b) -- 10(b) at the moment.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1819.92,1827.76,"So I think it was maybe around step four that I disagreed with you, and that is I think you said that he didn't make the act."
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1838.92,1844.08,"But the only act of fraud, you have to have an act that deceives someone else."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1849.48,1850.12,That's -- that's --
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1850.12,1852.0,And he didn't -- and he didn't make them.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1852.0,1857.28,"That's -- well, the D.C. -- the ALJ found and the D.C. Circuit affirmed that he did personally produce and send these emails."
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1857.28,1863.2,"Well, are -- are you challenging that? I understood the government to say we're not challenging the D.C. Circuit's holding that he didn't make the statements."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1863.2,1865.0,We're not -- we are not challenging the finding that he didn't --
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1865.0,1865.16,Okay.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1865.16,1873.6,"-- make the statements. But we -- we -- but the D.C. Circuit also determined, upholding the ALJ, that he did do the act."
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1891.88,1901.28,"The actus -- I think where we're getting stuck, and then I'll -- I'll stop, I promise, is that the actus reus for fraud is the act of actually deceiving another person."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1908.08,1908.88,I -- I agree.
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1908.88,1909.28,Okay.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1909.28,1910.32,But I think the transmission of it --
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1910.32,1911.48,We agree -- we agree on that.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1911.48,1912.12,Yes --
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1912.12,1912.2,Okay.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1912.2,1917.2,"-- but the transmission of -- the statement in the abstract, you know, does -- does nothing."
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1926.6,1930.04,"But the act -- the relevant act for fraud, again, though, is the act of deceiving another."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1930.04,1931.56,And -- yes.
2018.17-1077,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1944.4,1956.44,"Just so I understand the SG's position on this issue, do you believe that Janus controls 17(a)(2)? You didn't charge it or it wasn't charged here."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1967.24,1969.32,"No, that's not the SG office's position."
2018.17-1077,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1975.96,1976.64,Do you know why?
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1976.64,1996.36,"I don't actually know exactly why (a)(2) wasn't -- 17(a)(2) wasn't charged in this case, but the reason we wouldn't take that position is that the verb ""make"" is not in 17(a)(2), and that is critically the word that the Court was interpreting in Janus. I -- on that point, I do want to make clear that Janus was self-consciously a decision only about 10b-5(b)."
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.64,2106.08,"What does ""fraud"" mean, other than trying -- doing something to -- to create in the mind of the hearer or recipient a false belief that is material?"
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2106.08,2108.88,I -- I think that's a good -- I think that's a good description of it.
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2108.88,2111.0,"Well, that's Black's Law Dictionary."
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2113.04,2118.24,"If that's what it is, if that's what it is, there could be two ways of doing it."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2152.0,2154.24,Yes.
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2154.24,2154.64,Okay.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2156.24,2156.56,Yes.
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.56,2192.56,"But I just wondered why this isn't fairly simple, because now what we did in Janus is we took a category of things which we thought the maker had made the false representation, and we thought, no, he wasn't the maker, but, still, he might be the big boss of a group of people who, in fact, took actions or made statements to cause the false representation to arise in the mind of the listener."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2194.0,2194.6,I -- I do.
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.44,2198.64,"And that, it seemed to me, is your basic argument."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2198.64,2199.44,That's correct.
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.16,2208.84,"I was thinking about it that way, but I dissented in Janus."
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2210.72,2211.96,-- I don't want to be --
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2211.96,2213.2,"Well, I actually think --"
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.2,2215.32,I don't want it to be oversimplified.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2215.32,2215.72,Right.
2018.17-1077,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2244.16,2260.24,"Well, no, the argument is if you read (a) and (c) the way you do, Janus is a dead letter, right? I mean, in -- in the reply brief, the Petitioner says you never suggest any situation to which Janus would apply, if your reading of 10b-5 prevails."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2260.24,2262.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, that -- we disagree with that."
2018.17-1077,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2263.84,2264.96,"Well, let's hear if you -- go ahead."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2264.96,2316.4,"Well, perhaps we didn't suggest it in -- in our brief, but, you know, if you had somebody who was far back in the chain of drafting copy, you know, for example, a marketing director who drafted copy that was itself not deceptive but that that person knew would then be used in a fraud or you had a speech writer who drafted something that was not wrong but he knew was later going to be used in a fraud, that person in our view would be an aider and abetter. That would not be a primary violation, for the important reason that Rule 10b -- that Section 10(b) itself requires a deceptive act. And simply submitting material that you know is later going to be used fraudulently would give you the -- the requisite mens rea for substantial assistance but not for a violation of 10b-5(b) itself. And Janus will be the critical case in those scenarios between primary liability and secondary liability."
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.08,2339.72,"I think the Chief Justice is thinking of someone who does -- prior to Janus, would have made a statement, and now that seemed to be excluded in Janus."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2339.72,2340.4,So the -- I mean --
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2340.4,2358.4,"And -- and now we have a way of making, for that set of people, Janus irrelevant because the aiding and abetting argument you just made would have existed pre-Janus or ante-Janus. One possible attitude is to say: So much the better."
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2361.96,2379.56,"And so -- so -- so -- so what is the answer to the Chief Justice's question, which was raised by your opponents, that it still has life and, in fact, makes a difference even for people who before and after, maybe in the private context, what is -- what is --"
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2379.56,2381.28,"May -- well, let me try to be clear."
2018.17-1077,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2408.6,2425.4,"Your -- so the SEC would argue that somebody that prepared one of these documents that's -- contains fraudulent material or -- or knew that it would be used in a fraud, in other words, you would say, oh, don't worry about that, that person's not a maker, he's not going to be liable because of Janus?"
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2425.4,2427.92,"Before Janus, we would have said he was a maker."
2018.17-1077,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2526.4,2532.0,"I think he was saying something to the effect of, if it's only statements, it can't be conduct."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2532.0,2533.92,"Yeah, I -- I don't think that can work either."
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2561.16,2561.4,"Well, counsel --"
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2561.4,2563.56,-- that statements are devices under 10(b).
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2563.56,2577.4,"-- I think what I'm -- what I heard at any rate -- and we can -- it's an interesting question what the argument is, but I had understood it that, all right, one can create a false impression in the mind of another through conduct or through statements."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2596.2,2603.0,"Well, I think he -- he didn't make the statement, we -- the D.C. Circuit found, but he still employed the device to defraud or engaged in --"
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2603.0,2603.84,He sure helped.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2616.48,2621.12,"Well, I -- I guess I -- I might quibble with the last point, that -- the ""other than"" is quite important."
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2623.16,2624.0,"Oh, for sure."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2635.76,2639.92,"Well, on the facts of this case, Your Honor, there is no secondary liability charge."
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2642.52,2644.88,"We're not worried about just this case, are we, counsel?"
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2644.88,2647.44,I -- I did want to make that one point.
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2647.44,2651.56,"You've made the point, but you -- you concede we've got bigger fish to fry than that, right?"
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2651.56,2651.92,Right.
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2673.72,2676.16,"You've got lots of mens rea, I grant you."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2676.96,2677.72,Those are acts.
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2677.72,2680.12,"Oh, those are acts. They are indeed acts."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2690.92,2695.08,I suppose the answer to that is that sending an email is conduct.
2018.17-1077,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2695.08,2698.16,"Yeah, it took acts to get to those minds, right?"
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2698.16,2706.36,"Absolutely, and the act it took in particular was sending the email, sending the two emails, without which these investors never would have been deceived."
2018.17-1077,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2711.56,2729.08,"It helped the deception, but the deceptive -- the thing that caused the deception in the mind of the other, to get back to Justice Breyer's quotation from Black's, was the statement in the email, the -- the erroneous facts transmitted to investors in the email, right? That's it? There's not --"
2018.17-1077,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2729.08,2732.6,"No, it can't cause the deception unless it gets to those readers."
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2732.6,2751.44,"I -- I agree with that. I mean, I suppose another way to think of it is if Petitioner had -- if Petitioner had called up the investors on the phone and said, you know, I hope you just got the email that I sent, this is not my statement, you know, I didn't make it, Gregg Lorenzo made it, but, boy, you really want to look at it because it's a great investment opportunity, and if you have any questions, let me know."
2018.17-1077,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2753.96,2759.24,"When you said -- when you said -- just to clarify, when you said, ""I agree with that,"" were you agreeing with Justice Gorsuch or Justice Kagan? (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2759.24,2760.8,I think it was Justice Kagan.
2018.17-1077,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2760.8,2761.2,Okay.
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2761.2,2764.56,Is there a distinction between conduct and statement?
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2764.56,2764.88,Well --
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2764.88,2766.28,Okay.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2766.28,2767.64,No.
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2767.64,2770.8,What did you just state?
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2770.8,2771.32,Yes. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.32,2777.16,"You know, I mean, don't we make statements all the time through conduct?"
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2777.16,2778.08,"Yes, of course."
2018.17-1077,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2778.08,2780.16,Thank you.
2018.17-1077,1,62926,christopher_g_michel,,2784.16,2787.68,"And, you know, I -- I think it runs in both directions."
2018.17-1077,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2909.88,2914.52,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Heim."
2018.17-1077,2,63063,robert_heim,,2914.52,2921.92,Thank you. My friend argues that their plain language of the rule and the statute covers Mr. Lorenzo's conduct.
2018.17-1077,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2965.72,2977.2,Are you saying -- saying 17(a)(2) covers this case? Are you saying that Lorenzo used this statement to obtain money or property?
2018.17-1077,2,63063,robert_heim,,2977.2,3025.96,"No, I think if that -- if that had been charged, Mr. Lorenzo would have arguments and defenses to 17(a)(2), but the charge would have been a closer fit to what the conduct is here and it would not have raised the serious issues with regards to undermining Congress's statutory framework with regards to aiding and abet -- aiding and abetting and the requirement to have substantial assistance, because, as Justice Gorsuch noted, Mr. Lorenzo did not engage in an inherently deceptive act. Sending an email is not inherently deceptive. And our position, consistent with the circuit court majority, is that the act, in order to take Mr. Lorenzo out of the category of misstatements and into the category of (a) and (c), has to be something that's inherently deceptive."
2018.17-1077,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3030.04,3035.56,Why isn't it inherently deceptive to tell a succession of untruths?
2018.17-1077,2,63063,robert_heim,,3035.56,3037.76,The act is the sending of the email.
2018.17-1077,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3102.2,3103.2,"Thank you, counsel."
