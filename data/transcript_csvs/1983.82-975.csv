1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.237,We will hear arguments next in The City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,16.162,20.316,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-975,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,82.446,85.298,"What exactly are the cross bars, Mr. Alperin?"
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,85.298,112.313,"--The cross wires are a wire or cable which attaches the upright wooden utility pole to another pole on the other side of the sidewalk, and that pole is then attached from the top of the pole on the other side of the sidewalk to the top of the wooden utility pole with a wire and it helps support the pole in an upright position."
1983.82-975,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,112.313,114.817,"Is any of this in private property, Mr. Alperin?"
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,114.817,120.951,"Some of it is owned by private utility companies, and what is owned by private utility companies--"
1983.82-975,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,120.951,121.83,You say some of it.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,122.912,137.69,"--Without knowing exactly how many of the utility poles are owned by private utility companies and how much by the City, they are owned either by the City or by the utility companies."
1983.82-975,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,172.834,186.073,You do not think there is for First Amendment purposes any difference between a prohibition against hanging signs from privately owned wires and publicly owned?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,186.073,189.276,Not with regard to these utility poles.
1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,240.097,248.633,In the particular election that was involved here how many candidates were there for all the public offices on that election date?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,253.317,259.25,The record does not show exactly how many there were.
1983.82-975,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,354.083,366.45,"Mr. Alperin, following through on Justice Rehnquist's question, at pages 136 and 137 of the Appendix are those photographs of cross wires?"
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,366.45,371.144,"Yes, they are."
1983.82-975,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,371.144,375.897,How do they affect the safety of the workers involved?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,380.26,386.735,These signs attached to these cross wires will generally not affect the safety of the workers.
1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,488.362,497.338,--What if the people interested in Proposition 10... I take it that is what appears in 136 is it not?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,497.338,498.639,That is correct.
1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,498.639,499.761,The referendum.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,522.216,528.83,It is not clear whether that is an unlawful act.
1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,552.405,554.025,It acquires no right.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,554.025,559.418,We do not believe that someone who puts up a sign acquires any rights.
1983.82-975,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.426,573.119,"It would be a great law school exam on personal property, would it not?"
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,573.119,575.34,"I am sorry, Mr. Rehnquist, I did not--"
1983.82-975,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.34,579.333,That would be a great law school exam question in a personal property class.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,580.051,580.612,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-975,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,581.684,599.807,Does this ordinance include a prohibition against the individual homeowner if it was a tree or shrub on property from erecting a pro or con Item 10 sign on his property on his tree or shrub?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,599.807,612.813,The City has generally interpreted this ordinance to apply to signs which are either on City property or on a City parkway.
1983.82-975,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,615.384,619.988,There is no exception as I read 28.04.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,619.988,624.591,--On its face it would apply to any tree.
1983.82-975,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,657.633,661.967,You mean if I have a tree in my yard that tree is a public resource?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,661.967,671.291,"It is not public property, but certainly having that tree adds to the vitality and to the beauty of that community."
1983.82-975,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,693.448,700.92,"So even Mr. Marcus running for office could not put a sign up on his own home lawn ""Please vote for me""?"
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,700.92,707.785,"Arguably that is the case, but the City would certainly not seek to enforce its ordinance in that case."
1983.82-975,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,738.526,739.666,"Mr. Alperin, how is this ordinance enforced?"
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,742.718,748.161,It is generally enforced by City personnel pulling down these signs.
1983.82-975,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.556,764.694,So that conceivably in Justice Brennan's example a person could be charged with a crime for putting a sign up on a tree on his own lawn?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,764.694,772.919,Theoretically that may be possible unless you read the ordinance as not applying.
1983.82-975,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.993,784.977,It would not reasonably but literally it does.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,784.977,787.557,"Yes, we would have to concede that literally--"
1983.82-975,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.557,791.1,"Unless the City construed to the contrary, but no California court has construed the ordinance."
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,791.801,813.064,"--To our knowledge this ordinance has been construed in one unreported case... not construed by the constitutionality, has been tested in one unreported case of a superior court appellate department decision."
1983.82-975,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,860.445,863.417,This suit was a facial attack on the ordinance?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,863.417,864.508,That is right.
1983.82-975,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,891.166,893.227,"Well, I would expect it would be it is a facial attack."
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,893.227,912.66,"That is certainly correct, but what was litigated and what all of the attention was placed on was the question of whether or not these objects including trees and shrubs which are located or and along the streets are a public forum."
1983.82-975,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.956,1111.629,"Mr. Alperin, may I ask a question following up on Justice Brennan's inquiry about signs on private property?"
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1132.974,1147.252,"--There is another City ordinance which is another section of the Municipal Code, Section 28.03, which prohibits the attachment of signs to buildings and to any private property without the consent of the owner."
1983.82-975,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.252,1147.993,I see.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1147.993,1179.644,"In further answer to Mr. Brennan's question and your question following up on that with regard to the trees, certainly because of the existence of that other section we could construe the reference to trees in Section 28.04 to relate only to trees on public property because we have another section that relates to attachment of signs to private property and that certainly would include trees on private property which would be a reasonable interpretation of both ordinances together."
1983.82-975,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.644,1215.849,"Mr. Alperin, if you look at page 16 of the Joint Appendix there you have I believe Exhibit B which you filed as one of your exhibits to your answer in the district court, and as I read it it is a statement which says the policy of the Los Angeles Police Department in enforcing violations and it describes Section 28.03 prohibits the painting or posting of any handbill or sign on private property without the consent of the owner, agent or occupant."
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1224.463,1225.355,That is correct.
1983.82-975,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.355,1229.177,Now was that summarizing the way the ordinance is enforced?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1229.177,1243.076,"Yes, that is true with the only exception that indeed some of the utility poles although used by the public are private property because they belong to privately owned utilities."
1983.82-975,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.945,1263.029,But the utility may not consent to signs on its poles.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1263.029,1264.05,That is correct.
1983.82-975,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.06,1268.351,"Well, it does not say that in the ordinance."
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1268.351,1270.304,--The utility... It is not a part of this record.
1983.82-975,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.67,1319.075,"Well, we are talking about the legality of these particular prohibitions, and you say that these two, one of the other of these forbids signs on public utility poles, utility poles even if the utility gave its consent."
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1320.296,1322.408,That is correct.
1983.82-975,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.76,1333.584,And some other section of the law or some other regulation prohibits the utility from giving its consent at all.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1335.127,1343.913,--A state agency regulation prohibits them from giving its consent at all but so does Section 28.04.
1983.82-975,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.072,1368.419,The kind of so-called public property that you are talking about in 28.04 includes utility poles.
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1368.419,1382.208,"--It includes... The public property includes the publicly owned utility properties, but the section also prohibits attachment of signs to the utility poles that are owned by privately owned utility companies."
1983.82-975,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1573.101,1579.845,"Mr. Alperin, is the sidewalk a public forum in your view?"
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1579.845,1583.548,The sidewalk is indeed a public forum.
1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1592.835,1596.726,But if they gather and block traffic--
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1596.726,1604.243,"If they gather and block traffic then the City could certainly enforce an ordinance which would be a reasonable time, place and manner restriction."
1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1604.243,1609.144,--So it is not the place that was established as a public forum for communication was it?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1609.144,1611.345,One of the purposes of sidewalks--
1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1611.345,1616.25,Is the purpose to transport people and things from one place to another?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1616.25,1618.031,--That is one of its purposes.
1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1618.031,1619.99,Is it not the primary purpose?
1983.82-975,0,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,1619.99,1634.272,"It may even be the primary purpose, but one of its purposes just like the street certainly is for people as long as they do not block the use of the sidewalk by people who want to get from one place to another a place of discussion."
1983.82-975,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1656.486,1664.91,Mr. Canterbury.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1664.91,1670.396,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-975,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1696.723,1701.716,Do you agree that we should read the ordinance as applying only to public property?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1701.716,1712.051,The portion of the ordinance that we challenged on appeal was only Section 28.04.
1983.82-975,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1735.307,1741.1,And you do not think we should read 28.04 as covering privately owned trees and shrubs?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1741.1,1742.071,"--I do not, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.769,1757.232,It is just 28.04 that is involved here.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1757.232,1757.732,That is right.
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.912,1766.098,So you are saying that the City may not close down the public property to these signs.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1766.098,1767.359,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1769.69,1770.83,"I do not quite understand, Mr. Canterbury."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1799.039,1803.741,"--It is really unclear from the record, and I do not know how it is enforced."
1983.82-975,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1805.263,1807.484,How do I read it just looking at the face of it?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1807.484,1808.736,"--I would agree, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1817.99,1821.443,But this is a facial attack is it not?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1821.443,1825.806,"--It is a facial attack, but our complaint makes it clear that we are also attacking it as it is interpreted by--"
1983.82-975,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1825.806,1827.187,As applied?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1827.187,1828.298,--As applied.
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.298,1839.325,I take it the thrust of your argument is not overbreadth but the fact that even if it were limited strictly to public property it is invalid.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1839.325,1840.657,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.657,1844.758,That the public interest just is not sufficient.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1844.758,1845.9,That is correct.
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1845.9,1850.344,Even if it were limited strictly to public property which you think it is.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1853.264,1867.264,"Frankly, I do think that as enforced and from the record that we have before us that the issue here in my mind is whether it can ban all signs on public property."
1983.82-975,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1867.264,1873.297,In any event that is the way you want... That is your submission as the way we should decide this case is it not?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1873.297,1876.728,"Yes, as interpreted and as enforced by the police department."
1983.82-975,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1906.32,1913.393,"I suppose on its face it does not cover all public property, does it, such as parks and other areas?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1913.393,1914.444,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1930.895,1934.358,"Well, I thought it argued it had safety goals as well."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1934.358,1935.85,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.493,1975.294,What would you say about an ordinance that required a person to get a license before they put up any signs and the deposit of cash or a bond equivalent to $1 for every sign they put up to provide the cost of taking them down.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1975.294,1982.7,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that would be an impermissible restraint on the exercise of this type of political expression."
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.507,1996.387,"Well, suppose we make it ten cents a sign then."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,1998.999,2016.611,"--It is the amount and it is the fact that the candidates running for nation-wide office or even state-wide office would have to go into each town, determine what the particular permit requirements were, learn those, apply them and post their signs after they posted their bonds."
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2016.611,2019.373,"Who is supposed to bear the expense, of taking them down?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2019.373,2021.524,The candidates should bear that expense.
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2021.524,2029.149,"Well, would that not be a reasonable way to make the candidate bear the expenses ten cents a sign to remove?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2029.149,2031.741,"I suggest it would not, Your Honor, because there is no--"
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2031.741,2032.171,All right.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2033.691,2048.132,"--The principle I think, Your Honor, is that the candidate or the persons responsible for posting the signs should be made to take the sign down after the election and if they do not then a penalty may be imposed at that time."
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2048.132,2049.723,Then proceed against them criminally?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2049.723,2052.714,At that tire that would be appropriate.
1983.82-975,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.714,2061.35,"Mr. Canterbury, supposing in the Chief Justice's hypothesis that the cities had a criminal statute and they just cannot get convictions under it."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2087.777,2104.989,"I believe that that would bear some scrutiny, Your Honor, for this reason that under that situation posited you would essentially have law abiding candidates who took down their signs after the election paying for the misfeasance of those who do not."
1983.82-975,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2124.382,2131.296,"Well, would you put as part of the administration cost the cost to the city of taking the signs down?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2131.296,2133.476,I would prefer that it not be.
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.99,2159.294,"Mr. Canterbury, may I ask a question about the nature of the right that you claim exists?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2181.438,2184.04,I could not complain to the City about that.
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.04,2185.001,Could you complain to him?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2185.001,2185.862,Yes.
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.862,2186.924,He preserved your sign.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2191.435,2193.576,"Well, he has destroyed it for our purposes, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.576,2198.779,He has assumed the same right that you... Is it the first one that gets there has a right to stay there forever?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2201.112,2206.706,You have a right to keep the sign up until the election has passed and the sign has served the purpose.
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.706,2211.148,The first one getting there in effect acquires an easement in the premises?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2211.148,2215.882,"I would not go so far as to use the term ""easement"" but I do believe that for the same reason that--"
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2215.882,2227.97,"Well, supposing the person who got their first wanted to permanently advertise the sale of his home or something like that or permanent garage sale, he put a sign up there and said I want to leave it there until I sell everything in the house."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2227.97,2231.229,"--Of course, that would be a form of commercial speech which would not be--"
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.229,2232.241,"Is that not protected, too?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2232.241,2235.383,--It may be protected but not to the same degree that political speech is.
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.383,2237.444,This ordinance does not discriminate between the two.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2237.444,2238.886,This ordinance does not.
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.247,2253.846,"In other words, you think that there is a right... Supposing early in a primary say now if a democratic candidate wanted to put a sign up there and leave it up there for ten months, would he have the right to keep it there for the entire period of the election?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2253.846,2261.471,"I think the general rule would be that he would have a right to... I think that the candidate must make that decision ahead of time, yes."
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.471,2265.785,The first one to get there has a constitutional right to keep it there?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2265.785,2269.198,"He has a constitutional right to use the property, yes."
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.891,2277.743,Supposing the utility company which owned the pole said we do not want the sign there.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2283.597,2285.119,"In that situation I think not, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.208,2314.659,Do you think that our cases would support the notion that a public utility is subject to the same obligation that you contend a city is by way of allowing signs to be posted on its property?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2314.659,2325.925,"Your Honor, I think that Marsh v. Alabama does support that proposition especially if it is found in any particular town that the utility poles are universally owned."
1983.82-975,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.925,2332.039,"Well, there is a lot of water that has flowed under the damns since Marsh v. Alabama so far as our decisions are concerned."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2332.039,2338.213,"In the shopping center cases that is true, Your Honor, but I believe that the foundational underpinnings of Marsh would apply in the situation--"
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.213,2357.365,"Well, if you are right why could the candidate after he is elected looking forward to his next election not just change his sign that he had up during the campaign and say John Jones is doing a good job by the city council and just leave it up all the time just so that the people will keep his name in their minds?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2357.365,2359.458,"--Well, I think that he could; however, he risks--"
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.458,2365.272,I know but could the city take it down consistent with your views?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2365.272,2372.094,"--No, Your Honor, the city could not unless that sign became tattered and worn or became a threat."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.094,2379.31,"No, he keeps it fresh because he wants the public to respect him so he keeps the sign fresh."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2379.31,2383.684,I have to answer that I believe that he would be entitled to do that.
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.684,2392.25,So by getting there first he can permanently occupy that particular place on the cross bar?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2392.25,2394.1,"No, Your Honor, perhaps that is the answer to this question."
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2405.347,2406.288,How long would that be?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2409.79,2413.471,--I cannot give an arbitrary time period.
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.471,2418.105,"Well, if someone wants to get reelected for the rest of his life and he wants--"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2418.105,2422.627,"It is almost assured, Your Honor, that if he keeps the signs up he will never be elected."
1983.82-975,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2449.134,2458.251,--Could the signs be illuminated without violating any constitutional right?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2458.251,2470.63,We do not contend that we would have any right to illuminate the signs if the illumination would involve running wires up the poles.
1983.82-975,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2478.066,2491.173,"I am thinking, for example, of the type of signs that you sometimes see on highways that are illuminated when light hits them, have reflector lights so that people can read them at night as well as in the daytime."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2508.724,2520.432,"Well, Your Honor, again I think that the answer lies in whether the sign constitutes any hazard to the public, interferes with traffic and the like."
1983.82-975,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2526.576,2531.571,I think the Court of Appeals suggested some limitation in size.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2532.34,2533.611,"Yes, I would, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2533.611,2539.605,"While we are talking about the courts' decisions, there has been a good deal of discussion as to whether this ordinance covers private property."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2549.551,2553.104,That has been the assumption in this case from the very start.
1983.82-975,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2553.104,2555.525,The opinions express this also.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2555.525,2557.067,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2557.067,2585.494,The first paragraph of Judge Nelson's opinion as to 28.04 relating to public property and on page 18A paragraph 18 of the trial court's findings of fact one of the other means available was stated to be the posting of signs on private property.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2593.809,2595.291,I believe that is the case.
1983.82-975,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2595.291,2602.237,"Yet in your brief, Mr. Canterbury, you rely on the policy statement of the police department."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2618.987,2628.892,"Your Honor, the reason that that was quote was to illustrate that the police department considers 28.04 to ban all signs on public property."
1983.82-975,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2630.705,2638.139,"That might be but it says more than that, posting of any handbill or sign upon public or private property."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2638.139,2643.722,"--Your Honor, that is the case and the ordinance might be more offensive than I thought it to be until today."
1983.82-975,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2643.722,2659.974,I take it the only thing you are concerned about at all in the ordinance is the restriction on the use of power lines and specifically the cross arms.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2659.974,2671.45,"Your Honor, that is the type of property that my clients have traditionally posted these signs on, and when they undertook this--"
1983.82-975,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2671.45,2684.01,But I thought you agreed or said anyway that you agreed that no one had a right to post any kind of a sign on a fire hydrant and some of the other items listed here.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2684.01,2694.695,"--I do agree, Your Honor, but the complaint alleges that my client posts signs over the cross bar in the way that is depicted at page 137--"
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.695,2697.176,How about the utility poles themselves?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2697.176,2698.608,"--No, Your Honor, we do not contend--"
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.608,2700.489,We do not do that but others do.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2700.489,2701.32,--Others do.
1983.82-975,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2701.32,2702.68,It sounds dirty.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2702.68,2705.424,An ordinance prohibiting that--
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.424,2706.844,The candidates who do not want to get elected.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2706.844,2708.065,--That is right.
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.982,2760.699,But your submission here is I take it that that prohibition of signs or posters on utility poles is also unconstitutional.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2760.699,2762.019,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.962,2768.574,You mean if the ordinance just related to utility poles you would not be here?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2768.574,2769.445,--We--
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.445,2772.457,You would think that ordinance was constitutional?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2772.457,2774.158,"--In fact, I think--"
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.158,2775.008,Which it probably would be.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2775.008,2775.88,--Yes.
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.591,2840.272,So I take it you would be satisfied then if the Court agreed with you that the ordinance would be be applied to the cross bars but was perfectly constitutional as applied to any other public property?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2840.272,2842.733,"No, I think that again would be too broad."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.828,2866.528,But you can make them so small that nobody could read them.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2866.528,2868.799,"--Well, that would be... We have a right to post--"
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2868.799,2878.496,"No, but as soon as they become large enough to read from any distance... You cannot have it both ways."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2878.496,2882.049,"--Again, the question is one of reasonableness."
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2894.546,2900.121,"I asked your friend who was not sure, but I will ask you."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2912.828,2914.28,"I have no idea, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2914.28,2914.731,Ten candidates?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2916.781,2918.993,I simply do not know.
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2924.548,2926.859,Do you have written ballots or voting machines out there?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2926.859,2928.7,--We have voting machines.
1983.82-975,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2928.7,2931.692,You are from San Francisco any way?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2931.692,2933.071,"Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.465,2943.598,"Are you not taking a risk, a San Francisco lawyer going to litigate in Los Angeles?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2944.459,2947.82,"--Well, the district court apparently came to that conclusion."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.82,2949.372,"Yes, you lost."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2973.81,2976.11,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.383,2983.404,"Well, if you can do it, so can everybody."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2983.404,2985.497,"Oh, absolutely."
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2988.308,2999.496,"Your position is that that clutter, that impact on the environment is something the city has no right to control?"
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,2999.496,3006.281,"First of all, I would not characterize it myself as clutter, but assuming that that is the way we wish to characterize it--"
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3006.281,3010.292,I am just looking at the picture that you put in the record.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3010.292,3010.993,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.427,3077.715,"Of course, the City's power to regulate the right of a person or property owner to put a sign on his own property may be a good deal more limited than the City's right to regulate the right of others to put signs on property owned by the City."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3079.688,3101.952,It is our position that the opposite is true that Los Angeles may very well be able to pass a comprehensive plan to address the visual pollution problem in Los Angeles and take into consideration the visual impact of signs on private property and public property.
1983.82-975,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3105.034,3117.392,You are saying the City is freer to or has more latitude in telling me if I own a Tastee Freeze along the street that I cannot put up a sign on the building that says Tastee Freeze.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3129.08,3130.77,"That is our position, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3130.77,3137.034,Could the City of Los Angeles prevent you from putting one of these signs in the public square?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3137.034,3138.587,In the public square?
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3138.587,3139.576,Yes.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3139.576,3145.681,It would depend on the public square.
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3153.917,3156.908,Do you not know what a public square is?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3156.908,3165.054,--I am trying to conjure one in Los Angeles.
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3166.276,3170.009,You are trying not to answer the question.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3176.774,3177.653,Your Honor--
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3177.653,3184.108,My question is can you bar public signs in that square that you pick?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3184.108,3194.764,--The answer depends on whether that square or park is aesthetically so sensitive that its character would be destroyed by the placement of signs on or around it.
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3202.07,3204.1,You use two quite different tests.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3208.785,3212.745,If the character is substantially impaired.
1983.82-975,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3212.745,3213.887,Substantially impaired.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3214.728,3217.93,"I had more time to think about that, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3217.93,3222.533,How about the public square in front of the court house?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3222.533,3227.104,"I think that would be permissible, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3227.104,3227.855,What?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3227.855,3229.137,That would be permissible.
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3231.518,3241.994,You can put up a sign in the public square of the court house of every candidate who is running for office assuming you have that much room?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3241.994,3267.082,"I do not believe any sign can be placed on the court house or on the steps even for a period of 24 or 48 hours, but if there are public utility poles that line the street in front of the court house and for the same reason that this Court decided in Grace that persons can walk around the court house--"
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3267.082,3280.89,I am saying that could they pass a law saying no signs in the public square in front of the court house without the City's permission?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3284.934,3291.469,"--I suspect it would not be, Your Honor, because I do not believe that signs would substantially impair the character of the place."
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3291.469,3295.761,You mean you can put up any sign in front of the court house you want to put up?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3295.761,3296.872,"Not any sign, no."
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3301.473,3310.859,So the aesthetic values of the city are to be determined by each individual?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3310.859,3311.831,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3314.783,3336.717,The city has a hearing and they decided that multiple signs of multiple colors involving multiple problems would destroy the aesthetic value of not of the whole city at least of the court house lawn that that would be unconstitutional.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3336.717,3340.5,"I do not take that position absolutely, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3347.966,3351.676,Let us go back to the priority matter that Justice White mentioned earlier.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3375.903,3380.616,I believe the city can regulate against that type of abuse.
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3380.616,3383.578,Now the city deals with this when it happens.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3398.356,3399.648,"I think it should, yes."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.576,3428.497,"Mr. Canterbury, I take it you really are not defending the judgment of the Court of Appeals except insofar as it applies to the places you want to put signs on."
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3428.497,3430.179,I hope I am defending the--
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3430.179,3435.422,Did they declare this statute unconstitutional on its face?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3435.422,3436.263,"--Yes, they did."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3436.263,3442.367,I thought you were suggesting it is only unconstitutional as applied to these cross bars.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3442.367,3442.906,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.745,3457.798,That is not overbreadth.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3470.825,3473.426,"--No, Your Honor."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.008,3485.905,I thought you agreed... Do you think the Court of Appeals would not allow the ordinance if it applied only to the utility poles would it?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3493.679,3509.771,"--No, again the distinction is whether the sign is allowed to be placed on the cross bar out of harm's way or whether the ordinance prohibits the posting of signs on the pole itself."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3511.861,3515.214,You do not think any of your submission today is inconsistent with the Court of Appeals?
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3515.214,3517.415,"--I do not believe it is, Your Honor, no."
1983.82-975,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3517.415,3518.096,Okay.
1983.82-975,1,44166,wayne_s_canterbury,,3518.096,3519.335,If it is I do not see it.
1983.82-975,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3519.335,3522.958,Very well.
1983.82-975,2,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,3525.66,3530.705,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-975,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3556.992,3558.11,How many?
1983.82-975,2,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,3558.11,3559.122,--Several dozen.
1983.82-975,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3559.122,3560.213,Several dozen.
1983.82-975,2,15401,anthony_saul_alperin,,3560.213,3569.67,It may be anywhere from 18 up to a larger number.
1983.82-975,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3810.557,3811.579,"Thank you, gentlemen."
