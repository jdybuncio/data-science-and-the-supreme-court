1980.79-1171,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.028,"We will hear arguments next in No. 79-1171, Minnesota v. Clover Leaf."
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,208.791,214.899,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1171,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,339.27,345.72,Do you think the Minnesota Legislature is about next time to ban paper containers?
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,345.72,348.967,"Do I personally feel they were, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1171,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,348.967,354.279,"Well, whether... was there legislation introduced to that effect in the session in which this one was passed?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,354.279,375.036,This bill originally was introduced in the form of banning specifically the plastic jug in reaction to a then-pending move by major dairies within the State to commit a lot of money and capital expenditures in long-term commitments to the throwaway plastic jug.
1980.79-1171,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,397.636,412.708,"Well, the milk industry and the pulpwood industry in Minnesota both have clout, and... I guess my question is, how political this is, rather than how environmentally protective?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,412.708,425.578,"Well, I don't think it was necessarily at all political in the sense of reacting without legitimate policy to specific pressure groups."
1980.79-1171,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,481.76,484.851,Production within the State?
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,484.851,486.492,Production within the State; that's true.
1980.79-1171,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,507.015,515.511,"Are the paper-type containers divided into two categories, one readily destructible and the other not so readily destructible?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,515.511,522.992,"To my knowledge, Your Honor, there's only one sort of paper container which was at issue."
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.404,592.37,"General Raschke, does the record tell us what happened during the last three years?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,593.011,598.931,"--During the last three years while this case was in litigation, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.931,599.196,Yes.
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,599.196,603.241,I don't believe the record reflects that at all.
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.521,615.266,"If they have in fact all converted, as I guess they've been permitted to do, then the reason for the legislation would have passed, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,616.923,637.54,"Well, I think the idea, Your Honor, was to prevent the situation in which the industry was permitted to go ahead and make these types of investments and then later complain of the tremendous impact it would have on them to then come back and ban either the plastic or the paper."
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.656,670.791,"And the second question, this perhaps duplicates what Mr. Justice Blackmun asked, but as I understand it, part of the rationale was, you've to stop this because we're going to get rid of all disposable containers and paper containers would be next."
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,677.773,679.663,"There's nothing I'm aware of in the public record, Your Honor."
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,699.436,708.058,"I don't see how the outcome, whichever way the case is decided, if the goal really is to get rid of these containers, I don't see any reason why they don't enact the second statute."
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,708.058,720.835,"--Well, I think the goal of the Legislature, Your Honor, is to proceed a step at a time beginning with the least intrusive sort of regulation."
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,722.303,725.91,"Of course, the least offensive regulation is to let the paper containers continue forever, I suppose."
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,725.91,734.015,"--In... well, in moving in the direction of our goal, this statute has never been permitted to take effect."
1980.79-1171,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,739.544,743.388,"In other words, you can't take the next step until this case is resolved, is that your point?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,743.388,745.808,"I think that's a fair statement, Your Honor."
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.651,747.603,But I don't understand why not.
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,755.054,756.866,"--That could be done, Your Honor."
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.707,766.097,"Well, it would remove the constitutional argument that your court relied on."
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,766.097,768.033,--That's perhaps--
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.033,772.563,It would remove any constitutional question and it would clearly accomplish your environmental goal.
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,777.091,779.154,--There are a number of other factors.
1980.79-1171,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,901.962,904.384,May I interrupt you for a minute?
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,904.384,906.321,You may.
1980.79-1171,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,906.321,921.643,"You make the argument that the Minnesota Supreme Court decided this case on substantive due process analysis, and I would certainly agree there's a good deal of language in the opinion that I would construe that way."
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,959.019,969.765,"I think there are a couple of problems, many problems, with the findings of the District Court."
1980.79-1171,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1041.985,1046.077,May I ask you this question about what the Supreme Court of Minnesota said?
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1059.12,1060.478,"85, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1171,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1060.478,1067.334,"A-5, the third sentence in the paragraph beginning, ""We are aware""."
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1073.754,1075.034,A-5?
1980.79-1171,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1075.034,1076.534,Petition for certiorari?
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1076.534,1081.938,"Oh, petition for cert. I was looking at the Appendix."
1980.79-1171,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1083.875,1088.202,"It's the paragraph beginning, ""We are aware""?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1088.202,1089.108,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1171,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1089.108,1089.904,The third sentence:
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1134.808,1150.207,"Well, our Supreme Court did not reach the Commerce Clause issue and I guess I read that particular phrase as referring to what... and what comes after, concerning--"
1980.79-1171,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.207,1164.297,"Well, didn't the Supreme Court also say that specifically the stated legislative finding of the Act is that nonrefillable milk containers present solid waste problems and the stated legislative goal is that the use of returnable milk containers should be encouraged?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1167.295,1167.733,"--Yes, it did."
1980.79-1171,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.733,1169.935,Isn't that inconsistent with the trial court's--
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1169.935,1181.71,"I think it's directly inconsistent, and I don't think by affirming, by saying that they were generally affirming the trial court's standards that they were getting to that point."
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1269.003,1270.128,--I don't understand that last argument guaranteeing it.
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1273.626,1283.576,"--We could do that, Your Honor, and I think that would be a legitimate legislative choice, but what we're arguing here is that it is not a constitutionally mandated legislative choice."
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.706,1313.642,"The difference with the Dukes case is, it was clear from that legislation that as time passed on the people who were then in business would go out of business."
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1317.078,1318.094,"Well, I think in the legislative--"
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1318.094,1318.795,This is no one step at a time argument.
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1325.591,1335.4,--I think the Legislature can be allowed to take the first step without being constitutionally required to guarantee when that second step will occur.
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1335.4,1338.1,Or even to have any indication that it ever intends to take the second step.
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1338.1,1339.553,In the Railway Express case--
1980.79-1171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1339.553,1340.146,"That's your position, isn't it?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1340.146,1350.549,--In the Railway Express case this Court indicated that the legislature is free to address one portion of the problem and leave other portions for a later time.
1980.79-1171,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1355.875,1357.78,"It's been three years now, hasn't it?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1357.78,1359.404,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1171,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.404,1361.263,"It's been three years now, hasn't it?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1361.263,1363.2,"Yes, it has."
1980.79-1171,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1363.2,1366.699,And have you begun to take the second step or not?
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1366.699,1391.767,"I guess the Legislature ought to be entitled after this case is over and hopefully this Court would reverse the Minnesota decision and allow this step to take effect to see how less restrictive, less onerous regulations work before we're constitutionally required by court decree to take the most intrusive measure in accomplishing the goal."
1980.79-1171,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.767,1400.482,"Well, so, has the result of this case been that plastics are now being used?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1400.482,1400.872,They are.
1980.79-1171,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.872,1411.556,So the rationale has disappeared now for saying that we started with plastics because they really hadn't come in yet?
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1411.556,1417.444,"Well, we're trying to stop the major financial commitments, for one thing."
1980.79-1171,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.444,1419.429,"Well, that's past now, isn't it?"
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1419.429,1420.116,We are not aware that those commitments have been made.
1980.79-1171,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1462.659,1465.019,Your time has expired now.
1980.79-1171,0,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,1469.141,1477.996,--I've granted ten minutes to Mr. Dalton of the Solicitor's Office and if he has any time left I would like to rebut.
1980.79-1171,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1477.996,1478.999,Very well.
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1490.646,1492.958,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.474,1712.374,"Mr. Dalton, can I ask you, on this question of federal interest, if there is a choice presented in any commerce situation between using plastic containers and paper containers for dairy products, are you saying that there's a federal interest in choosing paper over plastic?"
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1712.374,1725.244,"No, I'm saying there's a federal interest in leaving Minnesota free to choose paper over plastic, and then in seeing whether that in fact does advance the statutory goals of the--"
1980.79-1171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1725.244,1730.274,"Is the Federal Government indifferent as to whether paper or plastic is used, or does it have a preference?"
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1730.274,1735.897,--I think the Federal Government has a very clear preference for returnable bottles.
1980.79-1171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.897,1743.142,"I understand that but if there's a choice between two disposables, one paper and one plastic, does the Federal Government have an interest in one over the other?"
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1743.142,1749.015,Only to the extent that plastic does use nonrenewable fossil fuels.
1980.79-1171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.967,1751.905,"Well, then your answer is, yes."
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1751.905,1752.78,"--Yes; my answer is, yes."
1980.79-1171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.78,1753.17,You do.
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1758.324,1760.527,Assuming that they are?
1980.79-1171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.152,1763.275,"I mean, we shouldn't make assumptions."
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1769.742,1785.517,"What I'm saying is that, assume that in other respects they are environmentally equally destructive or harmful or nondestructive, that the Federal Government's preference for conserving fossil fuels would make plastic preferable over paper."
1980.79-1171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1797.357,1805.948,"I understand, but I'm curious about the federal interest in this particular issue, and is there a federal interest in preferring plastic over paper in disposable containers?"
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1808.244,1808.603,--Okay.
1980.79-1171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.603,1810.727,Seems to me it's a yes or no question.
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1810.727,1818.207,"Well, in that case the answer must be, yes, given the federal interest in conservation of fossil fuels."
1980.79-1171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.207,1827.126,"Would you have the same interest if a neighboring state said, we will allow plastic but not paper, because we think that's environmentally superior?"
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1829.921,1843.855,"Yes, we would have an interest in that statute because we have an interest in seeing whether that process is an appropriate one or a successful one in leading toward the ultimate goal of returnable containers."
1980.79-1171,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1852.726,1862.378,"Is it the premise here that the pulp used in the other containers is a renewable, because it's a fast growth?"
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1862.378,1863.456,Precisely.
1980.79-1171,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1952.436,1964.821,"You are not saying, I am sure, that the legislative purpose would prevent any factual inquiry as to whether or not the effect of this statute really was discriminatory against interstate commerce, are you?"
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1964.821,1977.348,"--No, I'm certainly not saying that by simply enunciating what legislative purposes that seem consistent with the Commerce Clause, a state can insulate that statute from Commerce Clause challenge."
1980.79-1171,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1983.799,1986.625,"Well, the District Court found to the contrary."
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1986.625,1989.061,--But our position is that the Supreme Court--
1980.79-1171,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1989.061,1990.514,You want us to weigh the evidence?
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1990.514,1991.311,"--Again, please?"
1980.79-1171,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1991.311,1992.747,You want us to weigh the evidence?
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1992.747,1994.075,"No, on the contrary."
1980.79-1171,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2031.232,2034.09,Are there any plastic manufacturers in Minnesota?
1980.79-1171,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,2034.09,2044.43,"My understanding is that there were not at the time that the statute was enacted, but that there was a move afoot to have in-state manufacturing of plastic cartons."
1980.79-1171,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.69,2071.076,Mr. Keyes.
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2071.076,2074.73,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1171,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2138.174,2144.39,"Sooner or later, Mr. Keyes, someone must dispose of the container, whatever it is, must they not?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2144.39,2144.687,--Surely.
1980.79-1171,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.015,2149.342,It may even take about four drinks but it is--
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2149.342,2150.092,"They don't litter it, Your Honor."
1980.79-1171,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2162.727,2165.289,--And are these plastic containers combustible?
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2165.289,2167.147,--They are completely combustible.
1980.79-1171,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.761,2196.978,Do you agree that the trial was much like a legislative hearing?
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2196.978,2200.68,"--I do not agree with that, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.055,2253.487,"Would you be here if the statute had said, no plastics and also no paper, five years from now?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2253.487,2260.781,I assure you that we would not be here if it had said no plastic or no paper right now.
1980.79-1171,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2295.579,2300.702,"No one knows really very much about this problem as yet, do we?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2310.027,2317.072,"We did have, of course, the MRI report which, and the expert witnesses from both sides who testified in the lower court."
1980.79-1171,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2317.072,2317.759,I was speaking of experience.
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2320.946,2326.193,"Very little experience in this type of statute, Your Honor, yes."
1980.79-1171,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2327.818,2329.302,The technology?
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2329.302,2330.286,--Technology?
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.055,2420.156,"Suppose that at the time the legislation was passed the industry was using plastic and paper half and half, and the Minnesota court said, well, we want to get to returnables and we're going to start with plastic."
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2428.965,2430.59,"We submit, not on the evidence."
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.59,2430.979,"Well, it may not be."
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2433.291,2434.791,Would it be rationally--
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.791,2435.51,--would it be rationally connected?
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2442.163,2443.819,--Yes.
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.817,2452.237,"Well, why isn't it rationally connected if the Legislature said, well, plastic's about to come, we're going to keep it from coming?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2452.237,2454.798,"Well, for two reasons in this case."
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.562,2463.153,"Well, then, you're back in my first question, then."
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2463.153,2463.607,--All right.
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2518.258,2530.659,"That may be so but if the statute had banned all nonreturnables, that certainly is rationally connected to an end, isn't it?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2530.659,2531.253,"Yes, it is."
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.253,2535.002,And they wouldn't have gone on using nonreturnables.
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2535.002,2535.86,That's right.
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.86,2538.217,They would have shifted to glass or something.
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2538.217,2538.858,Yes.
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.858,2543.138,"Well, then, why can't the Legislature say, half at a time?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2543.138,2552.181,Because the half that they are going to take out isn't going to accomplish the purpose of getting refillables.
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.181,2552.774,"It would be one step, though."
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2553.946,2562.381,"Not necessarily, when... 100 percent of the consumers would then go to the paperboard, as the evidence showed."
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.687,2583.247,"--So, if the Legislature had started with paper, you would suggest that everybody would have gone to plastic?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2583.247,2585.012,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1171,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.012,2599.225,"Mr. Keyes, isn't there some evidence in the record that with respect to gallon jugs, if you ban plastic, they will go back to glass instead of the paper, because the paper gallon container, as opposed to the quart or half-gallon, is pretty unsatisfactory?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2599.225,2605.535,"If there was, Mr. Justice Stevens, I don't recall it."
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.21,2653.502,"Well, what if the legislative findings had in so many words found that, if we ban plastic, there will be a substantial switch to returnables?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2653.502,2654.548,What if they had said that?
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.548,2662.452,"Yes, what if they had said that, and then... is a court then free to refind that, to make some contrary findings?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2662.452,2664.389,I certainly believe so.
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.764,2665.561,Do you have to take that position?
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2666.715,2667.215,--Yes.
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.058,2672.745,In what case is that?
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2672.745,2674.963,--I would say in the Hunt v.--
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.963,2677.478,In the Apple case?
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2677.478,2678.1,--The Apple case.
1980.79-1171,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.98,2709.527,"Well, what is the standard?"
1980.79-1171,2,34714,leonard_j_keyes,,2727.332,2740.701,"--Well, the standard as I understand it... and I think the standard our Supreme Court used... is there was no rational basis for the Legislature to have conceived that these means would bring about the end that they sought to bring about."
1980.79-1171,3,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,3663.694,3669.051,"Just a couple of further comments, Your Honor."
1980.79-1171,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3739.118,3742.989,Would that be a matter outside judicial notice?
1980.79-1171,3,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,3744.396,3746.082,"Pardon me, your Honor?"
1980.79-1171,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3746.082,3752.643,Is that a matter outside of judicial notice or... I suppose you'd say it is.
1980.79-1171,3,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,3752.643,3759.406,"Well, I don't... if you're asking me whether you can take judicial notice of the fact that there are numerous cases involving paper--"
1980.79-1171,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3759.406,3760.765,Does the fact that trees grow in Minnesota--
1980.79-1171,3,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,3760.765,3762.39,--I think that's judicially noticeable.
1980.79-1171,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3762.39,3770.23,"--Well, did the Supreme Court of Minnesota say they were judicially noticing this production and resource factor?"
1980.79-1171,3,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,3773.01,3778.912,With respect to discrimination... paper?
1980.79-1171,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3778.912,3788.582,"No, did they refer to the fact that... the source of these containers, whether they were made inside or outside the State?"
1980.79-1171,3,33949,kenneth_e_raschke_jr,,3788.582,3794.25,"The Act makes no distinction whatsoever with respect to where the containers, raw materials, or anything else came--"
