1973.72-1297,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.393,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1297, Donald Johnson against Robison."
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,41.736,49.416,The ultimate question on the merits as I indicated before is the same here and the same jurisdictional questions arise.
1973.72-1297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,406.516,411.399,"Doesn’t it also include some other people, public health people?"
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,411.399,413.538,It does.
1973.72-1297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,421.404,424.456,"But another, by another law by reference."
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,424.456,443.471,"Under the 1957 version of Title 38, active duty was defined in a way as to include active duty by commissioned officers of those two organizations within the terms active duty for veterans’ benefits purposes."
1973.72-1297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.134,561.063,"The -- it was always intended to extend these benefits to draftees, wasn’t it?"
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,566.961,568.32,That’s right.
1973.72-1297,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,571.62,594.025,And they are arguably by your brothers on the other side would still be made if the benefits have been limited to draftees as they say that there’s nothing in the -- no purpose of Congress to provide an incentive for enlistment or volunteering can be served when you just give these benefits to draftees?
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,594.025,594.811,"Well, that’s true."
1973.72-1297,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,986.943,1007.694,"Mr. Norton, I take it that Judge Geraghty rejected the disposition of the government's that there is a rational distinction between those who were subject to being assigned to hazardous combat duty and those who were not on the grounds that Congress had intended to rely on that distinction, that it probably could have, but I gather he said that wasn’t what Congress had in mind."
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1010.237,1014.899,We’re not saying it’s only a distinction between those subject to hazardous combat duty.
1973.72-1297,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1079.835,1088.796,You say it’s a question of what Congress might have reasonably considered not what the legislative history shows they did in fact consider?
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1088.796,1102.144,"Well, we say that the test that has been announced in this Court’s decisions is the former that could it rationally have been conceived -- is there a state of facts that might have been conceived to justify this distinction?"
1973.72-1297,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1206.875,1212.684,"When you complete your alternative service you don’t get any kind of piece of paper, don't you --?"
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1212.684,1217.995,"You get a piece of paper saying you have satisfied your, in your --"
1973.72-1297,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1217.995,1219.132,It’s not like a discharge?
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1219.132,1228.299,"No, it can only be either a completion or an incomplete if you haven’t completed it; they can order you to continue until you do."
1973.72-1297,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.299,1232.665,"What I mean, are you given something like a card or anything?"
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1232.665,1233.118,I think for some --
1973.72-1297,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1233.118,1235.066,I think it’s important in this case is just the matter.
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1235.066,1242.196,"Selective service, I think sends you a piece of paper that certifies that you have completed your alternative service."
1973.72-1297,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1359.688,1368.376,Are there any limits on how much a person may receive under alternative service employment?
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1368.376,1372.312,There were not in 1965 and 1966 when Congress was considering this Act.
1973.72-1297,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.405,1390.494,It’s not statutory?
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1390.494,1391.345,It’s not statutory.
1973.72-1297,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1394.765,1399.055,Of course a draftee gets free room and board?
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1399.055,1414.807,"Well, that’s true, but it’s free room and board where the military wants them to live which maybe at military base in the far reaches of the world and a place where he is unable to shape his life, so as to pursue his education."
1973.72-1297,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1414.807,1434.036,"Well because you made that argument already that this is one of the things that a draftee is subject to, if you treat that as a point, I don’t really see how can you separately treat the fact that all -- that it’s some kind of a detraction from the room and board that the same thing happens or if you are talking strictly in terms of compensation?"
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1434.036,1444.108,"Well, we don’t know whether on this record whether any of these alternative service people end up getting room and board."
1973.72-1297,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1470.598,1480.963,"Well, McGowan against Maryland went a great a deal beyond that so that if on any conceivable, on any conceivable basis it could be supported that would be enough?"
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1480.963,1482.036,"Well, that’s right and that was what I was adverting to earlier."
1973.72-1297,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1482.036,1486.895,"[Voice Overlap] the last term or the most recent term, I think."
1973.72-1297,0,25838,gerald_p_norton,,1486.895,1492.829,"I’d like to reserve the balance of my time, if any, for rebuttal."
1973.72-1297,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1492.829,1497.278,"There’s only one minute remaining counsel, I don’t think we’ll ask you to talk to one minute."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1521.204,1522.16,Thank you sir.
1973.72-1297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1561.524,1568.861,How many of them were killed or wounded in the line of duty during the period of 1965 to 1973?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1568.861,1574.66,"Your Honor, as far as we can tell, only one, but the statistics are not kept."
1973.72-1297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.61,1585.406,So there is that difference?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1585.406,1587.825,But they are treated in every other respect.
1973.72-1297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1587.825,1592.44,"Well, you said in all respects but one, I am suggesting that there maybe at least two."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1592.44,1599.266,"Well, Your Honor the -- it goes directly to the question of whether or not there is any potential for hazardous duty."
1973.72-1297,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.035,1627.811,They can -- they couldn’t be deployed to combat duty?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1627.811,1629.217,They couldn’t be deployed to combat duty but --
1973.72-1297,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.217,1636.217,"Well, that makes -- it makes quite a bit, but this doesn’t make a great deal difference to say they can be sent to Vietnam or out of the country."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1638.638,1644.148,"That’s -- well, that’s true Your Honor, but there are I-A-O’s in the service, conscientious objectors."
1973.72-1297,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.148,1645.308,"Alright, alright."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1648.506,1654.985,"They may not be sent into combat [Voice Overlap], Your Honor I haven’t forgotten it, it is obviously critical to this case."
1973.72-1297,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1654.985,1658.74,"How about the Code of Military Justice, are they subject to the jurisdiction [Voice overlap]?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1658.74,1669.268,"No, Your Honor, they are not, but as the Senate Report clearly indicates the facts that these men are under discipline doesn’t at all disturb their ability to become students."
1973.72-1297,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1673.075,1681.933,I don’t see of a connection between -- I’m speaking of the difference at the time they’re engaged in discharging their two-year period of service.
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1687.691,1693.495,"No, Your Honor, they are subject to felony -- federal felony criminal prosecutions for their violations."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1776.737,1779.494,It could be because all of them were subject to it?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1779.494,1780.967,"Yes, Your Honor, there is that potential."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1780.967,1783.543,The only difference is that they were all subject to it.
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1783.543,1784.591,"Yes Your Honor, the potential --"
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1784.591,1792.468,They’re all subject to be thrown into the front line wherever the government is and these men were not subject to that?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1792.468,1793.391,No.
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1805.839,1812.038,"There are people right now that are crossing the street, they’ve been crossing all their life, but this time they got hit?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1812.038,1815.426,"Your Honor, it is absolutely true that the potential is there."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1816.212,1819.447,Don’t you think that some difference to be reckoned with?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1819.447,1826.277,I think it’s a difference to be reckon with Your Honor only if the purpose of the Act took that kind of difference into a account but the --
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1826.277,1827.196,And they didn’t?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1827.196,1836.048,"No, Your Honor, specifically in the legislative history throughout the legislative history is the indication that these benefits are not a bonus."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1846.1,1849.894,"And the men -- and these men, that your man was disrupted how?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1853.099,1853.586,That’s right.
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1855.849,1858.73,[Voice overlap] for men in the military to go on school?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1858.73,1860.31,"Unquestionably, Your Honor."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.535,1871.629,With the Government permission?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1871.629,1871.903,No.
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.903,1872.671,He will need the Government.
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1872.671,1875.709,"No, Your Honor, it’s not all with the Government’s permission."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1875.709,1881.393,"Well, I don’t believe that that man in Vietnam is going to a Boston College."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1881.393,1887.465,"No, that’s right but the man stationed at a Boston Base is going to a Boston College at night has the same --"
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1887.465,1899.113,Do you have anything in the congressional history that said that there was any question that this applied to people who were not in the active military service?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1899.113,1901.965,That this did not apply to anyone in the active military service?
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1908.258,1909.988,"I am talking about this, --"

1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1911.89,1916.123,"Your Honor, not in this legislation."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1917.674,1919.728,"Well, is that man a veteran?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1919.728,1922.524,"Your Honor, he is a veteran of alternative service."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.062,1926.417,He’s a veteran?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1926.417,1928.151,In those terms.
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1931.136,1934.636,"In order to be a veteran, don’t you have to have him honorable discharge?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1934.636,1936.669,He has a release from his service.
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1960.936,1962.872,Is this action from mandamus?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1962.872,1968.219,"Your Honor, it was an action under the mandamus statute and under Section 1331 general."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1968.219,1973.721,Are you saying that [Inaudible]

1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1975.762,1979.579,I am not -- that has not been settled and of course the statute says --
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.579,1981.049,It doesn’t settle under mandamus?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1981.049,1984.894,"No, Your Honor because the statute says in the nature of mandamus it doesn’t say mandamus."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.894,1986.74,So in the nature between that right?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,1986.74,1989.183,"Well, Your Honor I think if the Constitution --"

1973.72-1297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2066.175,2071.801,The federal government isn’t inevitably their employers during this period of service?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2080.8,2082.223,"That’s exactly correct, Your Honor."
1973.72-1297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2101.794,2103.192,He might have Blue Cross?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2103.192,2111.401,"Well, if he could afford it, the fact is Your Honor, these men are paid on a ratio that gives them the standard of living that a GI has."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2111.912,2113.754,Is that true as to your case?

1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2229.213,2230.894,It applies to this man in the sense --

1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2238.366,2248.511,"Well, I want what’s in the record about one of the named plaintiffs to show to what extent his life was disrupted, that’s in this record?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2248.511,2258.715,"Your Honor, his life was disrupted to the extent that he was forced to go night school to complete one year of college on his own on whatever money he could scrape together."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2275.392,2276.562,Is that in the record?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2276.562,2277.819,"Yes, Your Honor as a matter of fact we stated --"
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2277.819,2284.065,"If the last statement is not in the record, that he was a disadvantage as anybody else in the service."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2284.065,2285.199,"Well, I can see that, Your Honor."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2285.636,2290.249,"Thank you, so the only disruption was he had to go to night school?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2290.249,2293.71,"The only Your Honor, that was a substantial disruption."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2294.494,2296.886,"What other disruption was there, in this record?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2296.886,2300.044,"As I say, when he left the service he had no money."
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2303.136,2304.952,Was that because of his disruption?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2304.952,2306.07,"Yes, Your Honor, that was because --"
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.07,2310.648,"Well, how was he disrupted other than the fact that he worked in the day and went to school at night?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2310.648,2316.911,He was disrupted because he received an $80 a week compensation for his work and wasn’t able to save a cent.
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2316.911,2319.182,"Well, how much was he making before that?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2319.182,2320.081,I believe --
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.081,2320.842,Was that in the record?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2320.842,2322.027,I believe he was in school.
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2322.85,2324.039,"So, he’s making nothing before?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2324.039,2327.39,I don’t know what he was doing precisely before he entered the service.
1973.72-1297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2327.39,2329.291,"So, that’s the only disruption"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2329.291,2345.634,"Your Honor, as we state in the complaint, this man when he entered law school faced the problem that he would not be able to continue his law school education because he had no savings that’s why he brought the suit, that’s why he applied for a veterans’ benefits."
1973.72-1297,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2380.442,2389.775,"At the time he went under this program Mr. Rosenberg, did he then have the option to go into non-combat military service?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2389.775,2414.58,"He had that option Your Honor and of course our claim here is that under Sherbert, the differential that the Government has established places a burden on the man and we don’t say that this man would’ve bowed under to that burden, but places a burden on that man to give up his religious scruples and serve in the military in a capacity that would gain him benefits."
1973.72-1297,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2415.497,2433.058,"Do you say that it was irrational, that it is irrational to reach a conclusion that a man in this category suffers less hardship, less disruption than those who go into the regular military service?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2433.058,2440.164,I would say Your Honor that in both services there are men who suffer great or lesser disruptions.
1973.72-1297,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.786,2510.832,"Mr. Rosenberg, were these benefits available to people in the service between roughly the time that the Korean War ended and the time that Vietnam War started?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2510.832,2515.104,"Absolutely, Your Honor because the Act applies retroactively."
1973.72-1297,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.404,2532.893,[Inaudible]
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2532.893,2537.8,That expired on the very day that the retroactive affect attached.
1973.72-1297,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.339,2552.342,"Well, but I don’t think that quite answers my question because I take it from what you say that although looking back, post 1966, we can say that everybody has been covered."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2563.959,2578.661,"That exactly correct Your Honor, but it is a fact that in 1966 the Act applied retroactively to everyone who served between 1955 that is the termination date of the Korean GI Bill in 1966."
1973.72-1297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2594.641,2610.305,"Mr. Rosenberg, may I ask you, do I actually read Judge Geraghty opinion is finally entering in effect with an interpretation of the statute that it is at least covering your clients?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2610.305,2612.673,"No, it is not an interpretation of the statute, Your Honor."
1973.72-1297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2613.036,2617.27,"Is it because Justice Harlan’s technique in Welsh, didn’t he?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2617.27,2649.77,"Yes, Your Honor and of course I think the format set down in the Frontiero case where the Court affirms that in a situation like this where a program can be nullified or extended, the extension will be granted if it would probably -- if it was likely that Congress would want to maintain the program even with this additional coverage and I can’t see Your Honor how Congress would refuse and deny millions of people benefits just because of few others would get benefits."
1973.72-1297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2649.77,2663.008,But I gather from what your argument earlier you think the statute on its face reflects a deliberate congressional purpose to exclude.
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2663.008,2664.854,"Yes, Your Honor, I do believe that."
1973.72-1297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2684.328,2697.107,"Well, now the extension that Justice Harlan suggested in Welsh rested on his feeling that the statute, we then had before as contravened the establishment cause."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2697.107,2698.532,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that’s true."
1973.72-1297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2698.532,2700.842,And what do you --
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2700.842,2701.218,I --
1973.72-1297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2701.218,2704.943,-- suggests that Judge Geraghty hinges his extension to you?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2704.943,2711.967,"On the Fifth Amendment that it violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, that these men have been arbitrarily excluded."
1973.72-1297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2730.497,2733.103,Constitutional ruling to what affect?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2733.103,2748.198,"A ruling that without a compelling state interest, without any compelling interest in this exclusion, this exclusion both denies that the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment and denies equal protection under the Fifth Amendment."
1973.72-1297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2748.198,2750.619,With what consequence for the statute is written?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2750.619,2764.703,The consequence would be Your Honor that the clause that excludes would be extended to cover or were not or read not to exclude these people who have done alternative service for 180 days.
1973.72-1297,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2908.596,2912.953,"Well, if you say they could’ve given less money to the conscientious objectors."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,2918.497,2923.718,"Your Honor, I was positing that on the Government’s positions that there was a difference."
1973.72-1297,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3013.148,3014.136,Mr. Rosenberg.
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3014.136,3016.796,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1297,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3016.796,3023.385,Personnel in the alternative service in organized units of any kind?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3023.385,3024.991,The I-O conscientious objector?
1973.72-1297,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3024.991,3025.925,Yes.
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3025.925,3027.074,"In some cases, Your Honor."
1973.72-1297,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3033.563,3035.472,But what about the appellee in this case?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3035.472,3036.945,"The appellee, no."
1973.72-1297,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3041.148,3043.657,"I know, to whom did he report?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3043.657,3051.381,He reported first to the director of the hospital I imagine and then to the State Director of Selective Service and finally to the President.
1973.72-1297,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3051.381,3056.61,How often did he report to the State director of this [Voice Overlap]
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3056.61,3058.181,"Your Honor, I am not aware."
1973.72-1297,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3075.647,3081.121,Does the record show how many times that President made any such decision during the period in question?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3081.121,3082.698,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-1297,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3149.498,3154.975,"Well, take the example of the National Labor Relations Act when it was first passed."
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3181.235,3195.267,"Your Honor as I understand the question it would seem to me that if Congress’ decisions were based on no facts whatsoever and purely arbitrary, then I believe a Court could enter that area, otherwise, I think not."
1973.72-1297,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.173,3210.341,It’s certainly different than some of our cases you have said about Equal Protection of any conceivable set of facts?
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3210.341,3223.043,"There is no question, Your Honor and I concede that, but none of those cases involved legislation that stated on the face of the legislation, they are for direct purposes to this education program we have just created and that’s what this legislation does."
1973.72-1297,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3223.043,3230.523,"Well, can you be there at sure that in a legislation we were dealing in the other case is they weren’t stated purposes, but that the Court just didn’t think they were important?"
1973.72-1297,1,36553,michael_david_rosenberg,,3230.523,3232.095,"Your Honor, I have canvassed many."
1973.72-1297,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3299.212,3301.213,Thank you Mr. Rosenberg.

1973.72-1297,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3472.977,3480.868,"But the claim is, as I understand that at least that it’s under inclusive and that was a basic claim wasn’t it, in Wells?"
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3480.868,3487.315,"Well, that is the claim, but I think it is wrong to characterize the statute as carving out an exclusion of any definable --"
1973.72-1297,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3487.315,3488.691,Under inclusive?
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3488.691,3489.745,Definable group.
1973.72-1297,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3489.745,3492.694,Would you think that’s an unfair way to characterize the argument?
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3492.694,3494.745,"Well, they say they should be cover is as well, that’s true."
1973.72-1297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3494.745,3497.84,"Well, let’s say -- they say it’s unconstitutionally under --"
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3497.84,3500.028,"Yes, that’s correct."
1973.72-1297,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.028,3501.89,[Inaudible]
1973.72-1297,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3501.89,3515.289,Suppose it’s under inclusive in the sense that doesn’t include Peace Corps Veterans in the broad sense but the question in this case is whether it is constitutionally under inclusive as Justice White suggests?
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3515.289,3540.316,"Well, that true and I have that in mind and I think we come back in that case to the -- your question that was raised whether it would be sufficient if there could be any distinction between these two categories and whether then it would be permissible to grant a different level of benefits to military veterans than to alternative service selection."
1973.72-1297,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3540.316,3548.395,"Mr. Norton, could the man who served in military service for a 179 days make the same argument?"
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3552.787,3559.3,He would have the same and he could argue that it is irrational to cut it off at 179 or 180 days.

1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3756.774,3767.707,For up to 36 months of education and that is since twice have been increased in the current base figure I believe is $220.
1973.72-1297,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3767.707,3768.717,For how long?
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3768.717,3770.821,"Again, 36 months of period."
1973.72-1297,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3784.126,3787.554,Is tuition over and above that or is that the total?
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3787.554,3788.634,That is the total.
1973.72-1297,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3788.634,3790.227,"So we are talking about $8,000 here --"
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3790.227,3791.253,Something in that order --
1973.72-1297,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3791.253,3799.475,"-- not 10, not and but you don’t -- in your brief at least you relegate this to the footnote?"
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3799.475,3806.691,"Well, I think that is because our principle reliance is on 211."
1973.72-1297,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3806.691,3811.571,What do you have to say about the asserted jurisdiction under 1361?
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3811.571,3815.425,"Well, we say that does not apply here either because we’re not seeking relief --"
1973.72-1297,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3815.425,3818.435,"Now, in the preview case they would’ve seek mandamus?"
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3818.435,3820.275,They did there but --
1973.72-1297,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3820.275,3825.535,"If in this case say, it’s simply added that in the prayer of their complaint, you find no difficulties under 1361?"
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3825.535,3830.359,"Well, the relief they’re seeking is not relief in the nature of mandamus, we don’t believe."
1973.72-1297,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3836.694,3847.497,"Of course, if you know there’s good deal in the legal leadership about a writ on nature but on a writ of mandamus, whether or not that means what mandamus we all learned in law school not just the ministerial act."
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3847.497,3855.422,"But on the face of the statute if they have clearly no legal right, they have to go beyond the statute to make their claim."
1973.72-1297,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3855.422,3870.831,Mr. Norton as I understand the law that's established by decision of this Court that the Declaratory Judgment Act does not confer on independent basis of jurisdiction on this Court if it’s not a present by some other jurisdictional grant.
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3881.741,3897.687,"I am not entirely sure, I think there may be some lower Court decisions about ways, but I think it is in construed by some courts as granting jurisdiction within its rather narrow limits if it is a case appropriate for that kind of relief."
1973.72-1297,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3897.687,3899.216,"And this is not within those limits, you say?"
1973.72-1297,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3899.216,3900.664,That is our position.
1973.72-1297,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3967.243,3968.143,Thank you Mr. Norton.
