1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,73.378,75.127,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.772,294.834,Now many square miles in the--
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,294.834,295.178,--Pardon me?
1985.84-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.178,296.958,--How many square miles in the city?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,296.958,298.427,"It's 15.3 square miles, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,298.427,301.097,And 520 acres would be somewhat less than a square mile.
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,301.097,301.597,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.795,325.071,Does the record show us whether the City considered the commercial suitability of the 520 acres that were set aside for adult theatre usage?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,325.071,340.737,"The City's real concern was with their being too close to the prohibited areas, and I think it's fair to say that the record does not reflect a concern as to precise--"
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.737,346.72,As to the suitability of the property that was available for that.
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,346.72,349.03,"--Except to this extent, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.896,383.237,"Is that part of any required consideration, do you think, to uphold the validity of a zoning regulation?"
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,383.237,385.548,"--Let me put it this way, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,418.66,425.297,"Well, is it relevant that the City at least consider it as part of the calculus, do you think--"
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,425.297,425.688,--It seems--
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.688,429.638,--so that deference could be given to it if has considered.
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,429.638,433.669,--It seems to me that what you look at is what results.
1985.84-1360,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,454.645,456.535,What was the situation here?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,464.906,466.406,"Uh, only part--"
1985.84-1360,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,466.406,468.296,Were there more than three sites available?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,468.296,469.514,"--Oh, yes."
1985.84-1360,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,492.069,494.082,"In other words, there were no theatres in that area."
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,494.082,494.66,Absolutely not.
1985.84-1360,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,495.784,501.314,And how far from that area were the two theatres that Playtime acquired?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,501.314,511.654,"Your Honor, if I can show this to you visually, if I may impose upon you to look at page 141a of the Appendix to the jurisdictional statement."
1985.84-1360,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,511.654,515.949,What page?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,515.949,517.713,141a.
1985.84-1360,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,579.251,590.685,"Mr. Prettyman, on your question about access, how do you put movie, drive-in movies, into that argument?"
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,590.685,591.512,I think you--
1985.84-1360,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,591.512,593.932,They have as much access as a drive-in movie.
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,593.932,604.632,"--Yes, well, I think clearly if drive-in movies were going to show adult films that this would be an excellent place for them to be, because this is extremely accessible."
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,707.012,727.097,"In that regard, Mr. Prettyman, the ordinance of this City was justified on the secondary effects that these theatres have on particular other land uses, like residence land or churches or schools."
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,735.204,742.872,"Well, I think the mast obvious example is the City of Seattle, where Seattle was... Seattle had 13 adult theatres."
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,768.784,777.218,And did Seattle's studies show the secondary effects of having an adult theatre in a residential neighborhood?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,777.218,778.28,"--Yes, ma'am, they did."
1985.84-1360,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.887,830.446,Detroit and Seattle were doing it two different ways; Detroit by dispersal and Seattle by concentration?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,830.446,832.929,"--Yes, that's exactly right."
1985.84-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.347,927.392,"Mr. Prettyman, can I interrupt you with something that's troubling me--"
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,927.392,927.533,Certainly.
1985.84-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.533,928.704,--about the case?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,935.936,939.684,"Oh, I don't think that, sir, that's there's any question that they held it in violation of the First Amendment."
1985.84-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.153,944.088,"They sent it back for allowing to shore up the record, in effect."
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,944.088,945.995,"--Well, that was rather strange."
1985.84-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.115,1000.159,"I understand your argument on the merits of the motive, but if that issue remains open, is it clear that they have already directed the district judge to hold the ordinance invalid?"
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1000.159,1004.845,"--Oh, I think that's quite clear, Your Honor, that they have said that it is, that it violates the First Amendment."
1985.84-1360,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.845,1006.469,And is there... I see.
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1006.469,1007.766,"Yes, absolutely."
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1050.248,1059.198,"Mr. Prettyman, do you think that the Court has to analyze this statute under the O'Brien factors?"
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1059.198,1063.493,"--Justice O'Connor, let me say this as to that."
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1106.711,1107.459,I am asking.
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1107.991,1108.162,All right.
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1184.038,1196.892,"If O'Brien factors were applied, one of them is a requirement that the governmental interests be unrelated to the suppression of free speech."
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1196.892,1197.298,Correct.
1985.84-1360,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1197.298,1199.406,And how would you apply that here?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1199.406,1208.23,I don't think that that means that you go back and interrogate the City Council members about what their intent is.
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.178,1280.718,"Well, it isn't, it can't be literally true that it's unrelated, because at least in order to avoid the secondary effects, you are forbidding, you are forbidding these constitutionally protected kinds of speech to... you're making them move."
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1280.718,1285.7,"It's unrelated to the suppression of speech and what the, what the--"
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1285.7,1290.277,It's only because they're a speech of a certain kind that you're making them move.
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1290.277,1291.963,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, but it's not because of that."
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.446,1299.944,"Well, the only reason the secondary effects will occur is because of the nature of the speech."
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1299.944,1301.632,"--Well, I'm not--"
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.632,1302.834,Isn't that right?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1302.834,1304.396,--It is related.
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.189,1313.424,All right--
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1313.424,1314.374,"--sense, it is related, but--"
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.374,1317.78,"--Yes, of course it is, but that shouldn't make any difference to your case."
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1317.78,1319.171,--It didn't make any difference in Young.
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.171,1320.263,That's right.
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1320.263,1320.685,It certainly didn't.
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1413.523,1416.632,"You said there were three questions, three issues in the case."
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1417.257,1419.396,"I hope I have, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.552,1421.521,--the other two?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1421.521,1425.128,--The first one related to whether we can rely on the examples of other cities.
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.128,1425.378,What are the other two?
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1425.378,1431.141,"The second related to the nature of the set-aside zone itself, and the third related to the motive of the City Council."
1985.84-1360,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.141,1431.751,"Okay, thank you."
1985.84-1360,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,1431.751,1432.235,Thank you.
1985.84-1360,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1432.235,1437.06,Mr. Burns?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1437.06,1441.528,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1360,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1488.95,1498.476,"Well, Mr. Burns, is it not more accurately the kind of people it attracts?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1498.476,1507.003,"Your Honor, there is no evidence in this record that this kind of speech attracts any other kind of people than the people that are in this courtroom."
1985.84-1360,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.061,1524.762,What you're saying is that we cannot take traditional notice of the contrary?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1524.762,1540.349,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that we have to look to what this Court said in Young, in that certain things are not, are not, we just can't assume that they exist as a matter of experience."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1603.81,1604.56,"Well, Mr. Burns--"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1604.56,1604.966,"Yes, sir?"
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.966,1622.537,"--Mr. Prettyman said that the City of Renton was entitled to rely on the City of Seattle's experience, and he said that a Seattle study had shown that adult theatres in residential areas produced, you know, transience, crime, that sort of thing."
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1630.252,1635.187,"Your Honor, I take exception to his description of what the experience of Seattle was."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1635.187,1643.731,"Well, first of all, do you contend that the City of Renton was not entitled to rely in drafting its ordinance on whatever experience the City of Seattle might have had?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1643.731,1655.976,"Your Honor, if the City of Renton is going to rely on Seattle's experience, it should target the same evils at which Seattle targeted its ordinance, and it should rely on the same means."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1657.429,1659.819,Why is that so?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1674.547,1680.232,"--Your Honor, I think it's risky to rely on the experience of other cities for a number of reasons."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.232,1685.073,"Well, it's sufficiently risky so that the Constitution forbids Renton from doing it?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1685.073,1710.782,"Absolutely, because what we do then, if you allow a city such as Renton to pick the City of Seattle or pick the City of Tacoma and say, they passed an ordinance, we are going to mimic it, we are going to rely on it, you have effective immunized and sanitized that ordinance from judicial scrutiny, even though the reasons may be painfully fabricated; even though the reasons that they assert may not apply in their city."
1985.84-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.827,1725.807,"Mr. Burns, if your opponent is right... I haven't read this, the Washington case, but he said that in the Seattle experience there was one theatre out in a residential neighborhood, and that that was a bone of contention, and that would be a comparable example, wouldn't it?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1725.807,1726.337,"--No, it wouldn't, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1732.257,1733.273,But they were separated from one another.
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1733.273,1733.929,--Pardon me?
1985.84-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.929,1740.41,"He indicated they were separated from one another, so you might have a residential neighborhood with one theatre in it, and they said you have to move that theatre."
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1740.41,1743.986,"That's true, but what they did in Seattle was different than what Renton did here."
1985.84-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.172,1754.076,"But just to the point of whether there is anything on which they could base concern about a single theatre, at least that would be some evidence, wouldn't it?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1754.076,1764.213,"--But, Your Honor, it may be some evidence, but I think we have to look to the issue that we have to solve these problems that deal with First Amendment concerns by the least intrusive means."
1985.84-1360,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.617,1772.663,"So, for that argument you basically ask us to re-examine Young, don't you?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1772.663,1777.114,"--No, I'm not asking you to re-examine Young, because I think that this case is--"
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.114,1777.411,But you did--
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1777.411,1778.286,--different than Young.
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.701,1795.825,--What are the confines of Young on the standard you resort to?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1795.825,1814.662,"Your Honor, the Young case, as I read it, is, as I read Justice Stevens' opinion, is that if there is a demonstrable adverse secondary effect that we can see and we can touch and we can feel, the City can be concerned about that and regulate it by the least intrusive means."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.517,1866.0,"Is that such an unlikely location for, say, a drive-in theatre?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1866.0,1870.904,"--It would, because a drive-in theatre probably would not be permitted in that zoning."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1875.105,1879.869,But I thought we took it as stipulated that an adult theatre was permissible.
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1886.007,1894.051,--It's in the record below that there would be a zoning change required in order to locate an adult theatre in this area.
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.487,1901.47,But you say it's an industrial wasteland.
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1906.218,1909.247,"No, Your Honor, but I think access has three components."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.836,1924.038,"Well, what do you mean by an available location?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1924.038,1940.299,"Your Honor, if the City is going to regulate and restrict where a theatre can locate, and in fact nobody will sell or rent property to a theatre, the restriction and burden on speech has become substantial, not incidental, because there is no place that they can go."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1940.299,1949.903,"Well, would that entitle a theatre to locate out of a commercial zone and in a residential zone because no one in a commercial zone would sell them theatre space?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1949.903,1950.339,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.339,1952.605,"Well, why wouldn't it under your reasoning?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1952.605,1974.066,"It wouldn't because if, if a general audience theatre were permitted to locate in a residential zone, then it's my position that an adult theatre should be allowed to locate there as well unless you can demonstrate that there's some adverse secondary effect that arises out of the operation of the adult theatre that does not arise out of the operation of the general release theatre."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.066,1977.767,"Well, how about the transience and crime from the Seattle study?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1977.767,1982.673,"Your Honor, the City of Renton didn't look at any data from Seattle."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.902,1997.197,"Well, did the City of... did the decision of your state supreme court summarize findings that had been made in Seattle?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,1997.197,1998.164,"Yes, it did."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.164,2003.271,"Well, why on Earth shouldn't they be able to look at the supreme court opinion as a secondary source?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2004.287,2011.191,"Your Honor, when we're looking at speech, I think that we need to have empirical evidence that's of a compelling nature."
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.331,2024.655,"Now, that's a nice sounding phrase, but how would you define empirical evidence that's of a compelling nature, as opposed to just garden variety evidence?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2024.655,2030.026,"--Your Honor, in a commercial zone, what is the problem that transients cost... cause?"
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.858,2067.372,Provide them with bus tickets?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2067.372,2067.715,--Pardon me?
1985.84-1360,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.715,2068.871,Provide them with bus tickets?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2070.434,2083.6,"That may be one answer to the problem, but I think that this Court's decision required that when we're dealing with First Amendment concerns, we have to deal with the problem in the least intrusive way."
1985.84-1360,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.293,2109.479,You said something that I'm not sure I understand.
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2133.094,2139.249,"Your Honor, there's nowhere in this record that I can find what their concerns were about these theatres."
1985.84-1360,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2139.249,2141.918,"Well, why do they have to... do they have to put their concerns in the record?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2143.262,2144.356,"I think so, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.356,2145.714,What they have against them?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2145.714,2151.039,I think what... they have to make findings of fact that justify the restriction on speech.
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.502,2294.638,"Could I, could I ask, suppose that in this record there was evidence of the likely effect of adult theatres being too close to residential districts."
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2314.208,2320.549,"--Well, Your Honor, to answer your direct question about residential areas, I think they could make such a showing."
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.283,2332.92,"And even though the only place these, even though the only place these theatres could then go is to this area that you say is wholly unsatisfactory?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2332.92,2335.528,"Well, that creates a more substantial--"
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.528,2336.544,"Well, that's my question."
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2336.544,2336.87,--Okay.
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.93,2351.163,And even though this area that the adult theatres would have to move to is as unsatisfactory as you say it is?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2351.163,2352.286,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.843,2367.577,"Well, that's what I'm asking."
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2375.59,2380.463,"--If there is adequate proof of potential harm, they can zone out."
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.837,2388.147,"Even though, even though other sites may not be available?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2388.147,2398.643,"--Well, I think, in my personal view, a city has the right to deal with these problems as they can any other kinds of land use problems."
1985.84-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2439.189,2446.826,"Well, now, is none of the property in the 520 acres zoned for commercial use?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2447.826,2450.857,"Generally, Your Honor, it's zoned for industrial use."
1985.84-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2450.857,2456.916,Is any of the property in the 520 acres zoned for commercial use?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2456.916,2457.729,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.729,2464.272,"Well, can a commercial property be located in an industrial area?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2464.272,2466.116,"Well, to that extent that it can, there are less--"
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.116,2466.614,"I mean, it's not forbidden."
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2467.661,2467.88,--No.
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.88,2473.721,"--though, so the answer is commercial establishments may be located in an industrial area."
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2473.721,2482.671,"They can; but, Your Honor, there's evidence in this record that a commercial establishment such as a theatre requires a certain kind of location that nobody disputed."
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.264,2491.23,But it would not be against the zoning law for this theatre to be in the industrial area.
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2491.23,2492.746,"--No, it would not be against the zoning law."
1985.84-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2492.746,2499.539,Does the record disclose that there is at least one shopping center in the 520 acres?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2499.539,2503.069,"Yes, Your Honor, that's a fully developed shopping... well, yes, it is."
1985.84-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2516.017,2519.25,141a?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2519.25,2520.312,"141a, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2531.901,2535.806,Up in the extreme right corner?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2535.806,2538.79,"Yes, Your Honor, if you can see where I'm pointing."
1985.84-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2546.568,2548.036,"Oh, I see."
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2549.973,2561.532,"--However, that location is not available in a practical sense, in that the location is very small in size."
1985.84-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2578.321,2581.117,But there would be other undeveloped land nearby--
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2581.117,2581.57,No.
1985.84-1360,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2581.57,2583.772,--that presumably could be available?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2583.772,2588.411,"Well, Your Honor, that little L-shaped area is the only area there that is available."
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2615.541,2618.429,What do you mean unavailable?
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2618.429,2620.866,"I mean unavailable in the sense that somebody will not sell it or rent it to you, Your Honor."
1985.84-1360,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.249,2655.446,"But, again, if there had been adequate proof or some grounds for believing, a decent grounds for believing there would be danger to residential areas, this unavailability would make no difference?"
1985.84-1360,1,29279,jack_r_burns,,2655.446,2660.678,"Not but in that area it wouldn't, but there is no proof that there's any danger--"
1985.84-1360,2,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,3139.97,3143.281,"Three brief points, Your Honor."
