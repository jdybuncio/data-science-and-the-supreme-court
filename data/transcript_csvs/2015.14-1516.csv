2015.14-1516,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.93,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-1516, Duncan v. Owens. Ms. Shapiro."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,7.93,27.665,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Seventh Circuit in this case violated AEDPA when it granted habeas relief to Respondent in the absence of precedent from this Court, clearly establishing that Respondent's allegations rise to the level of a constitutional violation."
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,27.665,41.315,"Let's assume the judge said, instead of what he said -- so make the assumption my way -- I don't know if the witnesses are telling the truth or not, but I believe he's guilty."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,54.71,65.685,"It would violate due process if the judge did not find the element, the -- the -- that the evidence provided by the State proved the elements beyond a reasonable doubt."
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,80.28,81.71,"Well, this isn't speculation."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,101.235,111.685,"The State's evidence did establish that Larry Owens wanted to knock him off, because the State's evidence established that Larry Owens approached him and hit him over the head with a baseball bat several times."
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,111.685,112.48,"Sorry, Ms. Shapiro."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,162.0,173.275,"Well, I think it would first depend somewhat on if -- on habeas review on how the State appellate court or supreme court interpreted the record and interpreted what the judge had said."
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,210.74,210.94,Yes.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,263.94,269.24,If the -- if the judge found that the elements had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,269.24,277.41,"Well, the judge is just saying it's not -- you know, this is not enough, and it's necessary for me to think about motive as the missing piece."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,277.41,285.07,That does not necessarily violate due process because -- or it's -- it's certainly not clearly established that that would necessarily violate due process.
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,298.73,299.44,"Oh, I see."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,311.7,316.8,"If the judge said that he found the evidence insufficient, that would --"
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,316.8,316.98,Yes.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,323.825,330.14,"Again, it would depend on how the -- the -- the State court, State appellate courts interpreted the record."
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,350.685,351.41,Okay.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,396.085,409.19,"It -- it -- yes, I -- but it has to be quite clear that that's what's happening, both because we have a presumption that judges know and follow the law and especially on habeas review that presumption applies with special force."
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,420.53,421.34,Okay.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,487.549,505.68,"So, first, if that were what the judge said, that interpretation, it's not clearly established that -- that that would violate due process, for the reasons I've already said, that a finder of fact can develop a theory of the case to tie it together that is consistent with the evidence."
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,505.68,506.1,But that --
2015.14-1516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,506.1,523.75,"But I thought it was clearly established -- I thought you agreed -- page 14, I think, of your reply brief -- that it is clearly established that it would be a violation of -- of Taylor and -- and Turner if the factfinder bases its verdict on evidence not in the record."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,523.75,539.69,"On -- when we -- and when we discussed that in our reply brief, we talked about the possibility that a judge would say, I -- I -- I don't -- the evidence isn't sufficient so -- but I know that this defendant's brother committed a similar crime, and for that reason only I'm finding him guilty."
2015.14-1516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,539.69,548.345,"Well, but to begin with, we have a -- a general statement: The evidence must be based -- pardon me -- the verdict must be based on the evidence in the record."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,548.91,549.465,Correct.
2015.14-1516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,549.465,549.79,All right.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,550.68,551.36,Yes.
2015.14-1516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,551.36,556.52,Then I don't see how -- I don't understand your answer to Justice Kagan.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,556.52,581.24,"The -- the precedent can be read -- that -- that language can be read at a very high level of generality, which is not appropriate for AEDPA review. Under due process -- and it's especially important when we're talking about due process-claims that this Court respect AEDPA's requirement that the clearly established law have a certain level of specificity."
2015.14-1516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,592.19,602.24,"But here, the issue is, was the defendant convicted on the basis of information that wasn't in the record."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,610.69,611.19,Certainly.
2015.14-1516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.19,615.55,-- cannot be based on evidence that the judge heard at the local bar --
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,615.55,615.95,Certainly.
2015.14-1516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,615.95,616.62,-- for example.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,616.62,630.02,"Yes. But in -- and in this case, it's important to note that the Illinois Appellate Court reviewed the record, and the Illinois Appellate Court concluded that in fact, the judge's speculation about motive was not a material factor in the verdict."
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,634.16,640.15,"I'm not sure -- you know, the problem is that you're making an allegation I'm not sure about."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,646.11,652.14,"They -- they said that they thought that Evans -- that there was -- Evans' testimony had its problems, yes."
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,652.14,652.77,All right.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,667.33,669.23,From a distance of about 8 feet.
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,669.23,669.775,Right.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,685.405,698.645,"Several -- several answers to that question. First, Mr. Johnnie's testimony, which the appellate court discussed at some length and which the appellate court concluded was reliable, was essentially unimpeached."
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,706.07,709.675,"Well, except that evidence failed to identify him in court."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,709.675,710.0,No.
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,720.87,723.69,It's pretty easy to -- to identify a defendant in court.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,755.265,755.92,Certainly.
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,775.77,775.83,No.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,785.235,799.6,"It is not clearly established that that theory, in this -- in this situation would -- would violate due process where it is consistent with the evidence, is not contradicted by the evidence, and where the elements are sufficient."
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,799.6,801.0,This is quite interesting.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,811.29,812.11,He did not.
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,812.11,813.245,He did not.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,816.165,816.57,The --
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,816.57,818.39,And that's not extraneous evidence.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,818.39,826.85,It's not evidence at all. Fact finders are allowed to rely on their experience and common sense when they -- when they evaluate the evidence.
2015.14-1516,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,863.14,864.06,That's a new theory.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,876.96,877.28,No.
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,906.945,910.96,"Well, I guess I -- this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, I guess."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,949.66,966.655,"I'm saying several things. First, it's not clearly established that a factfinder can't -- can't tie together the case to his satisfaction by review -- by coming up with a theory that's consistent with the evidence. But in addition --"
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,966.655,972.8,It's not just -- it's -- it's not just like so I feel good about the case when I go home at night.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1019.845,1026.77,The -- that interpretation of what the judge said and did was rejected by the Illinois Appellate Court.
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1026.77,1029.275,I agree with you that there's a question of interpretation.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1053.63,1054.635,Correct.
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1054.635,1055.825,Okay.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1061.545,1062.635,"Well, there --"
2015.14-1516,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1062.635,1071.82,"Let me give you a hypothesis of what he may have been saying, because I think this may be a little bit too hard on the judge. This was an unusual prosecution."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1168.0,1171.03,I think that's an extremely fair interpretation of what the judge was saying.
2015.14-1516,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1181.96,1182.58,"Well, no."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1257.52,1265.5,The -- this Court has to give deference to the Illinois Appellate Court's conclusion that defendant's due process rights were not violated.
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1265.5,1266.71,But they didn't conclude that.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1308.79,1310.065,I disagree.
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1394.625,1396.535,"Well, on harmlessness grounds."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1396.535,1401.68,It is not clear that this -- the -- perhaps on harmlessness grounds.
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1416.72,1418.62,Whose adjudication on the merits?
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1418.62,1420.135,The Illinois Appellate Court's.
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1420.135,1431.725,"We might be going in circles, but I thought you just said if -- even if we -- we view this opinion as not reaching a determination on the merits."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1431.725,1444.87,"You could view this opinion as deciding the question of whether his due process rights were violated, deciding that question based solely on harmless error, although I said, that -- that is not -- we don't believe that's the best reading of the --"
2015.14-1516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.87,1446.38,Isn't that a merits determination?
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1446.38,1447.015,Yes.
2015.14-1516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.28,1449.47,I always thought harmless -- harmlessness --
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1449.47,1451.1,"Harmlessness, you get deference on."
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1471.28,1487.21,"The -- the -- ultimately, the question that the Court has to answer under 2254(d) is whether the State's adjudication results in a decision that is in violation of an unreasonable application of clearly established law of this Court."
2015.14-1516,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1503.17,1503.47,Okay.
2015.14-1516,0,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,1537.25,1543.915,"Yes, and for that reason, we believe the best reading of the -- of the opinion is that they did not find constitutional error."
2015.14-1516,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.275,1561.295,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Levenstam."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1561.295,1583.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Illinois Appellate Court unanimously found that there was no evidence that Mr. Owens knew Mr. Nelson was dealing drugs, or that he was himself involved with gangs or with the illegal drug trade."
2015.14-1516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.495,1647.055,"Doesn't -- doesn't the case really -- much of the case hinge on what -- what you mean by error? If you mean by error simply introducing into your decision matters that were not in the record that had no support in the evidence, if that's what you mean by error, it's one thing."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1665.335,1666.17,I agree.
2015.14-1516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.76,1703.92,But what about the presumption that the judge knows and applies the law? And I don't think there's a rational judge who would think it proper to base a conviction on conjecture that has no evidentiary basis.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1718.73,1724.04,"Well, there are two presumptions at -- at -- at work, in a sense."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.97,1809.38,I think we've gotten pretty far afield from the issue here. Which case of ours clearly established that it's due process-error when a judge speculates about an issue that is not pertinent to guilt and there's sufficient evidence of guilt on all the elements? Which case of ours says that?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1809.38,1811.97,"There is no case that says that, Your Honor."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1825.78,1829.76,"I just want to -- I mean, under AEDPA, isn't it critical that there be a case --"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1829.76,1831.12,"Yes, that Turner --"
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1831.12,1838.77,"-- as opposed to what you're saying is the case is: Well, you know, we have cases that say you can't be guilty if there wasn't evidence of guilt."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1838.77,1839.17,Right.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1839.17,1842.17,But that -- that's a -- our cases clearly make sure --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1842.17,1842.72,Turner --
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1842.72,1844.73,-- that that's too high a level of generality.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1844.73,1845.27,"Well, no."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1852.16,1859.78,"Taylor -- Taylor says the problem is the judge said you can infer from the fact that the person has been arrested and indicted, right? Is that -- that's Taylor?"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1859.78,1862.93,"There was some -- there was a bad instruction there, yes."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1862.93,1863.24,Okay.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1873.13,1873.56,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1875.445,1876.41,"Well, I know."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1883.225,1894.66,"Well, I -- I think if it exists in those cases, interweave and cite themselves, cases like Shepherd v. Maxwell, and Irving --"
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1894.66,1894.75,Yeah.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1906.86,1907.04,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1907.04,1907.99,Nothing like that is here.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1914.25,1914.57,Right.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1914.57,1916.57,-- blanketed. Nothing like that happens here.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1916.57,1938.57,"Each of those cases applied a -- what I would call a prophylactic application of due process to avoid a jury coming to a conclusion based on outside-the-record facts or assumptions. Here, what we have is a trial court judge who has told us, on the record, that that's exactly what he's done."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1939.5,1941.29,That's -- what is exactly what he's done?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,1941.29,1951.675,"That he -- he's told us he has based his finding on motive, based it on the knowledge -- which is not -- which is not supported in the record."
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.675,1954.315,But that's not what the State says.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2010.305,2011.49,Yes --
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.49,2014.77,"I mean, there we are, the Seventh Circuit thought, yeah."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2015.42,2015.56,Well --
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.56,2016.62,They're clearly wrong.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2022.05,2022.47,Well --
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.47,2023.69,Have -- have I got the issue?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2023.69,2026.92,"Well, perhaps that's one way of looking at it, yes."
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.4,2029.01,That seems to be the way that your -- your --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2029.01,2029.14,If --
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.14,2030.08,-- opponents are looking and it.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2030.08,2071.59,"If the court reporter had put a comma there, I think what he's -- what -- everything from ""skirted the real issue."" Because what he then does is define the real issue: What he has to -- what is going to bring him over the line to be beyond a reasonable doubt. And the issue to me is -- and it goes all the way on from there to the end, and ""that fact,"" the issue to him is the ""that fact."" I don't think -- I don't think you can get to -- precisely because Illinois law, which I think he was following his error was of fact -- says you need to establish knowledge to create motive."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2071.59,2082.66,"What if the -- what if the record said -- the judge says, okay, I -- you know, the -- the State has satisfied all of the elements required for murder in -- in Illinois."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2094.05,2094.45,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2094.45,2094.84,Okay.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2094.84,2095.13,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2095.13,2105.71,"Now, why don't we accept the presumption that the judges are presumed to know the law and are following it, and interpret that in light of -- in light of that record?"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2105.71,2106.3,"Well, but --"
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2106.3,2110.035,"Because you don't challenge that there's sufficient evidence of guilt, do you?"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2110.035,2112.74,"The -- no, that's not our issue."

2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2195.57,2195.86,But it --
2015.14-1516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.86,2196.43,-- doesn't say --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2196.43,2196.56,-- it --
2015.14-1516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.56,2199.975,He doesn't say that it's necessary to his decision.

2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.88,2221.205,"Yeah, but you're assuming what their argument is."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2224.08,2224.61,"Well, we --"
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.61,2228.1,We can get something further. Were you the trial judge -- trial lawyer?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2228.1,2228.66,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.66,2230.65,But you've read the record pretty well?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2230.65,2231.12,"Oh, yes."
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.12,2235.555,"So now, I think all of the witnesses skirted the real issue."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2237.2,2237.595,Well --
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.595,2239.685,They skirt what they didn't talk about.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2239.685,2239.95,But --
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.95,2241.92,So what was the rest of the trial about?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2241.92,2242.09,"Well, no --"
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2242.09,2243.23,What was the issue in the trial?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2243.23,2246.92,"The -- the trial is an extremely short one, and I recommend it to Your Honor. It's --"
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.92,2247.45,And what is it about?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2247.45,2251.6,-- about a hundred pages. It's about this event that happened outside --
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2251.6,2251.74,No.
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.15,2276.53,"So something else has to be; therefore, motive."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2277.855,2278.69,No.
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2278.69,2279.27,What happened?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2279.27,2287.18,"I believe what happened is the judge did not believe these people's story; that he -- I'm speculating now, too."
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.405,2294.95,No.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2307.58,2307.81,"Well, they --"
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.81,2309.45,-- the rest of the trial.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2309.45,2314.85,"They talked about what they saw, and they talked about their identifications."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2323.985,2324.5,So wait.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2327.15,2327.63,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2327.63,2332.54,And you're saying what the judge said is I don't think Larry Owens was the guy? I don't --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2332.54,2333.22,"No, no, no, no."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2333.22,2333.595,-- think --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2333.595,2338.77,I don't think they're telling the truth here about what really happened out there that night.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2338.77,2344.47,So he's saying you think he determined that they had not really identified the perpetrator.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2351.29,2354.71,I -- I can't speak beyond the words --
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2354.71,2356.04,"No, but it's very important --"
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2356.04,2359.04,"-- as we try to read this statement, and I'm -- I think it's --"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2359.04,2359.57,But --
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2359.57,2369.97,"-- if you think the judge did not think this was the guy but the guy who happened to be there was a drug dealer and so he sentenced him on first degree murder, I -- that's a pretty incredible submission."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2369.97,2371.005,"No, that's not what I'm saying."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2371.005,2371.34,"Well, what are you --"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2371.34,2379.01,"Because the guy that was there was not -- had -- there was no basis for him -- for anyone thinking he was a drug dealer, and that's the point. I -- I think that --"
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.01,2386.095,"Well, I thought -- I thought you said that the real issue was that the judge did not think that the witnesses were credible."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2386.095,2387.85,The -- I'm sorry.
2015.14-1516,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2458.965,2459.33,When --
2015.14-1516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.33,2464.66,"That's what you say, but what I want to put -- there's -- I'm trying to get the other side, so you have to answer that squarely."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2515.19,2531.65,"And my answer to that is that is speculation upon speculation upon speculation, and it's not a basis for putting somebody behind bars for 25 years. And the harmless error -- they bear the risk on harmless error."
2015.14-1516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2540.7,2543.42,"No, you -- you -- you have to establish that it's error --"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2543.42,2543.68,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.68,2546.23,-- before they have to establish that it's harmless.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2546.23,2546.8,"Well, the only --"
2015.14-1516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.8,2550.135,But -- and what Justice Breyer was saying is it wasn't error.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2563.14,2571.44,"Well, whereupon I point back to the Illinois Appellate Court conclusion that this was error, three-to-zip error, two-to-one --"
2015.14-1516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.44,2576.2,"Well, again, that -- that -- that depends on what you mean by error."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2592.12,2600.01,"Well, and that's what I think they thought he did, and I think they decided that was error, and then they turned and did a harmless-error analysis."
2015.14-1516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2645.03,2646.25,But that's not what -- what happened.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2649.2,2649.81,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2650.565,2650.75,Okay.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2653.84,2658.6,It's -- it's stayed pending this Court's determination.
2015.14-1516,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2658.6,2663.425,"There's a new trial that was necessitated by the judge's death, correct?"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2663.425,2664.1,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2664.1,2665.305,The judge who passed --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2665.305,2666.195,The -- yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2666.38,2667.6,-- who made the findings?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2667.6,2668.02,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2673.735,2674.06,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2674.06,2675.01,Is that --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2675.01,2675.22,In the --
2015.14-1516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2675.22,2677.975,Is that who made this statement? The trial judge?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2677.975,2678.6,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2678.6,2688.16,"The one statement that the judge made that you claim is utterly unsupported by the evidence, I gather, is the statement: ""Larry Owens knew he was a drug dealer."""
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2688.16,2688.335,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2688.335,2689.555,That's the -- that's the only one?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2689.555,2690.015,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2690.015,2696.735,"Now, there -- could -- there's some evidence from which one might infer that. It might be insufficient."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2719.25,2721.67,That -- that would be a reasonable inference.
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2721.67,2737.07,"And the -- and the -- the defendant walked up to -- there's evidence that the defendant walked up to this kid standing in front of the -- of the bar selling drugs, and spoke to him for some period of time, right?"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2737.07,2740.17,"Well, that would be Mr. Evans, not Mr. Johnnie."
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2740.83,2747.25,"Yes, but there's evidence of that, if -- if you believe that, that that took -- that took place, right?"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2747.25,2749.33,There is Mr. Evans' testimony.
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2749.33,2763.95,"There's evidence of that.

2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2763.95,2764.73,On -- yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2798.705,2819.16,"Now, the question on -- on the merits of -- putting aside the issues of -- of AEDPA and harmless error, when would it -- when does it violate due process for a judge in a bench trial to make a finding on a fact that is not needed for conviction? And what case of ours --"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2819.16,2819.32,Well --
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2819.32,2821.364,-- sets out the standard for that?

2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2826.63,2826.92,What is the --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2826.92,2827.46,But here --
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2827.46,2828.42,What is the standard?
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2828.42,2844.43,"The -- well, the standard is the due process standard in Turner and Taylor and the other cases that the Seventh Circuit cited and that we've cited. But that the fact is that the motive was a part of the identification analysis."
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2844.43,2862.02,"Well, I'm trying to figure out what the standard is, if you could put it in words. Suppose that the -- the trial judge had made a finding, like the -- the court of appeals appears to, about the -- the -- the time of nautical twilight, and suppose the trial judge was wrong on that."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2884.135,2888.225,"Well, I think at that point you -- you would do a harmless-error analysis."

2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2901.86,2902.21,Well --
2015.14-1516,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2902.21,2908.975,You're saying that there is a superfluous finding of fact that actually went into the judge's --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2908.975,2909.58,"Well, yes."
2015.14-1516,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2909.58,2910.395,-- final determination.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2910.395,2910.67,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2910.76,2913.395,It was not just any old superfluous finding of fact.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2913.395,2913.67,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2913.67,2915.02,It was not superfluous.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2924.6,2940.25,"And -- and I apologize if I haven't said that already, but that is certainly our point, is that -- that the judge framed the issue, laid out the issue, found the fact that was directly in front of the finding of conviction --"
2015.14-1516,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2940.25,2940.35,And --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2940.35,2945.26,-- and it was the only fact specified by the judge in reaching that conclusion.
2015.14-1516,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2945.26,2945.67,-- in Taylor --
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2945.67,2978.65,"It depends -- when you're reading this -- in reading what the judge said, it depends on -- the reasonableness of what the judge said may depend on whether you think that the judge inferred that Larry Owens killed the victim because he knew he was a drug dealer, or whether the judge was -- in attempting to fill in the blanks of this case, inferred that he knew he was a drug dealer from the fact that there was proof that he killed him."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2978.65,2979.4,But there --
2015.14-1516,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2979.4,2996.28,"So if you know that the victim is a drug dealer and the defendant talked to the victim, and then the defendant proceeded to beat his brains out with a baseball bat, you could probably infer from that the reason why he did it was that he knew he was a drug dealer, could you not?"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,2996.28,3000.315,"The reason why whoever did it did it because -- yes, I think that's right."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3014.875,3018.92,But I -- I'm sorry. You said the problem is with the evidence that linked him to the --
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3018.92,3020.26,"Mr. Owens, right."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3020.26,3022.85,But you're not challenging the sufficiency of that evidence.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3022.85,3025.36,I'm challenging the credibility of that evidence.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3030.37,3034.44,"Well, but credibility was the key issue in the trial, right?"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3034.44,3034.96,Yes.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3080.6,3093.415,"But that -- seems to me like you're challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, and I -- again, as I -- as the case comes before us, we assume there is sufficient evidence to convict under every element of the crime."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3093.415,3113.755,"I'm -- I'm challenging the sufficiency of the Illinois Appellate Court's harmless-error analysis, upholding the conviction in light of the fact that it concluded that there were no credibility determinations that it could rely upon made below."
2015.14-1516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.76,3137.15,That doesn't make any sense.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3162.29,3163.01,Your Honor --
2015.14-1516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3163.01,3165.08,-- of one or both of -- of the witnesses.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3165.08,3217.61,"I don't -- I'm telling you -- I'm reading you the Illinois Appellate Court opinion, and I'm telling you I agree with you when it doesn't make any sense, comes out time and again, because it doesn't make any sense, because this was a terribly botched job. And even under the deferential standards of Brecht and Kotteakos, the trial court got it -- based it on evidence that wasn't in the record, and the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed based on legally inadequate, harmless-error analysis, constitutionally inadequate and objectively unreasonable. They applied -- instead of applying harmless-error law, they applied this Neil v. Biggers. It's a reliability analysis for whether something gets admitted into evidence."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3245.54,3247.645,"I'm sorry, counsel. Maybe I'm just repeating myself."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3250.89,3253.93,"But Your Honor, it is not a direct sufficiency."
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3271.96,3284.385,"Yes, you're saying we're not challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. We are challenging the Illinois court's determination that it was harmless error that there was not sufficient evidence."
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3284.385,3287.44,The mode of analysis was wrong.
2015.14-1516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3299.99,3304.325,I thought you -- you're conceding that there was sufficient evidence.
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3327.29,3329.38,"Yes, substantial and injurious."
2015.14-1516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3329.38,3336.88,"So indeed, there was sufficient evidence, yes, but the finding of the conviction rested on an error that had --"
2015.14-1516,1,17831,barry_levenstam,,3336.88,3337.615,Absolutely.
2015.14-1516,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3348.21,3352.935,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Shapiro, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-1516,2,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,3352.935,3388.45,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I -- I'd like to start by talking briefly about the harmless-error analysis that the Illinois Appellate Court undertook. Even assuming -- which we do not concede -- that they found constitutional error and then went ahead and did a harmless-error analysis, at best, the Respondent here can argue -- is trying to argue that it -- that it engaged in an unreasonable application of Chapman, that's only one thing that Respondent here would have to establish to overcome -- to -- to establish that the error was not harmless."
2015.14-1516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3413.95,3427.1,"Could you explain how they were able to make that finding that the motive that the judge specified based on evidence that's not in the record, that that didn't have an influence?"
2015.14-1516,2,62643,carolyn_e_shapiro,,3427.1,3427.745,Certainly.
2015.14-1516,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3527.14,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
