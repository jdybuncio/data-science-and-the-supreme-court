1985.84-5872,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.044,We will hear arguments next in Daniels against Williams.
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,13.151,15.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-5872,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,46.623,50.45,"So, it is a negligence case, is it?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,50.45,56.228,"Mr. Chief Justice, it sounds like a negligence case and both parties have treated it as such."
1985.84-5872,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,92.416,94.962,"So, you think you are talking just about prisons?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,94.962,97.212,"Justice White, yes."
1985.84-5872,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,97.212,97.946,All right.
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,97.946,122.373,"Not only yes, but a very important part of our argument will be that the reason why we urge that there was a duty upon the state to provide some kind of compensation for a prisoner who can prove that he was, in fact, injured while in custody is that is part of the due process of law the person is entitled to when he is incarcerated as a person may be under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments."
1985.84-5872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,227.237,244.714,"Mr. Saltzburg, can you explain why you think the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment were concerned with possible state law negligence actions by state officers?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,244.714,245.994,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-5872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.17,302.894,"Well, failing to act consciously by reference to the word ""deprive"", don't we have to look at that word in the clause and inquire whether the ordinary meaning of the word ""deprive"" means an intentional rather than a unintentional kind of an act or discrimination?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,302.894,307.89,"--Justice O'Connor, there are two answers that I would like to give you to that."
1985.84-5872,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,324.868,325.572,By a negligent act?
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,325.572,326.947,By a negligent act.
1985.84-5872,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,326.947,330.976,"But, property, not liberty?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,330.976,333.771,"Yes, Justice Blackmun, that was a property case."
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.682,633.43,"Well, that was in the days of Swift against Tyson, wasn't it?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,638.944,641.489,"No, Justice Rehnquist, you are correct."
1985.84-5872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.395,685.487,"Mr. Saltzburg, can I ask this question that your argument prompts?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,706.214,708.73,--Our position would be that the guest would not.
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.964,762.081,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Saltzburg, that the Fourteenth Amendment... the Due Process of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes more stringent restrictions upon states than the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does on the federal government?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,762.081,763.378,"--No, Justice Rehnquist, I am not."
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,763.378,770.687,"Well, then, are you relying on anything other than the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment here?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,770.687,775.139,Due Process Clause plus the Civil Rights statutes which were enacted.
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.139,779.574,"Now, let's break that down a minute."
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,783.871,784.636,Yes.
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,784.636,792.273,"And, that the reason that you are suing is because 1983 gives you a right to recover for a violation of your constitutional rights."
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,798.598,799.176,Yes.
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,799.176,804.69,"Well, why did the 1866 and 1871 statutes have anything to do with it?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,804.69,816.794,"Well, without those statutes and without a decision like Bivens versus United States, it wouldn't have been clear that a person could have sued in federal court even if his rights had been violated."
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.009,829.102,"But, all that does is get you into court, as I would say, to assert your constitutional claim."
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,832.74,834.178,"We don't quarrel with that, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.943,843.111,"Well, all the talk about Congress knew that keepers of prisoners had duties, how does that fit into your argument?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,843.111,853.544,"It does tie in, I hope, with the citation of South versus Maryland, which this Court said as a matter of... may have been federal common law."
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.534,888.406,"Well, would the same liability be here on a Bevins claim against a federal prison warden in the same situation here?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,888.406,890.155,"Yes, in the same situation--"
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.155,894.652,"But, South against Maryland wasn't speaking of federal officials, was it?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,894.652,895.137,--No.
1985.84-5872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.114,956.83,May I interrupt again?
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,981.587,991.943,"Justice Stevens, it is probably the case that the prisoner was protected in the early 1800's under Virginia law and no one else was."
1985.84-5872,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1065.147,1082.671,"Mr. Saltzburg, before you go on, when you talk about a meaningful remedy, are you talking about the right to recover or the right to have access to the state court to present your case and take what defenses may be advanced as they come along?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1092.557,1105.317,"--Justice Powell, our position is as follows: That if... The state may have many defenses which do not... are not inconsistent with the notion of a meaningful remedy."
1985.84-5872,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1105.317,1108.27,Such as contributory negligence.
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1108.27,1112.346,"Which we concede, contributory negligence being one, the statute of limitations being another."
1985.84-5872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1178.818,1204.089,"Mr. Saltzburg, you have probably already answered this adequately, but let me ask anyway whether, as far as you are concerned, it is clear that in Virginia the state law is such that a state officer sued in his individual capacity has an absolute defense based on sovereign immunity."
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1205.666,1209.477,"Justice O'Connor, you put it slightly more strongly than I would."
1985.84-5872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1238.107,1242.105,When sued in their individual capacities?
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1242.105,1242.292,--Yes.
1985.84-5872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1283.072,1290.414,"But, shouldn't the word ""deprivation"" have the same meaning regardless of the context in which the suit arises?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1290.414,1313.452,"Justice O'Connor, the only answer I can make to that is if you accept, and you may not, but if you... If I can persuade you to accept the argument that part of due process when someone is incarcerated... Here is where the state does act intentionally, when it willfully, intentionally, and knowingly says we are going to take away your freedom and your ability to protect yourself."
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.556,1328.179,Would you say that is an intentional deprivation?
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1328.179,1340.769,"Justice Rehnquist, I argue especially in our reply brief... I believe that the line between negligence and intention is far more looser than Respondent in this case and in the case to follow would have the Court believe."
1985.84-5872,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1356.122,1362.494,If your client had been in a federal prison what would be the situation with exactly the same facts?
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1362.494,1367.337,"It is my understanding, Mr. Chief Justice, he would sue under the Federal Tort Claims Act where he would have a claim."
1985.84-5872,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1369.164,1371.6,I didn't get what you said.
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1373.366,1374.974,--Under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
1985.84-5872,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1374.974,1377.597,What about the governmental function and discretionary--
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1377.597,1392.138,"It is inconceivable that anyone would argue, I think, under the Federal Tort Claims Act that the person who leaves a pillow on the stairs is exercising a discretionary, a judgmental function."
1985.84-5872,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1392.138,1395.809,"--The function of a prison is a discretionary function, isn't it, a governmental function?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1395.809,1397.917,Certain aspects surely are.
1985.84-5872,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1412.554,1418.598,"In short, would you or would you not have a remedy if you were in federal prison?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1418.598,1422.815,I believe that we would under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
1985.84-5872,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1424.549,1430.326,"That would be contrary to quite a few holdings of this Court, wouldn't it, on discretionary function?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1430.326,1431.325,--I hope not.
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.348,1461.924,"Mr. Saltzburg, a moment ago in answering the Chief Justice's question you said you don't ask to have the federal sovereign immunity declared invalid."
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1473.512,1476.745,"That is exactly right, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-5872,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.611,1504.467,Does it have a repealer clause in case Parratt is overruled?
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1504.467,1505.655,"--No, sir, it does not."
1985.84-5872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.655,1513.386,May I ask you if you would characterize your due process claim in this case as a procedural due process claim or a substantive due process claim?
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1513.386,1530.927,"I think the proper characterization of it, Justice Stevens... and I hesitate before answering... is more in the nature of substantive due process despite by hesitancy in light of the attack made by the Solicitor General in the next case."
1985.84-5872,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.736,1537.768,I think that is the thrust of your argument.
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1537.768,1551.698,"It is our contention that the Solicitor General must prevail, must, if the only way our Petitioner could win the case is for the Court to hold that every state tort is a 1983 tort."
1985.84-5872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1551.698,1570.551,"Mr. Saltzburg, if the Court were to hold that negligent infliction of harm to a prisoner by a state official does state a claim, how would you propose to handle defenses for qualified immunity?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1577.893,1587.98,"Justice O'Connor, we conceded that a qualified immunity, such as this Court has already held under 1983, is adequate."
1985.84-5872,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1604.225,1607.192,"So, it could always be a defense in state law?"
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1607.192,1607.582,Yes.
1985.84-5872,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.827,1632.01,Negligence would... There wouldn't be many occasions where the defense would apply in the negligence section.
1985.84-5872,0,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,1632.01,1647.301,"Justice white, very few... The cases where it does apply are cases in which after the Court clearly announces a decision such as you must do this to conform to the due process clause, someone doesn't know about it but should have known."
1985.84-5872,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1648.833,1653.095,Mr. Hopper?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1653.095,1655.719,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.009,1792.977,May I ask whether there is an adequate state remedy in your hypothetical?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1792.977,1798.708,"Justice Stevens, I am assuming in the hypothetical I just proposed that there would not be a state remedy."
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1798.708,1799.567,You are just assuming it for the hypothetical.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1806.611,1819.856,"Justice Stevens, with respect, the law in Virginia is not clear as to this particular, unique government official, a deputy sheriff, and it is subject to constant review by the courts of record in the Commonwealth."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.856,1825.135,What did the Court of Appeals say?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1825.135,1828.447,"Justice White, the Court of Appeals said that they thought that sovereign immunity defense had no part in this case."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.447,1831.07,"And, it was not available in Virginia."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1831.07,1831.804,And that it was not available.
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.804,1834.162,Why shouldn't we take that as the law of Virginia?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1834.162,1839.676,"With respect, Justice White, the case relied on by the Fourth Circuit was an 1826 case."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.676,1845.08,"Well, you suggest we should just say the Court of Appeals didn't understand Virginia law."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1845.08,1846.641,"With respect, Justice White, yes."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.641,1846.969,Yes.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1856.06,1858.512,"With respect, Justice Rehnquist, they ought to."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.516,1894.856,"So, sovereign immunity in Virginia now exists only to the extent it has been declared and it has never been declared with respect to a prison guard."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1894.856,1896.949,"Justice White, that is correct."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.135,1904.494,I would suggest the inference is the Court of Appeals was quite correct then.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1904.494,1910.069,"--Respectfully, Justice White, I do not agree with the Court of Appeals."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1910.069,1921.346,"I know, but what... They have said we never had sovereign immunity until now and now we are going to have it here, there, but they have never said about this case."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1921.346,1923.5,That is correct.
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.5,1924.078,They have never touched on this case.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1924.078,1925.313,"That is correct, Justice White."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.218,1929.327,How about the lower courts?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1929.327,1934.841,"There are numerous circuit courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Justice White, which deal with this issue."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.841,1937.184,And say that there is sovereign immunity.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1937.184,1956.738,"Justice White, with respect, they are divided and the reason they are divided is because the court of record in the Commonwealth of Virginia engages in a determination of whether the act being performed is discretionary or ministerial."
1985.84-5872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.842,1975.793,"Mr. Hopper, let me interrupt you and get back for a moment... I fear I may be confused."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1984.461,1986.273,"No, Justice Rehnquist, you are not wrong."
1985.84-5872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.147,1992.911,"And, you are here now saying there isn't an adequate remedy under Virginia law?"
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,1992.911,1997.144,"No, Justice Rehnquist, I am saying that there is an adequate remedy under Virginia law."
1985.84-5872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1997.144,2002.532,Then how do you differ from the Court of Appeals with respect to the adequacy of the Virginia remedy?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2002.532,2007.842,"I do not, Justice Rehnquist, differ with the Court of Appeals on the adequacy of the Virginia remedy."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.246,2017.683,You would say that it was an adequate remedy even though sovereign immunity is available.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2017.683,2020.244,"Justice White, yes, it would be my--"
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.244,2023.04,"I know, but that certainly isn't the thrust of the Court of Appeals."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2023.04,2024.695,"--I understand that, Justice White."
1985.84-5872,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.298,2088.201,As I understand the difference is that he was a voluntary visitor.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2088.201,2091.153,"Justice Marshall, that is what the Petitioner has just said, yes, sir."
1985.84-5872,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2091.153,2093.182,The Petitioner was a voluntary visitor?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2093.182,2093.807,"No, sir."
1985.84-5872,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2097.51,2098.978,"Yes, but the prisoner wouldn't be."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2100.009,2101.009,"Justice Marshall, that is correct."
1985.84-5872,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2102.242,2103.039,That is the difference.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2103.039,2104.444,That is correct.
1985.84-5872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.534,2283.841,"Well, Mr. Hopper, supposing in this case instead of the Petitioner slipping going down the stairs the trustee or deputy had intentionally shoved him down the stairs intending to injure him."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2292.68,2301.256,"Justice Rehnquist, would I also have to assume... respectfully have to assume in the hypothetical that the deputy was in a position to prevent that injury?"
1985.84-5872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.256,2306.097,"Well, I suppose you can always prevent yourself from intentionally shoving somebody else down the stairs."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2306.097,2310.533,"I am sorry, Justice Rehnquist, I understood you to say a trustee which meant to me another inmate."
1985.84-5872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2310.533,2312.517,"Let's say a guard, a guard."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2312.517,2313.22,"All right, sir."
1985.84-5872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.03,2318.264,Yes.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2318.264,2331.384,"--that is a closer question, Justice Rehnquist, and may well create a constitutional deprivation in a constitutional sense because of the intentional act of the deputy sheriff or guard."
1985.84-5872,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.384,2333.899,Can you just say that it would?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2333.899,2338.351,"There again, Justice White, if it is--"
1985.84-5872,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.351,2344.222,Aren't intentional torts distinguished from negligence for a great many reasons?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2344.222,2345.456,"--Yes, Chief Justice Burger, they are."
1985.84-5872,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2348.033,2354.39,"That could be an assault and battery, pushing someone down the stairs."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2354.39,2355.874,"--That is correct, Chief Justice Burger."
1985.84-5872,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2356.437,2359.029,"It is quite different from ordinary negligence, isn't it?"
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2359.029,2361.325,"--That is correct, Chief Justice Burger."
1985.84-5872,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2367.698,2370.353,"Would you raise your voice a little bit, Mr. Hopper?"
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2370.353,2370.791,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-5872,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2371.571,2372.805,I am not sure our microphones are working well.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2377.366,2383.238,"Justice O'Connor, again the question becomes closer as you get into gross negligence."
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.17,2409.868,"Would you just explain to me why, if we focus on the word ""deprivation"" just for a moment, why the mental state of the person who does the depriving has anything to do with whether a deprivation occurred?"
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2421.348,2424.862,"Justice Stevens, yes, it would be a deprivation of life in that kind of--"
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.862,2425.737,Even if it was negligent?
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2425.737,2441.699,"--Justice Stevens, I would... The only guidance that I have in answering that question would be Parratt versus Taylor and Parratt versus Taylor has contradictory language but would seem to indicate that that negligent act would constitute a deprivation at least so far as--"
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.699,2444.198,"Well, if it is on life and property, why is it different on liberty?"
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2444.198,2448.492,"--Justice Stevens, intellectually it should not be different."
1985.84-5872,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2494.038,2496.364,Let's pursue that business of intention a bit.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2530.101,2544.188,"--Mr. Chief Justice, logically it may, but Monroe versus Pape was dealing with that same type of situation where, I believe, the argument was that those officers were acting outside the scope of their authority."
1985.84-5872,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2700.969,2711.073,"Mr. Hopper, tell me once more what your position here is about the availability of sovereign immunity in the event the Petitioner were to bring his case in Virginia."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2716.275,2730.426,"My position, Justice Rehnquist, is that there would be sovereign immunity because this individual was performing discretionary acts and an act of alleged simple negligence is alleged against him while performing those discretionary acts."
1985.84-5872,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2730.426,2737.502,"And, what precisely is the discretionary act, not cleaning the stairwell?"
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2737.502,2742.062,"That is correct, Justice Blackmun, not taking the pillow or the newspapers from the stairway."
1985.84-5872,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2742.062,2744.405,I am going to remember that at home.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2745.796,2761.334,"It has never been the law, we believe, that a state violates due process whenever it makes available substantive or procedural rules of tort law which on occasion preclude individuals from obtaining relief for certain injuries caused by state actors."
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.737,2776.907,May I give you one other hypothetical that occurs to me as a result of Justice Rehnquist's question.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2794.633,2801.053,"--Justice Stevens, in answer to your question, I think that we would have to determine whether that decision was wholly arbitrary or irrational."
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.053,2802.645,It surely wouldn't be wholly irrational.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2804.676,2822.639,"We would have to weigh then a balancing, if you will, of the private interest against the public interest and the public interest of maintaining orderly administration of its jails and prisons may very well outweigh the interest of the prisoner to bring a suit in the courts of the Commonwealth and receive compensation for that."
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2825.966,2830.947,"It would clearly prevail on your... If your first argument is right, you would still definitely win because it doesn't come in."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2834.898,2843.505,"--The second argument being a balancing of the governmental interest, Justice Stevens in your hypothetical?"
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.505,2847.596,"Well, your argument, as I understand it, is, first, there is no deprivation of liberty because it is a negligence case."
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2868.215,2876.648,"Justice Stevens, I would come down on the side that there would be no denial of due process assuming that there was a wholly rational and not arbitrary reason for that."
1985.84-5872,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.648,2876.976,Reason for that.
1985.84-5872,1,30787,james_walter_hopper,,2876.976,2881.349,"And, the legislature would make that determination at some point in its deliberations."
1985.84-5872,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3007.002,3013.812,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Saltzburg?"
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3013.812,3015.53,"Mr. Chief Justice, yes."
1985.84-5872,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3048.657,3056.514,"Well, I know, but as between the Court of Appeals and the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, whose words do we take?"
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3056.514,3058.607,"Well, Justice White, we believe--"
1985.84-5872,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.607,3061.245,It might have been a professor from the Virginia Law School.
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3061.245,3082.081,"--Surely the Attorney General of Virginia above me and the Court of Appeals, of course, but our position is... and I didn't want this to be missed... that it is not a meaningful remedy in a suit where in a state like Virginia in order to litigate this this prisoner would have had to go to state court, might never have gotten a final resolution."
1985.84-5872,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3097.294,3102.791,"Well, you have got a Virginia intermediate Court of Appeals knows that presumably review more cases."
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3102.791,3108.617,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist, but it did not exist at this time and there was no right of review for this prisoner."
1985.84-5872,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3121.206,3128.28,"And then it does, and then it does succeed in the state court, so it hasn't been a meaningful remedy, then you are around the mulberry bush again."
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3128.28,3129.28,"--Yes, Justice White, maybe."
1985.84-5872,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3196.143,3199.189,"May I just ask this question, Mr. Saltzburg?"
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3227.569,3229.724,"Yes, Justice Powell."
1985.84-5872,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3233.801,3234.192,Yes.
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3234.192,3240.719,"Our position is in that specific fact situation, yes, he should be able to sue under 1983."
1985.84-5872,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3261.445,3264.647,If the prisoner were being taken to his doctor's office.
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3264.647,3267.224,At his request for special medical treatment?
1985.84-5872,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3267.224,3267.427,Yes.
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3267.427,3268.489,It might very well make a difference.
1985.84-5872,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3268.489,3269.832,It might make a difference.
1985.84-5872,2,42004,stephen_allan_saltzburg,,3269.832,3271.816,Thank you.
1985.84-5872,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3271.816,3272.754,"Thank you, gentlemen."
