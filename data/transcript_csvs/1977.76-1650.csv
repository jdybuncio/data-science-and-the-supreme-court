1977.76-1650,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.674,"We will hear argument first this morning in number 1650, Ohralik against the Ohio State Bar Association."
1977.76-1650,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,16.933,20.48,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,191.328,201.005,"Well, does the charge require proof of advice with respect to need for counsel?"
1977.76-1650,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,201.005,204.373,That is the way in which the Disciplinary Rule reads.
1977.76-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,204.373,215.202,"So that just is not the business of soliciting business, it also says you should have a lawyer."
1977.76-1650,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,215.202,223.385,That is true that is essentially -- it is combination I would suspect of giving legal advice about the need.
1977.76-1650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,223.385,224.638,The need and then recommending himself.
1977.76-1650,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,224.638,239.687,"And recommending himself, and in the context of course, of a situation where that person does not come to the lawyer seeking such advice and recommendation."
1977.76-1650,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,366.075,391.726,Do you think counsel it would be fundamentally any different if a physician observing some person stranger to him thought he detected symptoms of diabetes or any other disease superficial symptoms and then solicited the person to come to his office for an examination.
1977.76-1650,0,22360,eugene_gressman,,391.726,399.528,An examination of his -- you mean speaking of the doctor now.
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2112.667,2122.72,Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2229.046,2230.958,How are the Commissioners appointed?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2230.958,2246.104,"They are appointed by the court, the Supreme Court of Ohio, and there are 17 districts, and one member is appointed from each district and they rotate the court as to who will appoint the next member, one by one."
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2246.104,2252.745,"This, the appellee and your client, is in this case is the Ohio State Bar association which was what the charging party?"
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2252.745,2255.396,The Ohio State Bar Association was the charging party.
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.953,2289.728,But the Commissioners are agents and officers of the Supreme Court of Ohio rather than of the Ohio state Bar Association.
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2289.728,2299.099,"They are agents of the Supreme Court of Ohio, yes Your Honor and had no connection with the Ohio State Bar Association whatsoever."
1977.76-1650,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2299.099,2304.962,For both the conversations that is in the hospital and in the home tape recorded or just the one in the home?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2304.962,2324.494,"Just the one in the home of Wanda Lou Holbert was tape recorded, she was the second young women, but the other tape recording was made with the parents of Carol McClintock on the same day on which the appellant solicited Carol McClintock in the hospital."
1977.76-1650,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2404.805,2409.273,Mr. Welch is there any punishment for solicitation alone?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2409.273,2410.424,In Ohio there is.
1977.76-1650,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2422.541,2429.63,Has any one been punished for solicitation alone?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2429.63,2431.924,Not within my knowledge?
1977.76-1650,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2431.924,2434.765,"So, the two are really tied together, aren't they?"
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2434.765,2436.003,The two are really tied together.
1977.76-1650,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2436.003,2436.507,Yes?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2436.507,2437.553,Yes.
1977.76-1650,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2458.857,2477.29,If the soliciting lawyer had used as some of them traditionally have photostatic copies of checks and prior settlements they had made for other clients and perhaps testimonial letters from clients.
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2486.953,2502.636,"It would be my judgment on that, Mr. Chief justice that it would be incorporated in the general allegation that it would be evidence of how he solicited, the manner in what he did."
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2789.888,2797.696,"Mr. Welch if I may interrupt you, you spoke a few moments ago of the Ohio State Legislature and its policy."
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2797.696,2798.851,Yes.
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2798.851,2808.122,"My understanding is, and you tell me if I am mistaken, that the Code of professional Responsibility in Ohio was promulgated by the Supreme Court of Ohio."
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2808.122,2808.645,Yes that is correct.
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2808.645,2809.905,Not by the Legislature.
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2809.905,2816.781,"Not by the Legislature but by the Supreme Court of Ohio, the Constitution of Ohio, excuse me Your Honor."
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2825.87,2829.709,"The State Constitution explicitly confers that authority under Supreme Court, Ohio Supreme Court."
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2829.709,2834.545,"Explicitly confirms that authority, yes Your Honor."
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2834.545,2840.615,Are there any State Statutes bearing on it?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2840.615,2842.793,On the matter of solicitation?
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2842.793,2850.378,Either on the matter of authorizing the court to do it or substantively on the matter of solicitation.
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2850.378,2886.577,"There are some Statutes that deal with other matters involving the court and may -- there is one involving judges Your Honor, yes sir, where the Legislature did pass laws asking the Supreme Court of Ohio to promulgate rules for inquiries about the competency and so forth of judges, and the Supreme Court of Ohio has promulgated separate rules covering that subject."
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2886.577,2890.175,But there are no state laws by that; I mean enacted by the State Legislature --
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2890.175,2890.635,Not effecting --
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2890.635,2892.371,-- bearing directly or effecting this case?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2892.371,2894.483,There is yes Your Honor.
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2912.605,2921.961,Is it generally understood in Ohio that the Supreme Court's action have superseded those old statutes?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2921.961,2937.147,"Yes, yes I think they are merely in aid of that I think quite the Court expresses it now if the court wishes to consult them, but we never bring any charges based upon the statutes, it is strictly --"
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2937.147,2938.966,Always the Code of Professional Responsibility.
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2938.966,2940.809,Always under the Code of Professional Responsibility.
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2940.809,2943.032,And when was it --
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2943.032,2952.99,"It was promulgated October 5, 1970, and the rules, at here under consideration, were then promulgated."
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2952.99,2953.188,And they where--
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2953.188,2954.32,Became effective October 5.
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2954.32,2964.438,They were modeled on with some modifications on the roles proposed by the American Bar Association Committee?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2964.438,2966.853,There are modeled on those.
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2975.031,2975.892,But these are identical?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,2975.892,3000.128,"These are identical with the American Bar Association rules, at least at the time when this occurred."
1977.76-1650,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3000.128,3014.236,"When did the State of Ohio give rule making power, the Legislature or the Constitution to the Supreme Court, about 57 or 58?"
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3014.236,3016.263,It is more recent than that Your Honor.
1977.76-1650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3032.385,3035.296,That is Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3035.296,3067.396,"Yes, yes Your Honor, and the control over admissions and discipline of lawyers."
1977.76-1650,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3181.922,3185.075,That was filed after the hearing on the disciplinary.
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3185.075,3190.109,"It was filed after the hearing, the disciplinary hearing concluded."
1977.76-1650,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3190.109,3197.027,In the disciplinary hearing did he represent that he was going to forgo his compensation?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3197.027,3199.97,"He did, Mr. Chief Justice, yes he did."
1977.76-1650,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3199.97,3201.741,Was that testimony under oath or is that?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3201.741,3215.861,Under oath.
1977.76-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3215.861,3220.501,"Mr. Welch, that statement I guess is there is a public record of the suit being filed."
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3220.501,3221.334,"There is, there is."
1977.76-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3221.334,3224.721,Does the public show that he appeared pro se or did someone else represent him?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3224.721,3228.598,He was represented --
1977.76-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3228.598,3236.332,"It is right, but is it conceivable that some lawyer went ahead and filed the suit without being aware of the testimony, do we know?"
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3238.987,3241.38,We do not have that knowledge.
1977.76-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.462,3250.924,Does the record tell us whether that suit was happened other than the filing of the complaint?
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3250.924,3253.185,"I am sorry, I did not understand."
1977.76-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3253.185,3259.037,Do the public records tell us whether anything happened beyond the filing of the complaint itself on the following (Inaudible).
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3259.037,3268.806,"Yes they do, there was -- Wanda Lou Holbert obtained an attorney and fought a counterclaim against Mr. Ohralik."
1977.76-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.876,3276.76,Counter suit against Mr. O’Reilly.
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3276.76,3278.211,"Mr. Ohralik, yes."
1977.76-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.211,3280.906,But I thought the claim was filed by Ohralik.
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3280.906,3284.13,"It was Your Honor, Ohralik sued Wanda Lou Holbert."
1977.76-1650,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3284.13,3288.537,"Oh, Ohralik, I am sorry, I thought you said O’Reilly and I thought somebody else."
1977.76-1650,1,33695,john_r_welch,,3288.537,3299.004,The appellant.
1977.76-1650,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3358.327,3359.012,Thank you gentlemen.
