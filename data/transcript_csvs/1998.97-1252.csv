1998.97-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.877,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97 1252, Janet Reno v. American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee."
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,10.778,16.021,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1252,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,68.575,81.825,"Mr. Stewart, may I ask you, what if the statutory scheme precluded review of a constitutional claim such as these respondents make?"
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,81.825,89.862,"--If the statutory scheme altogether precluded judicial review, that is not only at the present time but after the entry of a final order of deportation--"
1998.97-1252,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.862,90.483,Right.
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,90.483,95.566,--the Court has held that preclusion of all judicial review would raise a serious constitutional question.
1998.97-1252,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,97.175,102.559,We don't know at this juncture if your interpretation of the statute is correct.
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,108.194,123.265,"--Well, we certainly know that there has always... both before and after the 1996 act there has been a provision authorizing a petition for review in the court of appeals after the entry of a final order of deportation, and I think there's general agreement that a petition for review--"
1998.97-1252,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.265,126.514,But it requires a factual development in their case.
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,126.514,148.97,"--And if the... if there were ultimately final orders of deportation entered, and the respondents raised a constitutional challenge based on selective enforcement, and if the court of appeals then concluded that fact finding was necessary in order to resolve the constitutional issue, it would then be required to determine whether a mechanism existed under the applicable statute."
1998.97-1252,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,154.953,165.509,"It might provide the mechanism if the issue is properly raised, but can the issue be properly raised when it would not be based on anything in the record of the proceedings at the administrative level?"
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,165.509,187.695,"--I think it would be properly raised in the sense that the respondents would claim that execution of... if the respondents claimed that execution of the deportation order would violate their constitutional rights because the charges were initiated on the basis of unconstitutional considerations, I think that is a claim that would properly be before the court of appeals."
1998.97-1252,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,187.695,196.742,"So is that the Government's position, that we may rely on that representation that you have just made about the legal position that the Government would take in those circumstances?"
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,196.742,197.192,That is correct.
1998.97-1252,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,205.928,208.321,But you would concede that the issue may properly be raised.
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,208.321,208.878,That's correct.
1998.97-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,208.878,216.314,"Well, Mr. Stewart, these cases were pending at the time of the enactment of IIRIRA, were they not?"
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,216.314,216.724,That's correct.
1998.97-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.724,221.687,So isn't the habeas corpus relief provided for in 1105(b) available?
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,221.687,226.971,"Well, habeas corpus under the former statutory scheme was only in cases of orders of exclusion."
1998.97-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.824,234.597,But as I... perhaps I don't have it written correctly here.
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,239.77,247.056,"--Well, if and when the aliens were held in custody that would be--"
1998.97-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.056,252.017,"Well, surely they must be held in custody before they're... you can't deport them without having them in custody."
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,252.017,292.924,"--Well, the only... the basis for... if you look at page 1a of the appendix to the Government's brief, former section 1105a(a) was... it's entitled generally Judicial Review of Orders of Deportation and Exclusion, and it says, Exclusiveness of Procedure, and then it says, the procedure prescribed by and all the provisions of chapter 158 of title 28, which is the Hobbs Act, says, shall apply to and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for the judicial review of all final orders of deportation heretofore or hereafter made against aliens within the United States."
1998.97-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.498,321.856,"What's the purpose of 1105a(a)(9), which talks about habeas corpus for people held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation?"
1998.97-1252,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,321.856,347.1,"I would assume that would address the situation in which the alien challenged the detention itself, perhaps because it was prolonged, rather than challenging the validity of the final order of deportation, because as I say the legislative history of the 1961 amendments to the INA indicate that the provision for Hobbs Act review in the court of appeals was specifically intended to replace prior duplicative avenues of review."
1998.97-1252,1,20648,david_d_cole,,1631.263,1640.54,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1252,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3378.744,3390.332,I guess the first legal point I would want to make is that we certainly disagree with the contention that prior to the enactment of the 1996 statute there was a consistent practice of allowing claims like this to go forward.
