1972.71-1332,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,132.645,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1332, San Antonio School District against Rodriguez."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,138.438,143.739,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,450.241,455.466,So there would still be an equal input and there could be.
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,455.466,456.637,There certainly could be.
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.363,478.151,"But under the Texas system, it’s impossible for some districts to have a sufficient input even if they’re willing to tax themselves more."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,478.151,479.821,"They have a sufficient input, is that your words, Justice White?"
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.821,481.014,Yes.
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,481.014,482.542,"I would not agree with that, sir, no."
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,482.542,484.016,Why is that?
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,484.016,497.742,"Because we believe that our state foundation program has assured to every district the sufficient input for an adequate education and then it has left every district to decide for itself, “what, if anything more?”"
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.742,503.348,So you think this is really power equalization that you have now.
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,503.348,505.346,"No, I don’t think that ours is power equalization."
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.147,515.866,"Yes, but you get the same result in the sense that anything over a minimum-- a minimum is guaranteed and districts may make up their own mind."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,515.866,518.006,"That’s right, yes."
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,542.106,553.587,"Well, would you say it would violate the equal protection clause if, in some way, a Court could decide what was the minimum level of education?"
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,572.07,577.502,"I think that would be a much harder constitutional case for me to defend, yes."
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,581.317,592.484,"Apparently then, we must decide then whether the-- to your view, we must agree with you that the foundation programs brings it up to a minimum level?"
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,592.484,599.25,"No, I think that simply is not an issue here, that a-- there is hardly so much as an allegation or--"
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.25,601.528,It would be a violation if it didn’t.
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,606.647,609.915,I don’t think you have to decide that.
1972.71-1332,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,651.497,665.333,"You mean that the-- in effect, if it’s not conceded then at least it’s not denied that the present foundation of contribution to the local school district is sufficient to provide an adequate education?"
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,665.333,668.999,That is my understandings of-- that it is not denied.
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.474,711.657,"The difference between or one difference between the power equalization and your system is that under power equalization, if the district chose to tax itself on a higher rate it could get more money even if the pro-- even if the pro-- even if it was a poor property."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,711.657,712.716,That’s right.
1972.71-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.716,714.92,"Not so, under the Texas System Act."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,714.92,715.588,That’s right.
1972.71-1332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,715.588,726.58,"And each district would have the same row-a-hoe, so to speak, in raising that additional money under power equalization which it doesn’t have now."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,726.58,757.137,"Well, I wouldn’t want to accept that entirely, Justice Rehnquist, because power equalizing is always put in terms of the taxable property per pupil and, it seems to me, that in terms of what row you have to hoe in order to put a tax rate on yourself, it is really income, your ability to pay, that is important if, in a wealth district, the same rate would be a much smaller proportion of the income."
1972.71-1332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.086,784.049,Do you know of any case from this Court which has ever held it would be unconstitutional for a state simply to get out of the business of public education bag and baggage?
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,784.049,785.383,I don’t know such a case.
1972.71-1332,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,791.955,792.664,Aren’t there several cases?
1972.71-1332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.664,800.755,-- Why do you concede that a minimum education may be a constitutional requirement if the state can get out of it entirely?
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,800.755,805.188,"Well, I-- of course, you are closer to make my concession in terms of this case."
1972.71-1332,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,842.355,858.279,"But in the past two or three years, didn’t Justice Black in one opinion, whether part of the holding or not, didn’t he say pretty flatly the state could close all its schools if it wanted to?"
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,858.279,862.789,"I think he said something of the sort in Palmer v. Thompson, the swimming pool case where it was dictum."
1972.71-1332,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,862.789,876.861,"But is there a question, however, that once the state undertakes to furnish education then it must furnish a certain minimal adequate education for everybody?"
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,880.784,882.589,"We certainly must do it for everybody, yes."
1972.71-1332,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,888.297,897.185,"Would that mean that if a county in a state decided to provide public education then, as a constitutional matter, every county in that state have to do it?"
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,897.185,900.039,I wouldn’t think so.
1972.71-1332,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,906.554,912.671,"Constitutionally, as you know, there are many, many decisions that say that county action is state action from the point of view of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,912.671,921.149,"Yes, for some purposes as they are, but whether they are for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause, in this kind of sense, there I would say your decisions are to the contrary."
1972.71-1332,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.997,943.802,There are all sorts of local option in the Sunday closing cases involved.
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,943.802,944.298,Sure.
1972.71-1332,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.298,945.256,McGowan against Maryland.
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,945.256,949.326,Yes.
1972.71-1332,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,949.326,951.717,"Tell me, I’m just curious."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,965.079,976.626,"They differ very widely in Texas as they do in most states, Justice Brennan, and I think that if a state were do adopt district power equalizing, it, as a practical matter, would have to adopt statewide assessing."
1972.71-1332,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1100.091,1104.067,We’ll resume at 1.[Lunch Break]
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1108.414,1111.694,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1332,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1367.22,1395.514,"As I read this record, Mr. Wright, I-- it seemed to me that the testimony, and I’m not sure about the findings, pretty clearly demonstrate there is unequal treatment of these respondents who are Americans of Spanish ancestry at educational level."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1399.51,1403.718,"The racial issue is in the-- this litigation, yes, Justice Douglas."
1972.71-1332,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1525.411,1531.485,"I assume you use the term “state of the literature” in the-- rather, sense of the state of the human knowledge on this sense."
1972.71-1332,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1531.485,1536.499,"Yes, exactly the sense in which I use it, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1332,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1540.751,1544.422,Very well.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1546.849,1550.416,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1652.325,1657.08,"Mr. Gochman, do you-- let me be sure I understand you."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1667.467,1671.369,"That is not what I just said a moment ago, but there is."
1972.71-1332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1689.928,1694.262,My question is whether this is a necessary correlation.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1694.262,1695.547,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1708.56,1714.827,"I asked my question because, and it’s an unfair one, but I ask it from personal experience."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1745.908,1762.798,"There are probably some accidents like that in Texas but, in the West Orange case which we cite in our motion to affirm, we show how they do away with that happening in Texas by poor people being in a district begets all of the oil refineries."
1972.71-1332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1797.336,1797.604,Mr. Gochman.
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.604,1801.4,It doesn’t hold true in the middle unless at least by one of you.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1801.4,1810.443,"It doesn’t hold true in the middle, but in Bexar County where my clients live, Your Honor, it hold true perfectly up and down the line."
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.443,1811.766,Is there an exhibit in the--
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1811.766,1812.492,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1830.849,1831.04,Mr. Gochman--
1972.71-1332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1831.04,1834.991,Could you carry your general theory across the state line?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1834.991,1835.988,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.919,1856.142,"The logic of it, laying aside the Fourteenth Amendment with emphasis on “state,” the logic, however, would apply across state lines, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1856.142,1856.797,"No, Your Honor, I think--"
1972.71-1332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.797,1861.193,The logic of the Egalitarian concept that you’re arguing.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1861.193,1862.262,"No, I think we’re talking about--"
1972.71-1332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1862.262,1862.864,"Well, why?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1870.938,1872.737,"As a moral proposition, maybe so."
1972.71-1332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.737,1872.908,How?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1872.908,1874.091,But this is a state.
1972.71-1332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1875.867,1882.648,"I’ve said-- I said, laying aside that limitation, the logic of your argument would apply with equal force."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1882.648,1883.273,I think--
1972.71-1332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1883.273,1887.886,Whether you call it moral grounds or an Egalitarian philosophy or whatever.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1908.203,1921.506,"I think what’s important is the constitutional importance of education, that is, education affects matters guaranteed by the Bill of Rights."
1972.71-1332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1973.314,1976.863,"Well, how about public health to education, public health facilities?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,1976.863,1998.68,"Public health, food, lodging, those things are of great economic importance but they’re not matters that are related to those things guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, and any importance educationalized at the eight pegs up and down the ladder."
1972.71-1332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2111.577,2126.116,What’s your answer to Mr. Wright’s suggestion that the state foundation contribution is adequate to provide-- that the contribution is sufficient to provide an adequate education?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2126.116,2131.229,We show that it really doesn’t provide any minimum.
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.607,2195.565,Your answer is that state contribution does not provide an adequate education?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2195.565,2202.811,"Yes, and I say that, I pled that, and we proved that but, additionally, it doesn’t make any difference."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.759,2232.155,"MYour position then, just straight out, that the state must provide equal input into every school district in the state that whatever the system they have, whether it’s property tax or any other system, or whatever the-- whatever scheme you have is going to have equal input is otherwise per student."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2232.155,2232.848,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.185,2241.824,You can have an equal-- overall equal-- unequal input into two districts.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2241.824,2245.242,"Yes, Your Honor, but if it’s not just flat based on wealth."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.955,2263.486,"Well, let’s assume the state just had an income tax, no property tax at all, and it just gave one school district $500 a child and another school district $600."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2263.486,2265.803,For no reason?
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.633,2276.199,When could it give it one district more than another?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2276.199,2285.454,"One would be, I would think, power equalizing could be sustained because it does give effective local control and it does-- is this--"
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.454,2289.83,"No, but that ends up with wide disparities between school districts is what they get."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2289.83,2294.292,"Yes, we’re not preaching against disparities in education."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.292,2297.479,As long as the local people make up their mind they haven’t have any?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2297.479,2306.611,"Well, as low as the lo-- as long as there is an equal opportunity for education or if there is going to be a disparity, let it be on a program basis."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.514,2336.132,"Well, it’s not under power equalization if, after providing a minimum education if a district decided that they wanted to spend more money on education, they could just-- they could decide to spend it."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2336.969,2337.973,Yes.
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.973,2338.768,"Now, assuming--"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2338.768,2340.268,By taxing at a higher rate.
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.268,2349.176,"Yes, and let’s assume one district decided that and they want to spend $800 a student and another district said “well, we just don’t believe in education that well."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2355.367,2359.378,"As long as the 500 provided some, what you would say would be, minimum."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.973,2387.118,So you would say that the state may provide unequal inputs.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2387.118,2389.224,"On some basis, yes."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.596,2394.852,"But that’s only if the state guarantees a minimum, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2394.852,2399.556,"No, I can’t say that there’s any such thing as a minimum."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2403.395,2407.537,"I don’t understand your position, but you go ahead with your argument."
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2407.537,2420.84,"Well, a student in Mr. Justice White’s $500 district is going to be worse off than a student in Mr. Justice White’s $800 district there for reasons quite beyond his control, isn’t he?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2420.84,2433.841,"Yes, Your Honor, but this system-- Edgewood is a body, for example, 95% Mexican-American, average per capita income of $101,000."
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.829,2463.448,But there’s got to be some consistent principle that governs the decision rather than just saying that this is really bad and the other wouldn’t be quite so bad.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2463.448,2475.524,"No, what I’m saying is-- and we’re getting into the constitutionality or lack of constitutionality of this power equalizing system."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.524,2489.126,"Yes, but I just want to-- in deciding the case, I suppose it’s important to know is there any system that you could think of that would satisfy your objections to the present Texas system."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2489.126,2490.533,Yes--
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.533,2493.232,Other than just simply state control.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2495.149,2495.587,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.216,2542.577,"Well, as I get your position, it’s not that just the unequal inputs per se violate the Equal Protection Clause."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2557.836,2558.0,Exactly.
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.0,2560.283,That seems to be your major point.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2560.283,2562.519,"Exactly right, discrimination is based on wealth."
1972.71-1332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2562.519,2578.557,And yet what you-- your answer to Justice White a few minutes ago leave me with the impression that district power equalization could produce precisely the picture of which you complain today.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2578.557,2584.01,"No, because the discrimination would not be based on wealth and if you’re going to justify power equalization--"
1972.71-1332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2584.01,2593.693,"Well, could power equalizing ultimately produce precisely the picture of which you complain in Texas now?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2593.693,2606.932,"Well, the variances, Your Honor, under the present system are so vast that I can’t imagine any system and, as Dr. Berke testified, no one can imagine any system having vast or disparities."
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2619.903,2623.347,Did Dr. Berke testify or did he submit an affidavit?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2623.347,2624.341,"He testified, Your Honor."
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.556,2643.115,But it wasn’t a question of being present in Court and testified.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2643.115,2643.585,That’s right.
1972.71-1332,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2689.644,2697.247,"Well, I gather your answer, to me, is Edgewood at least under power equalization would be able to get out of this situation if it chose to."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2697.247,2698.148,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1972.71-1332,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2698.148,2700.163,"Whereas, now, it can’t get out of it."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2700.163,2700.698,That’s right.
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.661,2723.524,"Well, now, apparently it would satisfy your position if Edgewood, under some other system, had the opportunity to get out buy chose not to and stayed precisely at the present level of education."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2723.524,2732.007,If the discrimi-- if it wasn’t locked in on the basis of wealth and there was some rational and compelling state reason involved--
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.007,2733.281,"No, but if it chose not to."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2735.513,2736.002,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.002,2738.637,"You’d leave that to Edgewood, wouldn’t you?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2738.637,2745.853,"Well, I’d say it would be unconstitutional if Edgewood chose to go that way and had the opportunity to do something else."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.853,2753.69,You would say that the majority of the people in Edgewood could lock in a minority in Edgewood who wanted to get out.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2753.69,2757.466,"Yes, but that is not likely the system."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2758.133,2761.24,"But yours is voluntary with a vengeance, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2761.24,2762.591,Pardon?
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.591,2767.986,"This is voluntary with a vengeance, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2767.986,2770.513,Yes.[Laughter]
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.312,2785.96,You must think they did or you wouldn’t say that would be constitutional.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2785.96,2789.942,"Well, I think that has to be determined at a later time."
1972.71-1332,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2799.09,2801.496,Let me see if I can correctly understand you.
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2824.568,2840.775,"No, if the compelling interest of local control is that strong then you could have that kind of discrimination, that the people in an area can decide for themselves whether they want to lock themselves in to a poor school system."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2840.775,2845.26,What’s your position on that system if there’s something about the compelling system?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2855.182,2858.415,I would think it would be constitutional.
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2858.415,2865.748,"Then, in effect, your theory makes the districts equal but it may leave the students utterly unequal."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2865.748,2869.799,"Yes, but it would have a different basis at least."
1972.71-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2885.134,2890.463,"Well, then your case does a lot depend on these factors."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2890.463,2896.683,"I think-- yes, I think the factual situation is poor or there wouldn’t be any lawsuit the facts-- if the facts weren’t there."
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2931.804,2940.033,"You don’t contend, do you, that Texas setup this system of district school financing with the purpose of discrimination against minorities, do you?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2940.033,2946.567,"I contend that, objectively, Texas did what it did and it could have done something else."
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2949.676,2963.357,"Well, isn’t that a great deal like the findings we had in Jefferson against Hackney where you could say, statistically, minorities were discriminated against but there was no finding of intent to discriminate and, as to Welfare, we have held that."
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2963.357,2977.297,"Exactly, we had to face Jefferson versus Hackney and we say it’s distinguished because of the importance of education, because it falls on helpless children, and because the state created the discrimination."
1972.71-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.297,2981.334,"Well, doesn’t Welfare fall on helpless children too?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,2981.334,3001.054,"Yes, Your Honor, Welfare-- but on the other two grounds, the importance of education as it relates to the Constitution of the United States and the fact that-- I lost my train of thought on that."
1972.71-1332,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3023.556,3030.574,"The school districts created solely by the state legislature, only, that is they’re meats and bounds?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,3030.574,3031.87,No.
1972.71-1332,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3078.358,3092.916,"But the state legislature or any-- does any statewide agency, State Board of Education, or whatever, have any power to create or change or adjust the boundaries of the school districts within the state?"
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,3092.916,3094.132,No.
1972.71-1332,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3105.418,3107.619,This County is Bexar that you pronounce as “Bar”?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,3107.619,3108.785,"It’s “Bear,” yes."
1972.71-1332,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3108.785,3111.582,“Bear.”
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,3113.432,3116.65,"There are about 15, but some of them go into other county lines."
1972.71-1332,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3117.545,3118.694,They do cross county lines?
1972.71-1332,1,16108,arthur_gochman,,3118.694,3119.979,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1332,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3253.174,3254.434,"Thank you, Mr. Gochman."
1972.71-1332,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3257.682,3260.474,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-1332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3305.628,3308.462,Was Mr. Gochman bound by that comment?
1972.71-1332,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3308.462,3323.094,"No, but I think that you are bound to take into account the findings of serious students such as Professor Coons in determining what the Fourteenth Amendment means on a nationwide basis."
1972.71-1332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3342.014,3356.003,"If I had a case here from Texas and was claiming that “Texas had denied me equal protection,” I think I would feel rather strongly that whatever the figures might show about California was entitled to stand on the record made in the Texas case."
1972.71-1332,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3356.003,3379.618,"But I think with respect, sir, that in determining the rule of law that the particular facts of the Edgewood school district or about California or any other particular place are all merely parts of an overall mosaic that you must appraise in deciding does the constitution or does it not require this."
1972.71-1332,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3379.618,3388.047,Was it any part of the District Court’s rationale in this constitutional decision that this was racially discriminatory?
1972.71-1332,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3388.047,3388.907,No.
1972.71-1332,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3388.907,3390.091,I didn’t think so.
1972.71-1332,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3390.091,3391.799,There were allegations to that effect.
1972.71-1332,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3391.799,3393.862,"-- and a complaint, but no part of it--"
1972.71-1332,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3393.862,3395.015,But the judgment below--
1972.71-1332,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3395.015,3395.771,No part of the foundation--
1972.71-1332,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3395.771,3403.488,"Does not rely on that, no."
1972.71-1332,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3553.079,3554.453,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
