2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.76,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-882, Babb versus Wilkie. Mr. Martinez."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,6.76,21.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 633a states that all federal personnel actions shall be made free from any discrimination based on age."
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,139.08,157.68,"But you say that the but-for causation is not required for liability, but then at the relief stage, as I understand your briefs, you say that but-for causation is required for reinstatement or back pay."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,160.32,196.6,"So we would say that -- that at the -- at the remedial stage, ordinary remedial principles would apply, and those principles would require that the victim, the -- the plaintiff, be made whole for the violation. And under those ordinary principles that I think are undisputed on both sides, if the evidence shows that the -- the person, the plaintiff, couldn't -- wouldn't have gotten hired anyway, they shouldn't get remedies that are specifically and logically tied to that -- that thing that they -- they weren't -- wouldn't have been entitled to the in first place. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't get the kinds of prospective relief that are available in a wide array of other cases."
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,197.36,215.6,"And why -- why would we go all the way up the hill and then come all the way back down at the relief stage and just say, oh, well, you really do need but-for causation because, as you rightly say, if you haven't suffered a -- an action because of age, you're not entitled to reinstatement --"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,215.6,224.92,"You -- Your Honor, with respect, you wouldn't be coming all the way down the hill because there would be a wide range of other types of remedies that would be available other than reinstatement and back pay."
2019.18-882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.8,230.28,This case --
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,230.28,230.8,What would you --
2019.18-882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,230.8,251.04,"This -- this case, because there is -- at least one of her allegations is that she was passed over and younger people were selected for the coagulation unit."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,279.68,279.76,Sure.
2019.18-882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.76,280.6,-- Justice Kavanaugh.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,282.76,303.72,"So, first of all, assuming that the government could show that -- that she wouldn't have gotten the job -- we'll just take that as a given I think implicit in the question -- then she wouldn't be entitled to reinstatement or back pay, but she would be entitled to remedies like EEO training so that this kind of discrimination wouldn't happen to her next time she applies for a promotion or next time she seeks an opportunity."
2019.18-882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,309.88,311.4,Do -- who would get the training?
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,311.4,324.2,"The training we be the -- the supervisors and perhaps the -- the -- you know, the -- the others within the Bay Pines Medical Center who had contributed to the discriminatory treatment in the first place."
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,353.28,353.32,Would --
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,353.32,353.68,Would that remedy --
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,353.68,354.2,-- that require --
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,354.2,355.56,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,355.56,360.0,So no particular relief directly benefiting her?
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,360.0,361.88,"No, Your Honor. That's --"
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,361.88,368.36,"Or atmospheric relief, institutional relief, but she herself gets nothing tangible?"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,368.36,378.8,"I think those things would be very tangible for her, Your Honor, because she's still an employee there, she's still operating day to day in that environment, and she still wants to take advantage of future opportunities for training."
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,402.44,406.92,Would -- would the remedy be any different than might be obtained under the civil service laws?
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,406.92,421.76,"Well, under the civil service laws, Your Honor, the -- the way the civil service laws work is Section 2302 of the CSRA says that the way you bring a discrimination claim is to sue under this statute that we're currently talking about."
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,421.76,424.88,"There are -- there are other remedies available though, right?"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,424.88,436.96,"I -- I -- I guess I'd have to focus specifically -- I'm not sure specifically what you'd be asking for, but the way I read the civil service laws is that -- that these types of claims need to be brought under this particular statute."
2019.18-882,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,436.96,441.0,Mr. Martinez --
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,441.0,442.32,Now --
2019.18-882,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,442.32,449.4,"-- we're assuming the worst for your client, that the government is right that she would not have been hired but-for."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,459.6,460.4,Right.
2019.18-882,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,460.4,476.08,"So that even if she can't prove she would have gotten the job, she still has an opportunity to prove, qua a remedy, that age was considered and considered inappropriately."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,476.08,476.6,Correct.
2019.18-882,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,476.6,490.96,"So, for example -- give me an example of a defense to one of the government's allegations, because there were four allegations, four or five, of different employment scenarios that she didn't qualify for."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,490.96,491.52,Right.
2019.18-882,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,491.52,506.6,"But give me an example in those four or five of a process that could have -- that she might have won on, that she might have prevailed in showing that that process was corrupted because of her age."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,506.6,506.92,Sure.
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,554.44,562.04,"Usually -- usually when we have -- conclude that there's a tainted process, we make the decisionmaker go back and do it over without the taint, don't we?"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,562.04,576.16,"I think you do in a circumstances, Your Honor, and in a circumstance which that was possible, that might well be the -- an available remedy as well. I think we -- we are several years past the -- you know, the particular promotion decision and the particular role."
2019.18-882,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,587.0,591.96,"Mr. Martinez, you started by saying that this was a process statute."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,637.2,638.64,I -- I think that's a helpful way.
2019.18-882,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,716.36,727.52,"So I think what the Solicitor General would say is, sure, it's unequal treatment but a person is only subject to unequal treatment if he or she doesn't get the outcome that he would otherwise have gotten."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,727.52,727.72,Well --
2019.18-882,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,727.72,732.48,"And if everything ends up the same, then there's been no unequal treatment."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,732.48,752.64,"Well, I think -- I think, Your Honor, that's why the first part, the ""free from"" language and the fact that it's an adverbial phrase modifying the verb, and that that language is talking -- signals that we're talking about process. Once you know that we've got this -- we've got this modifier that's a process modifier, that's talking about the process, I think that then sheds light on what we mean by discrimination."
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,752.64,755.72,"Well, what -- what about the subject, ""actions""?"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,755.72,756.36,Right.
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,756.36,769.48,"And that's a term that's used in Nassar, a term that used in Gross, the word ""action,"" and the action is usually referred to as an adverse employment action, namely as Justice Kagan says, the decision."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,788.64,791.48,"Well, I think you need to read it again in -- in the context of the whole sentence."
2019.18-882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,820.16,821.08,I don't know -- I'm -- I'm sorry.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,821.08,821.76,I'm sorry.
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,868.16,869.72,Judge Henderson disagreed.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,869.72,874.04,"Judge -- you know, Judge Henderson concurred, Your Honor, so she agreed with the remand."
2019.18-882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,886.44,899.68,"But what happens if age plays no role whatsoever in the actual decision but at some prior point in the process, age was considered."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,909.4,911.08,I think it would -- it would depend.
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,935.36,942.52,"Well, but if -- if the statute prohibits any discrimination, I don't know where you get your qualification that it has to be a significant factor."
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,960.92,963.48,-- once to the -- to the applicant.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,972.52,978.16,I -- I think we would say that it does have to play a role in the decisionmaking process that -- that leads to the decision.
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.28,992.56,So how do you -- how do you tell what's a significant factor in the decision?
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,992.56,994.4,We're not saying it has to be a --
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,994.4,994.4,No.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,994.4,995.4,We're not using the term --
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,995.4,996.2,Some factor.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,996.2,1004.76,"-- ""significant."" We're saying that -- ultimately, we're saying what the statute says, which is that the -- that it needs to be made free from discrimination. We think that applies to the process as a whole."
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1004.76,1006.76,"Well, you say free from any discrimination --"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1006.76,1007.0,Even better.
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.0,1009.4,-- it doesn't have to result in the final decision.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1025.76,1025.84,Yeah.
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1025.84,1032.24,-- your position is going to become a -- a -- a -- really just a regulation of speech in the workplace.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1032.24,1033.48,"Oh, of course not, Your Honor."
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1033.48,1035.44,"Well, of course -- well, then explain how not."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1035.44,1045.6,"Well, if -- if -- if the speech in the workplace is, you know, using ethnic slurs or -- or, you know, calling people ""Boomer"" or saying unflattering things about them in age when considering them for a position, then, yes, of course."
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1045.6,1049.84,"So calling somebody a ""Boomer"" and considering them for a position would be actionable?"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1049.84,1063.88,"I think if -- if -- if -- if the decisionmakers are sitting around the table and they say, we've got Candidate A who's 35 and we've got Candidate B who's 55 and is a boomer and is probably tired and -- and, you know, doesn't know -- have a lot of computer skills, I think that absolutely would be actionable."
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1063.88,1066.76,"Well, what if he just calls him a ""Boomer."" I mean that -- I'm just trying to --"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1066.76,1070.76,I think that -- I -- I -- it -- it seems to me like that would be a classic question for the fact finder.
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.08,1079.32,But the key --
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1079.32,1080.52,I think it absolutely would be covered.
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1080.52,1088.32,"Is -- is -- when you answered that question, I had thought you would say, and you didn't, and -- and so this is why I have a question."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1103.48,1103.88,Right.
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1103.88,1106.96,"Now -- now, I thought you were going to pick up the same standard."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1106.96,1109.84,We -- we think that our standard is essentially the same standard.
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1110.0,1110.32,Right.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1110.32,1110.84,We just haven't --
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1110.84,1137.76,"So we could say in the opinion what this means, to be free, is the same thing that Congress said when it amended Title VII, that it isn't enough to show -- if you just show -- you don't have to show, plaintiff, that it is but-for, but you do have to show it was a motivating factor even though there may have been other ""motivating factors."""
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1137.76,1139.12,Right.
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1139.12,1146.0,"And, therefore, there is no more administrative problem in this than there is anyway under Title VII."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1149.24,1149.64,Let me -- let me just --
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1149.64,1151.24,You disagree with me because you --
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1151.24,1151.48,"No, no, no."
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.48,1151.56,-- think it --
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1151.56,1152.08,-- let me explain.
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1152.08,1152.36,"Yeah, go ahead."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1152.36,1158.76,"The reason we had -- we didn't do that is because, I think as everyone would agree, by its terms, that provision does not directly apply to this statute."
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1158.76,1160.16,"No, I know it doesn't."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1160.16,1160.96,I'm just explaining --
2019.18-882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1160.96,1161.04,Yeah.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1161.04,1164.28,-- why I didn't say it. But I think the substance of the point is exactly right.
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1169.64,1170.4,"Well, wait a second --"
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1170.4,1181.48,"Well, another reason -- another reason you may not have said it is because it comes with another flip side, right? It was a motivating factor, but then the defendant gets to show it wasn't -- the decision would have been made without regard to it."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1181.48,1184.84,"Yeah, but, Your Honor, that would -- that happens at the remedial stage, at the relief stage."
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1188.52,1193.6,"But in those statutes, in that statute, it happens at the liability stage, and I read your briefs --"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1193.6,1194.6,"No -- no, Your Honor --"
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1194.6,1204.64,"And I -- I read your briefs -- yeah, in the statute, I understand -- I read your briefs to reject the motivating factor or not adopt the motivating factor standard."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1204.64,1205.12,No.
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1207.44,1210.04,The Price Waterhouse-type standard that Justice Breyer brought up.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1210.04,1214.76,I think Justice Breyer was talking about what Congress did to fix the problem of Price Waterhouse.
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1245.24,1246.12,But you're not asking --
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1246.12,1246.32,-- test --
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1246.32,1247.04,Sorry to interrupt.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1247.04,1247.32,Right.
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1247.32,1250.56,"You're not asking for ""motivating factor;"" you're saying ""any factor."""
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1250.56,1251.36,"Right, but I think the way that --"
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1251.36,1252.56,Is that correct?
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1252.56,1256.04,"We -- we -- we -- we don't think it makes a difference, frankly, Your Honor."
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1256.24,1258.8,"And so, yes, you're asking for any factor?"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1258.8,1265.96,"We think ""any factor"" and ""motivating factor"" essentially mean the same thing because they play -- the -- the factor plays into the decision."
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1267.32,1270.76,"Counsel, I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond to another argument that concerned me."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1270.76,1271.28,Sure.
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1271.28,1282.08,"The Solicitor General suggests that if we were to adopt your view, we'd have to do the same thing with respect to private discrimination under, what is it, the 623 --"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1282.08,1283.08,Right.
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1283.08,1294.48,"-- which, of course, we can't do because of Gross, and point specifically to the language saying, you know, you can't discriminate in hiring or otherwise, right, discriminate --"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1294.48,1294.88,Right.
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1294.88,1305.04,"-- with respect to terms and conditions of -- of -- of employment. And if we were to adopt your broad reading here of ""discriminate,"" why wouldn't we do the same thing there?"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1305.04,1308.68,"So I think Gross is totally different, and just a couple points on this because it's very important."
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1323.32,1324.04,I -- I understand that --
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1324.04,1324.24,So -- so --
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1324.24,1325.44,-- but that's not responsive.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1325.56,1325.84,Right.
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1330.72,1331.4,I wish you would.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1331.4,1331.8,Okay.
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1354.56,1355.32,Conditions.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1355.32,1356.84,"-- compensation, conditions."
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1356.84,1356.88,Yeah.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1357.08,1360.0,The first three of those things are all outcome-based.
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1365.8,1368.76,"Why wouldn't that be process too, is the Solicitor General's question?"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1368.76,1372.84,"Well -- well, the first three things are all -- the first three in that list are all outcome-based."
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1382.8,1386.44,"So -- so the word ""discriminate"" here means something different than the word ""discriminate"" there."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1386.44,1390.6,"I think the word ""discriminate"" here needs to be read in the context of the broader phrase."
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1401.4,1402.4,"No, I understand that."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1416.52,1418.04,We couldn't agree -- we couldn't agree more.
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1418.04,1421.76,"And I understand -- I know where you're going with that, and that's good, that's a good point -- (Laughter.)"
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1421.76,1423.96,"-- but ""or otherwise discriminate"" --"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1423.96,1424.48,Yeah.
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1424.48,1429.4,"-- is -- is very -- I mean, that -- that seems to be a catch-all. That seems to be anything."
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1429.4,1432.04,I think I would resist that one because of ejusdem generis.
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1433.16,1435.4,You think you would have resisted that before Gross?
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1435.4,1438.2,"I -- you know, Your Honor, we're not here to relitigate Gross."
2019.18-882,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1438.2,1438.24,No.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1438.24,1441.08,I -- I think this -- Gross was a very closely decided decision.
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1459.52,1459.84,But the --
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1459.84,1464.96,"-- and here the ""otherwise discriminate"" clause is limited by ""with respect to terms, conditions,"" et cetera."
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1464.96,1465.32,That's not --
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1465.32,1465.88,So it's very narrow.
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1465.88,1467.88,-- limiting; that's broadening language.
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1484.96,1485.44,Right.
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1485.44,1495.52,"-- aspects, whereas here you just have ""actions,"" so if you're comparing the two statutes, to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's point, I would have thought a broader scope, if anything, was in that language --"
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1495.52,1495.88,I --
2019.18-882,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1495.88,1496.32,-- in terms of --
2019.18-882,0,56052,roman_martinez,,1496.32,1500.64,"I think the word ""discrimination"" sometimes can take on different meanings depending on the context."
2019.18-882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.8,1527.48,"Thank you, counsel. General Francisco."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1527.48,1553.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The federal sector ADEA adopts the same causation standard applicable to state and local governments and private companies, but-for causation. Three basic points make this clear. First, Section 633 -- 633a prohibits the Federal Government from making a personnel action based on age."
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1741.72,1758.08,"So -- so -- so if an employer has an explicit younger-is-better policy, Mr. Martinez says your position would allow that to stand for an -- an employee could not get injunctive relief against that. What's -- what's your answer to that?"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1758.08,1759.56,"So a couple responses, Your Honor."
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1794.16,1799.04,"So just to be clear, would that policy be a violation of that civil service provision?"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1799.04,1803.72,"If -- yeah, I think it clearly would be a -- a violation of the civil service provision."
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1803.72,1806.8,And would there be any impediments to suing under that civil service provision?
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1806.8,1812.32,"Your Honor, there is a very comprehensive scheme for bringing these types of complaints in the Federal Government."
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1820.96,1822.0,So for a --
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1822.0,1823.4,-- should adopt such a policy.
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1823.4,1849.0,"-- a statute that intended to reflect the equal protection clause of the Constitution, which would have covered this on its own prior to the enactment of the statute, you're now saying Congress intended instead to give litigants less Constitutional protection, less protection, not more, or equal."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1849.0,1850.2,"No -- no, Your Honor, not --"
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1850.2,1874.4,"And second, you intend on the -- like private sector discrimination or unlike private sector discrimination under be Title VII, Congress intended to give federal employees when it used the phrase ""free from any discrimination,"" it decided to say this kind of discrimination's okay under this provision."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1874.4,1880.76,"So, Your Honor, I think I disagree with that for a couple of reasons. First, I think I disagree with the premise."
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1897.12,1897.64,Unfortunately --
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1897.64,1899.96,And here everyone agrees the states are subject to the same --
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1899.96,1915.28,"General, unfortunately you're wrong because the EEOC and the civil service agency have been reading that equal procession principle even before this provision into federal decisionmaking. So I think --"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1915.28,1916.52,And I --
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1916.52,1918.44,I'm not sure how I understand your point.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1918.44,1919.28,"Well, I think that --"
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1919.28,1926.36,I don't think they were -- if they wanted to follow the state and local provision they would have followed it.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1926.36,1926.84,Right.
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1927.36,1944.2,"But they created a different and totally separate provision, and on top of it they said: That language and our -- that language of the private and state government should not be used to interpret this language that affects the Federal Government."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1944.2,1959.96,"Well, Your Honor, I think the reason why my answer is fully responsive is because the suggestion by my friend on the other side is that somehow when Congress extended Title VII and the ADEA to governmental entities -- and remember, they did it at the same time."
2019.18-882,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1985.28,2004.36,"Isn't there a -- there is a federalism concern, when you're dealing with state and local governments, which you don't have when you're dealing with the Federal Government alone, and why wouldn't -- the language as Mr. Martinez pointed out is different."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2023.56,2025.16,Right.
2019.18-882,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2025.16,2027.2,"-- and they said, what were the words?"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2027.2,2030.32,"""Free from any."""
2019.18-882,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2030.32,2057.68,"""Free from any,"" yes. So if Congress uses those different -- different, more encompassing language, all free from any, I would think that the standard that's before us, applicable to federal employment, is a more plaintiff-friendly standard."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2057.68,2073.04,"So, Your Honor, two responses on the textual issue, but I'd also like to address the federal -- federalism issue as well. On the textual question, the first is I'd simply point back to that provision of the Civil Service Reform Act that I was referring to earlier, 2302(b) --"
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2073.04,2073.72,"Well, call me --"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2073.72,2073.84,-- (1)(B).
2019.18-882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2073.84,2084.84,"-- old fashioned, General, but it seems to me that the first and clearly the most important place to go in thinking about what 633 means, is to go to 633 --"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2084.84,2085.12,Right.
2019.18-882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2085.12,2095.28,"-- and not to go to some later enacted statute in a completely different set of provisions. So I think, you know, Justice Ginsburg's question holds."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2133.76,2146.04,"Yeah, I -- I'd like to straight on address the textual argument first and then the why question second. The textual argument first is suppose you had a statute that said: All cakes shall be made free from the use of any eggs."
2019.18-882,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2168.0,2172.12,"Well, that -- I -- I mean, that gets to the point I -- I asked Mr. Martinez about."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2197.24,2197.56,Sure.
2019.18-882,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2197.56,2213.2,"If -- if -- if age is considered, is a factor in the -- in making the decision, there's discrimination based on age and the -- the -- the action is not done free from discrimination based on age."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2213.2,2214.56,"For -- for two reasons, Your Honor."
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2251.2,2251.52,Why --
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2251.52,2253.68,"And if that's the case, you're governed --"
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2253.68,2254.24,Why -- keep going.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2254.24,2256.16,-- you're governed by the common default rule.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2256.16,2259.04,"The why question is still hanging, which is why --"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2259.04,2259.16,Yes.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2259.16,2264.36,-- would Congress use this different language which is significantly different from the other languages --
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2264.36,2264.64,Sure.
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2294.08,2294.36,I -- I --
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2294.36,2295.8,-- for state and local governments.
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.8,2301.68,"I can -- I better read that one, which I will."
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.6,2326.52,You say okay.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2327.04,2328.12,Nobody here --
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.12,2328.68,-- There he is.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2328.68,2330.36,"-- thinks that, Your Honor."
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.36,2331.96,It's flashing around in his mind.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2376.6,2376.72,Right.
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.72,2378.96,"He can come back and say, no, not a but-for."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2438.4,2439.0,Right.
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2439.0,2442.28,So we have a reason. We have an interpretation of the statute.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2445.6,2473.64,"And -- and I fully understand that, Your Honor, and I think it actually illustrates what I think is one of the more troubling parts of the argument of my friends on the other side, because their argument really boils down to the notion that, in 1974, Congress somehow predicted the 1991 civil rights amendments, not just the motivating factor standard or potentially something significantly broader, any consideration, but the limitation on remedies and the burden shifting."
2019.18-882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2497.16,2503.2,"I think, General, that overstates what a complicated concept this is. I mean, there are two kinds of concepts you can use."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2523.6,2523.96,Right.
2019.18-882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2523.96,2531.28,"It's just those are your two choices, and you look to the language of the statute to decide which kind of statute we're talking about."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2531.28,2535.32,"Yeah, and I guess I'd add to the mix a third choice, which is the ""motivating factor"" test."
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.6,2550.88,No way.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2551.8,2553.8,And -- and if Your Honor --
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2553.8,2563.72,"-- the personnel action, the personnel action shall be made ""free from"" something, ""free from"" something."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2588.72,2588.76,Well --
2019.18-882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2588.76,2589.96,"It says ""free from."""
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2589.96,2610.52,"So, obviously, my answer is but-for, but the point that I was trying to make was that under the ""any consideration"" test, which is my friend's test and focuses solely on process, suppose you've got some low-level hiring official that says to his boss: I don't think we should hire this person for 10 reasons, one of which is I just think this person is too old."
2019.18-882,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2631.28,2631.36,Well -- -
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2631.36,2631.88,-- standard --
2019.18-882,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2631.88,2634.32,"-- in the process, but not in the actual decision."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2646.76,2647.24,Right.
2019.18-882,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2647.24,2648.92,-- then that's a different situation.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2648.92,2656.72,"What I would say is if there's a little bit of egg in it, then it would be a but-for cause but maybe not the sole but-for cause."
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2671.48,2676.16,Can I -- can I ask about the practicalities of this case and how it's going to apply --
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2676.16,2676.56,Sure.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2676.56,2681.0,-- in the real world? Because I'm not sure there's really much difference.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2691.72,2692.48,Yes.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2692.48,2716.32,"They would say you can get injunctive relief, however, against practices, policies, things, statements, conditions, even if they weren't a but-for cause of a particular action. You, too, agree with that, albeit under the civil surface -- civil service statutes."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2716.32,2716.8,Yeah.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2716.8,2717.68,Right?
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2717.68,2719.12,"Basically, yeah."
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2719.12,2726.52,"So there's no disagreement, as I understand it, between the two parties about how this is really going to work in the real world going forward."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2731.52,2733.76,"Well, I think there are a couple of big differences."
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2751.44,2751.56,Would --
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2751.56,2752.76,-- the thing that you're complaining about.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2752.8,2757.68,"But you would say, under the civil service statutes, that fair and equity provision that we've gone over --"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2757.68,2758.2,Yeah.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2758.2,2768.68,"-- for the same kinds of employment condition issues, you could get injunctive relief, which is exactly what Mr. Martinez is seeking here --"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2768.68,2769.12,Um-hum.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2769.12,2770.2,-- albeit under a different statute.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2771.84,2772.2,Yeah.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2772.52,2781.48,"-- different hurdles you have to go through, but in terms of employees, the real world of employees and the real world -- world of employers, I think there's a lot of agreement between the two."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2781.48,2795.0,"I think that's basically right because the things that he is concerned about, the types of policies that he's concerned about, couldn't happen within the Federal Government because of a whole host of laws, wholly apart from Section 633a."
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2804.76,2805.04,An additional avenue --
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2805.04,2806.44,And that's the point where we disagree.
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2806.44,2809.84,"Sorry to interrupt, but an additional avenue that would get you nothing more, though."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2809.84,2811.92,"Exactly, an additional avenue --"
2019.18-882,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2811.92,2812.08,Yeah.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2812.08,2818.28,"-- that would get you nothing more for the plaintiff, but that does create a significant headache for the Federal Government --"
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2818.28,2868.04,"Mr. General, the problem is, even though there was no anticipating Price Waterhouse and the 1991 litigation, it would also be much more consistent with the statute as the whole, because public sector, state, and Federal Government employees are ending up essentially with the same remedy for all the reasons that Justice Breyer said, which is even though we can't read motivating factor, it's really the same as a part of the decisionmaking, and private sector and state government claimants under Title VII are entitled to injunctive relief, et cetera, if they prove it was a motivating factor."
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2868.04,2870.12,"Not under the ADEA, Your Honor."
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2870.8,2871.2,And I do -- and I do --
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2871.2,2871.4,-- that --
2019.18-882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2871.4,2873.4,"But under Title VII, yes --"
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2873.4,2881.8,"Well, Your Honor, under Title VII and -- and I'd like to clarify this because our position on Title VII is a little bit more nuanced than that."
2019.18-882,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3076.24,3087.24,Mr. -- Mr. Martinez is making a distinction that -- between liability and remedy.
2019.18-882,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3138.68,3192.96,"Your Honor, I think you're fairly characterizing my position and I'd say a couple of things on remedy. If you disagree with me on liability, I agree with them on remedy, but I also think that his position on remedy is unnecessary for the reasons of -- of my exchange with Justice Kavanaugh. You can -- you -- you essentially already have a civil -- civil service system that provides the type of relief that my friend on the other side would seek since there are a host of civil service regulations that would prohibit the types of policies that he's concerned about, even if there wasn't somebody -- a particular person in court that was challenging it under Section 633a. But our bottom line position here is that Congress added the federal and state sector extension of 633 in the Title VII at the same time."
2019.18-882,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3222.56,3226.24,"Thank you, Counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Martinez."
2019.18-882,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3226.24,3233.04,"Just a few points, Your Honor."
2019.18-882,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3479.64,3490.04,"You know, I -- I assume, and I hope, that we would not see within any federal agency any sort of policy like younger is -- is better."
2019.18-882,2,56052,roman_martinez,,3519.04,3522.04,"May -- if I may answer? Two quick points, Your Honor."
2019.18-882,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3558.48,0.0,"Thank you, counsel, General. The case is submitted."
