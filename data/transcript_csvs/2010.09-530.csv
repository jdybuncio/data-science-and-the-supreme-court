2010.09-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.391,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-530, National Aeronautics and Space Administration v. Nelson."
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,13.308,16.343,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,56.718,62.472,"Mr. Katyal, is there any limit to what questions the Government can ask--"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,62.472,63.388,"Well, the--"
2010.09-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,63.388,63.905,--an applicant?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,63.905,69.809,"--The -- the limits are -- in this case, are the ones on SF-85 and Form 42."
2010.09-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,71.742,72.259,What does that mean?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,72.259,74.175,"--Well, those two--"
2010.09-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,74.175,82.448,"Could you ask somebody, what's your genetic make-up, because we don't want people with a gene that is predisposed to cancer?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,87.019,90.387,"--Well, I think that the Court doesn't need to confront that--"
2010.09-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,90.387,96.39,"We do, because I have to start with the question of: What are the limits on the Government, if any?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,105.329,111.15,"--Our position is in a case such as this, where there are collections on the Government's dissemination of the information--"
2010.09-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,111.15,112.733,"So what you are saying is, there is no limit?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,112.733,126.075,"--I -- I think that this Court in Whalen -- there is no decision thus far that has recognized any constitutional limit on the Government's collection of information, so long as there are accompanying safeguards on the disseminations and--"
2010.09-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,126.075,128.758,"General Katyal, why are we getting into this?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,142.03,143.815,--There -- there is no cross-appeal.
2010.09-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.815,145.315,So we have Form 85.
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,163.209,164.645,"I quite agree, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,186.409,193.415,"What do you think has been -- there hasn't been a formal injunction entered, a preliminary -- a preliminary junction, has there?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,193.415,196.45,--It's only -- it's at the preliminary injunction stage.
2010.09-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.767,229.254,I thought that the -- the entire Form 85 was approved.
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,241.494,246.881,--That's -- that's all that the Ninth Circuit ruled on at the preliminary injunction stage.
2010.09-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,246.881,251.535,Does that -- does that ruling stop you from asking that question right now throughout the Ninth Circuit?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,251.535,253.368,Which question?
2010.09-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,254.487,254.953,"No, no, no."
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,257.103,261.823,"Well, there's a -- the mandate has been stayed, so we haven't been able to--"
2010.09-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,261.823,262.39,Right.
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,269.244,270.244,--That's exactly correct.
2010.09-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,270.244,279.266,"And -- and if we did so, it would be because there is an underlying privacy right that is somewhat ill-defined or undefined?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,279.266,280.884,"Exactly, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-530,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.042,302.147,"But the -- the circuit precedent, as far as the other questions on Form 85, the circuit said that's okay."
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,304.297,306.099,"Thus far, that's correct."
2010.09-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.038,326.913,"Mr. Katyal, what is the well-defined, the well-defined, constitutional right to institutional -- to informational privacy that the Government is -- is willing to acknowledge?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,330.715,335.285,"--Justice Scalia, our position is that the Court doesn't need to answer that question."
2010.09-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.874,346.676,It's a strange way to proceed.
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,351.211,352.246,I agree--
2010.09-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.246,353.096,Do we do that in cases?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,353.096,358.134,"--I agree that in many other contexts, it might not be appropriate, but here I think there are some good reasons why."
2010.09-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.596,382.933,That would justify not defining it broadly or narrowly.
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,389.753,393.723,"--Justice Scalia, that's what this Court has done throughout its history."
2010.09-530,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,402.579,412.185,How can the Court determine that the right is not violated here without having some idea about either the existence or the contours of the right?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,412.185,415.821,"--Well, I think it would just be like in Whalen itself."
2010.09-530,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,427.961,439.936,Is it your argument that the Government can collect whatever information it wants from private individuals so long as the information is not publicly disseminated?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,439.936,441.038,"--No, that's not our position."
2010.09-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.029,464.153,"Well, does it help us in finding what this residual background right is and asking you: Why is it that you can't disclose it?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,464.153,466.503,--I'm sorry?
2010.09-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.503,468.688,Why can't you disseminate the information?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,468.688,472.39,"Surely -- we are restricted by statute, the privacy of--"
2010.09-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.39,473.706,Let's assume no statute.
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,473.706,475.842,--If you assume--
2010.09-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.842,486.75,"In other words, this is just testing whether there is some background constitutional right and how to define it, if we have to use that as a beginning premise."
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,486.75,487.316,--Absolutely.
2010.09-530,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,504.527,511.115,And what would be your position if the -- all this information were disclosed?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,519.868,520.051,Right.
2010.09-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,541.199,554.107,"So when you say your position would be no, you mean that there is no right of any kind under your -- I know you don't want us to reach it, but you would say there is no right of any kind for a citizen to tell the Government: That is none of your business."
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,560.426,562.859,"--Well, in the employment/proprietor context."
2010.09-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,580.002,585.072,Do you think it's firmly rooted in our traditions that there is some right to tell the Government: That's none of your business?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,585.072,588.457,--I think there is some right.
2010.09-530,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,599.496,605.483,What is the test -- what is the test for determining what sort of questions can be asked in the employment context?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,634.086,634.536,Sure.
2010.09-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,653.848,655.448,"Yes, but that's putting those aside."
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,678.862,683.531,I do think that if the private employer -- the private employers are a good template.
2010.09-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.323,729.477,"We do have a legislature, don't we, that could place some limits on what the Government asks employees or anybody else?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,729.477,730.41,Absolutely.
2010.09-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.41,736.047,"It's the same legislature that prohibited the Government from disclosing a lot of information, isn't it?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,736.047,737.181,That's precisely correct.
2010.09-530,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.181,748.355,"And it's possible that that's the protection that the Framers envisioned, rather than having courts ride herd on Government inquiries."
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,748.355,750.39,"It's certainly possible, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,754.175,758.877,Were these two forms approved by Congress?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,758.877,765.416,"--The forms themselves were not approved by Congress, but the Privacy Act, which is the main restriction--"
2010.09-530,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,765.416,769.435,"That's a restriction on disclosure, but the same Congress can change that, correct?"
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,769.435,770.97,--That's absolutely correct.
2010.09-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,791.966,797.703,What is the reason -- I've had trouble putting my finger on it -- that you need the information about counseling?
2010.09-530,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,811.861,813.88,It is for the good of the employee.
2010.09-530,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,813.88,816.515,"Well, I've asked you -- whenever the Government comes and says,"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1551.517,1553.652,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1574.799,1594.027,"Mr. Stormer, what provision of the Constitution are you relying -- I looked at your table of authorities in your brief, and you have cases listed, you have statutes listed; there is not a single citation anywhere in your brief to a provision of the Constitution."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1596.479,1597.831,It would mostly fall--
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1597.831,1602.117,I think it's a very nice thing that the Government shouldn't ask intrusive questions.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1628.431,1635.187,"--It would flow from the ordered concept of the liberty component of the Fifth Amendment, as well as the First--"
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.187,1637.321,"The Fifth Amendment, okay."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1640.84,1645.709,"--Of life -- I mean, no person shall be deprived of due process of law, and then the last--"
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.709,1646.911,Due process of law.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1646.911,1649.744,"--refers to the concept of, the ordered concept of liberty."
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.744,1649.946,All right.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1652.898,1660.902,"Well, the Whalen case, the Nixon case, and to some extent, the Reporters Committee case refer to this concept of privacy."
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1672.088,1674.957,"I mean, I like that, but I just don't see it anywhere in the Constitution."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1676.726,1683.463,"--Well, I -- there -- those cases, in fact, do not refer to a term called ""informational privacy""."
2010.09-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1693.037,1696.722,So that right is subject to what level of scrutiny?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1703.726,1712.582,"The -- the standard would be -- I think the appropriate standard was applied by the Ninth Circuit, which is a legitimate State interest narrowly tailored to meet that need."
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1736.697,1750.088,"So what is your view of what the liberty -- you are saying that the words in the Constitution that protect the right that you claim was violated are the words, ""No person shall be"" -- I guess --"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1756.342,1757.342,That's correct.
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1757.342,1757.725,All right.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1761.277,1763.829,Liberty to control information about oneself.
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1765.781,1770.316,There is a right to liberty to control information about oneself?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1770.316,1771.785,--Without governmental intrusion.
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1771.785,1774.47,All right.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1778.838,1780.79,Well there--
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1780.79,1782.992,Liberty -- there is a liberty to control all information?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1795.847,1803.037,"--It comes into play when the Government, the State, seeks to intrude and obtain information from an individual."
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1804.12,1815.476,"So the fact that the Government says -- I go and I want my driver's license, and they say, fill out the form, we want to see how you -- if you can drive or not, that potentially could violate the Constitution?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1815.476,1815.709,--Well--
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1815.709,1816.361,Potentially.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1821.446,1825.616,--Any intrusion into private lives would have to have some--
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1825.616,1826.333,"It says ""liberty""."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1830.687,1831.403,--That was the--
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.403,1833.387,So I want to know how that works.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1846.363,1846.98,"--That -- yes, it is."
2010.09-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1846.98,1849.482,So that's all information about yourself?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1849.482,1849.765,Well--
2010.09-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1849.765,1853.883,"I think what Justice Breyer is getting to and that I'm trying to figure out is, you've used the word ""privacy""."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1855.669,1858.621,"--Privacy relates, in this case, to the--"
2010.09-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1858.621,1865.791,"No, I'm talking about -- answer his broad question, which is -- you've defined the constitutional right to information about yourself."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1865.791,1866.525,--Correct.
2010.09-530,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1866.525,1876.832,"Is that all information about yourself, including your date of birth, your Social Security Number, your -- where you live, where you've gone to school, who are your friends, who your references are?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1880.3,1886.438,It -- the -- the nature of what is included can be intruded upon based upon a governmental need.
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1895.294,1898.329,So this gets back to Justice Sotomayor's earlier question.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1900.962,1902.114,The test--
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.114,1903.714,No matter what type of information?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1910.969,1915.671,"--In this case, I think it is a legitimate State interest, narrowly tailored to meet that interest, Your Honor."
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1915.671,1920.325,"But in the case of a date of birth for a driver's license, you say it's rational basis?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1920.325,1920.725,Yes.
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.725,1922.361,So how do we decide?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1985.952,1995.39,"Well, this Court has done much of that already in a whole history of cases: Contraception, procreation, marriage, sexual relations, family relations."

2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2001.729,2009.567,The -- the rights that go -- the questions that go to those types of -- which could elicit that type of information.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2029.192,2036.032,"But isn't that question, that kind of open-ended question, routinely used in employment situations?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2063.265,2072.038,It is not routinely used in employment sectors where there is allowed to inquiry -- inquiry into non-employment-related--
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2072.038,2074.573,"Well, it has a legend on the top."

2010.09-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2091.182,2097.236,"Well, I -- I have to agree with the implication of Justice Ginsburg's remark, at least what I imply from it."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2125.34,2127.792,"That would be exactly my point, Your Honor."
2010.09-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2156.125,2161.279,"I don't see what the alternative, as a practical matter, is to asking this sort of open-ended question."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2187.41,2197.868,"This goes to the very basic question of: Why does the Government need to know this information for these individuals, most of whom have been there for 20 to 30 years?"
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2206.455,2213.377,Are you then saying that these people have to be grandfathered or grandparented because they worked for 20 years--
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2215.496,2216.746,"--I am not, Your Honor."
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2225.602,2228.887,--But you are making a -- you said that these people have worked there for 20 years.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2236.724,2238.342,--I am not.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2238.342,2239.692,--for the person who is already in the job?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2239.692,2240.475,I -- I am not.
2010.09-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2252.416,2261.938,"Well, suppose the person who works at the -- at the gift shop, or the snack bar -- I think that's what you mentioned -- has a big sign on his front lawn that says,"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2269.676,2273.811,"I would agree that -- that in that instance,"
2010.09-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2280.948,2286.369,"And now, what's the alternative to acquiring that information through an open-ended question?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2294.356,2296.908,I wouldn't think that that would be needed.
2010.09-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2297.641,2298.593,Do you see what I am getting at?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2302.629,2305.431,--Only if you need to know the answers.
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2337.402,2340.337,So -- just to -- I would like to get back to Justice Breyer's question.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2355.679,2356.346,It does.
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2356.346,2365.719,"Well, that -- you know, it's a big government, and they can't tailor every inquiry, every form, to the individual applicant."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2365.719,2367.737,It -- it can to the positions.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2387.382,2391.0,Are you suggesting that this is no good for government employment?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2422.722,2438.916,"If I understand Your Honor's question, and I apologize, I -- I think this cannot be asked of -- these questions cannot be asked of people for whom the Government does not have a justifiable need to know that information."
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.916,2440.682,We can handle those details.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2452.157,2452.94,Well--
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.94,2453.926,It's a piece of cake.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2453.926,2459.394,--The Government is -- claims to be acting as the employer here.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2469.101,2474.922,"You are -- you are attacking these forms for all Government employment, not just the contractors?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2474.922,2482.176,I -- I don't -- it -- I think it would apply to all of those people who are in nonsensitive positions.
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2494.701,2501.739,But you don't know -- you don't know if it's a low-risk employee until you find out what he -- he or she is like or what the neighbor thinks.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2511.261,2525.87,"--In the context of these employees for this particular case, we absolutely know, because the Government went through and of the 7,500 employees there, it categorized 97 percent as low or no-risk employees."
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.841,2533.141,Excuse me.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2539.978,2542.08,--I don't know that for a fact.
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.047,2544.797,"Well, do you contradict that?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2549.251,2554.304,--Because the Government says they are low or no-risk employees.
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.538,2582.205,Does al-Qaeda know all this stuff?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2582.205,2583.188,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.188,2584.707,Does al-Qaeda know this?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2587.207,2599.717,"Well, the interesting response to that, Your Honor, is that it wouldn't matter if they knew this, because it's open transparent science by a civilian agency in a campus atmosphere."
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2604.102,2622.48,"What you are saying -- what you are saying is it may not make much sense to have the people here fill out Standard Form 85, but the Government can't tailor its open -- opening security form to people that -- you know, maybe down the road at a different NASA laboratory, they do work on more sensitive information."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2626.034,2630.752,--And the Government has a form for those people who work in classified information.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2653.851,2658.755,I'm -- I'm very surprised to hear that.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2666.675,2674.681,"--Similar but not questions that would go -- you couldn't, as a private employer, say you have to turn over your medical records, you have to turn over--"
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2674.681,2676.55,Where does it say you have to turn over your medical records?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2676.55,2680.752,"--That's in SF -- SF-85 page 6, which is the release."
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2683.454,2687.756,Under what -- under what law could you -- a private employer not ask for those records?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2687.756,2690.19,--In the State of California in the right to privacy.
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2690.19,2692.976,I know we are talking about under general federal law.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2692.976,2696.511,"Most -- general federal law, I cannot answer that."
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2696.511,2698.144,But it's a matter of statutory law?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2698.144,2701.998,"Yes -- well, in some States there's a -- where there's a privacy right."
2010.09-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2701.998,2714.64,"Question 42, do you have -- pardon me, question 7 on Form 42, the -- the standard one, do you have any adverse information about this person's employment, residence or activities concerning, and so forth, violation of the law?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2718.607,2720.559,They can't ask the question--
2010.09-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2720.559,2721.609,The prospective private employer?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2721.609,2735.6,"--in the context of the release which is SF-85 page 6, which requires that you release your private records, extensive records, residential, retail businesses, where you shop, your educational, your--"
2010.09-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2735.6,2744.705,I -- I'm asking whether or not a private employer can ask third persons the question that's at Form 42 question 7.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2749.942,2752.561,"--I -- I -- if I said that, Your Honor, I misspoke."
2010.09-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2753.778,2755.846,"But that was enjoined by the court below, was it not?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2755.846,2756.596,--It was.
2010.09-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2756.596,2757.198,All right.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2757.198,2764.686,"Question 7 talks about financial integrity, mental and emotional stability, general -- general behavior or conduct or other matters."
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.256,2772.975,What is your view on that question?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2808.196,2809.031,--No.
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2809.031,2810.481,All right then.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2819.904,2827.525,Any employer can ask issues that are employment related and based upon the nature of the job.
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.083,2845.887,What is the specific thing about question 7 that you think is unlawful or should be changed?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2849.006,2854.843,"--Well, other matters, general behavior or conduct, certainly."
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2854.843,2865.55,"So they cannot ask, do you have any information about this person's employment, residence, or activities concerning general behavior or conduct or other matters?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2876.608,2880.993,That's because this question for the types of situations is not needed.
2010.09-530,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.13,2887.797,"I see, I see."
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.797,2893.618,Why do you say a private employer could not ask a question of such detail?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2893.618,2896.836,Primarily because of the release.
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2901.656,2904.925,Why could a private employer not do it?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2904.925,2911.262,--Because in virtually every state there are laws requiring the disclosure of private information.
2010.09-530,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.262,2915.483,"Well, you mean that legislatures take care of these matters?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2936.563,2951.822,"I -- the reason I invoke that is because the Government has stated that any private attorney can ask these questions, and that's a misstatement of the law in most states."
2010.09-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2951.822,2955.958,Can I ask you this question about the question on drug treatment.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2981.489,3001.07,"If they've said I violated State or Federal laws, not on its face so long as if it said voluntarily, you may show mitigation that -- that would show that this is not a problem, it would make you unfit for the job."
2010.09-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3001.07,3009.843,"So they could say, have you bought, sold, used drugs in violation of Federal or State law?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3017.997,3018.297,That's correct.
2010.09-530,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3018.297,3021.834,What's really the difference between that regime and what you have here?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3021.834,3023.834,The difference is here is because it is compelled.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3044.33,3049.901,Can I ask you to clarify your understanding of what has been enjoined?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3069.798,3077.903,There was in the emergency order specific reference to the release.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3087.593,3090.728,"They didn't say, Government, you can't ask for the release?"
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3090.728,3091.695,They did not.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3091.695,3093.33,They say you can't ask open-ended questions?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3093.33,3095.397,That's correct.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3102.953,3108.607,"If somebody is going to be enjoined, I mean, it can't be implicit in the ruling if you were enjoined."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3116.278,3132.472,"--The -- well, in the Court below, for instance, the argument that the Government made was that they needed to have the medical records, not that they just needed this information, that they needed to have the medical records."
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3148.248,3152.95,"As I understand this process, this is not an oral interview."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3162.991,3163.841,--It's handled.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3175.549,3176.165,Yes.
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3178.851,3180.203,--There is not.
2010.09-530,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3180.203,3185.607,"So then they wouldn't say -- it says here, so I'm going to ask this, that and the other thing."
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3188.09,3189.725,I may have misspoken.
2010.09-530,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3195.093,3199.597,You say there are 22 people in JPL that are involved in the employment?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3199.597,3213.423,"There are 22, the Government has approved 22 so-called approvers who are at JPL who look over -- who are eligible to look over these forms and the responses to the forms."
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3213.423,3219.743,What do you understand the scope of the preliminary injunction to be?
2010.09-530,1,21500,dan_stormer,,3226.981,3247.977,"At this point it only applies to -- well -- this is not before the -- part of the record, but when it went back to the district court, the district court and all parties agreed that it would only apply -- that HSPD-12 would be limited to these 28 individuals, that investigation."
2010.09-530,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3253.731,3254.548,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-530,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3257.1,3268.574,"Justice Ginsburg, you had asked earlier whether this was narrow decision on just a couple of questions and I think that the argument that you just heard from my friend illustrates that it is not."
2010.09-530,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3272.193,3275.496,"Whatever he asks, we were reviewing a judgment."
2010.09-530,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3275.496,3276.746,And the judgment--
2010.09-530,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3276.746,3281.9,"And the judgment is not the universe, it's certain questions can be."
2010.09-530,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3281.9,3287.904,"--And the judgment is based on the following rationale, this is from the petition appendix on page 18A from the Ninth Circuit."
2010.09-530,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3323.81,3330.631,Are you conceding you can't meet that standard or are you saying that the Ninth Circuit misapplied that standard?
2010.09-530,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3330.631,3332.25,"No, we are not conceding that at all."
2010.09-530,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3355.38,3360.9,Do you think there is something wrong with the Government having to explain why it seeks information?
2010.09-530,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3373.474,3388.132,"--I think that political process ensures that the Government generally has to answer that question at large, but in order for the Ninth Circuit's reasoning to apply it would permit any individual person here or there to ask the question."
2010.09-530,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3388.132,3397.089,"I don't see how that's so because at least if you are in the Ninth Circuit, you know that the Ninth Circuit has blessed all the questions on that form but one."
2010.09-530,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3397.089,3398.372,That's only because--
2010.09-530,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3398.372,3401.474,"You could raise the question, but you would be out of court in a minute."
