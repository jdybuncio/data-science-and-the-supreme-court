1971.70-57,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.682,"-- number 70-57, United State against Caldwell."
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,59.493,62.554,May it please the Court.
1971.70-57,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,655.226,663.819,"In a way, is it despite or is it in view of the broad protection that's been applied to it."
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,680.995,696.796,"I think that, that is perhaps an appropriate interpretation of the decision of the Court of Appeals and it is exemplified at page 125 in the opinion of the Court of Appeals."
1971.70-57,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.722,740.197,Now the whole paragraph now goes to that point --
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,740.197,753.396,"Yes, but this particular statement can rest only on the affidavit of Earl Caldwell which appears at pages 17-19 of the Appendix."
1971.70-57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,889.123,906.287,"And Mr. Solicitor General what about -- what is this Court of Appeals trying to -- is this, I am looking at 125, “if this is true and the government apparently has not believed it's necessary to excuse."
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,906.993,911.584,I don't know what it is meant by the government apparently has not believed it necessary to dispute it as disputed it in --
1971.70-57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,911.584,913.136,So it has disputed now --
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,913.136,915.42,-- consistently all the way along.
1971.70-57,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,926.673,936.76,"Well, are you suggesting the Court of Appeals thought that the government agreed with the appellant's assertion on first sentence, doesn't it?"
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,936.76,949.186,"Well, if the Court of Appeals believed that, it was against every effort made to disabuse with such a belief."
1971.70-57,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1064.62,1068.425,Where is the exception to the President of United States come from?
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1068.425,1078.735,"In Separation of Powers, I suppose, by historical derivations from the King, it's simply a matter of common constitutional law."
1971.70-57,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.735,1084.605,What if the President of United States were an eyewitness to --?
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1084.605,1101.905,"I think, if I go back, if my mind goes back as far as, Livingston and Jefferson and the President was held not amenable to suit and I understand that he is commonly regarded as not amenable to process of the courts."
1971.70-57,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1101.905,1104.979,I don't think Jeremy Bentham would be with you.
1971.70-57,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1109.039,1113.765,"Well, John Marshall said, the President didn't have to appear, didn't he, in the trial of Aaron Burr --"
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1113.765,1123.241,"In the Trial of Aaron Burr, he said he did not have to appear and I repeat I believe that's what Livingston and Jefferson decided."
1971.70-57,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1132.297,1135.648,"I guess, I didn't learn it -- [Laugher]"
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1135.648,1139.103,-- which I had supposed was unquestioned --
1971.70-57,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1139.103,1141.509,And which probably doesn't hurt anybody very much?[Laughter]
1971.70-57,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1141.509,1149.42,"And there was a case following the civil war, if I recall too, it was somebody against Johnson."
1971.70-57,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.747,1857.031,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1859.811,1866.237,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-57,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1960.202,1975.226,I suppose here occurrence would give the opportunity to -- or there is a chance that the witness might change his mind or breakdown or be swatted out of his own position?
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1975.226,1988.164,"Well, that is certainly one of the dangers involved in his appearance and one of the reasons why we think his non-appearance, and particularly in very narrow circumstances of this case is not required."
1971.70-57,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.462,1992.742,What happens to Fifth Amendment cases?
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1995.816,1999.698,"Yes, but the Fifth Amendment privilege Mr. Justice Marshall is based on quite a different footing."
1971.70-57,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2017.375,2024.229,"Well, the harm might be much greater in the case of the Fifth Amendment situation than in the first, might it?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2027.065,2037.446,"I cannot conceive of any way in which his appearance before the grand jury would incur much harm under the Fifth Amendment, let alone more than in this case to the First."
1971.70-57,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.446,2053.705,What if the circumstances were such that he requred with or at least close enough to some organized another desperate criminal group that he might get shot on his way to the grand jury as soon as it became known.
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2058.235,2061.525,"No, perhaps I misunderstand the question."
1971.70-57,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2135.038,2135.802,What does it reach?
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2182.829,2185.154,That's correct Your Honor.
1971.70-57,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2185.154,2193.616,Considerations of being able to gather news at some future date too should be an excuse?
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2193.616,2194.531,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-57,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2194.74,2197.029,It's more important than his life.
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2198.545,2216.356,"Nothing is more important than life, but one doesn’t reason back within the fact that deprivation of life maybe involved that other rights can’t be taken away by a process which jeopardizes specific constitutional guarantees."
1971.70-57,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2676.197,2681.917,Mr. Amsterdam isn't a place where the government ordinarily contest that before the Grand Jury itself.
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2692.333,2706.325,"I have no doubt that if there were no reason to give him protection against appearing before the Grand Jury, that a perfectly proper place to explore that question would be before the Grand Jury."
1971.70-57,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.984,2742.437,"Isn't the government have to build in disadvantage in that sort of a proceeding in that the witness such as Mr. Caldwell here will have his version of what the government could get out of him first supplied by an affidavit and the government not having to have the advantage of examining, very likely simply does not know what it may get out of him?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2742.437,2762.896,"Well, that is precisely we think the implication of this Court's decisions for example in legislative investigation area, that although government is at a disadvantage in starting investigations, it may not start them in a way that has a drastic effect on the First Amendment simply on speculation."
1971.70-57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.458,2833.715,"Mr. Amsterdam, what about calling him to -- get him to put on the record what he has written in the story?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2848.496,2860.615,"Mr Justice White, I cannot deny and do not deny that it would be admissible evidence before a Grand Jury to have Mr. Caldwell come in and authenticate his story, I do not deny that."
1971.70-57,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2896.525,2899.732,"Before you get to that, let me ask you this because it may relate to it?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,2926.782,2935.723,"Well, Your Honor, do I think that the Grand Jury could or properly should subpoena the reporter?"
1971.70-57,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2995.049,3017.452,"Well, what are you pushing that anytime a court would decide that he doesn't have that -- he is authenticating his published stories would not contribute much, you can't call it, but in a lot of other circumstances you could, is that your suggestion?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3017.452,3033.713,"Alright then Mr. Justice White, actually approach what basically is that that kind of accommodative judgment is what the stand off, if you will, of the Grand Jury institution embodied in the Fifth Amendment and the First Amendment across the board."
1971.70-57,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3033.713,3041.663,"Mr. Amsterdam, is there any other group that can tell a Grand Jury or can't be subpoenaed?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3041.663,3043.822,"I am sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall, is there are any other --"
1971.70-57,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3043.822,3051.432,"Group of people in the United States, when they get a Grand Jury subpoena, can say I won't come?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3051.432,3054.623,"Oh! Yes, Your honor, there are a number of people --"
1971.70-57,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3054.623,3056.384,Who?
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3056.384,3062.094,"Well, one case is, for example, Window Glass Workers Workers case we cited in our brief."
1971.70-57,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3065.016,3066.517,"Well, you're talking about a group."
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3078.191,3091.272,"I would suppose that there were constitutional rules and I think that the First Amendment might be one of them, which might very well preclude other people from being called before the Grand Jury than reporters."
1971.70-57,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3118.867,3123.929,"Well, I am speaking about 1972?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3153.247,3162.17,"To start with that is not necessarily my point, that is not the basis -- is not the basis on which the Court of Appeals' decision rests."
1971.70-57,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3183.351,3199.212,"Well, may I ask Mr. Amsterdam, let's take this very protective order, an article which had been published in the New York Times attributing to someone, an admission that he had committed a murder."
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3210.269,3229.745,"I think with one qualification, again, Your Honor, that I think the government should have to show also unavailability of equal information could not be served, but if we put that one aside, and I am willing to put it aside because I don't need to reach it, for the purposes of this case, then I would say that the government could call it."
1971.70-57,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3229.745,3243.06,"Well, then all you are asking is, as I understand it a principle which requires a balance in which balance made in this case, opts in favor of affirmance of the Court of Appeal, that's all there is to it?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3243.06,3244.012,Precisely.
1971.70-57,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3279.82,3281.327,Let's get to this point.
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3295.547,3301.549,"On the narrow facts of this case, that's correct, but let me --"
1971.70-57,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3301.549,3327.167,"What would happen for example, if Mr. Caldwell was talking to members of the high pollutant fly people, a confidentially etcetera, and he gets subpoenaed and he says I don't have to come because whatever I heard was confidential, and the government shows, yeah, but while you were there they brought out two dead bodies."
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3327.167,3329.087,That would meet the government's burden.
1971.70-57,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3329.087,3330.109,You have no problem with it.
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3330.109,3339.788,"No problem and the Court of Appeals decision leaves that open, and the thing that has been I think totally ignored in the government's argument is Court is that that is open."
1971.70-57,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3396.54,3405.445,Then in any event you are not asking or suggesting that First Amendment in this area requires a prophylactic rule?
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3405.445,3406.303,Absolutely not.
1971.70-57,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3406.303,3409.568,"That the reporter need not, that even appeal."
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3409.568,3411.494,Absolutely not Your Honor.
1971.70-57,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3437.369,3444.943,Is it possible that the Court of Appeals had no factual basis on which to reach that conclusion?
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3444.943,3448.536,It is not possible that they had no factual basis in which to reach it --
1971.70-57,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3448.536,3454.014,"But I suppose, you would be saying that it would not be possible for us to make that conclusion on this record?"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3454.014,3465.752,"No, I think first of all, due deference to the Court of Appeals' conclusion which stated not only that it reached it on the basis of the record, but that the government had not contested it, would not permit this Court to offset the point."
1971.70-57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3577.044,3583.399,"Mr. Amsterdam, I have the Michigan Law Review version of it --"
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3583.399,3589.758,"I have the full scale study, I believe that these are available --"
1971.70-57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3589.758,3593.369,"I have that in my office, I just wanted if there was a cross page reference."
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3593.369,3599.295,"Page 69, it is at footnote, if the footnote is the same, it would be footnote 215 in that area."
1971.70-57,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3599.295,3600.123,Thank you.
1971.70-57,1,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3600.123,3616.068,"The next point that I want to make about the Blasi's study, I think demonstrates importance of not litigating fact questions in this Court, but rather sticking to the record which I think is very clear on such questions, the source reliance and chilling effect."
1971.70-57,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3676.175,3678.77,"Thank you Mr. Amsterdam, thank you Mr. Solicitor General."
