1985.84-1531,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.458,"Mr. Thiede, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,29.458,32.035,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.68,260.474,"May I ask at this point, supposing the judge... at that point there had been a lawyer sitting in the courtroom and he said,"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,269.142,273.314,I think the Michigan Supreme Court's rule would apply.
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,273.314,275.313,"I mean, under your view should--"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,275.313,277.25,"No, I don't think so."
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.25,279.217,"--You would say, then the police could still initiate interrogation?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,279.217,279.608,Exactly.
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.33,311.392,Let me just stop you there for a minute.
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,324.964,330.415,"--I would say, perhaps after the preliminary hearing, would have a different setting."
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,330.415,330.962,"Well, this is after the preliminary hearing."
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,330.962,333.571,"No, this is an initial appearance."
1985.84-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,340.679,341.881,"The case has begun, though, hasn't it?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,344.537,346.005,"--Well, I don't know."
1985.84-1531,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,346.896,347.785,There is a charge?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,347.785,350.753,"--There is an outstanding charge, we have a warrant."
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.624,368.591,"Well, suppose he shows up with a lawyer at that hearing."
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,375.509,380.132,"Yes, I think so, and I think there's some important reasons for that."
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,457.805,463.928,--You don't think it's possible to set up a procedure whereby as soon as he makes a request like that you would immediately be notified?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,465.472,472.033,"--No, I don't think so, and one problem becomes, we don't always know if they're going to get court appointed counsel."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,473.813,481.951,"What happens if the man says, I want a lawyer, my own lawyer, at this preliminary hearing."
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,483.169,486.278,At the preliminary hearing he can have a lawyer.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,487.715,490.198,"Well, then why can't he have a court appointed lawyer?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,490.198,490.479,--Hmm?
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,490.479,493.932,Why can't he have a court appointed lawyer?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,493.932,494.977,"Well, he can."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,495.32,498.928,"If he can have a paid lawyer, why can't he have a court appointed lawyer?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,498.928,506.378,"--I suppose he could, but as far as the system works, the district court judge, that's not his decision as to whether somebody is in fact indigent or not."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,521.451,524.809,"Well, when you pick him up and you give him the Miranda warnings--"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,524.809,525.043,--Hm-hmm.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,525.043,532.463,"--And you tell him you will appoint a lawyer for him, you don't appoint him until after the preliminary hearings?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,532.463,533.447,Well--
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,533.447,533.978,Is that right?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,533.978,535.431,--If I--
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,535.431,536.445,Is that correct?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,536.445,537.507,--No.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,537.507,541.554,I thought you said the Magistrate couldn't appoint him.
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,541.554,542.677,"No, the magistrate cannot."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,542.677,543.27,"Well, who can appoint him?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,543.27,550.409,"What happens, we have a different system when there's a requirement of counsel for interrogation purposes, for lineup purposes and the like."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,561.045,564.075,Is there is a list of lawyers for a preliminary hearing?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,564.075,565.372,--There is.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,571.135,573.525,I thought you said you didn't.
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,573.525,578.647,"Well, I think you are confusing two of the... the system, and how it works."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,578.647,579.616,"Am I confusing, or are you confusing?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,579.616,581.537,"I think you are, sir, with all due respect."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,615.415,617.991,And in the meantime anybody can question him?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,617.991,620.334,"--Yeah, I think so."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,621.428,627.863,"Why did you mean when you said you would appoint a lawyer for him, you meant 12 days hence?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,627.863,629.362,"--No, I think in this case--"
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,629.362,630.362,"Well, you just said so."
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,630.362,631.002,"--No, I think--"
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,631.002,633.032,Did I misunderstand that?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,633.032,635.22,"--I think we're not communicating too well, sir."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,650.119,652.056,You don't question him until he gets a lawyer?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,652.056,652.4,Right.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,653.774,654.336,Is that correct?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,654.336,655.102,--That's exactly right.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,675.953,677.577,What is this 12-day period?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,677.577,685.651,That is the time under statute that we have to bring a person for a preliminary examination to see if there is probable cause to hold him for trial.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,685.651,689.181,"You mean, during those 12 days he's not examined by the police?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,689.181,696.991,"If he has requested counsel at any time during Miranda... during custodial interrogation, he will not be questioned by police."
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,743.145,752.735,"Mr. Thiede, does Michigan also proceed sometimes by way of indictment following grand jury investigation?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,752.735,753.594,Sometimes.
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,753.594,760.716,"And then there would be no preliminary hearing, there would be a grand jury indictment, arraignment and trial?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,760.716,766.042,"When there is a grand jury indictment, there is also a right to a preliminary examination by either party."
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,766.042,768.666,But it can precede the trial?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,768.666,770.994,"Yes, it is theoretically possible."
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,770.994,774.179,"And in that circumstance, would your position be the same?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,774.179,776.194,I would think--
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,776.194,781.27,The police wanted to question after the arraignment and when counsel had been requested?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,781.27,785.285,"--I think it would have to be, for some practical reasons."
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,788.72,791.688,It would have to be... what would your position be?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,791.688,806.074,"I think our position would still have to be that it is appropriate only to preclude further interrogation when the defendant asks for counsel in a context which shows that he wants counsel during interrogation, not simply during the judicial process."
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,806.074,814.46,"I suppose it is not explained to a defendant at arraignment in Michigan that there is this difference, as you see it?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,814.46,815.381,"No, it's not."
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,834.171,850.462,"Do you think the defendant would perhaps... if unsophisticated, at least, understand that the attorney that was requested at arraignment would be an attorney that would be available to assist during questioning or a lineup or something of that--"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,850.462,853.21,"Sure, no question about that, no question about that."
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,864.174,865.612,--And they can get a confession?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,866.47,877.029,"--Well, they can get a confession if he waives counsel for that purpose, but we'll have to get a subsequent specific waiver of the right to counsel during interrogation before we can get a confession from him."
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,907.187,911.281,"What is the language used at arraignment, when the defendant is asked--"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,911.281,911.484,--Okay.
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.488,939.081,--May I interrupt with a question?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,939.081,939.502,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.502,954.402,"Supposing a particular judge or magistrate, I forget the exact title, at that particular hearing went ahead and said, by the way, I might as well also explain to you what the Miranda warnings are, and he reads him the Miranda warning and then gets all through and says, now, do you want to fill out the form."
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,958.011,965.382,"Well, I think where it's especially ambiguous, I think the police ought to have the opportunity to clarify."
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.382,967.975,Even if the judge had given him the substance of the Miranda warning?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,967.975,981.673,"That's a more difficult question, but I think that would depend on a factor... a case by case basis, as this Court has dealt with, I think it's Smith versus Illinois, the ambiguity or potential ambiguity of the request for counsel."
1985.84-1531,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.673,988.576,"You are saying the police would have... even if it's ambiguous and even if the other case is... even if he has a lawyer, you still say the police have a right to initiate--"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,988.576,1000.619,"Yes, because otherwise there's just going to be a whole host of problems, and especially, the biggest problem is you may preclude the police from the opportunity to seek a confession from a defendant who wants to confess."
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1009.802,1012.27,--I guess they can do that before arraignment.
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1015.269,1015.91,--Yes.
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1019.735,1022.594,Isn't there a period of time before arraignment?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1022.594,1022.797,--Yes.
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1024.016,1028.701,When the police clearly can go in and make an inquiry after giving Miranda rights?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1028.701,1029.341,"Yes, and typically--"
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1029.341,1036.105,And you simply want to extend that time to post-arraignment and until the preliminary hearing?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1036.105,1036.292,--Right.
1985.84-1531,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1036.292,1037.213,That's what you're saying?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1037.213,1051.458,"Right, yeah, and the typical defendant who doesn't want to give a confession is already going to have asserted his Miranda rights before we ever get to this stage, and so the police have already been precluded by Edwards from re-initiating interrogation."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1051.458,1051.8,Wait a minute.
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1058.798,1058.985,No.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1063.141,1065.249,--Didn't you say that you can ask him if he's changed his mind?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1065.249,1067.81,"--No, not under Miranda."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1077.198,1080.087,How many times can you advise him of his Miranda rights?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1080.087,1083.163,"--You can advise him a million times, if every time he waives."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1083.163,1085.615,"And all of the million times, you can ask him a question?"
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1085.615,1087.161,"Yes, if he waives every time."
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1087.161,1088.598,Is that your idea of not questioning?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1088.598,1090.238,Pardon?
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1090.238,1093.174,Is that your idea of not questioning?
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1093.174,1093.361,No.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1094.189,1097.861,"You said that if he doesn't get a lawyer, you should stop questioning."
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1097.861,1099.296,--If he asks for a lawyer.
1985.84-1531,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1099.296,1105.544,"And in the second breath you say, you continuously question about his Miranda rights."
1985.84-1531,0,18095,brian_e_thiede,,1105.544,1109.028,"Your Honor, I think, again we're not communicating because there are two separate things."
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,1775.247,1780.307,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.095,2018.697,"Well, Mr. Krogsrud, do you think that the right to counsel made available by the Miranda case under the Fifth Amendment is a more easily waived right than the right to counsel contained in the Constitution in the Sixth Amendment?"
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2018.697,2019.9,"--I do, Your Honor."
1985.84-1531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2019.9,2022.102,"Well, why should that be?"
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2022.102,2029.598,"Well, I think that it may not necessarily be in every case."
1985.84-1531,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2084.454,2092.871,"Well, but of course if an individual clearly wants to talk to the police, no matter how high the standard of waiver, that standard could be met."
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2107.943,2108.912,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.607,2332.447,"Well, counsel, suppose... suppose the defendant had not, at the arraignment said, ""I want counsel""."
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2332.447,2336.758,--He did say that in this case.
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.758,2337.821,"I know, but what if he hadn't said it?"
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2337.821,2338.851,"Well, if he had not said it--"
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.851,2341.272,"The right to counsel attached then, didn't it?"
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2341.272,2342.553,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.553,2345.318,"And he said, I don't care to have counsel appointed."
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2348.207,2350.363,I think not.
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.534,2361.764,"That's what I... that's what your argument that you're just making says, once the criminal process is really begun, the officers must stay away from him unless he goes to them?"
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2361.764,2362.81,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.81,2366.34,Whether or not he's said what he said at the arraignment?
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2366.34,2370.245,"I agree, Your Honor, unless... I will add one proviso."
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.043,2415.663,What if the defendant in this case had approached the officers?
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2415.663,2423.27,"Well, Your Honor, if we look at the Edwards analogy, there still has to be a decision--"
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.27,2429.206,I was thinking you would say that a much higher standard of waiver would be required than in Edwards.
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2429.206,2435.687,"--I agree, Your Honor, and I think in offering the Edwards analogy, we're simply saying if this Court--"
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.687,2441.372,You are asking for a good deal more than the Michigan Supreme Court gave you.
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2441.372,2442.496,"--Your Honor, the reason--"
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.496,2443.075,Aren't you?
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2443.075,2443.965,"--I am, Your Honor."
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.965,2448.978,"Yes, because they hinge their entire analysis on his request for counsel."
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2448.978,2449.947,That is correct.
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.384,2453.211,And you say that isn't even necessary to win this case?
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2453.211,2455.195,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1531,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.832,2465.862,That's the only argument you've made.
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2465.862,2478.81,"--I did that, Your Honor, and I said so at the outset because I think in looking down the road, I think you can see the value of taking the step that the Michigan Supreme Court did take."
1985.84-1531,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.81,2489.493,"Let me ask, at this hearing as it is handled in Michigan, what does the judge do if the defendant says, ""I don't want a lawyer""?"
1985.84-1531,1,31362,james_krogsrud,,2496.85,2499.239,"No, there is no careful inquiry required."
1985.84-1531,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2499.239,2513.624,Mr. Bretz.
1985.84-1531,2,38631,ronald_j_bretz,,2513.624,2515.7,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1531,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2647.711,2651.367,"You don't mean to suggest that that suspended any need for the warning, do you?"
1985.84-1531,2,38631,ronald_j_bretz,,2651.367,2663.005,"--Absolutely... well, my initial argument is that they shouldn't even have been in there giving him the warnings in the first place, under the application of the Edwards rule, the police officers."
1985.84-1531,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2669.188,2677.716,Even if they were not aware that a warning had in effect been given and that counsel was on the way?
1985.84-1531,2,38631,ronald_j_bretz,,2677.716,2683.947,"Assuming that they were not aware of that, I believe that at the point that my client advised the police that,"
1985.84-1531,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.746,2766.492,"How often does a defendant say at his arraignment, ""I don't want counsel""?"
1985.84-1531,2,38631,ronald_j_bretz,,2766.492,2770.085,"Well, Your Honor, in my experience I don't see that."
1985.84-1531,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2770.085,2772.6,You hardly ever see it?
1985.84-1531,2,38631,ronald_j_bretz,,2772.6,2774.006,"Absolutely not, even in--"
1985.84-1531,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.006,2784.673,"Well, I suppose you could argue that any police officer who knows that an arraignment has taken place should assume that he's asked for counsel?"
1985.84-1531,2,38631,ronald_j_bretz,,2784.673,2800.416,"--Exactly, and in this case the facts are... that is the Bladel case... the facts are that the interrogating officers' superior, that is, the chief investigator on the case, was in fact present at arraignment, so there's no great burden of having to read ambiguous court files, they just call the boss and he could have told him."
