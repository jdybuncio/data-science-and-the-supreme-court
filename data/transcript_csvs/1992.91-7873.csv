1992.91-7873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.958,"We'll hear argument next in number 91-7873, William Fex v. Michigan."
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,50.524,54.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7873,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,201.903,212.021,Had he been going through such a program prior to the installation of the request?
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,212.021,232.164,"No, there wasn't any opportunity because at the time that the complaint was issued... and I cannot believe that the Michigan prosecutor's office didn't have some kind of communication with the Indiana prosecutor's office and the court there."
1992.91-7873,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,244.391,246.653,"So, they were on top of him right away."
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,249.454,250.516,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-7873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.184,333.24,"That may be a policy argument, but it may be that the language of the statute makes it an argument that ought to be addressed in the Congress."
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,335.651,348.15,"--Justice Scalia, I don't think that the language of the statute is sufficiently clear."
1992.91-7873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,399.165,402.576,"I think it's a little different than that, isn't it, Mr. Payne?"
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,420.676,427.672,"He would... if he knew what he was after, he would say it's September 7 when he signed it."
1992.91-7873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,427.672,440.872,"Well, just say you're mailing a letter paying a bill, and after the bill has been paid somebody asked when did you cause that letter to be delivered."
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,443.563,444.542,I would say when it was mailed.
1992.91-7873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,444.542,445.403,Of course.
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,445.403,446.254,But I think that--
1992.91-7873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.254,453.128,"What if you knew it never got there and somebody asked you the same question, when did you cause it to be delivered?"
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,458.751,461.134,--It's kind of an unusual phraseology.
1992.91-7873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.134,461.575,--But these have been delivered.
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,464.876,465.346,Yes.
1992.91-7873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,465.346,468.007,And the only question is when did he cause it to be delivered.
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,468.007,471.66,"He caused it on September 7, and--"
1992.91-7873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,471.66,475.354,"Your argument would be a lot easier if the statute said sent, wouldn't it?"
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,475.354,476.984,"--Yes, it would be, Justice."
1992.91-7873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,476.984,480.956,Isn't that a distinction we ought to bear in mind?
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,480.956,492.775,"Yes, and it still is not clear, though, because normally you wouldn't ask somebody when did you cause your light bill to be paid."
1992.91-7873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,496.758,500.219,"But you couldn't say when did you send it here because he doesn't send it, does he?"
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,502.642,505.524,"That's correct, and I would like to point out--"
1992.91-7873,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,505.524,508.105,"And the statute doesn't say after it was delivered, does it?"
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,510.637,516.0,"--That's correct, and the emphasis should be on he, and it's on what he does."
1992.91-7873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,516.0,520.602,Don't we still have the problem that he didn't cause it to be sent?
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,527.526,530.158,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-7873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,530.158,534.362,And that's the distinction that I was trying to suggest.
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,536.752,537.764,Thank you.
1992.91-7873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.764,553.874,"Mr. Payne, you may proceed with your argument."
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,553.874,556.876,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-7873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.793,621.849,"When you mail a check, you may think you've paid it, but have you?"
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,621.849,625.321,--Well--
1992.91-7873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.321,627.151,Probably not.
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,627.151,628.884,--we're in somewhat of an--
1992.91-7873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.884,629.565,Probably not.
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,629.565,634.037,--artificial situation here because we're dealing with the--
1992.91-7873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,634.037,637.629,"For example, if you didn't have sufficient funds, do you think you've paid your bill?"
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,641.9,665.867,"--Well, Justice, if you are accepting a... an offer of a contract, the offer of a contract is accepted when it is put in the mail or when you have delivered the offer to the agent of the... or when you've delivered your acceptance to the agent of the offeror."
1992.91-7873,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,665.867,676.405,"Or if you want to comply with our time requirements, if you have a little verification that you put it in the mail on time, you are in time."
1992.91-7873,0,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,676.405,689.231,"That's correct, but the bottom line here I think is that the prison authority is the agent of the prosecutor."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1511.97,1521.778,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1577.716,1578.047,No.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1584.712,1585.342,"The inmate, of course."
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.893,1586.692,"So, when the--"
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1586.692,1588.615,--shall have caused to be delivered.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.615,1591.317,"--Right, and what is the last time he did anything to cause it to be delivered?"
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1591.317,1593.457,When he handed it to the warden.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1594.128,1596.189,"So, isn't that date he shall have caused it to be delivered?"
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1596.189,1596.69,No.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.69,1600.472,Then why doesn't the statute say after delivery if that's what it means?
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1600.472,1605.635,You can always--
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1605.635,1608.837,"See, these words are superfluous under your reading of the statute."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1608.837,1609.598,--No.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.598,1611.489,You say it doesn't mean after he shall have caused it to be delivered.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1614.591,1615.302,That's right.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.655,1623.757,But it has unnecessary words that are not needed at all.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1623.757,1624.148,--No.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.148,1629.702,And don't we generally construe statutes to avoid assuming that certain words are totally unnecessary?
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1629.702,1636.256,"Of course, but I don't quite understand what's unnecessary under this interpretation."
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.667,1637.957,"The words, have caused to be."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1637.957,1638.908,Yes.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1646.892,1648.144,It doesn't say that.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1648.144,1653.156,"Yes, it does for two reasons, Your Honor."
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.913,1694.734,"No, no, no."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1705.971,1706.882,That's right.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1709.443,1712.456,And you think that's perfectly plain.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1712.456,1718.319,That is sufficiently plain given everything in this particular case.
1992.91-7873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.194,1783.562,"Justice Stevens and say, well, by his calculation, when it isn't delivered, it's the prisoner who has caused it to be nondelivered."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1794.248,1796.54,--That's correct.
1992.91-7873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.54,1798.773,"And so, he caused it to be nondelivered."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1798.773,1800.964,"No, no."
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.193,1805.425,Nobody caused it to be delivered if it never got there.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1810.84,1811.649,No.
1992.91-7873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1821.676,1827.701,I think what you're saying is he can't cause it to be... he cannot possibly cause it to be delivered until it gets there.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1827.701,1828.88,--That is true.
1992.91-7873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.88,1833.926,He cannot possibly cause it to be delivered at a time prior to when you know it has been delivered.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1834.905,1835.726,That is true.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1835.726,1842.2,"Obviously, it has to be delivered before they can be a cause of the delivery, but once it has been delivered, you ask when did he cause it to be delivered."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1845.242,1846.093,When he--
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.093,1847.172,--after he had anything to do with it.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1847.172,1860.612,"--The phrase is he shall be brought to trial within 180 days after he shall have caused to be delivered, and that is the future perfect."
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.646,1865.917,No.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1911.067,1914.039,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1992.91-7873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.039,1915.441,"I mean, I can understand a prosecutor gets it."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1931.099,1932.882,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-7873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.943,1937.613,And inmates might be inclined to lie about something like that?
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1937.613,1938.905,Yes.
1992.91-7873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1938.905,1941.207,They've been known to lie.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1941.207,1942.529,Yes.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1951.135,1955.416,Do they... have they learned about the invention of the time stamp in Jackson County?
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1963.073,1966.942,We have learned the time stamp in Jackson County.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1966.942,1968.933,But you don't think they know how to do it in Fort Wayne.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1968.933,1977.21,"But for some strange reason, Mr. Fex did not bother walking over to our office on September 7 to have it time stamped."
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1977.21,1978.891,"Well, you're in Michigan, aren't you?"
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1982.704,1983.265,That's right.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.265,1984.725,But couldn't the Fort--
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1984.725,1985.496,That's right.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.496,1986.207,--But couldn't the Fort Wayne authorities?
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,1994.572,1997.464,That is probably some type of record keeping in this particular case.
1992.91-7873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.752,2019.537,"Well, at best your prosecution would be subject to the record keeping practices, which may be quite slovenly, of somebody in another State."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2020.278,2020.728,--Yes.
1992.91-7873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.728,2021.86,And that is not what you want to risk.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2021.86,2022.359,Yes.
1992.91-7873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2035.729,2061.844,"I suppose 99 percent of your returns from the prison where you... to which you have sent a detainer, they do have a time stamp on it as to when the prisoner gave the demand to the authorities to deliver."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2066.437,2071.413,As long as the prison bothers sending that little piece of information on.
1992.91-7873,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.206,2081.608,"Well, it always happens because the mail fails."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2081.608,2087.429,It doesn't always happen because the prison officials don't always bother sending that piece of information on.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.429,2094.065,And so that risk should be taken by the prisoner rather than negotiating with the other State.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2095.797,2099.849,"That is correct, and the reason for that is the prisoner is in the vastly better position."
1992.91-7873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2147.281,2155.436,"Do you have an obligation, as you understand the act, to send a second detainer once the judgment becomes in effect?"
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2155.436,2159.099,I don't see it as an obligation.
1992.91-7873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2162.612,2170.756,Do you think you fulfill your statutory responsibilities by sending it to the jail before the IAD even comes into effect?
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2170.756,2175.689,I don't see how there's any statutory duties.
1992.91-7873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2181.134,2185.266,"Well, I take it there's a duty to do something in order to trigger the 180-day period."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2185.266,2188.758,That is entirely on the inmate to trigger it.
1992.91-7873,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.835,2218.307,"Well, do--"
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2223.31,2223.971,Or someone does.
1992.91-7873,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.971,2227.283,--he wants to bring the defendant back for trial.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2227.283,2228.165,Yes.
1992.91-7873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2228.165,2236.901,But is it proper procedure under the act to file the detainer with the jail before the prison commitment begins?
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2236.901,2240.881,"It is proper procedure, but it's certainly not mandated."
1992.91-7873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2259.904,2261.405,It comes to into effect only when what?
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2262.967,2270.691,--It goes into effect when a detainer is filed after he has... is under a judgment of sentence.
1992.91-7873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2271.713,2289.395,"--So, then it would seem to me under a reading of the act that you... at least to be careful, you ought to file a second detainer after the judgment so that this act can... so that... at least so that the prisoner can know--"
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2289.395,2291.024,It makes a lot of sense.
1992.91-7873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2291.024,2292.916,--that a formal detainer has been filed.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2292.916,2294.496,"Well, let's put it this way."
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.797,2341.467,"Yes, but how does the prisoner know he hasn't sent it on?"
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2341.467,2349.584,"--Well, subsection (c) requires... well, he'll know."
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2358.608,2364.922,"Well, that certainly is... he has to wait the full statutory period before he has any opportunity to know."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2364.922,2365.433,"To a certain extent, that's right."
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2374.829,2379.955,You don't need an agreement on detainer statute or agreements if you can rely on that.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2379.955,2380.854,No.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.952,2415.738,"Yes, but the States have a mutual interest in working together in implementing the statute, don't they?"
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2415.738,2416.217,That's right.
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2416.217,2419.009,"If you don't cooperate with Indiana, Indiana won't cooperate with you."
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2419.009,2419.97,That's--
1992.91-7873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.97,2427.603,I would assume that the two of you have a common interest in promptly processing these requests and keeping proper records and all the rest.
1992.91-7873,1,33026,jerrold_schrotenboer,,2427.603,2429.526,--That is basically correct--
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2734.654,2750.806,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7873,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.022,2868.903,How does he initiate the process?
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2871.034,2873.017,That's correct.
1992.91-7873,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2874.316,2880.39,"So, that's what you focus on, is his act in initiating the process is the key act in whole statutory scheme."
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2880.39,2881.361,--No.
1992.91-7873,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2886.134,2887.726,You have to file a detainer with the prison I'm sure.
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2887.726,2894.92,"Well, and specifically under article III, he has to cause the transmittal of his documents, and the documents actually have to be delivered."
1992.91-7873,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2902.637,2913.312,"If you talk about the drafting history, I'm surprised they didn't follow the Oregon statute which was an equally clear model for this under your view I take it."
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2913.312,2916.674,--The Oregon statute revolved... was built around the verb receive.
1992.91-7873,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.674,2917.405,Right.
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2917.405,2929.093,And we would suggest that the problem with using the verb receive rather than the verb deliver in article III is that then you would shift the focus of article III to the prosecutor and the appropriate courts receiving it.
1992.91-7873,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.888,2939.278,"Well, but that's precisely the shift in focus which you say the drafters intended."
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2941.289,2944.201,But article III as distinguished--
1992.91-7873,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2944.201,2948.566,"That the whole scheme, rather, focused on the prisoner which would seem to focus on when he caused it to be delivered."
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2948.566,2949.467,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-7873,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3055.545,3067.432,"Mr. Seamon, is there anything in the IAD that requires a prosecutor to move promptly in order to get a prisoner back for trial?"
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3067.432,3071.226,I'm not quite sure I understand your question.
1992.91-7873,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.939,3075.21,"Well, no."
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3082.425,3086.437,Ultimately there are Sixth Amendment limitations.
1992.91-7873,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3086.437,3088.109,"Yes, but I said in the IAD."
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3088.109,3089.018,"No, there are none."
1992.91-7873,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.276,3161.797,Yes.
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3164.528,3167.871,I agree with my colleague's explanation of Houston v. Lack.
1992.91-7873,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.334,3174.713,Do you think the plain... the language in that rule is any less plain than this?
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3174.713,3186.532,--The Court construed the language of rule 4(a) to avoid an interpretation that would have effectively disastrous consequences for the prisoner in that case.
1992.91-7873,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3212.11,3219.242,"Well, the respondent strove mightily to distinguish Houston against Lack, and none of you cite it."
1992.91-7873,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3223.637,3228.139,We did not cite Houston v. Lack in our brief because we don't think it's apposite.
1992.91-7873,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3238.517,3240.066,"Thank you, Mr. Seamon."
1992.91-7873,3,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,3242.55,3245.563,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-7873,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3263.111,3271.018,Do you disagree that the detainer could have been filed before the sentencing?
1992.91-7873,3,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,3277.833,3283.955,"Well, the detainer may have been filed."
1992.91-7873,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.143,3308.612,"Sure, but you say... the prosecutor isn't in control if it isn't up to him whether this whole statute shall be called into play by the filing of a detainer which is the first step that triggers it or that lets the prisoner trigger it."
1992.91-7873,3,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,3308.612,3315.568,"--Well the complaint, Justice Scalia, comes from the same place as the detainer would."
1992.91-7873,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.994,3348.169,"Of course, that complaint can be filed before he knows... before the prosecutor knows that the person is even arrested anywhere else."
1992.91-7873,3,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,3351.662,3359.546,"--No, Justice Scalia, because... at least not in the--"
1992.91-7873,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3359.546,3369.574,"All the statute says is whenever during the continuance of a term of imprisonment, there is pending in any other party State any untried indictment, information, or complaint."
1992.91-7873,3,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,3376.616,3379.481,"--Yes, I would have to agree with you on that."
1992.91-7873,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3379.481,3380.159,Okay.
1992.91-7873,3,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,3380.93,3385.913,"But still it comes from the prosecutor's office, and the prosecutor doesn't know--"
1992.91-7873,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3385.913,3390.587,"--Well, yes, but he doesn't know that he's triggering... that he's beginning anything under this detainer statute."
1992.91-7873,3,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,3411.36,3416.063,"--At least in Michigan, the complaint would have to be signed by the prosecutor."
1992.91-7873,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3416.063,3416.594,No.
1992.91-7873,3,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,3419.886,3447.355,"My understanding of the detainer... now, the Court ruled... has ruled that a probation violation is not a detainer, and if I am not... it's my understanding... now, I don't work for the prosecutor's office, and I'm not completely up on how this paperwork is processed."
1992.91-7873,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3586.654,3589.506,Could I ask you another question about the text here?
1992.91-7873,3,32300,john_b_payne_jr,,3641.952,3644.946,"--May I respond to that, Mr. Chief Justice?"
