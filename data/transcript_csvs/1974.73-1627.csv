1974.73-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.038,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1627, Lefkowitz against Newsome."
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,39.17,43.271,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,172.36,175.98,"Now, what did he appeal from, the loitering conviction as well as the other one?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,175.98,189.327,He appealed from both the loitering conviction and the conviction of attempted possession of a dangerous drug.
1974.73-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,190.362,197.976,"Is that a -- attempted possession is a -- at least its novel to me, is that what you just --"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,197.976,201.132,It's a perhaps a theoretical offense.
1974.73-1627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,223.866,235.522,You see it quite recently -- quite frequently in New York and I don't see anywhere else attempted possession and attempted manslaughter when indeed it is conceded that there was a killing and so on?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,235.522,238.958,Well this is -- as I pointed out as vehicle for allowing the plea to a reduced charge.
1974.73-1627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,238.958,242.676,"The New York peculiarity, right?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,242.676,266.14,"I should point out Your Honor, that there are analogous provisions of the now criminal procedural law to permit the review of convictions where there has been a pretrial motion to suppress a confession or to invalidate an identification under the Wade rules."
1974.73-1627,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,266.14,271.572,What's open on that appeal so far as the appellate division in the Court of Appeals are concerned?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,271.572,279.978,The appellate court may review the denial of the suppression motion notwithstanding the plea of guilty.
1974.73-1627,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.405,296.061,"And what does it do if it decides that the decision on the suppression motion was erroneous, does it reverse the denial of the motion or does it reverse the conviction?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,296.061,301.485,"It -- the appellate court reverses the conviction, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.73-1627,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,301.485,306.874,Is this procedure open if the defendant made no motion to suppress?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,306.874,312.053,The statute requires that a motion to suppress be made otherwise the --
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,312.053,313.698,And overruled?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,313.698,314.609,"I beg your pardon, sir."
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.609,316.034,And overruled.
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,316.034,331.421,"And overruled otherwise, there is no right to take an appeal and the matter is waived even at a trial should the defendant plead not guilty."
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,331.421,335.18,But I gather in this case when that went up to the appellate division?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,335.18,336.19,"To the appellete term, Your Honor."
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.19,343.313,"Appellate term, the decision turned on the issue of constitutionality of the loitering statute, is it?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,343.313,345.25,The appellate term never reached that issue.
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,359.854,364.059,And did it also decide the motion to suppress was improperly overruled?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,364.059,364.7,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,374.317,375.127,Right.
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,375.127,387.699,"At that point a certificate for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals was sought and denied and this Court itself in February 1972, denied a petition for certiorari."
1974.73-1627,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,387.699,389.15,Let me ask you one other question?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,402.526,410.283,"If the defendant had then gone on to trial and was convicted after a trial, we would have a totally different situation."
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,419.926,422.637,It does form a barrier to state review?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,422.637,423.787,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,424.423,427.759,"It's a created state review, created by the state?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,427.759,428.549,Exactly and of course --
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,428.549,432.399,And now the state says but he can't -- because of that he can't use the federal court?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,432.399,444.503,"Well Your Honor, under Lego against Twomey the states are always free to be more generous than -- more generous than the federal constitution requires and this we suggest is what happened."
1974.73-1627,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,473.978,479.962,Do you think there's any validity in your opponents argument about this being a trap for the unwary?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,479.962,480.664,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1627,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.644,528.997,I presume if we reverse that judgment of the Court of Appeals at least there will thereafter be no trap for the unwary?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,528.997,531.515,Absolutely.
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,727.321,738.758,"Can you read McMann as relying on the fact that under the state procedure there was -- this was final, the guilty plea?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,738.758,740.484,We submit Your Honor that the --
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.484,743.144,Was that true in McMann?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,743.144,752.023,"As I understand the McMann plea Your honor, McMann's plea --"
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.023,754.543,Waived everything in the state court?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,754.543,755.544,That's correct.
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,755.544,758.54,And that's not true here?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,761.633,762.87,"In McMann, of course the Court --"
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.87,766.6,Well isn't that a difference?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,766.6,772.287,"Of course in McMann, the Court reserved the precise question that we have at bar today."
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,799.726,811.354,That even where the state changes its whole procedure the state could not by any means create a situation where you could get a discord.
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,811.354,813.377,"Well, of course, Your Honor that the states --"
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,813.377,814.908,It didn't go that far?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,814.908,818.581,"But the state's procedure, I would submit is not relevant."
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.388,841.058,What case do you have for that?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,841.058,843.323,"Well, we have Tollett."
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,848.493,851.68,Tollett didn't have this type of statute?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,851.68,852.951,"That maybe so, Your Honor."
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,852.951,858.375,That's my point is that did the statute create a difference -- that's all (Inaudible).
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,858.375,862.583,All the statute created Your Honor was a right to a state appeal.
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,867.276,877.342,"If you therefore say that this conviction is not in and of itself not appealable, it said just the opposite."
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,878.864,882.092,"That's correct Your Honor, not withstanding the plea of guilty appealable in the state courts."
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,882.092,883.884,Yeah.
1974.73-1627,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.884,903.485,"I take at your point is that McMann and Tollett didn’t turn on anybody voluntarily giving up a claim to habeas corpus, but rather on a fact that after you pleaded guilty and admitted the substantive developments of the offense, as a matter of federal law you're not entitled to raise afterwards certain claims on habeas?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,903.485,906.099,"This is precisely our contention, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.73-1627,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.099,910.072,"So, it has nothing to do with whether New York grants appeals by statute?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,910.072,919.396,"Precisely, the state legislature never considered the problem and indeed they could not by its own legislative action, possibly effective."
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.685,941.537,But I take it you're saying that the state's position is that sustaining the position you urge today would not subvert the legislative aims in New York in providing this appeal of suppression motion?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,941.537,947.6,"Absolutely, the legislative aims of New York are merely to grant a state appeal."
1974.73-1627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,951.102,964.502,And I suppose the policy ground underlying that or at least one of them is to eliminate a lot of not guilty pleas that are unnecessary and a lot of trials that are unnecessary?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,964.502,965.539,That's correct.
1974.73-1627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,965.539,975.283,The person's only defense in other words his basic only defense is the Fourth Amendment claim.
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,978.19,979.596,That's correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,979.596,997.017,"And your view is I know that our agreeing with you in this case wouldn't subvert that policy, although it's arguable that it would, wouldn't it because it would cause more arguably -- it went to cause more not guilty pleas in the state system?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,997.017,1003.149,I suggest Your Honor that there is absolutely no evidence in the record that this would be the case.
1974.73-1627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1003.149,1003.649,"Well, I wouldn't."
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1008.671,1014.081,"I think Your Honor if we have to speculate, the answer has to be in the negative."
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1045.551,1049.185,"It wasn't the real reason for the plea bargaining, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1049.185,1049.78,Precisely.
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1049.78,1051.25,"That's what you said, I thought."
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1051.25,1052.553,In this instance I know it can be --
1974.73-1627,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1052.553,1054.171,I mean for the statute itself.
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1054.171,1064.468,"It can be demonstrated that it was provident, the plea was provident because the man reduced his exposure to imprisonment from one year to three months."
1974.73-1627,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1064.468,1067.766,And then the state would save the expense and trouble of a trial?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1067.766,1068.865,Precisely.
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.865,1078.797,"Whose views are we suppose to take this as to the legislative purpose or expectations, yours or the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1097.938,1104.152,That is the essentially the gist of the opinion below I would submit however --
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.152,1115.324,It frequently happens at federal that you -- that federal court has to decide what it believes the statute means and it isn't necessarily bound by the views of the Attorney General of New York?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1115.324,1118.389,No Your Honor we don't --
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.389,1120.79,How about us?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1133.096,1174.214,"The legislative intent of course we contend will not affect the jurisdiction of the District Court since the legislature couldn’t do it, but I would suggest Your Honor that the whole purpose of these statues was to provide a statutory remedy to enforce the mandate of this Court in cases such as Jackson against Denno with respect to confessions, Mapp against Ohio with respect to suppression of physical evidence and the way Gilbert and Stovall with respect to identifications."
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1191.188,1196.746,Well that to say the inquiry is to what that purpose was is irrelevant to the issue here --
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1196.746,1197.955,Absolutely Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1197.955,1211.043,"-- that the issue here is if our Tollett and are we ready to suggest or not, the plea of guilty foreclosed on the search and seizure issue any resort to federal habeas?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1211.043,1211.167,Precisely.
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1211.167,1223.589,"While there never may have been the case and whatever the reason the New York legislation want to do it that that if the -- one plead guilty wants to do it he may take the suppression issue on appeal with the appellate court, is that it?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1223.589,1227.911,Precisely Your Honor.
1974.73-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1227.911,1229.876,Did you want to answer Mr. Justice Brennan further?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1229.876,1231.894,I answered him Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1231.894,1255.874,"Is there -- so far as New York is concerned and the prosecution problem, if fallacy question that this statute gives the prosecutor greater flexibility to deal for example with first offenders or less offensive cases by this device of attempted possession?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1255.874,1261.655,I think in practical terms this is the net effect.
1974.73-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1261.655,1275.725,And if you wouldn't to be likely to do this with a man that three prior convictions for possession of heroin as much you would a 20-year old fellow who is up on first offense?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1275.725,1282.478,"I should think not Your Honor, but then this would be in the particular discretion of the individual district attorney, there might be other mitigating factors."
1974.73-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1282.478,1292.51,I find this that there is a fallacy factor possibly working here to give the prosecutor this greater discretion?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1292.51,1297.023,Such a view I think is perfectly consistent with the statue.
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1298.855,1306.904,"I gather, am I right that after this case I guess it was judge -- then Judge Bartle, denial leave to appeal, was isn't it from --"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1306.904,1307.752,That's correct.
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1307.752,1310.686,"And then after that the Berck case cases was decided, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1310.686,1310.793,That's correct.
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1310.793,1315.428,"It declared the loitering statue unconstitutional on federal constitutional grounds, wasn't it?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1315.428,1315.885,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1315.885,1317.448,And by that time he was out of lucky.
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1321.309,1324.173,"No, Your Honor. Corum nobus would not be available because although --"
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1324.173,1328.577,"So he has no resort in taking advantage of Berck at all, does he?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1328.577,1343.235,"I should think so, because we are dealing had even convicted of loitering, the State Court of Appeals decision in People against Tenenbaum would have required a retroactive application of the substantive law."
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1350.272,1353.573,Well anyway the loitering conviction on a different ground was set aside?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1353.573,1354.591,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-1627,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1354.591,1356.127,Yeah.
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1356.127,1379.751,"What about this, suppose there is an appeal for the suppression, motion that has been denied and only appeal then [Voice Overlap] in the state as the New York law permits, and it's decided one way or another in the supreme -- in the Court of Appeals in New York, let's assume that, does petition for cert lie here?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1379.751,1385.506,Of course it's under Section 1257.
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.506,1398.366,"Well, assume the denial of the suppression issue is affirmed and the -- and you think the defendant at that point get the petition for cert here?"
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1398.366,1408.169,"Of course, because of this Court's jurisdiction to review the decisions of the highest state court in which the issue could be heard."
1974.73-1627,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.169,1413.424,We would take jurisdiction to that case although we would say a District Court would not?
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1413.424,1439.695,"That's correct because the statute gives this Court the right to hear the case whereas it is our submission that the statue denies the District Court the right to hear it on collateral attack, simply because the plea of guilty eliminates any case or controversy within the jurisdiction of that court."
1974.73-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1441.493,1446.453,"Yes, you have a few minutes if you wish to reserve it."
1974.73-1627,0,39505,robert_s_hammer,,1446.453,1450.327,With the permission of the Court I should.
1974.73-1627,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1450.327,1452.64,"Very well, Mr. Hammer."
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1456.573,1459.647,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.14,1566.873,You don't agree with Mr. Hammer then that the states maybe more generous without suffering any penalty for it?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1566.873,1577.802,"No, the states can always be more generous, in terms of defining the perimeters of constitutional rights as I'll say under the aegis of state constitutions."
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.708,1636.999,"Well what if in McMann, there had been a pretrial suppression motion that had been denied, the present New York statue not being in existence?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1636.999,1637.702,Correct.
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1637.702,1639.42,And then a guilty plea?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1639.42,1642.55,Well that have would put in exactly posture of this case.
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.489,1672.467,"Yeah, but my question is prior to 813-c, what if they litigated in the trial court lost and then pleaded guilty?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1672.467,1680.249,And pleaded during the trial under state law at that time state appellate review of that confession claim would have been thought.
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.249,1681.981,The question is would federal habeas has been --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1681.981,1683.124,Yes.
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.124,1686.942,"Well then, but then that's in direct contrary to McMann?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1686.942,1689.272,"No, perhaps I misunderstood your question."
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.272,1693.141,Well let me repeat my question if I may.
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1709.268,1712.824,"No, he does not."
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.933,1760.152,You see McMann until that then is turning on a notion waiver within the state system?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1760.152,1769.228,"That is correct, within in the context of the state procedural rule which setup the requirements for litigating constitutional claims."
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.288,1808.363,"I suppose if the Congress did not pass the statute, and said that federal habeas will not be available in circumstances which is described that would fit the New York statute, there's no question that then federal habeas wouldn't be available?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1808.363,1809.489,"No, of course not."
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.489,1816.089,"And so you're -- what you really are saying that in this particular case, this person didn't think he was waiving his federal habeas right?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1816.089,1828.979,"Well not only that, but there's nothing in the habeas corpus statute to suggest that a trial as opposed to a plea if the only way of preserving the issue for subsequent habeas corpus review."
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.979,1837.454,"Well, I suppose habeas corpus still turns on whether there has been denial of some federal right?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1837.454,1838.991,"Yes, but what I'm saying is that --"
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.991,1841.995,It may have been some denial state rights but their --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1841.995,1843.476,"No, no."
1974.73-1627,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1867.226,1877.008,"I suppose you are saying Mr. Neustater that pre-813, the only way of state procedures you could preserve this constitutional Fourth Amendment claim is by going through trial?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1877.008,1878.981,Correct.
1974.73-1627,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1878.981,1881.148,And then you go away as far as you could go --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1881.148,1882.241,Pursue your appeal.
1974.73-1627,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1882.241,1883.796,Then you can come in to federal habeas?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1883.796,1884.132,That is correct.
1974.73-1627,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1884.132,1887.595,"Now New York said no, there is another way you can preserve."
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1887.595,1888.044,"Correct, exactly."
1974.73-1627,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1888.044,1892.815,You can plea guilty and take a prior appellate route?
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.815,1902.748,"But is that entirely true as to the pre 813-c practice in New York, you certainly had a motion to suppress in the trial court before 813-c was enacted?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1902.748,1903.609,"Oh, yes."
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.033,1935.096,"Was that true as to Fourth Amendment claims too, there is no --"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1935.096,1943.697,"Well there was never really that bind with Fourth Amendment claims for the simple reasons that almost immediately after Mapp came down, the state enacted 813-c."
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1946.79,1950.741,Well then it was 813-c in existence at the time that McMann was decided?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1950.741,1958.28,"Yes, but it did not extent to confessions, it only extended to physical evidence sought to be suppressed on Fourth Amendment ground."
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.28,1962.569,Of course McMann didn't say the result would be different under the New York procedures?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,1962.569,1963.411,"No, of course not."
1974.73-1627,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.043,2049.568,"I should have asked Mr. Hammer, how did the attorney general get into it as product, where, is goes straight?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2049.568,2058.746,"No, he got in at the appellate term level in this case, appellate term being one of the intermediate appellate courts that determines misdemeanor appeals."
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.062,2164.908,Do you think it was clear in those cases if they ever were advised that they would be giving up habeas as well as the state remedies?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2164.908,2167.795,The neither opinion addresses itself to that.
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.795,2173.533,"When you should suggest as they did, maybe they are now quite the opposite?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2173.533,2199.783,"No, of course it was also as I recall one of the closing portions of Mr. Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Tollet was that if that the defendant was -- as a matter of fact in your opinion as well in McMann, if the defendant was somehow mis-advised as to the forum which he should first present the claim, he might have another habeas petition with competence of counsel."
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.04,2270.295,"Another topic, you want to go and waiver?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2274.99,2279.622,Well for the record doesn't demonstrate a particular -- articulate expectations of habeas corpus.
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.622,2280.92,Assume he had one.
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2284.988,2289.219,Well of course the Second Circuit -- the extent Second Circuit law at the time.
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.219,2292.706,Well -- at the time he pleaded McMann was decided?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2292.706,2294.138,"No, No."
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.918,2302.617,"If you read the case, so the question was open?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2306.913,2307.973,Well --
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.973,2312.354,And there's never been anything else indicated here?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2312.354,2313.845,"No, well I think --"
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2313.845,2317.648,"Well isn't that so, well you disagreed said that McMann said the question was open?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2317.648,2318.719,"Yes, that is true."
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.719,2322.299,Well what the legitimate expectation did he have about federal habeas?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2322.299,2324.903,That the state would not say it's foreclosed to him.
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.903,2329.612,"Alright, that the state wasn't but how about ultimate federal law?"
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2329.612,2340.653,"All the state promised him in 813-c was he has right to take that thing to whether the appellate term or The Court of The Appeals, they certainly didn't promise and that they would not oppose the federal habeas."
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2340.653,2351.726,No but isn't that -- rather is it that statute rather pregnant with the suggestion that we have no expectation that your plea has terminated litigation of the claim.
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.726,2358.313,"It is a not a state law question, that's a federal law question and if you met McMann, you would know the question is open?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2358.313,2361.039,Well I'd like to get into that now.
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.449,2375.078,You are suggesting that it doesn’t?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2375.078,2376.91,"No, not for a minute."
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.782,2433.804,Well within the state system but it certainly doesn't determine what federal --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2433.804,2438.131,This is true but the entire federal habeas corpus statute is tied into state procedures.
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.131,2449.847,"Would you concede that if McMann footnote had said in further more even in New York the plea of guilty waives any resort here, you wouldn't be here?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2449.847,2450.803,Absolutely not.
1974.73-1627,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.803,2453.088,"Well McMann didn't say that, it said it's open?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2453.088,2455.885,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2455.885,2458.796,"The law of your circuit was clear, it wasn’t open?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2458.796,2461.577,"It was very clear in the law of the circuit, certainly."
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2461.577,2463.524,How many other States have --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2463.524,2467.062,"Well, right now Wisconsin has an identical statute."
1974.73-1627,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2490.523,2491.864,Washington too though?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2491.864,2492.393,Excuse me?
1974.73-1627,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.393,2494.804,"Washington, the state of Washington?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2494.804,2495.322,Is it in Washington?
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2496.705,2497.678,And California has --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2497.678,2501.18,California has something like -- that's a slightly different arrangement.
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2501.18,2507.209,And what have the federal habeas corpus courts held with respect to those state statues --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2507.209,2513.349,"Well, there's a case right now I believe pending in the Seventh Circuit with respect to a Wisconsin defendant --"
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2513.349,2513.686,And you say that's McMann --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2513.686,2516.774,And that's being held in abeyance pending the outcome of this case.
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2516.774,2518.341,Any other litigation?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2518.341,2519.373,Well in the Ninth Circuit case --.
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2519.373,2521.796,I mean any other circuit is really what I'm asking?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2521.796,2530.907,"In the Ninth Circuit Van B. Smith about I guess it's about a year ago now, held the other way although there is quite a distinction in the state procedure."
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2532.795,2534.274,That is at all the California ones?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2534.274,2536.217,That is correct.
1974.73-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2536.217,2570.101,"You speak Mr. Neustadter of this being an alluring matter for the defendant if the state is -- the implication I got at least was the state is alluring in and then springs the trap, I think you used that term but as one of the justices has pointed out that this is a very alluring sort of thing for him to get off on three months instead of a year plus what he might have got."
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2570.101,2573.425,The same would hold true in non 813-c context.
1974.73-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.175,2586.777,"Well but in ordinary plea negotiations, you do not have the element of this statute intervening."
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2586.777,2605.903,"No but what that suggests is that the state wants that plea so badly that they are going to give another little goody to the defendant not only do you get a break in terms of the length of the sentence, but we're going to allow you to appeal any pre-plea motions you've litigated, that’s how badly New York wants those guilty pleas."
1974.73-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2605.903,2613.862,Well you see it I suppose from that view naturally the state sees it from other views?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2613.862,2619.504,I haven't heard the other view expressed but presumably Mr. Hammer have something to say --.
1974.73-1627,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2619.504,2636.297,"Mr. Neustadter you haven't yet come at it, maybe I just was interested that the state's attorney general says that this plea of guilty in the face of that statute forecloses you ever getting to federal habeas corpus."
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2640.288,2641.132,"I know, that seems to --"
1974.73-1627,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2641.132,2645.529,"Then you get in a federal forum, I do not understand that."
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2645.529,2648.022,Well neither do I.
1974.73-1627,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2648.022,2650.893,If it keeps you out of a federal court.
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2650.893,2675.706,"I can explain that anomalous position it seems to me that if you concede as the petitioner has that certiorari review, it remains open not withstanding the plea, and by the way that the New York procedure on a cert case here, on a motion is suppress in Sibron commended itself to a footnote in Sibron, you know the Court was perfectly aware that they were taking a case on cert notwithstanding a plea."
1974.73-1627,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2698.037,2699.506,"Well on the contrary, he hasn't tried to."
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2704.577,2719.972,And 2254 says the same thing with respect to habeas corpus but I don't think we can ignore the fact that the touchstone of habeas corpus in 2254 (d) are state procedures.
1974.73-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2777.9,2804.007,"Well going back to this alluring prospect again, if you prevail, the prospect certainly will not any longer be so alluring because it will mean that the state must having made this bargain as you put it, then the defendant having had his cake now can go into the Federal District Court and the Court of Appeals and then come up here."
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2810.313,2828.688,"I think New York State has found for the contrary because in 1970, 813-c, when the whole criminal code of New York was redrafted, reenacted 813-c in the face of those three Second Circuit decisions which had already allowed habeas relief."
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2847.436,2852.291,You have 813-c and then you have an analog for -- to test the voluntariness of the --.
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2852.291,2853.488,That is correct.
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2853.488,2855.098,Any thing else?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2855.098,2859.133,"I.D., identification cases, Wade-Gilbert problems."
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2859.133,2859.493,So you --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2859.493,2863.909,"That can be litigated pretrial plead, appeal and so on, that is correct."
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2866.065,2871.375,And all of those reenacted in 1970?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2871.375,2871.799,Yes --
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2871.799,2872.941,In the light of the second --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2872.941,2885.032,"As a matter of fact I think before 1970 before this new statute, you could not plea, you could not litigate a way Gilbert issue plead and then appeal, that you have to go to trial for."
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2885.032,2885.994,That is was added in 1970?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2885.994,2887.028,That was added.
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2888.886,2905.81,"McMann itself wasn't decided until May 4, 1970, so whatever the New York legislature may have had in mind in 1970 in view of Second Circuit cases, It wouldn’t be Second Circuit cases that had been considered in the light of McMann, would it?"
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2905.81,2911.425,Four years have past since McMann and not creature is stirring in the legislature with respect with the changing statute.
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2911.425,2927.835,Well you said a moment ago that the New York legislature in the teeth of these three Second Circuit cases nonetheless chose to reaffirm or re-enact it but if they didn't know about McMann at the that time that that isn’t the quite the same thing.
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2927.835,2932.354,"Well in the four years that have elapsed since McMann, they could have modified their view accordingly."
1974.73-1627,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2932.354,2942.945,Well true but the consideration they gave it in 1970 sounds to me a little -- ought to be a little bit different factually than you intimated a moment ago?
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2942.945,2964.922,"Well I can't point to legislative documents to say what they considered and what they don't, I’m simply drawing an inference from the existence of very clear pronouncements by the Second Circuit with respect to New York statutes and I'm drawing the further inference that state legislatures that was made up 60% of lawyers at least a few of them were aware of this decisions."
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2964.922,2965.801,They have reenacted --
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2965.801,2966.998,And reenacted in anyway.
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2966.998,2968.553,Because of the Second Circuit law.
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2968.553,2968.776,No.
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2968.776,2969.676,In spite of the Second Circuit law.
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2969.676,2970.339,Yes that's precisely the point.
1974.73-1627,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2970.339,2971.939,That’s the point.
1974.73-1627,1,41820,stanley_neustadter,,2973.479,2977.068,Yes.
1974.73-1627,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.498,3075.541,Thank you Mr. Neustadter.
1974.73-1627,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3078.974,3079.841,Mr. Hammer --
1974.73-1627,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3079.841,3079.949,Yes sir.
1974.73-1627,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3079.949,3096.519,"-- before you start with you reply, I was interested in the fact that counsel for correspondents spent a good deal of his time arguing the benefits to the state of New York this statute in that it encourages guilty pleas."
1974.73-1627,2,39505,robert_s_hammer,,3104.54,3130.941,"I would submit Your Honor that the while the statute thus confer reciprocal benefits upon both the people and the defendant, however, the considerations underlying the enactment of such a statute are in view completely immaterial to the legal question at bar and that is what is the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court?"
1974.73-1627,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3355.307,3355.995,Thank you gentlemen.
