1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.899,"We will hear arguments next in Richmond Newspapers, Incorporated, against Virginia."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,48.033,52.387,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,227.455,231.726,Was this trial held in the same courtroom as the prior trials?
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,231.726,233.016,"It was, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.488,247.398,Where is Hanover County?
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,247.398,251.776,"It's some miles from Richmond, and it's a rural county."
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,261.687,265.687,"Well, some -- that's like, most places are some miles --"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,265.687,270.227,"I'm afraid I have not been in Hanover County, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,329.476,332.217,"Well, I thought the court had to decide."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,332.217,333.613,"It's in the court's discretion, that's right."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.965,348.521,"It's not automatically closed, is it?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,348.521,349.486,"No, not automatically closed, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,349.486,353.48,"If the defendant asks that it be closed, and the prosecutor doesn't object."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,353.48,355.762,No the trial judge still has discretion to decide.
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.988,522.51,"We have appellant jurisdiction, whether the statute is invalid on its face or whether it's invalid as applied, do we not?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,522.51,530.889,"I think in this case, invalidity as construed and as enforced, is all that we claim, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,530.889,532.042,That's enough.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,532.042,533.636,That's certainly enough.
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,567.03,584.393,"Going to the matter of breadth, Mr. Tribe, tell me whether I correctly gathered from what you said before, that you're not arguing that never under any circumstances or conditions can a part of a trial be closed?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,584.393,587.119,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice; a part of a trial."
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,595.486,605.858,"Well, can you imagine circumstances in which a total public audience of 40 can be seated and a hundred others want to get in, but they would have to stand around the edges."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,610.427,611.348,"Certainly, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,920.803,923.541,Do you think the burden is heavier on the trial than --
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,923.541,925.781,"I should think it would be very much heavier, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,943.409,952.606,"Well, now, Mr. Tribe, you would agree I suppose that the statute did authorize a trial judge in this case to do precisely what he did?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,952.606,953.838,"Yes, we think he probably did."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,953.838,962.621,"And therefore your claim is that the statute, at least as applied in this case, is -- violates the United States Constitution."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,962.621,963.649,Exactly.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,963.649,972.841,And I -- it's not clear to me in what you're now telling us just what provision of the constitution it violates as applied in this case.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,972.841,976.427,"Well, I think that it violates the Sixth Amendment and the First and the Fourteenth Amendment."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.427,982.338,"Well, the Sixth Amendment was -- claim was disposed of in the Gannett case, was it not?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,982.338,984.713,"Well, the Sixth Amendment claim as to pretrial proceedings, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,984.713,989.41,"Well, the Sixth Amendment talks about in all criminal prosecutions."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,989.41,991.373,That's correct.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,991.985,1002.707,"Insofar as there was reliance by the petitioners -- or the appellants, whoever they were--in the Gannett case, the Sixth Amendment claim was disposed of."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1002.707,1007.177,I believe that the Sixth Amendment has not yet been held applicable at all by this Court to pretrial proceedings.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1007.177,1013.423,"Well, the Sixth Amendment by its own terms talks about all criminal prosecution; does it not?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1013.423,1014.673,"Yes, it does."
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1060.188,1063.676,"So you say most of the opinion was dictum, then?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1063.676,1066.71,I'm afraid a good bit of it.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1066.71,1070.213,"Well, there was reliance in the Gannett case on the Sixth Amendment."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1070.213,1071.237,"That's correct, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1071.237,1073.325,And that argument was rejected.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1073.325,1076.292,As to pretrial suppression hearings.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1076.292,1079.163,"Well, the Sixth Amendment talks about all criminal prosecutions."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1089.139,1089.596,And as to the --
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1089.596,1090.455,-- upon the accused.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1090.455,1090.836,That's correct.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1090.836,1105.084,"And that therefore, as the Gannett case I thought said, just -- that the Sixth Amendment self-evidently applies only to criminal cases, and confers rights only upon the accused."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1105.084,1108.818,"Mr. Justice, you are surely the authority on what Gannett said and meant."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1135.874,1139.903,"Well, the opinion might have been a good deal shorter had there not been a dissenting opinion, too."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1139.903,1142.145,"Well, I'm sure that's so."
1979.79-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1142.145,1144.965,"Mr. Tribe, may I just pursue this thought for a little bit further on."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1158.382,1161.663,I found no suggestion in this Court's cases either way on that issue.
1979.79-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1161.663,1163.784,"You don't suggest that we would so hold, do you?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1163.784,1164.513,I really don't know.
1979.79-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1171.856,1176.138,"Well, what one word in the majority opinion lends support to that notion?"
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1176.138,1176.613,Or a sentence.
1979.79-243,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1176.613,1177.692,Not a single word.
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1177.692,1178.924,Not a word.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1178.924,1180.465,I certainly don't press it.
1979.79-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.158,1184.897,I understand your distinction in First Amendment terms.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1190.386,1191.565,Well the reason I would --
1979.79-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1191.565,1192.956,Insofar as it relates to the Sixth Amendment.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1192.956,1193.381,I understand.
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.197,1231.207,"Well, when you say a trial, Mr. Tribe, I take it you exclude side bar conferences, chambers discussion as to suppression --"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1231.207,1231.426,That's right.
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1231.426,1232.602,-- that arise during trial.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1234.495,1238.515,Reception of evidence intended to be received by the jury.
1979.79-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.515,1246.544,"Mr. Tribe, surely, did you rely -- I know you rely here, and I assume you relied in the Virginia courts, on the First Amendment as well."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1246.544,1247.465,I'm about to turn to that.
1979.79-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.465,1247.722,"Well, I hope you will."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1247.722,1249.631,Because I think it's a stronger argument.
1979.79-243,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1249.631,1249.968,"Well, yes."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1249.968,1262.949,"The First Amendment, even if one reads the Sixth Amendment as completely inapplicable and conferring no rights whatever on the public, it sheds an important light on the First Amendment claim."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1292.785,1296.307,"Now, are your clients the general public, or are they members of the press?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1296.307,1299.948,The clients are two reporters and a newspaper.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1304.103,1309.766,"But they're not the general public they're specific members of the press, are they not?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1309.766,1313.042,"Of the press, and at the same time, they are citizens and members of the public."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1313.042,1315.743,"Well, certainly so are you, so am I."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1315.743,1316.741,Correct.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1329.079,1332.807,But you might not have the same case.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1332.807,1335.513,I think we'd have the same First Amendment argument.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1343.165,1349.715,"Well, are you distressed about the First Amendment, which gives separate and specific protection to the press?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1349.715,1349.851,No.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1350.889,1353.499,"It's there in the First Amendment, whether we like it or not."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1353.499,1354.88,And I think it's terrific.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1383.844,1385.713,"That, too, was held in Gannett, was it not?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1385.713,1387.699,That's right.
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1388.882,1403.003,"Mr. Tribe, if you had a professor at the law school nearby who wanted to come to listen so that he could lecture on the subject --"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1403.003,1404.511,Into this Court?
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1404.511,1406.834,"No, not this one, the Hanover Court."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1406.834,1408.536,Ah-hah.
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1408.536,1420.473,"And would he then have a nexus with the First Amendment rights about speech, if he was going to make this lecture, based on what he observed?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1420.473,1426.717,I don't think that inquiry into the way the information will be used is either necessary or --
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1426.717,1427.63,I'm just pursuing --
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1427.63,1429.285,I think he certainly would.
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1429.285,1429.804,I'm just pursuing --
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1429.804,1431.254,Even though he's not a member of the press.
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1431.254,1439.64,"-- that was suggested, is there any difference to whether the man's going to use the information to write something or to go out and make a speech about it2?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1439.64,1440.589,No.
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1440.589,1442.224,If he's just going to maintain silence.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1442.224,1448.632,"Or if he's simply going to educate himself with it, and use it to be a more intelligent voter on all kinds of matters."
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1521.241,1523.437,"Well, what -- you talk about the First Amendment, Mr. Tribe."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1536.196,1553.573,"Well, under the First Amendment standards that I think appropriate in this case, a showing of some compelling need, which could be served only by the closure of a trial and without which, some equally transcendent value would be compromised would suffice."
1979.79-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.573,1555.378,"Well, at least it wasn't here."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1555.378,1563.695,"One isn't even close to the line here, and it's for that reason that attempting to articulate the precise circumstances on a record of this kind --"
1979.79-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.695,1566.946,"Well, I don't want to get you into too much trouble, but what about Gannett?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1566.946,1567.852,Gannett itself?
1979.79-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.283,1575.288,On the First Amendment.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1575.288,1575.385,I think on --
1979.79-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.385,1576.043,On the First Amendment.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1576.043,1580.774,"On the First Amendment grounds, I think I would have to think that Gannett ought to have been opened."
1979.79-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.569,1583.36,You think it was close?
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1583.97,1585.611,I think it was close.
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1590.295,1601.107,Do we know -- have we any way of knowing very much about the closeness of it in the absence of any findings --
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1601.107,1607.282,"Well, it's precisely the absence of findings that makes it -- that aggravates the clarity of the case."
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.208,1634.63,"Well, supposing you have a defendant who waives the right to a public trial he wants a closed trial."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1634.63,1635.635,As this one did.
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1635.635,1637.328,As this one did.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1643.668,1644.789,"I don't think so, Mr. Justice."
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.63,1677.041,It may be the government's decision in almost every case that closes a trial.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1677.041,1687.542,"But if you're dealing with a context which is truly internal to government, in which government has unilateral control to begin with, then the First Amendment is far harder to apply."
1979.79-243,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.995,1708.312,But it's not in the public domain if the defendant seeks -- waives his right to a public trial?
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1708.312,1711.461,I guess that is the very ultimate issue in this case.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1727.942,1731.147,"Well, that's true about a jury trial, isn't it?"
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1742.167,1743.098,But it's purpose --
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.098,1747.099,"If the defendant waives it, and the prosecutor agrees."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1747.099,1750.687,It's quite true that the public can't insist that there be a jury trial.
1979.79-243,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.441,1753.586,Which members of the press might like to do so some times.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1753.586,1756.507,But the First Amendment values would not be implicated in that case.
1979.79-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1771.505,1798.372,"Mr. Tribe, I suppose there might be a legitimate or at least arguable, colorable First Amendment right to a jury trial by contrast to a defendant who just gets up there and says one sentence, ""I plead guilty, Your Honor"" and that deprives the press and the public of all the information about all the otherwise available evidence about those facts and circumstances of the criminal offense."
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1798.372,1806.27,But I think to transform the fact that there is less information around into a First Amendment claim is to go much further than we are doing here.
1979.79-243,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.27,1811.096,It is to go further but I wouldn't go with you that there is no colorable First Amendment claim.
1979.79-243,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1811.096,1814.971,"I suppose it's a question of how generous one is with the word ""colorable""."
1979.79-243,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1824.519,1826.186,Mr. Attorney General.
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1826.186,1830.019,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it may please the Court."
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1941.982,1947.018,"Mr. Attorney General, what was the reason for closing the trial -- the factual reason?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1947.018,1950.792,"The factual reasons were, first of all --"
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1950.792,1952.318,Are they in the record?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1952.318,1955.674,"Yes, they are."
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1983.867,1986.01,Could this have been prevented?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,1986.01,2000.331,"Well, at the time this hearing was requested and these points were urged, sequestration and change of venue, the jury had already gone home that day, the trial had begun."
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2014.277,2016.688,"You didn't have the same jury each time, did you?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2016.688,2022.992,"No, we didn't but someone who was in every one of the trials, apparently, was in the courtroom."
1979.79-243,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2042.154,2048.705,"Well, couldn't the judge handle that by simply saying that all spectators must remain in their seats while the jury departs?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2048.705,2049.42,I concede that.
1979.79-243,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2049.42,2052.35,Or the jury is to remain in the box until all the spectators are gone.
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2052.35,2065.306,"I think that is true, but what we are confronted with now is looking back on a judge who is on the firing line, that had all of these factors and, on the request of the defendant, decided to close the trial."
1979.79-243,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2089.577,2097.79,"Mr. Attorney General, why did the judge need any reason to close the trial?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2110.159,2131.808,"I think the law is that if a prosecutor and if defense attorney and the defendant and the judge, two of whom are charged with the responsibility of representing the public interest, say they want the trial closed -- and I don't think that this Court or any law shows that that can be unconstitutional."
1979.79-243,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2131.808,2143.195,"So that as long as the three agree, the defendant, the prosecutor and the judge, you would close any criminal trial without any reason whatsoever insofar as the Constitution is concerned?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2143.195,2146.539,I don't think that has to be reached in this case.
1979.79-243,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2146.539,2163.641,"Well, it may not, because you may think you have a good enough reason, but if somebody disagrees with you, you might reach it and say whether, regardless of reason, you could close the trial."
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2169.717,2185.326,"I think when the three agree, when the public interest is represented, and I think the basis of many decisions in this Court is that the public interest is represented by the prosecutor and the judge, that historically you cannot blend the Sixth and First Amendments together."
1979.79-243,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.955,2199.421,All you needed to say at the hearing where the press and the people is that three people have agreed and we don't need any reason to close the trial.
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2199.421,2210.881,"Well, I think I can certainly see that if abuses occur in which there was case after case after case of closed trial it might be --"
1979.79-243,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2210.881,2216.995,"I know, but what Constitutional provision would be implicated, in your view, then?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2216.995,2218.925,I will not concede that the First Amendment would.
1979.79-243,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2221.092,2225.444,"You wouldn't think the Sixth Amendment would, would you?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2225.444,2227.878,"That has been decided, I think."
1979.79-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2227.878,2236.79,"The defendant, if he consents, is certainly in no position to raise a Sixth Amendment claim, particularly if he is acquitted by the judge."
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2236.79,2240.464,I think that's right.
1979.79-243,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2240.464,2246.847,"You do -- your basic position, I gather, is you don't need any reason."
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2246.847,2250.495,"I think there is a strong interest in public trials, and the Court has recognized that."
1979.79-243,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2250.495,2253.181,"That may be so, but what about -- is there a Constitutional interest?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2253.181,2256.173,I don't think it's a Constitutional interest.
1979.79-243,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2273.844,2277.457,On your theory --
1979.79-243,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2277.457,2286.962,"I am not sure about what sounds to me like a concession to Mr. Justice White that where the three agree, there is no Constitutional provision --"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2286.962,2287.826,That's right.
1979.79-243,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.826,2289.361,-- regarding the opening --
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2289.361,2293.871,I think the Sixth Amendment is one that is personal to the accused.
1979.79-243,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2324.33,2344.478,"Suppose this Court decided that this hearing today was to be closed, no one except counsel and the Court and the necessary attendants be present, and that was with the consent of both of you gentlemen?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2344.478,2346.463,We would certainly have no appeal.
1979.79-243,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2346.463,2348.822,"QUENo, I agree with you."
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2360.254,2361.571,I don't think it would.
1979.79-243,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2361.571,2365.788,"Well, you can't point to any."
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2365.788,2373.032,I think if you opened the First Amendment application to the Sixth Amendment it becomes an unending proposition.
1979.79-243,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2389.944,2400.671,"Do you think Congress could, if that step had been taken by this Court or any appellate court, Congress could provide a remedy?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2400.671,2401.007,I think Congress could --
1979.79-243,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2401.007,2403.134,And say it must be open?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2403.134,2414.959,I think the Congress could so long as it did not enact a law that was at odds with the procedural guarantee provided for the defendants.
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.546,2518.544,"Suppose, Mr. Attorney General, the judge at the opening of the trial said, ""This is just one of those cases I think would be tried better without the public here or the press."
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2541.916,2544.495,"Well, I don't think there would be anything wrong with him providing a hearing."
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.132,2552.144,But still you couldn't find any Constitutional provision that they would be relying on to get them in the courtroom?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2552.144,2562.616,"I have a problem with believing that the First Amendment, freedom of expression argument transcends the political arena and the dialogue in ideas."
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.814,2572.468,"So, if the judge, even over the defendant's objection --"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2572.468,2572.988,Now --
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.988,2574.997,Wait a minute.
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2587.82,2588.634,The public does.
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.547,2600.538,"By the way, on what Constitutional provision?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2600.538,2602.46,I don't say it is on a Constitutional provision.
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.46,2603.871,"Well, that's what I asked you."
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2603.871,2610.125,"Well, my answer to that is I think the defendant would come back into court on a writ of habeas corpus --"
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.125,2615.962,"The defendant I know, but I want to know is he the only one who can object -- who has a Constitutional ground for objection?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2615.962,2629.269,"I would prefer not to be pushed on that, but if you ask me to, I certainly will oblige by saying I think the First Amendment talks about and is historically concerned about the expression and ideas about debate."
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.269,2631.985,So the First Amendment is irrelevant to my question on that?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2631.985,2635.56,I think it is.
1979.79-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2707.753,2728.536,"Attorney General Coleman, if you are right that there has been such a long tradition of open trials in your State, and that the trial judge, as you say, was on the firing line, had to make a quick decision, how do you account for the Supreme Court of Virginia giving such short shrift to the matter?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2728.536,2730.015,I think there are a couple of things there.
1979.79-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2750.777,2751.963,This is in the briefs of the Supreme Court of Virginia?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2751.963,2753.011,That's right.
1979.79-243,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2780.836,2810.407,"But that's all, the cite of Gannett v. DePasquale as I would read the Supreme Court of Virginia, settles the Federal Constitutional question, but if the State has this long tradition of open trials, is there any other reason that you know of why the Supreme Court of Virginia didn't perhaps write a little more on the subject?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2810.407,2841.76,"Well, I think that in this case they were not prepared to say that a common law interest and a tradition in open trials which has many beneficial effects, and this Court has agreed with that, when it is in confrontation with the right to have a fair trial, that all parties of interest in that case, representing the public interest, the judge and the defendant felt was necessary, that the Supreme Court was not going to again say that."
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2912.232,2918.62,"Attorney General Coleman, what arguments were made to the Supreme Court of Virginia, only Federal Constitutional arguments?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2918.62,2919.727,That's right.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2922.655,2928.05,"Well, I know, but maybe State law arguments might have been made --"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2928.05,2928.645,That's right.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2928.645,2932.654,-- upon this long tradition you have told us about in Virginia.
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2932.654,2935.13,And the Constitutional arguments.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2935.13,2939.063,Were oral Constitutional arguments made to the Supreme Court of Virginia?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2939.063,2946.346,I think I am correct on that.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2947.66,2948.256,No.
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2948.256,2949.348,I believe I am correct in that.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2950.326,2952.754,The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2952.754,2953.684,That's right.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2954.594,2959.485,Only those arguments and no State common law arguments?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2959.485,2961.145,I believe that's right.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2961.145,2964.496,Is that correct?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2969.541,2971.537,There may be Federal Constitutional questions.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2971.537,2972.748,But no State Constitutional questions?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2972.748,2973.847,That's right.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2973.847,2975.119,Or State common law?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2975.119,2976.293,That's right.
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2976.293,2982.117,"The trial judge ruled on the statute, didn't he?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,2983.496,2992.871,I think he mentioned the statute.
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.871,3001.85,"He ruled on the statute, he built an opinion on the statute, that Order was appealed, and you say the statute is not involved?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3001.85,3009.378,I am saying that the Appellants never drew the constitutionality of the statute into question in the trial.
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3011.097,3014.662,Why did they say the judge should be reversed?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3014.662,3023.204,They said that there was an interest in the public to have the trial open to the public.
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3023.204,3025.545,Wasn't it aimed at the statute?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3025.545,3027.736,"If it was, they didn't mention it."
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3027.736,3029.525,"Well, it was in the Order."
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3031.751,3032.776,It wasn't in the Order.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3040.198,3041.901,He relied on it and said the statute --
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3041.901,3048.15,And you are saying the statute wasn't mentioned to the Supreme Court of Virginia?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3048.15,3054.438,My position is that the question was not ruled upon by the Supreme Court of Virginia.
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3054.438,3058.308,You are not saying it wasn't argued or mentioned?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3058.308,3060.45,It was mentioned by the judge.
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.054,3066.843,But in the Supreme Court nobody mentioned it?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3066.843,3067.821,Nowhere mentioned.
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3079.52,3081.817,I don't want to get involved in language.
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3085.04,3086.32,The State mentioned it.
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3086.32,3089.504,Did anybody else mention it parenthetically?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3089.504,3091.558,The Commonwealth Attorney.
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3091.558,3097.007,The Commonwealth Attorney and the Appellant did not?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3106.531,3107.552,The court?
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3107.552,3110.498,"No, the Appellants."
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3110.498,3111.688,"No, they did not."
1979.79-243,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3111.688,3112.983,Never mentioned it?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3112.983,3114.483,Never mentioned it.
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3114.483,3120.532,Did the Richmond newspapers rely on any provision of the State Constitution to invalidate this statute and this closure?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3120.532,3122.723,No.
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3122.723,3125.91,Are there similar provision in the Virginia Constitution?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3125.91,3128.657,The Virginia Constitution --
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3128.657,3130.162,Does it require a public trial?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3130.162,3131.953,"No, it doesn't."
1979.79-243,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3142.095,3147.853,And there was no claim that under Virginia's Constitution this closure was invalid?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3147.853,3148.725,No.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3148.725,3154.904,Then what do you suppose the statute means when it talks about the right of the accused to a public trial?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3154.904,3157.336,There is a right to a public trial in Virginia.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3157.336,3159.093,But there is not a Constitutional right?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3159.093,3160.658,"Yes, there is a Constitutional."
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3160.658,3163.961,I thought you just answered my question that there was not.
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3163.961,3164.703,There is.
1979.79-243,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3164.703,3166.599,There is a provision in the Virginia Constitution?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3166.599,3166.834,There is.
1979.79-243,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3166.834,3167.664,For public trial?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3167.664,3168.338,Yes.
1979.79-243,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3172.883,3174.925,In a criminal or civil case?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3174.925,3176.259,"No, in a criminal case."
1979.79-243,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3176.259,3180.423,"Well, was that provision invoked in this case at all?"
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3180.423,3186.239,"No, it was only the Federal rights that were invoked in this case by the Appellants."
1979.79-243,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3186.239,3191.006,Are there any prior Virginia cases that deal with the right to public trial?
1979.79-243,1,29792,j_marshall_coleman,,3191.006,3201.933,"No, we found no Virginia law, and it was not raised in that case."
1979.79-243,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3349.664,3351.138,"You have about two moments left, Mr. Tribe."
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3351.138,3352.52,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.79-243,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.73,3367.797,Was there reliance on the public trial provision?
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3367.797,3377.603,"No, there was not, because it is available only to the accused, I guess, under Virginia tradition, and I think the Attorney General was right there was no case law to rely on."
1979.79-243,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.423,3384.348,The Virginia law is like Gannett -- that public trial provision is available only to the accused?
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3384.348,3390.396,"I have to tell you, Mr. Chief Justice, I am not certain, but that was my impression."
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3473.387,3486.49,And the reason you say the First Amendment provides an appropriate home for that concept is that this case is distinguishable from such cases as Saxby.
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3486.49,3488.183,Pell and even Hutchins.
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3488.183,3492.494,By reason of the fact that somebody has a right to open up these proceedings?
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3492.494,3492.831,Exactly.
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3492.831,3495.56,And it is to that extent that you look to the Sixth Amendment.
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3495.56,3495.798,That's right.
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3495.798,3497.112,And also limits --
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3497.112,3500.621,That limits --
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3500.621,3503.769,"Saxby, Pell or --"
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3503.769,3503.849,Hutchins.
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3503.849,3509.577,"-- or between the President and Members of his Cabinet, or whatever."
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3509.577,3513.17,But it is also not just the support described by the Attorney General.
1979.79-243,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3532.399,3540.821,"Mr. Tribe, the Attorney General said the maverick decision can be corrected by the Supreme Court of Virginia, not that this was a maverick decision."
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3540.821,3547.771,"Well, if this was what he regards as an acceptable decision, then I think it proves the need for this Court's intervention in the name of the first and Fourteenth Amends."
1979.79-243,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.771,3549.061,"Mr. Tribe, before you --"
1979.79-243,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3549.061,3551.015,The defendant didn't do anything about it.
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3552.48,3556.145,"Well, I am not defending the defendant."
1979.79-243,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3556.145,3566.134,"It is the State's position that nobody has any right there but the defendant and he was acquitted, so that's the end of the ballgame."
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3566.134,3568.615,But the First Amendment will have to be vindicated somehow.
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3568.615,3578.121,"It is said that the prosecutor represents the public interest, and he consents."
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3583.766,3585.767,I have no idea at all.
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3594.41,3607.529,"But if by definition the public trial provisions of the Sixth Amendment is for the defendant's protection, and yet the prosecutor can open it up."
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3607.529,3608.55,It becomes problematic.
1979.79-243,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3618.038,3629.244,"Before you sit down, what provision of the Constitution did the Court draw on to make a presumption of innocence part of our fabric?"
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3629.244,3652.77,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Rinship case drawing only on the general language of the due process clause is a perfect parallel because in Rinship, the Court held that one of the fundamental reasons that, even though it is not mentioned, the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt is implicit in the Constitution is that it is central to trust in the system of justice and central to legitimacy."
1979.79-243,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3656.25,3666.18,"Was there not also some hints that this was the tradition in 1787, '89, '90 and '91."
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3666.18,3678.429,"Tradition as well, both in Rinship and here, and in a number of other cases provides an additional basis for making it clear that the Court is not fashioned in a new light, that this is the oldest and best established."
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3678.429,3682.426,"And so that argument would apply to both civil and criminal cases, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3682.426,3690.755,"That would be much broader and one would have to know more than I have discovered about the tradition in civil cases to be absolutely sure, but the Court needn't decide that in this case."
1979.79-243,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3690.755,3693.586,I think you will find that the tradition is the same.
1979.79-243,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3693.586,3696.365,May I ask a question?
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3731.821,3740.137,"I think Mr. Justice Stewart's majority opinion took the position that even if the First Amendment applied, on the record in Gannett, it was adequately served."
1979.79-243,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.137,3749.946,"But your test is, if I understand you right, the rule of the First Amendment right of access applies and that right can only be rejected on a showing of compelling need."
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3756.892,3780.1,"Mr. Justice, I think there will be nonetheless one way to resolve that question without overruling Gannett, and that is as a prophylactic device one can say that in a context like pretrial suppression hearings where the requirement of showing compelling need institutionally would be impossible to meet but where, nonetheless, there are a lot of cases where indeed there is a compelling need, though you can't prove it."
1979.79-243,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3810.137,3814.527,You would also not prevail by applying a different standard than compelling need.
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3814.527,3818.593,You could prevail by applying any standard other than no need at all.
1979.79-243,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3818.593,3819.801,That's right.
1979.79-243,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3819.801,3820.283,Thank you.
1979.79-243,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3820.283,3820.975,"Thank you, gentlemen."
