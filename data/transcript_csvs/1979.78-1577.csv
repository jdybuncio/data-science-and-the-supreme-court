1979.78-1577,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.735,"We will hear arguments next in Sears, Roebuck against County of Los Angeles, No. 78-1577."
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,57.269,60.218,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.853,141.416,"Mr. Garb, are you going to address yourself to the standing issue of the County of Los Angeles at all?"
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,141.416,152.172,"I had not intended to, Your Honor, although we believe that that issue is certainly an interesting one, and one presented in the California courts."
1979.78-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.172,152.583,Well --
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,152.583,154.881,I would be happy to address myself to that issue if Your Honors --
1979.78-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.881,161.681,"I, for one, would be interested, considering it a part of our Article II jurisdictional limitation."
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,161.681,165.147,Certainly; let me address myself at this time to that issue.
1979.78-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,212.749,216.553,"Certainly no more than injury in fact, at most."
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,216.553,218.579,"We have even no injury in fact, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.317,397.505,"Mr. Garb, let me ask a curious question."
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,400.925,403.276,The Attorney General of California did not participate in this case?
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,403.276,403.737,Why not?
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,406.97,412.855,The Attorney General of California was not a party in terms of the plaintiffs and defendants in the lawsuit.
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,412.855,421.752,"Maybe I should ask your opponents this, but it is strange when an Attorney General is not here defending his statute."
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,429.48,429.818,I see.
1979.78-1577,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,445.757,450.757,"Well, he doesn't have to be asked if a State statute is being challenged, does he?"
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,450.757,453.443,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor, but the subject was never broached."
1979.78-1577,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,456.043,460.702,Aren't you required to notify him officially that a State statute was under attack?
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,460.702,465.473,"Mr. Justice Marshall, there is no requirement in the State of California to do that, no."
1979.78-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.473,476.692,"We had one other case with a Pennsylvania statute under fire, and the Attorney General refrained, in fact, said it was unconstitutional; we thought it was a little strange."
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,476.692,479.375,I would think so as well.
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.002,534.391,May I ask another question on standing that Justice Rehnquist raised?
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,558.412,565.812,"Exempting goods from tax we know is within the purview of the legislature to do, as New York has done."
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.812,573.148,"Yes, but if it's within a statute that generally imposes a tax, as Section 225 says the goods involved here are not subject to tax."
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,580.941,588.425,"Because, Your Honor, as I see it, the reason that they are basing this entire attack on the statute is an alleged discrimination."
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.24,597.108,And they're saying you remove the discrimination by holding the exemption unconstitutional.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,597.108,597.952,That is what they're saying.
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.298,600.17,And they will get more revenue if you do that?
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,600.17,600.7,Correct.
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,622.856,625.033,"But doesn't that go to the merits rather than the standing, is what I'm saying?"
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,625.033,629.598,"Well, it goes to the nature of the attack; it's an attack on discrimination."
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,645.636,654.774,"And you say it's a discriminatory effect if the goods come from Nevada, they're subject to tax; if they come from Canada, they're not subject to tax?"
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,654.774,656.954,"If they are shipped out of the State of California thereafter, correct."
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.954,658.593,If that's transhipped out of the city.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,658.593,658.659,Right.
1979.78-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,658.659,661.4,And that's a discrimination--and why isn't that a discrimination?
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,661.4,661.86,Pardon me?
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,661.86,664.538,Why was that not a discrimination?
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,664.538,664.835,"Well, there is no --"
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.835,669.228,"I mean, maybe it's not an unconstitutional discrimination, but why isn't it at least a disparity that gives them standing I --"
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,669.228,671.011,"Well, it is a differential in treatment."
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.57,677.697,You have to show the statute costs you some money.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,677.697,683.41,"-- the statute -- well, you have to show if discrimination is the basis, that there is indeed a discriminated class."
1979.78-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.41,690.468,"Well, don't you also have to show more than just injury in fact, the loss of money that Justice Stevens was referring to?"
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,708.567,709.679,"I believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,718.587,721.49,Is there really a standing problem here?
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,725.007,726.275,"Yes it did, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.275,729.859,"And Sears applied for an exemption, claimed an exemption?"
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,729.859,730.463,It did.
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,730.463,731.298,It was denied?
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,731.298,731.637,It was.
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.637,733.564,It was denied on two grounds.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,733.564,734.101,It was denied on --
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.101,737.034,"Statutory, local statutory grounds, and constitutional grounds."
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,737.034,737.997,That is correct.
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.997,743.919,And Sears took the decision up.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,752.648,755.135,"Well, Your Honor, I think when you perceive it --"
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,755.135,759.402,That may be -- I can't imagine why there's any case or controversy.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,759.402,764.137,"Well, the standing problem that we see is that the argument throughout the brief of the respondent --"
1979.78-1577,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.137,766.225,"Well, it's not an Article III question, you know."
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,775.882,786.059,"Well, I think it really exists on two different levels, first the question of whether the progeny of the State can attack the enactments of its parent at all; and secondly, even if it can --"
1979.78-1577,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.059,791.393,"And the tax assessor says, ""I take an oath to observe the Constitution of the United States, too."""
1979.78-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.391,794.827,But the tax assessor isn't a party to this suit.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,794.827,795.235,That is correct.
1979.78-1577,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.235,795.895,It's just the County of Los Angeles.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,795.895,796.875,That is precisely correct.
1979.78-1577,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.388,807.149,"No, but who is on the other side when -- how did this case get started?"
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,808.427,811.695,It got into the courts by the denial -- after the denial of the exemption.
1979.78-1577,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.806,818.782,"Well, who else would they have sued?"
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,821.93,822.436,That's correct.
1979.78-1577,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.953,825.599,He is -- that is the tax collector.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,825.599,827.966,"Well, the assessor is the tax collector, the personal tax collector."
1979.78-1577,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.966,828.452,No.
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,832.123,849.253,"That is correct, and precisely for that reason, you do not come within those cases that permit an individual who has been called upon to perform an act that he believes is unconstitutional to file suit, or to defend suit himself, and to have standing to do so, to avoid the necessity of his engaging in an unconstitutional act."
1979.78-1577,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.253,851.981,So it is a standing problem; it's not a case or controversy problem?
1979.78-1577,0,16112,andrew_s_garb,,851.981,857.914,I see it as a standing problem.
1979.78-1577,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,987.322,995.955,"Very well, Mr. Garb."
1979.78-1577,1,21899,ernest_j_brown,,995.97,999.566,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1577,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1420.004,1430.22,"Mr. Clark, at the outset would you mind clarifying for us the absence of the Attorney General of the State?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1438.557,1440.821,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.347,1491.342,Does that mean he agrees that the statute is unconstitutional?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1491.342,1498.238,"I cannot speak for the Attorney General, because I have only spoken with assistants and deputies."
1979.78-1577,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1534.307,1543.568,"In any event, I suppose it's your position that having informed the Attorney General, you have discharged any obligation which the County has in the matter, and from there on, it's up to him?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1543.568,1544.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.169,1577.023,Will you advise us as to the status of the pending California legislation?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1577.023,1588.527,"Yes, Your Honor; the State has effectively repealed Section 225; it is not effective for the future."
1979.78-1577,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1588.527,1590.034,"Well, was there not also refund legislation?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1590.034,1590.632,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.802,1602.447,What is your estimate as to the likelihood of that passage?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1602.447,1607.331,It really -- I have no feel for that.
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.331,1609.303,Are you opposing it?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1609.303,1619.603,"Your Honor, we --the County's position is that we're going to lose money, and we would like to be reimbursed for any refunds that take place."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.327,1641.616,Now what has been repealed?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1641.616,1655.931,"Section 225, the statute in question, has been repealed effectively by the enactment of an overall exemption, which exempts all inventory from taxation in the State of California, whether it comes in interstate --"
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.931,1656.383,Right.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1656.383,1662.038,-- or foreign commerce.
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.837,1668.555,Could I just ask you for a minute?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1668.555,1670.064,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.064,1679.656,I take it the California courts saw no problem with your taking the position you do and mitigating the issue?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1679.656,1694.21,"No, Your Honor, as a matter of fact, as I was about to point out, in terms of the so-called standing issue, the case arises, as has been pointed out to this Court, in the context of a taxation event by the local county."
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.431,1738.455,I take it the county is the State's assessing agent?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1738.455,1739.058,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.544,1748.519,Because the county --
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1748.519,1750.106,Simply because it was the county.
1979.78-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.43,1863.498,"Well, Mr. Clark, are you familiar with our decision in Doremus v. Board of Education in 342 U.S., where the State of New Jersey Supreme Court held that a taxpayers' action would lie to challenge the constitutionality of a release time program under New Jersey law."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1881.468,1884.985,"No, Your Honor, I have not become acquainted with that."
1979.78-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1900.156,1905.235,But here you have no individuals listed as -- it's just the County of Los Angeles.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,1905.235,1928.275,"Well, Your Honor, it seemed to me anomalous to -- on the fact that I foolishly stipulated out the assessor's name, because it was not required by the State statute, to say that the people involved do not have standing to raise constitutional issues, even when that has been recognized specifically by the State legislature, which I recognize that you are telling me that under Doremus would be irrelevant."
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.677,2278.867,"Well, let's assume all that were true."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2280.962,2281.939,"These goods, Your Honor, have --"
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.939,2287.788,Because -- why do you say the exemption was unconstitutional with respect to these goods?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2287.788,2294.61,"Well, Your Honor, the particular goods which are the subject of the stipulation involve two classes of goods."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.171,2334.056,The transshipped goods are exempt; in-State goods are not?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2334.056,2334.577,Transshipped --
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.577,2338.878,"Well, I mean the goods that are shipped out."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2338.878,2341.116,"The -- I'm sorry Your Honor, the --"
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.116,2341.536,"Well, what --"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2341.536,2344.716,"No, Your Honor, as a matter of fact, California manufacturers--"
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.716,2351.267,"Well, the exemption -- does the exemption purport to cover both of these classes of goods?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2351.267,2351.795,"No, sir."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.795,2352.863,No.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2352.863,2356.76,"No, it distinguishes between them, and it also distinguishes between the in-state--"
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2356.76,2358.461,"Is that the vice of it you think, or not?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2358.461,2367.086,"Well, I think that's one of the vices of it, because it makes the tariffs--in essence, it gives a tariff rebate to one set of foreign goods and doesn't give it to another."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.253,2544.909,"Well, you're not -- are you really suggesting that the exemption is inconsistent with, or frustrates, any statutory enactment of Congress?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2544.909,2547.256,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.256,2548.342,Well --
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2548.342,2573.297,"I believe that the exemption by its own conditions, and referring to the Tariff Act which we have cited in our brief, in essence mandates almost as broadly as the Tariff Acts themselves, a rebate of tariffs which have been paid, insofar -- and the Court of Appeals found the distinction between interstate and foreign goods."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.297,2577.517,"Yes, well I take it that the Representatives of the United States disagree with you in that respect?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2577.517,2580.151,"I believe they do, Your Honor, although I'm not --"
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.151,2582.432,"But that doesn't -- I agree, that doesn't answer the matter."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2582.432,2592.955,"Well, if any I may, Your Honor, for just a moment."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.901,2616.535,"Yes, but they argue that there's no inconsistency between this exemption and the tariff laws."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2616.535,2619.615,"Well, Your Honor, they do that on the basis that I have stated."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2625.508,2631.145,"Well, assume there's no inconsistency; then that should be the end of the matter."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2632.639,2637.338,"Well, Your Honor, I think they used that second argument as a support for the first."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.338,2647.324,"Yes, well maybe -- let's assume we disagreed with you on this -- in this respect, that the exemption is not inconsistent with any statutory enactment of Congress."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2657.327,2659.213,That the commerce clause itself --
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.213,2659.838,Invalidates the injunction?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2659.838,2661.67,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.67,2664.493,"-- on some kind of commerce, several kinds of commerce."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2664.493,2667.257,"Well, not necessarily with a burden, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.564,2669.502,It's discrimination.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2669.502,2684.993,"That is true, and also, Your Honor, that because it effectively rebates tariffs in an area where the President is empowered to protect domestic goods, that it takes away from the Presidential power to protect those goods."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.993,2686.894,I'm assuming we disagree with you on that.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2686.894,2687.616,I'm sorry.
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2696.574,2704.987,"Well, I would say that would just be a frustration of the Federal law, and I will assume that out; assume that out of the case."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2709.494,2709.88,"Well, yes, sir."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.242,2718.665,Yes.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2718.665,2725.99,That we believe that Boston Stock Exchange applies here.
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.24,2744.945,"Mr. Clark, did the Court of Appeals rely on any cutting between different kinds of foreign commerce?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2744.945,2746.616,The Court of Appeals --
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2746.616,2751.727,"I thought it just considered there to be a discrimination between foreign as a class, and all interstate as a class."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2751.727,2755.968,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, it did dwell on that particular point."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.689,2778.665,"And that's what your case rests on, just one -- didn't go into your distinction, for example, between shipments to Phoenix and shipments to Sacramento?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2778.665,2782.323,"No, Your Honor, it did not."
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2867.566,2896.117,"I take it your argument, then, domestically -- assume that the city -- assume that Cook County in Chicago said, we tax inventories that are located here on a certain date, except the following, and one of them they list is, inventories (Inaudible) are here that have come from out of State and are going to be shipped out within two weeks, or--goods that are destined to go elsewhere out of the State."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2900.096,2903.149,I think that it does not create the foreign-interstate distinction.
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.149,2917.213,"I know, but it certainly creates a distinction between goods from out of State that are going to be shipped -- that are going to be sold locally, and goods that are going to be transshipped."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2917.213,2917.562,That is --
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.562,2919.212,That's certainly one of your arguments.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,2920.373,2937.202,"Well, I think that one of our arguments, Mr. Justice White, is the idea that those kinds of statutes do not create the same degree of problems that Section 225."
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2987.622,3001.651,"Yes, but you've got to argue in this case that the exemption is invalid because of the goods -- Sears goods that are shipped out of the State, or exempt under this exemption, and the ones that are destined for Sacramento are not."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3001.651,3002.483,"Well, Your Honor, if the Court --"
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.483,3004.46,Those are the only goods that are involved here.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3004.46,3005.288,If the Court of Appeals --
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.288,3005.906,Is that right or not?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3005.906,3013.719,"Well, no, Your Honor, because we believe that the Court of Appeals determination -- we agree that that is one of the issues; and we agree that the statute is unconstitutional."
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3013.719,3019.28,"Well, why -- is there any broader issue here?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3021.263,3028.95,The Court of Appeals determined the ambit of the statute as creating a distinction between foreign and interstate goods.
1979.78-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.991,3033.022,You can't challenge it on its face.
1979.78-1577,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.897,3039.426,Not your client.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3039.426,3041.063,"Which is not my client, right."
1979.78-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3041.063,3051.095,"Well, of the goods which you seek to tax, or which you have had refund proceedings with respect to."
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3051.095,3051.674,"Well, right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.235,3077.573,So that the Court of Appeals preferred position was that any exemption for goods originating abroad is just a discrimination --
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3077.573,3077.821,I think --
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3077.821,3079.804,-- against domestic commerce.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3079.804,3081.249,That was the Court of Appeals --
1979.78-1577,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.249,3081.837,Yes.
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3081.837,3121.031,"-- decision that when those goods go out of State as well; in other words, when we have an interstate shipment, and a foreign commerce -- and a foreign shipment, which eventually go out of State, the Court of Appeals held that 225 operates to distinguish between those two; that in essence it distinguishes between those two branches of commerce; that distinguishing between those two branches of commerce is improper; and that that, we believe, is supported by American Oil, and by the idea that the Court of Appeals made, as part of the broad interpretation which was supported and urged by the petitioner, that --"
1979.78-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.031,3149.41,"Well, do you think the California Court of Appeals would have rendered a similar decision, even if declaratory relief, if the issues had been framed in terms that 12 months of now the County of Los Angeles was going to assess these goods and the owners were going to refuse to pay it?"
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3149.41,3154.587,"I'm sorry, I do not really understand the question."
1979.78-1577,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3154.587,3178.386,What I'm trying to get at is how free does your Court of Appeals feel to render declaratory relief or injunctions just on construction of statutes in the abstract without regard to what may have happened or what may have been done by the parties before them?
1979.78-1577,2,29481,james_dexter_clark,,3178.386,3191.776,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I thought -- before the Court of Appeal, Your Honor, there were facts that that interstate commerce did exist; that interstate commerce is being brought through the State for distribution purposes to other States."
1979.78-1577,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3225.843,3228.327,"You have four minutes left, Mr. Garb."
1979.78-1577,3,16112,andrew_s_garb,,3228.327,3230.033,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1577,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3497.67,3498.468,"Thank you, gentlemen."
