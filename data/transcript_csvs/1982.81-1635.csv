1982.81-1635,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.729,We will hear arguments first this morning in Anderson against Celebrezze.
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,12.12,28.361,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the constitutionality of Ohio's early filing deadline for independent candidates as that provision is applied to independent Presidential candidates."
1982.81-1635,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,127.916,133.727,This was about 30 days or so after the filing deadline?
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,133.727,135.302,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1635,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,163.994,173.599,Do you think it makes any difference that he had filed once under a party designation and then sought to file later as a third party candidate?
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,173.599,191.029,"In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it makes any difference, because the Ohio legislature has already made a judgment about whether that would disqualify a person in Mr. Anderson's position from getting on the general election ballot."
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,237.589,249.506,"Yes, but that person would have had to have filed or made his intentions to run in the primary known before his withdrawal."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,251.803,256.896,"--That's correct, Justice White."
1982.81-1635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.249,306.903,"Mr. Frampton, exactly what is the First Amendment right being asserted here?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,306.903,308.965,Justice--
1982.81-1635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.965,310.014,How would you articulate it?
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,310.014,342.611,"--Justice O'Connor, I think it is directly the First Amendment right of the... principally being asserted in this case is the right of the voters and citizens, including those petitioners who are Ohio registered voters who are seeking to support Congressman Anderson by putting forward his name and having him on the ballot, their right to associate for the purpose of putting their candidate before whatever body the state designates to select its electors in November."
1982.81-1635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.459,369.724,Does Ohio permit write-in candidates?
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,369.724,376.081,"--Yes, it does, and there is a specific provision in the Ohio code for Presidential candidates."
1982.81-1635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.293,391.26,"Well, then, how is the right to vote infringed?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,391.26,419.377,"Justice O'Connor, I think the Court has recognized in the past, for example, in Lubin and Panish, that the write-in... and in Williams and Rhodes, that the write-in alternative is not an equivalent, a practical equivalent either for voters or for candidates to having a candidate's name on the ballot, and I would contend that that is particularly so for someone seeking as important an office as President of the United States."
1982.81-1635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.512,476.274,"Well, you are not relying really on some right to be a candidate, then."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,476.274,485.24,"Justice O'Connor, I think we are certainly asserting the right of Petitioner John Anderson to be on the ballot and to represent these people."
1982.81-1635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.129,492.5,"Do you think that Clements versus Fashing bears on that, where the Court indicated there wasn't such a right?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,492.5,512.305,"--Justice O'Connor, I think the Court treated that case as principally a case asserting the candidate's rights, and although we do have a candidate here asserting his rights, I think that the principal rights being asserted here are those of the other petitioners and voters and citizens like them."
1982.81-1635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,512.305,523.49,"Well, if we have said there isn't a right under the First Amendment to be a candidate, then can the voters have some right that hinges on some right to be a candidate?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,523.49,527.174,"I think it does, but I think the voters also have an independent right."
1982.81-1635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.122,661.295,"Well, what business would those people have for assuming in your hypothetical situation that President Reagan would run again."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,671.196,675.114,I think that is precisely the point that we are trying to make in our case.
1982.81-1635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,703.963,734.465,"Yes, but the logic of your position suggests that if the major party conventions were held in late August and September, and the candidates nominated only then, and although that isn't the tradition, there is certainly nothing in the law that prevents it, your people would still have a right after that happens, however late or however few days left before election, your people would still have a right to act after the major parties in order to put their candidate up, and I don't see where you get that out of our cases."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,734.465,741.261,"Justice Rehnquist, I don't think that is at all the necessary logic of our position."
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.485,858.618,"Well, in that regard, Mr. Frampton, are you suggesting that without regard to how this statute was applied to Mr. Anderson and his supporters, the statute is unconstitutional on its face?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,859.884,865.992,It is our position that it is unconstitutional on its face as applied to the Presidential race.
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.992,883.858,"Well, how about as it is applied to Congressman Anderson, in the particular circumstances of his case, and if you say that... if you... let's just assume that as applied in this case, it was constitutionally applied."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,894.571,906.304,The assumption that the statute... that... the assumption would be that Congressman Anderson could constitutionally be barred from Ohio's general election.
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.304,909.194,"Yes, yes, the very case that the statute was not unconstitutionally applied to him."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,910.067,911.471,But it seems... sorry.
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.609,920.654,"Well, that may be so, but what about this law?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,922.467,925.622,"Well, our position, I think, then... my answer has to be twofold."
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.74,949.27,"Yes, but why would you... why would you... why would you think you were entitled to have it declared unconstitutional on its face, just because it might be applied to others in an unconstitutional way?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,949.27,957.235,"--Well, I don't... Mr. Justice, I don't think that is the real thrust of the Court's overbreadth opinions--"
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.235,958.467,"Well, I want to know what the thrust of your position is."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,958.467,982.208,"--If Congressman Anderson, for example, were contesting... had been faced with an 850,000 petition signature requirement in June, which he had challenged because he couldn't get the correct number of signatures, I don't think that it would be right to say that he wasn't entitled to challenge that requirement because the state could have barred him with some kind of political stability device--"
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.208,1004.497,"I still... I still want to know whether we should judge this case... we should ask ourselves whether this statute was constitutionally applied to Anderson in the circumstances of this case, or whether we must also ask, well, that is sort of irrelevant, is the statute unconstitutional on its face, because it is overbroad, or because of something else."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1004.497,1005.386,--That is correct.
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.449,1013.728,"Well, not if the test is just mere rationality."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1021.383,1034.142,"--Well, our position is that even if a rational relationship test is applied, the statute falls, because it isn't... it doesn't in fact rationally further political stability goals."
1982.81-1635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1171.256,1187.45,"--Mr. Frampton, is there any evidence here that indicates how many late blooming third force candidates like the Petitioner Anderson have sought and been denied access to Ohio's general election ballot?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1187.45,1195.947,"There is evidence that a number of independent Presidential candidates have gotten on the ballot, but it is--"
1982.81-1635,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1195.947,1198.681,Is there any evidence as to how many have been denied access?
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1198.681,1200.088,"--No, Your Honor, there is not."
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1226.028,1231.214,"When you say discriminatory, it does, of course, it treats party people and independents differently."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1232.325,1233.371,--Yes.
1982.81-1635,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.371,1241.618,"Just that it... you are not suggesting that just because they are treated differently, that the law is unconstitutional?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1241.618,1258.25,"No, we are suggesting that because independent candidates and voters who may wish to put forward some candidates are deprived of the opportunity during most of the time everybody else chooses their nominees from doing the same thing, that that is both an invidious discrimination and a burden."
1982.81-1635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1302.046,1310.808,"Of course, I think it is also true that the Ohio... it is inconceivable that the Ohio legislature, with Republicans and Democrats making up 98 percent of it, would pass the statute."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1310.808,1312.293,Absolutely.
1982.81-1635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1354.118,1373.249,"But, of course, you... in a sense, for seem to be arguing that independents are a sort of political party all their own, and of course if that were true, I think there would be no difficulty about Ohio saying that if you want the independent nomination, you have got to file by a certain date, and the independents choose their candidate at the independent convention, and such and such."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1385.151,1388.712,"Justice Rehnquist, I think I have to give a three-part answer to that question."
1982.81-1635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1389.837,1391.366,I didn't realize I was bringing that on.
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1392.115,1418.122,"It seems to me that the Court, although it is not a separate party, of course, the Court has recognized in previous decisions that independent-minded voters, those people who for whatever reason don't want to affiliate themselves with an organized ongoing political faction, do have different and independent type of rights that are entitled to the same recognition under the First Amendment as party members."
1982.81-1635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1468.756,1490.546,"But your argument necessarily requires you to say, doesn't it, that even though the major parties have their conventions in August, that nonetheless if someone like Congressman Anderson wishes to announce in September on the basis of choices made by the major parties in August, Ohio has got to allow them to do it, however it may foul up their balloting."
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1490.546,1503.353,"No, our position still is that the burden or difference in treatment, if it is substantial, has... simply saying that it has to be supported by some state interest."
1982.81-1635,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.629,1521.22,"Would a filing deadline in June for independents have done away with your constitutional objections, do you think?"
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1529.093,1539.072,"--I think it would be a very different case, because Ohio does have legitimate administrative interests that might support a June deadline."
1982.81-1635,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1593.286,1594.893,Very well.
1982.81-1635,0,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,1594.893,1598.423,"Unless there are any further questions, I would like to save the rest of my time."
1982.81-1635,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.423,1601.749,Mr. Taylor.
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,1601.749,1620.166,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Ohio filing deadline at issue in this case has a burden, if it has one at all, of an entirely different character than the election regulations that have been struck down in the past by this Court."
1982.81-1635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.577,1768.464,"On your second point, do you say the same thing about not only the candidate but about his supporters?"
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,1768.464,1770.714,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1982.81-1635,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.572,1782.881,I take it your opposition stresses the associational right rather than the candidate's right.
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,1782.881,1783.755,--Right.
1982.81-1635,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1831.813,1840.652,"Well, then, you do recognize that there is a right of political association that may be affected, but you are just saying it isn't much of an effect."
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,1840.652,1842.262,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1635,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.526,1850.728,"So there is some First Amendment right here at stake which you would recognize, apparently, as well."
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,1850.728,1862.38,--There is no question but that the Court in voting rights and candidate cases has recognized the implication for First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of any regulation.
1982.81-1635,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1877.451,1883.73,"Well, there may be a threshold inquiry of whether it is an undue burden or something of that kind."
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,1883.73,1889.478,"Indeed, I think that is the case, Justice O'Connor, and in several cases the Court has done exactly that."
1982.81-1635,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1909.518,1915.453,Does any other state have a filing deadline as early as Ohio's?
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,1915.453,1922.028,One state currently has a filing deadline earlier than Ohio.
1982.81-1635,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1922.028,1923.011,What is that?
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,1923.011,1923.604,I believe that is Indiana.
1982.81-1635,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.604,1924.371,Indiana?
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,1924.371,1939.205,"New Jersey, I believe, has one in April, and there were, of course, at one time filing deadlines in four other states at or about the same time as Ohio's that were struck down as a result of Anderson litigation in other cases."
1982.81-1635,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.001,2098.406,"When you say both those entities, Mr. Taylor, what do you mean?"
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,2098.406,2102.859,--The two entities being the independent candidate and the political party.
1982.81-1635,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.859,2111.025,I suppose... are there customarily more than two political party candidates for President on the ballot in Ohio?
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,2111.025,2119.428,There... I believe the last time we had a third party on the Presidential ballot was in 1972.
1982.81-1635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.035,2138.813,"Mr. Taylor, it is still not clear to me what the Petitioner in this case could have done in March and complied with your law."
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,2148.37,2151.54,"No, he could not, Justice Marshall."
1982.81-1635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2157.507,2161.866,Which would deny him the right to run in the convention.
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,2164.487,2167.818,I don't believe he is denied any right to run in the convention.
1982.81-1635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.236,2173.549,"Well, isn't the state of Ohio telling him that he can't run in the convention?"
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,2173.549,2187.479,"The state of Ohio is not telling him... There was nothing in this case to prevent Congressman Anderson from having obtained the nomination of the Republican Party at its convention, had he been able to do so."
1982.81-1635,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2187.479,2196.709,Even after he had... Even after he had taken these other steps?
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,2196.709,2197.895,That's correct.
1982.81-1635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2205.001,2211.562,Can you imagine a political party nominating a man that is an independent candidate in 50 states?
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,2211.562,2214.077,I would think it highly unlikely.
1982.81-1635,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2214.077,2215.762,Highly unlikely.
1982.81-1635,1,33247,joel_s_taylor,,2224.914,2227.96,I am not familiar if it did happen in California.
1982.81-1635,2,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,3451.424,3460.919,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would just like to respond to one question asked by Justice Stevens, and one by the Chief Justice of Mr. Taylor."
1982.81-1635,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3492.75,3493.827,In Ohio?
1982.81-1635,2,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,3493.827,3495.359,Nationwide.
1982.81-1635,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.359,3496.997,What about Ohio?
1982.81-1635,2,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,3496.997,3507.853,"We did not have any particular statistics from Ohio, but I believe those polls showed that his strongest support came from eight northeastern states, one of which included Ohio."
1982.81-1635,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3599.093,3603.156,You say that is a considered state interest.
1982.81-1635,2,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,3604.529,3616.65,"--I use the phrase, Justice Brennan, v. Oklahoma case, which pertained to different kinds of First Amendment rights."
1982.81-1635,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3616.65,3641.547,"But basically, as I understand your argument, if, as you, in your colloquy with Justice White, you fail on the argument that there is an overbreadth about this statute that requires that it be struck down under the First Amendment, that alternatively in any event the state can't justify this statute without establishing a compelling state interest, which it has not done."
1982.81-1635,2,25316,george_t_frampton_jr,,3642.919,3645.341,"You are right, Justice Brennan."
