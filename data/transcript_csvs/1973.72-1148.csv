1973.72-1148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.429,We will hear arguments next in 72-1148 Cupp against Naughten.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,22.428,26.332,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.625,275.877,"I take it Mr. Solicitor General that you have reviewed these evidentiary matters in detail, perhaps the purposes of indicating that the guilt was established by overwhelming evidences of it, there is no question --"
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,275.877,334.526,"This is the reason why we tried to present it in this fashion, because it seems to us that on those facts and given the instructions which the Court gave clearly instructed on burden of proof, clearly instructed on presumption of innocence, that it's just inconceivable to me that a lay jury could have taken that instruction about witnesses being presumed to speak the truth and could have turned that on the facts of this case into an instruction which did just the opposite, which placed the burden of proof on the defendant, and this is particularly true in this case because of what occurred at the time that the Jury had received its instruction and counsel took his exceptions to the instructions."
1973.72-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.633,402.555,"Mr. Solicitor General, despite the overwhelming evidences you say it guilt, I gather the Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court that this was case in which Harrington's harmless errors rules required."
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,402.555,404.141,Yes.
1973.72-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,404.141,409.284,So as it comes to us at least that issue of the harmless error is not before us.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,409.284,417.789,Well we think that it comes before the Court in two ways and maybe these are subtle statements of the same principle.
1973.72-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,417.789,420.005,But did you argue that?
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,420.005,420.496,Yes.
1973.72-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,420.496,420.998,Oh! You did.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,420.998,424.245,"Yes, we have raised both of those issues."
1973.72-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,476.841,486.404,So you suggest that the Ninth Circuit apparently adopted the view that any constitutional error which is quite judicial per se and that's what obligated the harmless error determination?
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,486.404,487.531,Yes.
1973.72-1148,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,521.945,523.732,You say not presented.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,523.732,532.243,"Pardon me, the burden of proof is on the State, that the State must prove its guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant is presumed to be innocent."
1973.72-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,695.886,700.271,"Is it permissible or is it not, under the Oregon stature, as I understand it."
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,700.271,702.615,Yes.
1973.72-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,702.615,706.513,"In your experiences, is it usually given or is it usually not given?"
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,706.513,709.809,This instruction was given for many years.
1973.72-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,715.43,717.376,"The statutes go back to 1862, you told us."
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,717.376,718.553,Yes.
1973.72-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,718.553,724.19,And there was a Californian statute from 1872 until 1965 saying the same thing.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,731.151,738.35,"I have had an occasion to speak to judicial conferences, of course, and I have been discouraged to give any of the instruction."
1973.72-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,750.835,753.131,Generally it's given is your experience.
1973.72-1148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,753.131,756.86,Even when the defendant doesn’t take the stand on testimony?
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,756.86,758.443,Yes.
1973.72-1148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,758.443,761.176,Nobody ever draws a line there?
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,761.176,774.137,"Well, this is an instruction that has been given for about a hundred years and it is only in the last few years, in fact this is the first known case in which anybody has challenged the instruction."
1973.72-1148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,774.137,787.605,"But, do you see any difference in the case where the defendant puts on -- the prosecution puts on eight witnesses and defendant puts on eight witnesses and the case where the prosecution puts on eight witnesses and the defendant puts on none, you don’t see any difference?"
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,787.605,790.161,I don’t see any difference in this instruction.
1973.72-1148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,790.161,791.407,That's what the government found.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,791.407,793.167,I don’t see any difference.
1973.72-1148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.355,825.494,They are not the prosecution’s witnesses.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,825.494,831.014,They are the prosecution’s witnesses only in the sense that the prosecution has chosen to call them.
1973.72-1148,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,831.014,834.239,And vouches for them.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,834.239,841.71,Well we have a rule of course as a matter of state practice that you can’t impeach your own witness by evidence of bad character or something else.
1973.72-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,841.71,843.717,But before these evidence -- they were held out.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,849.507,852.052,Exactly.
1973.72-1148,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,852.052,853.379,And you didn’t choose them.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,853.379,856.166,Right.
1973.72-1148,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,856.166,877.635,"In your brief and in the opposing brief the references made to the Mathes' book on Jury Instructions, the 61 edition and also these 65 revision, I see no reference to the 1970 edition in either brief, where the instruction is omitted."
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,877.635,879.37,Yes.
1973.72-1148,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,884.617,889.406,But maybe that source or the use among your trail judges is now eliminated.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,889.406,903.868,"Well, of course, Mathes's instructions are federal instructions and our State Courts as the most State Court have their own uniform jury instructions."
1973.72-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,903.868,914.026,"We see that the Mathes form by many, many years, but the Mathes form was almost universally disfavored, shall I put it by Court of Appeals?"
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,914.026,936.126,"Well it's unusual and that I think as we indicated Judge Mathes was a California Trial Judge and when he had the opportunity to prepare the uniform jury instructions, he put that in, apparently because of his California background, and it immediately met with disfavor by practically every circuit."
1973.72-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,936.126,946.159,Is this the only circuit to say however that it has a constitutional infirmity?
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,946.159,970.447,"There are cases -- many of the cases which, of course, are federal prosecutions, do speak in terms of constitutional infirmity, but they are talking in a context in which they don’t have to put it on constitutional grounds, because the Court of Appeals, of course, are free to suggest that the instruction is a poor one, which it well may be."
1973.72-1148,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,970.447,971.189,Supervised.
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,971.189,971.61,Yes.
1973.72-1148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,971.61,977.836,"The instruction is that at least one circuit reversed on the pure supervisory powers, I don’t know about the others."
1973.72-1148,0,32283,john_w_osburn,,977.836,979.993,Yes.
1973.72-1148,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1045.54,1049.043,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1054.126,1059.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1108.401,1115.09,Where did you find the burden of proof standards in the constitution?
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1115.09,1118.319,"It's in the Due Process Clause, Your Honor."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1120.466,1126.776,"It's rooted we now say, in the Due Process Clause, but it's not explicit anywhere in the constitution."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1126.776,1130.399,"No, it's not expressed, it's not expressed."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1165.622,1192.623,"But suppose counsel that this instruction had been given before any evidence went in as some trial judges in some courts do; give some general instructions of the jurors, particularly jurors at the outset of their service will grasp the burden of proof concept before they hear the evidence."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1199.859,1200.76,Now it makes a big difference.
1973.72-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1520.403,1522.688,On constitutional grounds?
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1522.688,1523.135,Pardon.
1973.72-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1523.135,1525.604,"On constitutional grounds, not always."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1525.604,1538.564,"I think it is very difficult to read both State cases and Circuit cases from the standpoint of whether they are federal constitutional grounds or supervisory or in the State cases, whether they are state constitutional grounds."
1973.72-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1538.564,1539.757,Or simply error.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1539.757,1540.858,Or simply error of our federal constitution.
1973.72-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1540.858,1543.972,The trial error of a non-constitutional magnitude.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1543.972,1546.892,"In State cases you have three choices, I guess."
1973.72-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.454,1603.37,This probably would arise in a case where the defendant put on witnesses.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1603.37,1605.049,"Well, I think the problem is still there."
1973.72-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1623.511,1640.772,"Well, but the instruction is, the presumption is that all the witnesses are telling the truth and that the prosecution’s witnesses say, he is the man and the defendant’s witnesses says, he is not the man."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1640.772,1641.006,Then it's of course --
1973.72-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1641.006,1643.546,It doesn't (Inaudible) appear that it balances.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1643.546,1650.41,"Then it's less burdensome for the defendant, but more irrational, because witnesses are almost contradictory and how can you have a presumption they are both telling the truth?"
1973.72-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1650.41,1656.823,"Well, but the instruction itself says there are many ways and this presumption could be overcome, does it not?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1656.823,1657.852,Yes.
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.056,1673.262,In general -- It's sort of a general instruction about the credibility of witnesses and how the Jury is to approach whether to believe a witness or not.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1681.099,1683.104,"No, not completely at large at all."
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.155,1691.053,"But, you wouldn't insist that they say that the State witnesses presume not to tell the truth."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1692.364,1694.259,"Well, I couldn’t object to it."
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.259,1695.746,"No, but you wouldnt insist on that."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1695.746,1697.341,I wouldn’t ask for it not at all.
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.567,1703.292,What are they supposed to -- they are supposed to be left completely in neutral.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1703.292,1709.117,"No, I know of no cases that holds that the Jury has to be turned loose at large."
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.257,1736.29,To presume.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1736.29,1744.71,"Well, that's why I reread the instruction where the jury has told what a presumption is."
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.274,1760.699,"But, it's a comment on how the Jury is -- whether Jury is to believe witness or not."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1760.699,1771.957,"No, I think it is not a comment in the sense of this is my opinion, take it or leave it or like an inference instruction is; this is telling the Jury that they must find unless it is rebutted."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1771.957,1776.795,Did you tell the Jury that they were the sole Judges and facts the usual --
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1776.795,1779.638,"Yes, right at the outset of the instruction."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1779.638,1784.294,Do you think that can somewhat nuetralise the --
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1784.294,1791.059,You would think so at first if you only read that -- this is a problem I think that was brought up in the Cool case from last year.
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.017,1849.312,So it's unconstitutional view to instruct the jury that they must believe a witness unless he is contradicted or un-contradicted evidence must be believed by the jury.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1849.312,1855.19,"Well I think if that is unconstitutional, it's probably unconstitutional under the Jury Clause."
1973.72-1148,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1868.461,1869.055,Mr. Runkel.
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.055,1876.359,"They then, in effect -- the judge in effect told the jury the witnesses you have heard you should believe."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1876.359,1878.42,You must believe.
1973.72-1148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.42,1888.603,But he did not qualify it by saying the manner of testifying might be taken in to consideration or the contradiction -- he gave the usual kind of qualifications you would expect.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1888.603,1893.164,"I think not Your Honor, they are not the usual ones."
1973.72-1148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1904.614,1923.712,"Let me ask you this Mr. Runkel, where it says every witness is presumed to speak the truth on Page 16 of Appendix, then it says this presumption may be overcome by the manner in which the witness testifies, by the nature of his of her testimony, by evidence effecting his or her character interest or motive."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1925.882,1938.935,"Yes as a matter of evidence, but you see that shifts the burden to the defendant to put on evidence, and in a criminal case the defendant has no obligation to either put on evidence as it relates to the affirmative case."
1973.72-1148,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.935,1947.499,"Well, but he can -- certainly you can show that the prosecution witness is biased by cross-examination without bringing any witness of your own."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1947.499,1962.404,"That's true, that's true, it can be done by cross-examination and there was a certain amount here, but there is also the burden of persuasion, and you maybe able to get the evidence on by the states on witnesses."
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1971.825,1983.561,But to me all this did was to disentitle the jury to disbelieve evidence that isn't contradicted.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1987.176,1988.269,I think they always are.
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.269,1988.578,Yes.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,1995.985,2004.318,They aren't -- no they are entitled in this case to disbelieve these witnesses and all of them if the defendant persuades them.
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2004.318,2010.983,"No, in this case where there weren't any other witnesses on the defendant side."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2019.12,2021.739,I think that's a slide over statement of my argument.
1973.72-1148,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2021.739,2027.403,Because they were told they could disbelieve it by the very manner in which the witness testified.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2027.403,2029.337,They were all entitled to disbelieve them.
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.337,2035.347,"Well then what's wrong with it, if they are all free to disbelieve them."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2035.347,2040.006,The problem is that burden of persuasion has to on the Government.
1973.72-1148,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.339,2058.172,"Well, why does the defendant has a right to cross-examination?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2059.483,2062.677,"That's separate clause of constitution, Your Honor."
1973.72-1148,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.677,2063.947,Well is that?
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2063.947,2065.523,Yes.
1973.72-1148,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2065.523,2072.57,"Well, suppose there was an instruction and the court said, you notice all the witnesses and took them all, I won’t tell you what that mean."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2075.998,2081.297,"I don’t think this is a case of perjury, Your Honor, perjury was mentioned by the solicitor."
1973.72-1148,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2081.297,2085.041,What is the difference between that and in saying he is presumed to tell the truth?
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2085.041,2097.576,"Truth means what the judge had said it means, which is that that's what the jury is there to find out, is the truth, and truth means objective truth not perjury or lying versus not lying."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.576,2115.253,"Why not the instruction that Justice Marshall just proposed, would you think that was unconstitutional, if the judge reminded them that the witnesses had taken an oath and if they have not told the truth they would be subjected to prosecution for perjury?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2115.253,2128.574,"I think that would -- I wouldn't object to it except that it's not a accurate statement of the law, because not telling the truth is not perjury, perjury is a deliberate and intentional lying on the material facts."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.574,2131.045,"I was taking a shortcut, read that into the instruction."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2131.045,2136.894,"Yes, okay, read and that's fine, but you see that is not what they are being told; they are being told --"
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2136.894,2143.229,"Do you think that's less objectionable, less impact on the defendant than what was said here?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2143.229,2145.788,Yes.
1973.72-1148,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2165.558,2180.241,"Well, Mr. Runkel I gather, at 16 after discussing presumptions and the fact the Court instructed, presumptions are to be accepted my you as truth unless outweighed or equaled."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2180.241,2180.919,"Yes, your Honor."
1973.72-1148,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2180.919,2196.181,"And then in the second succeeding paragraph, doesn't the Court instruct them how they may be outweighed or equaled namely, overcome by the manner in which the witness testifies, the nature of his or her testimony?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2196.181,2212.691,"Yes but that simply makes it a rebuttable presumption instead of an irrebuttable presumption, of course, an irrebuttable presumption would be worst, but the problem is that overcome means that now the defendant -- or equal means that now the defendant must carry at least a preponderance burden."
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.691,2225.052,No but the jury -- under that lays a jury on its own motion and its own mind could say this fellow testified in such a manner that we don’t believe him without defendant having to do a thing.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2225.052,2227.323,Not do a thing in terms of put on evidence.
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.323,2227.825,"No, or even argue --"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2227.825,2230.263,They must persuade them that they should think that --
1973.72-1148,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.263,2234.147,The jury has already made up his mind set.
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2240.163,2255.919,"Perhaps that's theoretically true, but I think we have to operate under the rule of the game that the jury will comply with the instructions of the court and will not make decisions based on things off the record."
1973.72-1148,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2255.919,2291.83,"I don’t suppose it would make any difference, but let me ask you Mr. Runkel, suppose in speaking of overcoming the presumption, this being a case where there was no evidence other than State's witnesses, had the court left out by evidence affecting his or her character, because so was none, by contradictory evidence, because so was none, and this has just been left with overcome by the manner in which the witness testifies, by the nature of his or her testimony, would you be making the same argument?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2291.83,2301.426,"Yes, simply because the burden is on the Government to persuade the jury that the facts are true."
1973.72-1148,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2301.426,2311.973,"Yes, but even though this tells the jury, in effect, if you just don't believe and you think the witness is lying then that's not end of the presumption."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2319.19,2329.722,if they believe -- if the defendant can persuade them by a preponderance that the witness is not telling a truth then the witness can be disregarded.
1973.72-1148,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2329.722,2331.965,May I ask you since I have interrupted you?
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2340.137,2343.496,"Yes, and I would like to distinguish that from I think it was --"
1973.72-1148,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2343.496,2344.426,May I ask you a first --
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2344.426,2345.1,Yes.
1973.72-1148,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2345.1,2353.238,"In your own experience, does it make a difference for the Trial Judge whether the defense has put on a case?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2353.238,2358.353,"I don't think I can answer that from my own experience, Your Honor."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2390.294,2394.055,"I think there is general agreement on that in the profession, don't you think?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2394.055,2422.409,"I think so, but it seems to me that when we are dealing with concept of due process and the burden of proof, that the States need or previous cases argued today talking about compelling state interest, state has virtually no interest at all in having this instruction, and in the due process area, I think the State's need is a relevant criterion."
1973.72-1148,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2432.476,2441.858,"How do you read what the Ninth Circuit had said about harmless error, it's constitutional error automatically -- it is a judicial --"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2441.858,2444.502,It's never been the rule in Ninth Circuit and --
1973.72-1148,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2444.502,2452.24,"Well, what what does this language mean in the opinion?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2476.837,2495.709,"Well, I think that's the law under Chapman and Harrington, and the court, the Ninth Circuit is simply saying that the State has not carried its burden of showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, which is I think an impossible thing to do in any event."
1973.72-1148,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2530.451,2539.88,"Well, your argument does rest on our acceptance of your proposition that this was a constitutional error, instruction is a constitutional error, doesn't it?"
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2539.88,2570.071,"Absolutely, and the fact that the evidence was sufficient does not mean that the error was harmless, because you can stack up 15 or 20 witnesses and if you presume that they have all told the truth, then you would never have a burden on the State and any case would be harmless."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2570.071,2582.044,Evidence a little bit more than sufficient we would say -- you are not suggesting that it is just to enough to get the jury --
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2582.044,2585.684,"Well, I don't think there is any distinction that we made between just enough to get a jury and --"
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2585.684,2588.696,"Well, that's a different point."
1973.72-1148,1,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2596.138,2610.789,"No I think the only relevant point is what if the juror complied with the instructions, what logical steps would he take in reaching his burden, apart from the quantity or the quality of the evidence."
1973.72-1148,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2650.017,2651.873,Do you have anything further Mr. Solicitor General?
1973.72-1148,2,32283,john_w_osburn,,2651.873,2655.617,Just briefly your honor.
1973.72-1148,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2711.287,2712.796,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1973.72-1148,3,40375,ross_r_runkel,,2725.942,2732.436,Thank you Your Honor.
1973.72-1148,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2732.436,2735.433,The case is submitted.
