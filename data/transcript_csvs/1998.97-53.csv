1998.97-53,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.708,"We'll hear argument now in No. 97-53, Jane M. Roberts v. Galen of Virginia, Inc.--"
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,10.408,13.951,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-53,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,73.77,88.638,"Mr. Mattingly, do you contend that this statute, this emergency medical care statute, incorporates some kind of substantive standard of medical care?"
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,88.638,112.503,"Justice O'Connor, the statute provides, number one, a duty on the part of the hospital to provide an appropriate medical screening examination, and it does, by definition of some of the key terms, refer to an obligation on the hospitals not to transfer patients if that transfer would cause a substantial deterioration in a patient's condition."
1998.97-53,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.48,140.724,"Well, it says... it doesn't really talk about deterioration."
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,151.759,152.14,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-53,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.249,183.59,"Now, in... in... in this situation, if Ms. Johnson had been stabilized at the time she was initially admitted to the emergency room, could she then have been transferred?"
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,183.59,186.792,"Your Honor, again, if... if--"
1998.97-53,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.792,194.629,"I mean, is... doesn't this statute really focus on what happens in the emergency room and the stabilization there?"
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,201.422,204.574,"--Justice O'Connor, in my opinion no."
1998.97-53,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.136,207.326,No.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,207.326,209.867,--that the parties have had an opportunity to fully brief--
1998.97-53,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.867,220.016,I just wondered what your view of it was because on the surface it would appear that this statute just addresses itself to emergency room care.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,220.016,222.329,"--I would disagree with that analysis for a couple of reasons, Your Honor."
1998.97-53,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.462,270.279,"Well, presumably this argument would be open in any event on remand if... if we agree with you that there's no improper motive requirement."
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,270.279,276.243,"--Honestly, Justice O'Connor, it would be our argument at the district court that that entire argument was waived."
1998.97-53,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.865,303.881,"I know that this doesn't enter into our decision at all, but where is Ms. Johnson today?"
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,305.414,306.804,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-53,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.214,336.556,"With respect to the response you just gave that it would be your position that these points were waived, but going in, there was a solid precedent of the Sixth Circuit that the district court was obliged to follow."
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,341.919,343.311,Justice--
1998.97-53,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,343.311,344.46,--to... to bring up things?
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,360.362,385.798,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think that you are correct, that there is Sixth Circuit precedent that would support an argument that... that the obligations of this statute apply outside of an emergency room, and that I believe is the reason that the hospital didn't raise this issue from the very beginning of the case because it was pretty clear that... that the precedent in our circuit is that it's not limited to... to emergency room treatment."
1998.97-53,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,401.739,404.751,But she was there for some weeks.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,415.056,421.281,"Again, Justice Ginsburg, that is... that is an issue that unfortunately didn't get fully briefed."
1998.97-53,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,440.584,440.985,Section what?
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,440.985,442.255,--Section (a) of the statute.
1998.97-53,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,442.255,443.246,8?
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,443.246,443.677,(a).
1998.97-53,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.677,444.386,(a)?
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,444.386,444.857,Yes.
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.06,514.133,I guess (a) certainly envisions hospitals that don't have emergency departments.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,529.614,531.627,"--No, I would not agree with that, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.865,532.807,I'm trying to help you.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,536.51,537.491,--I would welcome your help.
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.491,538.162,But you're free to disagree.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,538.162,558.384,"I believe that section (a), the requirement that... that a hospital conduct an appropriate medical screening examination, would apply to any hospital that holds itself out as providing emergency services whether they have a departmentalized emergency room, whether it's a... for example, a psychiatric hospital that--"
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.384,561.158,What hospital doesn't provide emergency services?
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,564.11,568.803,--I'm not familiar with a hospital in Kentucky who does not.
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.803,570.703,I'd hate to think there is one.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,591.027,591.558,Section (a)?
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.558,592.139,Yes.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,592.139,592.439,No.
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.439,593.32,Okay.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,596.88,597.271,Correct.
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.271,598.241,Okay.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,598.241,601.845,"Section (b), it would appear to me, is a much broader scope."
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.762,612.814,The very point I was making.
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,612.814,613.054,Mm hmm.
1998.97-53,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.785,623.049,"And without that, all you had to do to... to evade the apparent intention of the statute is simply not to open an emergency department."
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,623.049,639.19,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and that's why section (b) in my view is a broader... a broader section of the statute than section (a) because if there are hospitals that don't provide emergency services or close their emergency departments, section (b) still provides some obligation on that hospital."
1998.97-53,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,693.998,699.261,The State causes of action were... were dismissed?
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,699.261,701.684,Not all of the State causes of action.
1998.97-53,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.378,742.0,"So... so, the Federal law has a respondent superior theory that the State law does not?"
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,742.0,746.104,It would appear that the statute imposes direct liability.
1998.97-53,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.125,749.655,"Well, for... for anybody's acts?"
1998.97-53,0,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,749.655,758.684,--Anyone's acts who have a substantial impact on the decisions that the hospital is required to make under the statute.
1998.97-53,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.839,892.099,"Very well, Mr. Mattingly."
1998.97-53,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,893.421,904.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-53,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.135,940.671,"When you say raised for the first time in respondent's brief on the merits, Mr. Feldman, you mean they were not raised in the lower courts or that they were... that was the first time they were raised in this Court?"
1998.97-53,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,940.671,944.075,--They... it was certainly the first time they were raised in this Court.
1998.97-53,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,977.477,979.087,You're referring to section (b).
1998.97-53,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,979.087,979.337,Right.
1998.97-53,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.337,983.611,"And the case that the court of appeals relied on came up under section (a), did it not?"
1998.97-53,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,983.611,984.95,That's correct.
1998.97-53,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.306,997.229,There's no requirement in subsection (b) that there be an appropriate medical screening.
1998.97-53,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,997.229,999.209,--They don't... it doesn't use the word appropriate.
1998.97-53,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1068.184,1073.798,"Well, what was the basis of Congress' legislative jurisdiction here... legislative authority?"
1998.97-53,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1073.798,1075.14,--The constitutional basis?
1998.97-53,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1075.14,1075.351,Yes.
1998.97-53,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1075.351,1078.093,I think it was both the Spending Clause and the Commerce Clause.
1998.97-53,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1095.714,1103.707,"So... so, it isn't... it doesn't apply to a hospital just by virtue of the fact that the hospital might be dealing in interstate commerce."
1998.97-53,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1103.707,1104.609,That's correct.
1998.97-53,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1181.589,1195.881,"Does the Secretary currently have no position on a case like this where the stabilization, according to the plaintiff, takes weeks, even months to occur?"
1998.97-53,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1195.881,1197.293,The... there is no position.
1998.97-53,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.88,1300.41,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1301.872,1305.315,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-53,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1344.779,1353.057,"Well, now, the theories, though, that you do put forward were not ones that were aired in the court below I take it."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1353.057,1354.747,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor, although--"
1998.97-53,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1354.747,1361.261,That makes it awfully hard for us to deal with because they aren't even well briefed here I think.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1361.261,1364.323,"--Well, I hope at least in part they're well briefed."
1998.97-53,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1364.323,1364.493,"Well, maybe one side."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1381.786,1390.922,"To be sure, and... and... and the question really is, is this a proper instance in which the Court ought to exercise its discretion to resolve a... a pure question of law."
1998.97-53,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1420.74,1425.554,"But, Mr. Phillips, there's one question of what you could do on remand and the other, what you can do here."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1445.556,1448.0,"--Well, there's no question about that, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.97-53,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.253,1493.959,"Mr. Phillips, as I understand, Mr. Feldman's point is that this area is under review by the Secretary who's contemplating regulations and so forth."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1499.682,1520.676,"--I... I think on... on the two particular questions that we're talking about, we would almost certainly be in what I would regard as a Chevron One world where Congress has spoken quite specifically to the particular problems, the two questions being, does EMTALA end when a hospital admits the patient for... for treatment of... of the emergency medical condition?"
1998.97-53,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1559.721,1567.787,"Well, let me ask you how you read subsection (b) as opposed to (a) of section 1395."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1567.787,1568.218,Subsection--
1998.97-53,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1568.218,1578.703,"I'm looking at 42 U.S. Code, section 1395d(b), which is examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions and women in labor."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1578.703,1578.953,--Right.
1998.97-53,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1578.953,1585.939,Subsection (a) refers to a medical screening requirement in the case of a hospital that has an emergency department.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1585.939,1586.179,Correct.
1998.97-53,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1586.179,1600.408,"(b) says in general if any individual comes to a hospital and the hospital determines the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must do blah, blah, blah."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1600.408,1600.688,Yes.
1998.97-53,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1601.039,1609.644,"Now, does that kick in in the situation of a patient who's already in the hospital and develops an emergency condition?"
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1616.27,1616.43,--No.
1998.97-53,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.86,1635.691,The statute doesn't apply at all.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1635.691,1635.861,Correct.
1998.97-53,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1724.063,1725.993,Is it a cert worthy question of law at this point?
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1730.335,1736.8,"Every court of appeals that has addressed this issue to date has embraced our... well, no, that's true."
1998.97-53,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.557,1807.158,"But, Mr. Phillips, we're told... we were told this morning that the Secretary is planning to have a rule making, and doesn't prudence dictate that we... we await that full development at the agency level before attempting to... I mean, it's extraordinary for this Court to take a first view of an issue rather than to serve as a court of review."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1807.158,1813.3,"--Well, obviously the announcement this morning was as much a surprise to me as it presumably was to the Court."
1998.97-53,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1850.035,1850.325,"No, but isn't it true--"
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1850.325,1851.557,--ask the Court to resolve that question.
1998.97-53,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.557,1858.65,"--Isn't it true, Mr. Phillips, that the... there is an issue of fact as to whether the patient had ever stabilized?"
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1859.071,1861.722,"Well, I don't know what stabilized means in that context."
1998.97-53,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1861.722,1862.961,"Well, maybe that's part of the problem."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1862.961,1865.455,But that's not the statutory language that's relevant here.
1998.97-53,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.297,1874.871,"Well, is there an issue of fact as to whether she continued to be in an emergency medical condition?"
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1874.871,1885.14,"I don't know that there is a... no, there's not a shred of evidence in this record... and it would be the plaintiff's burden to bring forward the evidence... that demonstrated that she was in an emergency medical condition at the time of this transfer."
1998.97-53,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1896.266,1896.874,But are you suggesting--
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1896.874,1897.935,--thought stabilized meant in that context.
1998.97-53,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.935,1905.901,"--Is it your legal position that even if she was not stabilized at the time, she could have been transferred because she was not in an emergency medical condition?"
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1906.652,1912.695,"Yes, because I believe that it being an emergency medical condition is a precondition to any of the other obligations with respect to a transfer."
1998.97-53,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.695,1918.72,And stabilized has a meaning other than the termination of the emergency medical condition.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1918.72,1920.442,"That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1998.97-53,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.55,2021.896,"I... I thought hospitals just didn't provide 2 and a half months of treatment anymore, that the idea was a hospital was a place where you went for, you know, some sort of serious surgery, and you know, they got you out of there in about 3 days."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2021.896,2027.63,"Well, to be sure, Mr. Chief Justice, that... is the... the effort that's usually put in."
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2055.92,2066.82,What... what is it exactly that you... as I read the statute... let's see if I'm right... that a person comes to a hospital and the hospital... that person has an emergency medical condition.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2069.241,2070.152,"Okay, Justice Breyer."
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.152,2079.388,"Now, what you have to do as a hospital is you have to keep that person there until the person stabilizes."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2080.518,2080.748,No.
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2081.639,2086.721,"Well, it says you have to give such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition--"
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2086.721,2088.462,--The only... my only objection--
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.462,2088.822,--or--
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2088.822,2091.025,--The next subsection also says--
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.025,2095.178,--or... or transfer to another facility in accordance with (c).
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2095.178,2095.368,--Right.
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.368,2107.757,"And (c) says unless the person agrees or unless the doctor says it's going to... she's going to be better off in that other place, in the absence of those two things, the person has to be stabilized."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2107.757,2109.018,Right.
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.018,2119.374,"It says... so... so, I take it here you haven't got a doctor who's going to say she's better off, and the person hasn't agreed, and so you have to keep her unless she's stabilized."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2160.089,2161.892,"Well, you're not right."
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.283,2164.473,"Well... no, then fine."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2167.756,2171.496,What the statute says is that if... if you don't make a decision to admit her--
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.496,2171.927,Yes.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2171.927,2175.671,"--you decide you're going to transfer her, you have to follow one of two courses."
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.671,2175.981,Right.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2175.981,2189.399,"You have to provide her stabilizing care, that is, care that within a reasonable medical probability is designed to ensure that her emergency medical condition will not deteriorate during or from the transfer."
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2189.399,2189.76,Yes.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2189.76,2191.96,"That's the care you provide, and then you transfer her."
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.96,2192.18,Yes.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2192.18,2203.618,"If, on the other hand, you decide you can't do that for whatever reason and you transfer her anyway, then you have to go through (c) which requires consent and the certification and all the rest of the process that follows from that."
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.509,2205.08,All right.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2206.081,2207.831,--was that I have to keep her in some sense.
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.831,2208.001,"--No, no."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2216.076,2216.507,Okay.
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.156,2232.358,How could we--
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2232.358,2233.998,--from the ashes after it's been satisfied.
1998.97-53,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.998,2245.455,--How could we hold that if the statute says you have to give her treatment to stabilize the condition or she has to have been stabilized before you can transfer her without her consent?
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2247.988,2263.59,Because the... the question is what are the three... what are the options that are available under this statute to the hospital: to transfer her and what you have to do in order to do that... and there are two different ways you can proceed with respect to transfer... or you can admit her.
1998.97-53,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.083,2310.971,"Because... because (b)A in particular, when it says that the hospital must provide either within the staff and facilities for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition, the word stabilize there has a very technical meaning, doesn't it?"
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2310.971,2311.962,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-53,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.962,2318.287,"As defined, it means to assure no deterioration during transfer."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2318.287,2320.198,Specifically during the period of transfer.
1998.97-53,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.679,2323.991,"So, it's not the normal meaning that you'd... you'd attribute to stabilize."
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2323.991,2324.162,Right.
1998.97-53,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2340.691,2347.395,"After admission of the patient, can an... a new emergency condition arise, I mean, absent her falling or something like that?"
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2347.395,2356.873,"--I... I don't believe, Justice Kennedy, that this statute would come back in under those circumstances because you're in the hospital, you're not being... you're not... because it talks about coming to the hospital."
1998.97-53,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2359.715,2361.876,Comes to a hospital.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2361.876,2362.066,Right.
1998.97-53,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2382.749,2385.563,Because State law provides adequate remedies.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2385.563,2389.734,"Absolutely, Justice Kennedy, I believe State law does provide remedies."
1998.97-53,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2389.734,2401.122,"What in your view, Mr. Phillips, is the office of (c) which says that there are two conditions under which you could transfer?"
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2414.322,2414.562,Right.
1998.97-53,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2485.719,2486.299,Can you... can you maybe try it once?
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2523.653,2525.576,"No, I don't believe the statute has been violated."
1998.97-53,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2525.576,2525.746,All right.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2538.095,2546.557,"Well, except that the... well, I suppose that you're right in the sense that the stabilized with respect to the car ride would itself cause her a particular problem."
1998.97-53,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2556.995,2566.812,What it does say is that stabilized means that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or during the transfer.
1998.97-53,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2593.878,2612.552,"I don't dispute that... that there is a technical reading of the statute that would support that particular outcome, but it is... but the... but it is so counter both to State law and to... to intuitive judgment about what a hospital would do that I don't think it's within intendment of this particular statute."
1998.97-53,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2702.562,2704.293,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
1998.97-53,3,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,2707.305,2711.489,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and I would like to point out just a few things."
1998.97-53,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2738.957,2744.34,But that may not be the focus of Congress' intent in this act.
1998.97-53,3,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,2752.786,2753.306,That may--
1998.97-53,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2753.306,2754.117,--that sort of thing.
1998.97-53,3,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,2756.599,2761.731,"--Yes, that... that may be true, Justice O'Connor, that that was the primary focus of Congress."
1998.97-53,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2930.925,2933.476,"Congress would have said determines or should have determined, wouldn't it?"
1998.97-53,3,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,2933.476,2937.329,If Congress meant determines or... or should have determined--
1998.97-53,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2937.329,2937.489,Yes.
1998.97-53,3,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,2942.803,2948.927,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, actually what I mean is... is if... if the plaintiff can prove even a higher standard than that."
1998.97-53,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2959.515,2962.066,How would that fit under determine?
1998.97-53,3,31711,joseph_h_mattingly_iii,,2969.222,2985.563,"Mr. Chief Justice, I agree that there are several interpretations of that section of the statute, and I point that out only to... to again argue to the Court that those kinds of issues that are raised for the first time now have not been adequately briefed by anybody."
1998.97-53,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2987.313,2989.957,"Thank you, Mr. Mattingly."
