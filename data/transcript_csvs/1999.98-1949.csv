1999.98-1949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.518,"We'll hear argument now in Number 98-1949, Lori Pegram v. Cynthia Herdrich."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,10.482,13.328,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1949,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,65.388,73.973,"Well now, I gather that the Ms. Herdrich did recover in a malpractice action in this very case."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,73.973,84.552,"--In this very case, Justice O'Connor, she... the defendants were found liable, and she received 35,000 as full compensation for her... for the injuries that she suffered."
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.871,112.912,The question isn't whether there's some reason.
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,115.367,116.348,"--That's absolutely true, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.706,118.417,"I mean, it's really not a policy question that's up to us."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,120.05,120.831,--That's right.
1999.98-1949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,162.55,167.084,"Mr. Phillips, would you clarify one thing?"
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,191.109,228.293,"I think actually Judge Easterbrook, in his dissenting opinion below, had the better of that argument, and he argued, and I think quite rightly, that the allegations in the respondent's complaint basically lay out the kinds of incentives that are inherent in any managed care operation in terms of questions of medical necessity, experimental treatment... all of the elements that go into trying to control what was in the 1980's an extraordinarily expensive health care system are embodied in the Carle Clinic's managed care plan, so in that sense I don't think it is significantly different from any other managed care operation, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.98-1949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,228.293,230.726,"Mr. Phillips, could you just clarify one simple point for me?"
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,241.634,244.274,I think it's very difficult to know.
1999.98-1949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,287.389,290.413,"You don't contend there isn't really a live case here, though?"
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,290.413,290.645,"Oh, no."
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.727,303.969,Mr.--
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,306.656,308.749,"Well, she is... I mean, what she is seeking--"
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.749,310.546,"Is a judgment, but not a remedy."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,310.546,311.066,--Is a judgment with--
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.066,311.775,A judgment is not a remedy.
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,311.775,319.17,"--No, no, I understand that, Justice Scalia, but what she is seeking is... I mean, her claim is that there is a pot of money and that that pot of money can be moved around."
1999.98-1949,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.235,356.461,"Mr. Phillips, are there any circumstances under which an HMO can be found to be a fiduciary, for instance, in administering claims or benefits to which a covered employee is entitled?"
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,356.461,367.617,I think there are some circumstances in which that would be certainly the case under the narrower of... narrowest of the theories that we put forward in opposition to the judgment below.
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.378,412.783,Why is that?
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,417.467,423.837,There is no allegation in the complaint as it's defended before this Court with respect to coverage allegations.
1999.98-1949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,439.43,440.461,"Where are you reading from, Mr.--"
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,440.461,440.884,--I'm sorry.
1999.98-1949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.837,445.155,--Whereabouts on page 9?
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,445.155,447.473,"It's sort of in the middle, as I recall."
1999.98-1949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.252,455.772,Thank you.
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,455.772,456.565,--and I'll just quote it.
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.868,475.614,To people who are covered?
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,475.614,476.156,Yes.
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.156,478.882,"To people who are covered, not excluding people from coverage?"
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,478.882,479.924,"Right, exactly."
1999.98-1949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,479.924,480.225,Suppose you--
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,524.908,527.449,"Well, I think you have to read that in context, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.98-1949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,644.261,654.177,"Suppose that you go to your doctor and you give him or his staff your health care policy, your HMO policy and you say, I can't understand this stuff."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,682.404,684.868,--I think there is a possibility of a situation like that arising.
1999.98-1949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,738.527,751.734,Do we talk about the employee or the patient's legitimate expectation as to what that employee is receiving from the doctors?
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,765.998,773.32,I think it would be a mistake to hinge ERISA scope on the subjective intent of the patient under these circumstances.
1999.98-1949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.32,774.874,Reasonable legitimate expectations.
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,774.874,799.043,"Well, even that I think is probably a mistake, because the question... the question is, you know, you're in a fiduciary world when you're administering a plan, and the question is... and then you have... because then you have a whole series of questions, is there a breach of fiduciary duty, and what the remedy for it is, and what I'm suggesting is, I don't think the Court wants to get into the business of saying that this is, in fact, a fiduciary relationship based on ERISA."
1999.98-1949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,801.609,807.943,"But how do we get out of... I mean, the statute says that a fiduciary is a person under ERISA."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,823.242,823.543,Right.
1999.98-1949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,823.543,827.331,"Then what they've alleged... whether it's true or not, they've alleged it."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,871.904,873.62,"Well, there are two answers to that, Justice Breyer."
1999.98-1949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.004,896.195,"Oh, I just read, was reading from the--"
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,896.195,904.501,"--Justice Breyer, but the question is, what does she mean by those particular words, because all she's really doing there is alleging how the plan operates and then using the statutory language."
1999.98-1949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,934.971,939.617,"--So you say forget Roman numeral ii, small ii, just focus on i."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,939.617,942.229,Just read it in the way the respondent has asked you to read it.
1999.98-1949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.875,951.504,But then you're making of this a pleading case.
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,955.027,955.753,Right.
1999.98-1949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,955.753,967.668,"So if we accept your position it goes back, and they amend the complaint to say no, we're talking about the role of this HMO in making eligibility and coverage determinations."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,967.668,976.052,"You assume, Justice Ginsburg, that she simply somehow made a mistake here rather than a conscious judgment to attack what it is that is the gravamen of her complaint."
1999.98-1949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,984.969,989.896,"In a sense this has to be a pleading case, because the district court granted a motion to dismiss."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,989.896,991.295,"--Oh, absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.48,1011.838,"Mr. Phillips, is it clear that making a determination as to coverage is the exercise of discretion in the administration of a plan?"
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1011.838,1013.685,"No, it's not clear."
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.602,1018.678,"I hate to depart from that as a premise, because I'm not sure that premise is correct."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1018.678,1028.95,"I don't accept that premise either, but what I'm asking the Court to do is to avoid having to address that issue by reaching what I think is a narrower and much simpler ground for reversal in this particular case."
1999.98-1949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1028.95,1047.127,"Let me ask you a... it may be a too-simple question, but I understand your answer to Justice Breyer, but I think, like him and maybe some others here, I can't help but think of what the next case is going to be, depending on how narrowly or broadly we might decide this, if we decide it in your favor."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1131.891,1132.836,"No, Justice Souter, and I don't have--"
1999.98-1949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1132.836,1134.647,"--If I am, you're going to be in trouble later."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1136.091,1139.097,"--I might be in trouble already, but... no, I don't have any problem with that."
1999.98-1949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1146.86,1147.263,Right.
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1147.263,1152.547,The Court ought to just focus on what it is she has alleged and leave for another day the situation you pose.
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.063,1159.76,In his hypothetical the person at the front desk may be an employee of the physician's.
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1163.936,1164.493,I assume that was--
1999.98-1949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.493,1173.268,"The whole HMO is owned by physicians, so you know, if some secretary at the front desk... it's the physician's, because they own the HMO and employ the secretary."
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1173.268,1174.702,--That's true.
1999.98-1949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1183.811,1193.279,"Mr. Phillips, wasn't it emphasized by the other side that if only there were somebody else making the coverage and eligibility decisions, if only that, they would have no complaint?"
1999.98-1949,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1208.634,1223.286,"--Well, I would read page 9 of their complaint once again and tell you what the sole focus of their claim is, which is that the physician-incentive system causes the physician to withhold... I mean, the compensation system causes the physician to withhold treatment."
1999.98-1949,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1226.063,1227.168,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1229.312,1244.091,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1292.163,1305.262,"It's also your position, I take it, that not every claim of an error in the claim processing function without more would state a breach of... a claim for breach of fiduciary duty?"
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1305.262,1306.327,That's true.
1999.98-1949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1306.327,1311.688,"In other words, if they just get it wrong, if a fiduciary just gets it wrong, that's not a breach of fiduciary duty without something more."
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1311.688,1325.309,"That's true, but insofar as the fiduciary is someone... it's an error that had to do with the exercise of discretion under the plan in deciding what... whether a certain kind of procedure is covered, then it would be a breach of fiduciary duty."
1999.98-1949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.844,1343.083,"How do you... you see, I never thought that a judge has discretion in deciding whether the law means this or that."
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1360.099,1392.16,"I think discretion in this sense is used in the terms of applying the plan terms to a wide variety, sometimes fairly vague plan terms to a wide variety of different cases, and that does have something in common with what judges do, and judges do exercise discretion sometimes, but in the Varity Corporation v. Howe, the Court said... I'm reading from page 511, 516 U.S. on 511... a plan administrator engages in a fiduciary act when making discretionary determination about whether a claimant is entitled to benefits under the terms of the plan documents."
1999.98-1949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.713,1457.579,May I ask you a question?
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1475.441,1476.234,Right.
1999.98-1949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.565,1486.685,It doesn't mean you always have to rule in favor of the--
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1486.685,1486.98,--That's right.
1999.98-1949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.351,1511.81,"--If you have an ambiguous plan document, if its duty is to act solely in the interests of the participant or the beneficiaries, it's a pretty tough standard."
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1511.81,1537.06,"--Well, I... I don't think it's, though... I think the sense of, in the interests of the participant or the beneficiary, what that means there is to make determinations under... as to what's covered and what's not covered in accordance... strictly in accordance with the terms of the plan, not in accordance with other considerations either for or against the particular individual, because that beneficiary doesn't have the right to anything, other than what the plan document's entitles him or her to."
1999.98-1949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1537.06,1543.517,But Mr. Feld... that makes perfect sense except when you bear in mind what you said a moment ago to Justice Scalia.
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1561.495,1562.298,"No, I don't think that that's--"
1999.98-1949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1562.298,1568.42,You've always got to choose the point in the reasonable spectrum that gives the plaintiff what the... the patient what the patient wants.
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1571.711,1572.438,"--In fact, the Court--"
1999.98-1949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1572.438,1573.328,--Or it's not a fiduciary--
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1573.328,1587.569,"--In fact, the Court has held, I think, quite to the contrary, that where a fiduciary under ERISA is given discretion by the plan to make those kinds of determinations, courts will accord deference to the discretion given to the fiduciary--"
1999.98-1949,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1587.569,1588.758,"--Mr. Feldman, I had thought--"
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1588.758,1600.146,--within some range where the fiduciary doesn't have... isn't... the plan documents don't give the fiduciary any discretion and the courts don't accord it and will decide any legal suits that arise from it based just on the terms of the plan.
1999.98-1949,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.146,1618.402,"--You seem not to be taking the position that I thought would be the one that you would take, which is that the word beneficiaries is plural, and sometimes what may be in the best interests of a particular plaintiff could be against the interests of the class of beneficiaries."
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1624.028,1638.03,"The... it's... there are certainly many circumstances under which ERISA fiduciaries do have a duty to the plan as a whole, where, for example, they are sitting on a trust, on some assets."
1999.98-1949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.63,1675.539,"--Mr. Feldman, couldn't the administrator say, if I resolve every single debatable point in favor of each beneficiary, other beneficiaries are going to suffer?"
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1675.539,1694.797,"--Well, you know, I just don't think that that's quite right, because this person, fiduciary, this kind of limited purpose fiduciary... it's not a general fiduciary who's a trustee of the plan, but it's someone who's just a fiduciary insofar as this person is making... is ruling on a claim for benefits."
1999.98-1949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.772,1701.203,"Yes, that's--"
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1701.203,1707.92,"And because there's a contract here the fiduciary is supposed to be applying that contract to the terms of this claim, and whatever it permits--"
1999.98-1949,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.92,1710.781,--You yourself had said the terms can be very vague.
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1710.781,1720.125,"--Right, and they should be construing them in a reasonable, consistent way, and so on, not always... certainly not always in favor of the beneficiary, not against the beneficiary."
1999.98-1949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1720.125,1725.949,"Well, what we're talking about here is not a particular decision in relation to a particular beneficiary, I thought."
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1738.858,1739.63,That's... yes.
1999.98-1949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1739.63,1741.164,"And that, isn't that the issue before us?"
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1741.164,1742.454,"That's correct, except--"
1999.98-1949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1742.454,1742.972,All right.
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1743.43,1744.172,--Except--
1999.98-1949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.172,1757.388,"--When you apply it you have to look at this beneficiary, but when you're deciding specifically whether to have a rule that gives an incentive to doctors to do X, Y, or Z, that's a matter for all the beneficiaries, isn't it?"

1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1783.993,1786.509,--But as far as the doctors are not.
1999.98-1949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1813.636,1814.321,Okay.
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1815.194,1815.827,--I think that would raise a serious problem.
1999.98-1949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1815.827,1816.536,"All right, fine."
1999.98-1949,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1835.916,1845.726,And I would... our position is that the... you start off from the point that ERISA specifically recognizes that benefits can be provided through insurance or otherwise.

1999.98-1949,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2175.814,2184.535,How many HMO's fall in this pattern of physician-owned... you said that you thought most were not that way.

1999.98-1949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2421.153,2423.042,Would you respond a little more directly?
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2423.042,2444.631,"I think that there is a difference between the scenario that you have suggested and a scenario where the claims determiners are the ones who are doing the determination of the actuarial underwriting so that they know what's going to be in that risk pool at the end of the year and, to the extent that they can deny claims, there's more money in the risk pool for distribution at year-end to them."
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2444.631,2446.772,"Well, there's a difference perhaps in degree."
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2501.205,2503.932,"It's the mechanism that we're focusing on here, Your Honor."
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2503.932,2528.654,"But why... I know it is, but why does the mechanism make a difference, because what you say is wrong with the mechanism is that it induces these so-called fiduciaries to say, no care for you, but that same mechanism operating at a perhaps less obvious level is inherent in any HMO, so I don't see why the mechanism makes the difference."
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2528.654,2541.997,"The mechanism makes the difference here because these physicians in their capacity as owners of this HMO are getting paid bonuses to deny care, and let me explain that a little bit further."
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2586.928,2602.689,"In effect, the... the rule of decision that you want us to come down with I think is, we've just got to draw lines here and say, the breach of fiduciary duty is clear when the doctors get a year-end payment and make the decision."
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2620.434,2627.717,"--I am not asking this Court to outlaw physician incentives, to declare them illegal."
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2627.717,2634.944,"Right, and in order not to do so, aren't you asking us for a rule of decision something like what I just put to you?"
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2634.944,2649.521,"There is going to have to be a line drawn, and I think that the line is drawn with reference to incentives reaching the level of undue influence so that it affects patient care."
1999.98-1949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2649.521,2666.143,"Now, suppose... you may have a very good answer to this, and I'm on exactly the same track, but take as separate a person as you want, you know, somebody who has nothing to do with doctors, that works for the ERISA trust plan of a company, and that person says, here's what our plan's going to do."
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2692.397,2697.029,"Because the rule that we're suggesting here is not that broad, Your Honor."
1999.98-1949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.029,2719.79,"I know, but what I... see, my rule draws its strength from the fact that we know there are a group of ethical rules governing medicine, and doctors, we believe, governed by this when they take the 3,300, will try to look for the best way of saving the patient anyway, and if they can do so with a little saving extra money, that's to their benefit."
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2731.071,2748.58,"Because that type of incentive doesn't rise to the level of undue influence that is going to have a deleterious effect, necessarily, on patient health care, and let me point the Court to the study that was performed in 1998 out in California."
1999.98-1949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2809.514,2815.195,"Well, do you think they all attributed the same meaning to the word unduly, which is extremely vague?"

1999.98-1949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2836.283,2854.487,"Well then, I take your answer to be that you're saying that I thought what was a good legal rule isn't, and you don't mind that if I decide for you we also make unlawful under ERISA the rule that I talked about, the 3,300 per patient, or are you going to distinguish it?"
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2854.487,2856.518,--I think you have to distinguish it.
1999.98-1949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2856.518,2856.828,All right.
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2868.043,2888.826,"Depending on what the rate of capitation is in your hypothetical, it might be a violation of the rule that I'm suggesting, but what I'm suggesting is that the courts should make that determination on a case-by-case basis and just not exempt entire groups--"

1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,2958.204,3000.515,"Let me respond firstly by saying I'm only aware of one case where a Federal court specifically addressed the issue of whether or not the ethical opinions promulgated by the American Medical Association are enough to counterbalance an incentive that a doctor might have to cut care, and that decision I cited in my... I believe it was the reply at the writ stage, and that court decided that the ethical opinions aren't enough to counterbalance strong financial incentives, and therefore we can't rely on the physicians' ethics in situations like this."

1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3144.386,3144.973,That's correct.

1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3167.606,3170.717,This is not a denial of benefits case.

1999.98-1949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3254.125,3256.709,So it goes back to the HMO.

1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3286.872,3288.635,It's not a coverage case.
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3291.878,3295.34,It's a breach of fiduciary duty case.
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3295.34,3298.343,Resulting in what kind of harm?
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3312.289,3319.329,The harm is that the money that is paid into the risk pool by State Farm and the employee... because this is a contributory plan.
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3329.313,3332.563,So you're basically making a financial management claim.
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3334.646,3337.971,"Yes, absolutely."
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3389.882,3396.576,"Well, I will... you know, I will assume that, but may I just come back to a follow-up question."
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3402.469,3403.627,Yes.
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3403.627,3447.155,"--am I right that in order for you, which I think we've all been assuming, am I right that in order for you to make out your case that there has been mismanagement of funds, it's necessary for us to accept the proposition that whenever a physician in an HMO has a strong financial incentive to make a medical decision, that that medical decision is therefore a fiduciary decision, and is therefore... and therefore a claim against him is preempted from State malpractice law in favor of ERISA fiduciary law?"
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3447.155,3448.382,"No, you do not make that assumption."
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3448.382,3449.177,Then it's not the median term.
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3452.073,3458.487,"We're confusing a couple of two different issues, because there's more than one level involved in this case."
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3478.059,3480.656,And that kind of decision was involved in this case?
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3480.656,3482.063,--But we're not--
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3482.063,3483.863,Isn't it?
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3491.058,3501.267,"--No, because there was nothing that the physician felt that was medically necessary that was denied."
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3501.267,3519.397,Are you saying that it just happens to be a coincidence that you are bringing this financial mismanagement claim under the same... with the... joined with the same pleadings that happen to make malpractice claims?
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3534.175,3536.005,"Essentially that's correct, Judge."
1999.98-1949,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3536.005,3536.459,Okay.
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3536.459,3537.391,"That's correct, because--"
1999.98-1949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3537.391,3537.921,I didn't realize--
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3537.921,3538.377,--Because--
1999.98-1949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3538.377,3541.398,--I didn't realize you were making any ERISA claim.
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3553.667,3554.204,--No.
1999.98-1949,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3555.986,3557.659,Where does that appear in your--
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3557.659,3559.318,It's amended Count III.
1999.98-1949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3560.688,3561.887,--Amended Count III.
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3586.761,3588.078,"That's exactly right, Judge."
1999.98-1949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3588.078,3602.023,"And what in your view is the standard for determining whether... because you concede that some incentive plans could be okay, so what's the standard for determining... and I think the Government concedes that there could be some that weren't okay."
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3602.023,3602.575,And I agree.
1999.98-1949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3602.575,3602.933,All right.
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3603.46,3603.852,I agree.
1999.98-1949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3603.852,3605.891,"So now we've got a lot of agreement here, and what we've got to--"
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3611.604,3613.582,That's going to be a difficult line to draw.
1999.98-1949,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3624.796,3625.141,All right.
1999.98-1949,2,30410,james_p_ginzkey,,3626.023,3640.526,"The phrase that I have used is undue influence, because again, drawing on the study from California, the median incentive was 10,400, but some of those incentives got up to 40 to 50,000."
1999.98-1949,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3657.986,3658.446,Thank you.
