1968.138,0,16337,arthur_kinoy,,0.0,8.246,Were wholly unsupported by the facts themselves.
1968.138,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,748.633,750.228,Professor Reid.
1968.138,1,27880,herbert_o_reid,,750.228,758.911,May it please the Court.
1968.138,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,932.118,940.247,What's the basis of that statement Professor Reid that the House could not expel for conduct in previous session?
1968.138,1,27880,herbert_o_reid,,940.247,955.778,"The Precedents of the House sir, the speaker outlined the Precedents of the House when he wrote on March -- on January 3, 1969 in which we've included the copy of the record of January 3rd."
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2162.292,2169.597,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.138,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2372.305,2384.55,"Judge Bromley, is it a fact that the Speaker of the House had already ruled that those questions were not relevant to the investigation of the committee?"
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2384.55,2385.894,"No, Your Honor."
1968.138,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2387.071,2410.371,I thought that counsel said that prior of this it was a ruling by the Speaker of the House that the inquiry into his conduct while he was in the Congress on this particular investigation was not relevant?
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2410.371,2411.573,"No, that's not right sir."
1968.138,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2411.573,2413.207,"Well, I misunderstood probably."
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2413.207,2414.152,"No, I don't think so."
1968.138,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2422.112,2427.725,"Well, don't let me interrupt your argument anymore then."
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2427.725,2444.637,"Now third, the complaint in this case does not allege that Mr. Powell was excluded because of his race and the record before the House when it came to reach its decision of expulsion."
1968.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2538.148,2544.787,"Suppose he had been excluded because of his race, a former resolution."
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2548.69,2555.249,I should say sir in answer to that question of action of the House would be clearly unconstitutional.
1968.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2555.249,2557.448,And he -- would he have traditional remedy?
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2557.448,2567.988,But as I read the speech or debate clause he would not sir.
1968.138,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2635.739,2641.55,"How about his back salary that he would have been paid, had he been seated, Mr. Bromley?"
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2641.55,2652.207,Back salary is so incidental to the main prayer for relief that I do not feel it could justify the jurisdiction of the Court.
1968.138,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2701.771,2710.551,"Well, suppose it were -- suppose it were 12 months' salary, Judge Bromley, would that save the case from being moot in your judgment?"
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2710.551,2712.474,"No, Your Honor."
1968.138,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2713.694,2716.934,Why not?
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2716.934,2726.517,"Because in the first place, the salary can't be paid unless the oath is administered."
1968.138,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2726.517,2731.338,"No, no, no, I'm talking about -- I see what you mean."
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2745.407,2761.655,"Yes, I think this Court would have no jurisdiction against the sergeant of the -- and the relief would have to be against the sergeant ordering him to pay when he is prohibited by statute from doing it."
1968.138,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2761.655,2766.252,I suppose you might conceive that he might have an action in the Court of Claims.
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2766.252,2768.492,I certainly would sir.
1968.138,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2787.593,2800.699,But would a remedy in the Court of Claims foreclose a declaratory judgment action in the Federal District Court for salary?
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2800.699,2805.775,"Well, it's moot now so you couldn't have a declaratory judgment."
1968.138,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2821.602,2827.119,"Judge Bromley, on your question of mootness."
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2847.032,2848.52,I think so clearly sir.
1968.138,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2848.52,2849.417,Why?
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2849.417,2851.515,Because he's been seated.
1968.138,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2884.514,2891.474,"What happen Mr. Bromley if he does attack it then two years from now, that will be moot?"
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2891.474,2896.255,"Not if he proceeded promptly, it wouldn't be."
1968.138,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2896.255,2905.309,"On further word about your statement that in 1967, he was paid one month salary?"
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2905.309,2906.997,"No, I didn't say he was paid."
1968.138,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2910.538,2917.859,"Well, how could the sergeant pay him if he hadn't taken the oath?"
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2917.859,2920.819,By resolution of the House.
1968.138,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.312,2923.674,The resolution say he should paid?
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2923.674,2924.118,That's right.
1968.138,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2931.467,2939.455,I see.
1968.138,2,17466,bruce_bromley,,2939.455,2950.882,"Of course, my point about the salary is after he was paid the March 1st, he could have come back and the result might have been entirely different as it was last January."
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6004.951,6006.685,May it please the Court.
1968.138,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6167.729,6168.864,Mr. Kinoy?.
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6168.864,6169.309,Yes.
1968.138,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6169.309,6176.126,Is your -- is that order of the speaker in the best time is here?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6176.126,6187.147,"The order of the speaker Chief Justice, is in the official record which the parties have stipulated, copies are to be available to the Court."
1968.138,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6187.147,6190.562,Well It is quoted in many of your briefs.
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6190.562,6195.225,"That ruling is referred to in our brief, in our reply brief."
1968.138,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6198.432,6199.83,Very well.
1968.138,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6199.83,6201.454,What is the citation?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6201.454,6211.675,"The citation is January 3rd Congressional Record 1969, H14."
1968.138,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6215.439,6217.829,19 what?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6217.829,6220.522,1969.
1968.138,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6275.926,6276.412,Mr. Kinoy.
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6276.412,6276.952,Yes.
1968.138,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6276.952,6284.211,"Let me get something straight here, did the Speaker of the House in 1967, was that when the exclusion took place?"
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6284.211,6284.775,Yes.
1968.138,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6297.734,6298.701,Now I understand that.
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6304.642,6306.445,Except two-thirds vote.
1968.138,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6307.147,6311.259,They didn't so it was only in 1969 that he referred to the precedents then --
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6311.259,6312.914,"Correct, Mr. Justice White."
1968.138,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6401.328,6403.199,Which occasion was that?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6403.199,6409.219,"Kilbourn against Thompson Mr. Justice Black, Kilbourn against Thompson the original discussion of the Speech or Debate Clause in this Court."
1968.138,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6409.219,6427.267,"Is that the one -- is that the one that stated that and considering this was condition of the Constitution, how that could be exercise to do something to a man was the least possible power adequate to the (Inaudible)?"
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6427.267,6428.564,That's right Your Honor.
1968.138,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6603.546,6607.763,You said that he made his position clear before the committee?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6607.763,6609.165,"Yes, Justice Black."
1968.138,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6609.165,6610.955,What did he say?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6610.955,6628.734,"We said before the committee that the Congress had the power on the question of seating a member to inquire into the constitutional qualifications as set forth in the Constitution, we would give evidence as to those qualifications we did."
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6649.146,6649.748,If they --
1968.138,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6649.748,6651.728,Did he answer all the questions there?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6651.728,6654.343,All questions on the constitutional qualifications.
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6655.776,6671.095,"If the petitioner had been seated, there's no doubt is there that the House would have had power to punish him if it had so concluded so to do under the specific provision in the Constitution."
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6671.095,6679.358,"Justice Fortas, subject only to the constitutional mandate that they could not punish him for alleged acts occurring prior to his elect --"
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6679.358,6681.237,I understand that but the --
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6681.237,6681.988,Otherwise --
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6681.988,6684.994,In theory that constitutional power is clear?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6684.994,6685.922,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6685.922,6698.166,"And so that if the -- a proceeding to punish him had been brought in the same session of Congress in which allegedly acts, these acts were committed."
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6715.105,6722.486,"That's correct, subject to an adversary proceeding and the rights of the adversary proceeding, and subject to the limitations as I said before of the Constitution."
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6722.486,6737.518,"And also there had been no question as to power of the House and in appropriate case and by whatever procedure may be appropriate to expel a member, is there?"
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6737.518,6738.808,That's absolutely right.
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6738.808,6758.054,"So that to considerable extent in a way, your submission to us depends in the first instance upon the distinction between the exclusion and the expulsion procedures or the exclusion and the punishment procedures."
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6758.054,6761.437,"Well, I would put it this way Your Honor."
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6787.158,6787.748,Oh!
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6797.462,6798.245,No.
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6814.459,6832.492,"Now, why do you -- I've read your brief on the point that -- perhaps you'd tell -- tell me briefly, quickly now why you say that you have to take this problem session by session of the Congress or Congress by Congress?"
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6846.933,6847.912,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.138,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6847.912,6849.18,And why is that?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6849.18,6852.983,"Well, the explanation for that I think was best put forward."
1968.138,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6935.834,6944.066,And the fact is that in this case you would say that it -- that the Representative Powell could not have been expelled for the conduct that's involved in this case.
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6944.066,6944.979,I would say that.
1968.138,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6945.143,6947.243,Because -- because of the time of its occurrence?
1968.138,3,16337,arthur_kinoy,,6947.243,6948.064,That's right.
