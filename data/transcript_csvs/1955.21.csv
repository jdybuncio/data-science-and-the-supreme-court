1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.217,"Number 21 on the docket, United States of America versus Twin City Power Company, et al."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,10.585,13.974,Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,344.309,350.056,I don't -- I'm not sure I understand.What's the effect?
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,350.056,356.185,They claim that the Court should not regard this as being within the navigation power.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,360.757,365.935,"And, from there, the -- it was suggested that there was no power to condemn this?"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,365.935,366.576,No.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,396.535,407.093,"Is it -- as a matter of law, is this an endeavor to -- to ask us to reconsider the affirmation of the case, being that it is here?"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,407.295,410.13,I think 311 -- the 311 is correct.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,413.765,414.933,You'll get the remedy.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,417.995,437.293,"Well, I think that the claim -- its -- the claim is made that it is not, in fact, a navigation project, and then, the claim is further advanced that, therefore, the rules of compensation which have been applied in cases the Government relies on, such as Chandler-Dunbar, do not control here."
1955.21,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,444.407,448.761,Does that include a claim that the river is not navigable?
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,448.761,453.153,"No, it's conceded that the river is a navigable stream."
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,453.153,462.367,"And Congress has provided for this project that some -- some strength is derived from suggesting that it's not navigable, is that it?"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,462.367,463.717,"Yes, by respondent."
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,463.717,471.437,"The Act -- the Act providing for the project, did Congress state whether it was for navigation or not?"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,471.437,482.588,Congress stated at the outset of the Act that it was only approving projects which had substantial navigation and flood control benefits.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,505.152,520.503,Did I understand your opening -- your opening to say that they got eight times the value of what the fast lands would be as land abstractly considered because this was valuable for navigation purposes?
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,520.503,525.368,Because it was suitable for water power development.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,548.639,551.311,Does the Government generate water power at this project?
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,551.311,552.393,"Yes, water power is --"
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,552.393,555.553,And they say this land has special value for water power purpose?
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,555.553,556.315,Yes.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,556.315,566.167,"And they also say that Congress didn't condemn -- authorize a condemnation of navigation purposes whereby water power is generated, is that right?"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,566.167,567.644,I think that is a --
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,567.644,569.141,All right.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,569.141,569.259,-- their analysis.
1955.21,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,569.259,577.906,"Well, it is true, isn't it, that the Government is taking, here, something much more than is covered by its rights of servitude, is it not, for navigation?"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,580.105,580.541,We're taking --
1955.21,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,580.541,580.819,-- upon a certainty --
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,580.819,603.329,"-- fast lands which border the river and, consequently, there's no issue that respondent is to be entitled to their -- to the full value of those fast lands, as fast lands, the full value of those lands for any purpose, as we put it, to which the condemnee or buyers from the condemnee were entitled to put it."
1955.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,636.544,645.596,I take it that these were a private company that was condemning this hydroelectric power site itself.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,648.202,659.927,"Well, assuming that there were -- that two persons, the buyer and the seller, were both free to make the use and then one got condemnation powers, it's certainly so."
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,680.108,682.801,May I get your answer to Justice Reed's question.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,694.502,694.742,I --
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,694.742,720.239,"-- as to the -- as to the value that may be attributed to this site for developing water or surfacing water power as a private concern even though, at the time, it may not have a license of the power but the land is concededly serving for that purpose."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,721.95,722.976,"No, there would not be."
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,741.466,743.07,"I mean, this very case."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,744.545,745.104,"Yes, sir."
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,745.104,766.356,"-- that a private concern wants to condemn it and, as toggling before, the hope to buy and consider power from this is an application for a license where the measurement of the criteria for waters bear that if the condemnation would be different."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,766.356,766.815,No.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,766.815,768.436,But that would be without knowledge.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,768.436,772.164,"No, I don't think it would."
1955.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,786.797,803.439,"Offered as a private off-the-door that was taking to develop the power place prior to the time that we had the Federal Power Act, they certainly would have to pay the extra price of the -- the suitability of the land that they acquired."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,803.439,805.443,"I think the -- the -- yes, I think so."
1955.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,810.033,810.579,Yes.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,823.7,824.359,"No, I'm sorry."
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,852.874,853.359,Except that --
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,853.359,854.712,-- federal authorization that --
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,854.712,855.047,-- except with the Secretary of War.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,855.047,858.012,"Secretary of War, yes."
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,932.04,942.663,"Mr. Spritzer, after the 1944 Flood Control Act which called for the development of this -- of this project, --"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,942.663,944.002,"Yes, sir."
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,944.002,954.818,"Suppose the state wanted to put a highway through -- through that canyon, one that is covered by the -- by the proposed lake."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,968.153,973.487,"Well, the -- this entire reservoir now becomes part of the federal project, Your Honor."
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,973.551,976.97,"Well, it is -- it isn't until they purchase it."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1022.269,1023.042,Well --
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1023.042,1028.904,"Maybe it isn't a fair question, but we're speculating on some of these situations and --"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1028.904,1031.154,"Yes, I'm trying to address myself to it."
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1042.34,1052.393,"I don't suppose -- I don't suppose it would, but I suppose it -- it could, unless -- unless the Federal Government proceeded to -- to condemn the land itself."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1053.714,1054.076,Yes.
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1054.076,1057.485,"-- and, maybe -- maybe, the project will be built for 25 --"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1057.485,1057.573,Yes.
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1057.573,1065.69,"-- 25 years and, in the mean -- in the mean time, it's the property of a private property and the state could be excess of it."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1065.69,1065.821,I would say --
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1065.821,1066.325,That's what I mean.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1066.325,1084.09,"I would say no, Your Honor, because I think the whole function of eminent domain proceedings is to eliminate special value which the property may have to the taker and to compensate the condemnee for what he has lost."
1955.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1373.167,1378.516,Do we know whether there are going to be locks in the proposed new dam?
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1378.516,1386.725,"Well, all of the other proposed sites which are indicated in this map in shading are also upstream."
1955.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1392.598,1396.649,"But where is -- where is this present -- this dam is in litigation here, where is it going to be?"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1396.649,1397.788,That's right here.
1955.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1421.627,1438.919,"Well, Mr. Spritzer, now that flood -- the control of floods is a matter of national policy, does it make any difference to your case whether -- whether this project is for the control of floods or whether it is to improve navigation?"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1438.919,1444.018,"We think it does not, though, we also think that we have both purposes served."
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1525.149,1542.797,You don't think that all that is meant by that is the negative or -- suggestion -- the suggestion of what was taken from believing that the water that the Government to call it even.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1542.797,1543.895,Yes.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1543.895,1550.114,"What was taken comes from what the Government already had, namely, the use of the water."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1552.261,1552.501,"Well, it --"
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1552.501,1560.529,"And that's for the stream because that's the excess that the law are going to give them, namely, free flow of the stream.Of course he can be compensated."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1560.529,1560.953,"Well, I don't think --"
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1560.953,1563.541,Is that what is meant by that sentence?
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1563.541,1586.769,"If so, I would go ahead and say, further, that we don't think that it's possible to say that the landowner has the right to appropriate the waters for power purposes when a necessary preliminary to his doing so involves placing a dam in the middle of a navigable river."
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1595.567,1613.581,"Isn't -- isn't the question kind of, actually, whether it's what I think, on your side, is considered what you call “place value,” whether this parcel of land is to be the territory at place value?"
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1613.581,1613.977,"Well, I --"
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1613.977,1622.432,It's a little like the -- little spite house from another -- different story in New York as place value because we think you'd like to get it.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1622.432,1622.647,Well --
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1622.647,1623.876,Isn't that what it's meant by that sentence?
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1624.1,1630.247,I -- I think it can be framed in terms of place value or some courts had sometimes said strategic value.
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1630.247,1630.878,Anything of course.
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1630.878,1632.426,"And, I would say --"
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1632.426,1633.987,Isn't that the controversy of this case?
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1633.987,1637.406,"Yes, that's certainly a fair way to formulate it."
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1637.406,1654.352,"And, our position, meeting -- meeting the issue so framed is that nobody can claim strategic value in relation to the use of the waters of a navigable stream as against the United States exercising its navigation powers."
1955.21,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1654.352,1672.516,"In other words, if this piece of property, as in five miles away or 500 yards away, whatever it is, the -- the compensation, you say, would be different -- would be grave to be different than the cost of its strategic position."
1955.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1672.516,1673.799,"Yes, it's strategic."
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,3284.66,3294.486,"If the Court please, if I may take a few moments with the facts before we get in to the law."
1955.21,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3567.029,3573.097,"Did it have -- did it have the power to do it in view of the 1944 Act, Mr. --"
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,3573.097,3586.901,"The Fourth Circuit did not pass on the power of the Federal Power Commission to grant the license, but held that the Power Commission had properly exercised its discretion in not doing it."
1955.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3925.156,3926.202,May I ask you a --
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,3926.202,3926.274,"Yes, sir."
1955.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3926.274,3930.683,"-- question on this, just on your argument to the relevance."
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,3954.406,3972.469,"I -- I would say that, there, if the main purpose of this was navigation, real navigation, the Government would be relieved of one branch of our argument, being -- that is to say, there would be an execution of the navigation servitude."
1955.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3979.701,3980.148,But I --
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,3980.148,3980.533,"But, it would --"
1955.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3980.533,3982.804,I don't quite understand that argument.
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,3994.201,3995.111,"No, sir."
1955.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3995.111,3996.015,You think it would be the same?
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,3996.015,3996.848,Yes.
1955.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3997.579,3999.039,"Then, what is the relevance?"
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,3999.039,4002.995,The relevance of it is that we have a two-pronged position.
1955.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4007.032,4007.936,"Yes, that, I --"
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,4007.936,4008.202,That's what the --
1955.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4008.202,4009.74,I quite understand.
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,4009.74,4031.766,"The Fourth Circuit, in effect, said that this is highland that the Government took and, therefore, the navigation servitude applying to the bed of the stream only, these people are entitled, Twin City is entitled to the market value of the highland which includes this potential for use with the used proximity value to the river."
1955.21,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,4056.484,4056.583,"Well, I --"
1955.21,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4056.583,4057.143,I don't understand.
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,4060.805,4074.204,"I -- I think, in this respect, he was and, because we know that you have the opinion of Judge Hudson, as well of Judge Parker's, opinion that both of the -- propositions should be argued."
1955.21,1,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,4728.477,4729.317,My --
1955.21,1,46981,david_w_robinson_ii,,4729.317,4730.753,-- excuse me.
1955.21,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,6194.851,6226.595,"I'd like to point out to the Court that, at page 26 of the record, the Commissioners found that, as of recent years, I'm reading about three-fourths in the page down, of recent years, and then I'm going on a little, it is practically certain that it, meaning Twin City, could not have obtained a license to construct such project on the Savannah River."
1955.21,2,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,6372.117,6372.206,"Well, why did --"
1955.21,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,6372.206,6373.169,-- Congress could --
1955.21,2,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,6373.169,6374.331,You're right at that point.
1955.21,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,6376.4,6379.042,"Might the Court, today, may apply."
1955.21,2,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,6379.042,6397.977,"That -- that means that a private operation such as they had their state, where it gets the license from the Federal Power Commission, then it has to take for the value of the land that they take."
1955.21,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,6397.977,6398.458,"Well, the -- that --"
1955.21,2,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,6398.458,6403.212,"And, if we assume that you're correct, the Government would not have to pay."
1955.21,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,6403.212,6429.196,"Well, in the Grand River Dam case, the majority of the Court, and the Court was as evenly divided as it could be and still reach a decision in that case, the majority of the Court took the position that the case was controlled by Oklahoma law because the authority had proceeded under the condemnation powers granted by Oklahoma in the Oklahoma courts."
1955.21,2,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,6467.124,6468.224,I understand that.
1955.21,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,6468.224,6468.461,Yes.
