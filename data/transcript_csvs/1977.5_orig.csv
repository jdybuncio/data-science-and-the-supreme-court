1977.5_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.843,"We will hear arguments next in the number 5 Original, United States against California."
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,45.038,47.812,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.332,142.448,"At the time of President Truman’s proclamation referring to this diagram, the – this was the identical diagram to which you referred?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,142.448,143.436,Yes Mr. Justice Stewart it was.
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,143.436,146.967,And this was attached or made a part of the proclamation?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,146.967,148.896,"Specifically it was, yes sir."
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,148.896,152.28,Thank you.
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,152.28,161.839,We believe that proclamation added to the monument everything within one mile of the shoreline; waters submerge lands and natural resources.
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,399.041,404.911,Does that mean that you concede that there was no claim at all before the 47 decision?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,404.911,405.575,There was no --
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,405.575,409.771,That the US had no claim at all before 1947?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,409.771,412.68,No I would not take that position Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.802,434.373,But if -- I take it that if 47 case had come out the other way you would say you had no claim?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,434.373,438.994,If the 47 case had come out the other way we would have no claim in 1949.
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.994,442.108,And then couldn't have been any national monument setup there?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,442.108,456.436,It could not have been expanded in the way that President Truman did so and if President Eisenhower had tried to do this in 1959 after the Submerged Lands Act was passed would not be possible.
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.697,495.739,"Well immediately after -- immediately after the Submerged-- immediately before the Submerged Lands Act while the 47 decision was still ruling the waves, what was the difference between United States claim with respect to the sea bed underlying the national monument and the adjourning sea bed?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,495.739,498.093,There was really no difference as a matter of law.
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.643,513.034,Well if there was no – if there was no -- I guess you were just going to tell me then why the Submerged Land Act didn't treat both pieces of the sea bed the same?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,513.034,515.482,It did not because of the claim of right exception.
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.056,521.052,I know but both areas would be under claim of right?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,521.052,523.71,"No, the area which was held --"
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,523.71,526.931,Well you know this case can't do anymore than claim to own what it owns?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,526.931,538.815,"That's true, but the claim of right exception did not include those lands which the United States owned, if you will, only by virtue of the California one decree, the paramount rights doctrine."
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.665,551.398,"I know but except to that decision, you just said if the decision come out the other way, they wouldn't have owned the national monument either?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,551.398,567.361,"They would have owned the islands, but had the decision come out the other way, I don't think that President Truman in 1949 could have simply reserved this area and said I proclaim it a national monument, he may have been able to proceed by eminent domain or another fashion."
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.361,571.39,Is that how the government acquired the islands in the first place by eminent domain?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,571.39,580.317,The islands were a federal monument at least as far -- federal territory -- lighthouse territory at least is far back as 1854.
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,586.566,588.445,That is ownership of the real-estate is what you are talking --
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,588.445,589.316,Yes sir.
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,589.316,591.095,That is the entire island?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,591.095,596.473,The entire island at least down to the high water or most down to the – I am sorry at least down to the high water.
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,596.473,602.495,"Now that you have mentioned high water mark, somewhere along here would you talk about tidelands?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,602.495,606.405,"I will talk about it right now and say that we, the United States has no claim to the tidelands."
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,606.405,607.805,Why?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,607.805,611.149,Because the tidelands historically have been considered inland waters of a state.
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,611.149,616.683,"You are relying on the proclamation, proclamation then accept the tidelands."
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,616.683,618.142,No the –
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.142,619.099,President Roosevelt's --
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,619.099,622.583,President Roosevelt's proclamation did not – it did not include the tidelands.
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,622.583,623.796,But it didn't exclude it.
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,623.796,636.327,"Well, in that case, I would have to say that it excluded it by implication, because tidelands at least since the case of Pollard's Lessee by this Court tidelands have been considered inland waters of the state."
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.315,658.262,"Well your reliance in this case as I understand it is, you correct me if I am wrong, exclusively upon the President Roosevelt's proclamation and President's Truman's later proclamation?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,658.262,660.322,Well as to the territory at issue here
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,660.322,663.648,At issue here as President Truman's proclamation.
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,670.766,676.961,The result is that state owns the tidelands whereas you claim the islands and the seabed beyond the tidelands.
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,676.961,677.968,"Right, that is the result."
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,677.968,680.984,"So, we have a little horseshoe ownership of the states?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,680.984,681.106,That is the result Mr. Justice.
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.106,694.659,"I don't understand that if the tidelands maybe inland waters of the state if the state happens to own shore next to it, but state at time of the proclamation didn't own the shore and never has, doesn't yet own these islands?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,694.659,701.982,"Well, the islands politically are a part of the state of California like Nantucket is a part of Massachusetts."
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.982,708.235,"Well, it maybe so but the land is the United States territory, isn't it?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,708.235,709.035,Yes it is.
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.035,722.024,"That was true in Pollard's Lessee too, all the land was in the possession of the United States and yet this Court held that the United States alienated the land could not alienate the tidal water."
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,722.024,726.436,But the tidal waters remained --
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,726.436,730.13,Not maybe so but as my brother Stewart says the proclamation –
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,730.13,730.804,That's right --
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,730.804,732.758,-- didn't say a word about tideland?
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.758,734.268,-- and so you are relying on the proclamation.
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,734.268,737.163,That's correct.
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.163,743.589,"So, why do you concede way to tidelands, unless you are relying on something else?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,743.589,746.467,We concede them away if that's what we are doing simply because --
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,746.467,751.852,"That's your proposed decree, excluding the tidelands?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,751.852,755.161,We are not before this Court asking for the tidelands that's –
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.161,755.997,I wonder why not?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,755.997,768.789,"And the reason that we are not is because as we read President Roosevelt's proclamation in 1938 he had powers, if you will, only to reserve the areas of the United States controlled and the United States did not control the –"
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.789,772.733,So you say that proclamation could not purport to take the –
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,772.733,773.401,Could not have --
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.401,776.048,-- legally and constitutionally could not take the tidelands?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,776.048,780.569,-- could not take the tidelands.
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,799.766,807.018,Well did President Truman have more power than President Roosevelt or is it that his proclamation is more express?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,807.018,808.462,"Well, they were looking at two different things."
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.515,845.91,So it's the lands – President Truman used broader language than President Roosevelt?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,845.91,847.105,"Well he did, yes."
1977.5_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,847.105,853.866,And if he had said the areas including the tidelands you would have said that he didn't have power to include the tideland?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,853.866,857.301,"I would say that right now, yes Mr. Justice."
1977.5_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,857.301,862.984,Mr. Ryan is there a map here that shows the width of the tidelands?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,864.508,867.296,I don't -- there is nothing in the record that shows that.
1977.5_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,867.296,871.875,"Any idea what's left of this now, that's what I am interested in."
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,871.875,873.799,I would say it's a matter of feet.
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,876.461,879.842,"Not what's left in this mile is a matter of feet, you don't mean to imply that, did you?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,879.842,880.621,No I am sorry.
1977.5_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,890.243,892.573,Where do you begin to measure and from what?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,892.573,899.029,"From the line of mean lower low water, which is the California Coast line up to."
1977.5_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,899.029,901.624,What relation does that have with the tidelands?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,901.624,907.46,That is the sea where it ends of the tidelands.
1977.5_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,907.46,927.154,"The administration of this – of this conglomeration of four different areas, United States, California, United States and California would present all sorts of difficulties I would think."
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,929.531,933.202,"Well, California raises that point in their brief."
1977.5_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,944.988,954.195,It's not our problem but it does bear I would think on the reasonableness of government's interpretation of these proclamations?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,954.195,971.904,Well I think Mr. Justice that it bears not so much on the reasonableness of our interpretation an on the realities of the law that is -- that the United States could not have simply appropriated those tidelands in 1949 or at any other time as it appropriated what was around it.
1977.5_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1063.782,1085.707,"Getting back to this measuring point, whatever maybe easy with the guidelines you suggest that it was perhaps the width of was only in feet, whatever it may be seaward of the islands, whatever it's boundary is of that island, is that – isn't that from that point that you measure the mile seaward?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1085.707,1088.156,"Yes Mr. Justice yes, that's –"
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1088.156,1091.799,Which is simply saying a measure from the low water mark of the shore of the island?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1091.799,1093.902,Correct.
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1093.902,1101.475,"May that, depending on tides and everything else, may that be a broadened just a few feet?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1103.839,1114.123,"What California has is determined by the line of mean low water, which is a statistical measurement drawn out over years."
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1116.572,1119.149,"Well, do we know what that is?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1119.149,1120.572,In relation to these islands?
1977.5_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1120.572,1121.256,Yeah.
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1121.256,1123.062,I honestly do not Mr. Justice and it's not –
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1123.062,1124.469,But somebody knows -- but somebody knows.
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1124.469,1126.636,I am sure that somebody does.
1977.5_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1126.636,1127.729,It's a fact.
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1127.729,1156.135,It is a fact and it's a fact that judicial notice can be taken of if we knew what the fact was which we don't If the Court to determines in the favor of the United States that all waters and lands were included in President Truman's proclamation that brings up the second question in the case which is whether the Submerged land's Act gave this all to California in 1953.
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1275.625,1301.131,"Mr. Ryan what if then President Eisenhower, after the Submerged Lands Act, it passed both houses of Congress, feeling that he didn't really like the act but knew he had to sign it, issued a proclamation proclaiming the entire three miles coastal zone a national monument and then went ahead and signed the Tidelands bill, do you think that would a claim of right?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1301.131,1304.52,Presidential proclamation for the entire three-mile belt –
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1304.52,1304.903,Yes.
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1304.903,1307.37,-- beyond the coast of California?
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.658,1346.407,But when you say there must be statutory authority for the President to --
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1346.407,1352.984,At a minimum the presidential proclamation has to be a valid one.
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1363.488,1371.605,Does that mean both the United States must have had title and the President authorized to make a proclamation?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1371.605,1375.135,It does not -- United States did not need title.
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.224,1387.205,"Well I mean good faith -- at least good faith and reasonable belief that you want, doesn't it."
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1387.205,1389.105,Yes and a claim that you wanted.
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1389.105,1393.247,And what do you say is the source of the government's Claim of Right in this case?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1393.247,1396.592,The 1949 proclamation by President Truman.
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1396.592,1399.416,And what was the authority for him to make that?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1399.416,1413.052,"The Antiquities Act of 1906, but California has taken the position that the Antiquities Act of 1906 does not authorize President Truman to do as much as he did in 1949."
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1425.23,1437.179,"Well then we would still have to decide that question, wouldn't we, the Claim of Right exception, if you prevail on it simply leaves you where you were with respect to the ability of President Truman's proclamation?"
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1437.179,1438.684,That's right.
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.198,1475.316,If – what if the United States owned them?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1475.316,1490.332,"Well the United States there is no dispute I think, perhaps I shouldn't say that but we think it's certainly clear that by the doctrine of paramount rights the United States had a right to proclaim this area in 1949."
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1490.332,1497.541,I thought that the decision in California specifically reserved the question of ownership?
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1497.541,1499.748,Well the decree did not use the word own.
1977.5_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1499.748,1501.714,It was stricken out of the decree.
1977.5_orig,0,16863,allan_a_ryan_jr,,1501.714,1523.336,"The decree said -- it now has and exercises paramount rights over the territory, but in California two there is footnote that says the issue in California one was whether who owned the three-mile belt, so I would think the distinction between ownership and paramount rights is at most a technical one."
1977.5_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1531.614,1533.761,Mr. Iungerich.
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,1533.761,1536.583,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.228,1594.399,The reliance by the government in this case is on the proclamations.
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,1594.399,1595.095,Yes.
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1595.095,1627.465,"And absent of proclamation as a general rule; you -- California owns its tidelands along the shores including around the shores of the islands that are part of California, but the whole reliance of the government in its exercise of paramount rights over both these islands and now on the President Truman's proclamation, the one-mile belt around them and I know that's a basic issue in this case, why didn't it get the tidelands under the proclamation?"
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,1627.465,1634.519,We didn't get the tidelands because we own them and because the Antiquities Act of 1906 is that you can only place international monument --
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.519,1640.137,You didn't in fact owned -- you had turn out rights to them under --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,1640.137,1647.016,Well I think it was more than that as far as the decision in 1947 and in later cases point out.
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1667.608,1680.87,"Now -- I think -- I would have thought, under President's rule about original proclamation providing that these islands should be the national monuments, the islands or the islands down to the shore?"
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,1680.87,1694.129,"Well if you take a close look at the 1938 proclamation of President Roosevelt and look at the calls of the island that are set forth for Santa Barbara island, the cause are only to the high water mark –"
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1694.129,1694.737,"Oh, they are –"
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,1694.737,1705.744,"-- recognizing only with regard to Santa Barbara Island, federal ownership down to the high water mark and apparently recognizing our ownership of tidelands at that point in time."
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1714.299,1716.598,That's our terms at least respect to Santa Barbara.
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,1716.598,1718.031,Yes.
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.911,1873.523,"That's not true when you're simply construing a deed that's a deeding land rather than water, is it, I mean –"
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,1873.523,1882.567,"This -- Justice Rehnquist it all -- I think the whole continuity, all of the factors in the matter of interpretation have to be taken into account."
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2015.142,2029.497,"But when you -- when you say the surface area of the water alone, you agree don't you that to -- someone the surface are of land and nothing more is almost meaningless."
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2038.99,2052.045,"Well the problem here is we have an in artful description and it's not clear what's meant and I don't necessarily rely on surface area but I'm just trying to find out, basically grapple with what President Truman intended."
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.045,2061.53,Well but isn't one of the least reasonable construction is the idea that he intended to reserve kind of a film of water mile --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2061.53,2068.0,"I think most -- it wouldn't be film of water, it would have to be the bulk of the water but not the yellow line sea bed -"
1977.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2068.0,2077.197,"Aren't you reversing the ancient approach to it, that's the critical thing is the owner of the land and what's above it and what's below it."
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2079.971,2085.456,But what the problem is that the land has to be expressly placed in the monument and not the water alone.
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.868,2121.865,Would you think that the reservation intended to reserve the United States the right to conserve the sea life that lives on the bottom?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2121.865,2143.535,No it does not intend to reserve -- the proclamation as I see it is not intended to protect sea life because Assistant Solicitor General Washington wrote the memo that ultimately went to the attorney general and was then sent to the President recommending approval of this proclamation specifically disavowed any intention to protect marine life.
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.535,2156.415,"Well let's put it this way, under that's -- if you assume that -- that the proclamation was intended to -- to reserve the water, I suppose the United States controlled the sea life in it?"
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2156.415,2157.341,Yes.
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.341,2160.085,Wow about the ones living on the bottom?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2160.085,2171.14,"Well I don't know how we divide that up and I think the simple answer to that is it's very difficult to grapple with that, the actual intent of the President in this case because it's very hard to deal with those terms."
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.631,2182.229,And if you are not – one of the build appears or something out from the land they would be trespassing?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2182.229,2183.598,Yes.
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.598,2187.29,And had -- would have no right to have a --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2187.29,2189.047,That would be anything --
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.047,2190.651,-- under water under your submission?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2190.651,2241.027,"Yes, but what I'm -- what I'm submitting here is that the reason the probable reason way this term waters and the word area was used was the fact that in 1945 there had already been a reservation in Executive Order 9633 of this natural resources of the subsoil on sea bed of the continental shelf which reserve those lands for legislation being aware of that and the Department of Interior they wanted expressly to avoid the possibility of taking some lands out of that reservation and placing them in the national monument, and so they carefully tried to draft a proclamation that avoided that result and the end result is a proclamation that will not stand the test of the Antiquity's Act because it didn't add the submerged lands underneath, because there has been the repeal –"
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.027,2255.521,"If it doesn't withstand what you call the test of the Antiquity's Act, all that means is the President didn't have the authority to put it in a national monument, it doesn't mean that the government no longer owns it or it had a claim of right, does it?"
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2255.521,2261.603,If they didn't -- if the government didn't own it -- it not -- it does not have a claim of right.
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2261.603,2280.807,"Well let me ask you, do you think under the Antiquity's Act the President could proclaim all the incorporated area with in the city of Santa Barbara as a national monument because of -- the early fryers and so forth even though the land was owned by private citizens?"
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2280.807,2282.404,No he can not.
1977.5_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2334.654,2339.734,-- the proclamation was valid under the Antiquity's Act with respect to the islands?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2339.734,2366.481,"Yes it was because those islands were ceded to the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo from Mexico and as a result based on that they were public domain lands and being public domain lands the United States could place them in a national monument down to the high watermark, but they couldn't place out tidelands in there because by virtue of our sovereignty in 1850 the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was in 1848 --"
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.481,2386.226,I take it that – and it could have -- do you say that the – aside form that would you say that the Antiquity's Act authorized the President to reserve the sea bed beyond the tidelands if had said so expressly?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2386.226,2395.545,"Excuse me, yes if we had said so expressly in 1949, he could have reserved the submerged lands in that one mile belt."
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.545,2397.711,The Antiquity's Act would have authorized that?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2397.711,2427.278,"Yes, the point is it's unclear whether he did that because he had already reserved those lands in Executive Order 9633 and this order can be can be construed in such a way as that -- as not repealing by implication Executive Order 9633 and giving the National Park Service jurisdiction over everything that's in the water and still reserving under 9633 the submerge lands for purposes of national -- national resource development."
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2427.278,2448.413,"How can profit though from any imperfections in these presidential proclamations based on the Antiquity's Act since as I understand the Antiquity's Act it's only purpose is Congress says with respect to this kind of land at the United States owns or controls, the President may make a national monument of it."
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2457.272,2477.214,"No it wouldn't because in 1953 and that's my next point, in 1953 the Submerged Lands Act relinquished to California all federal rights in the entire three-mile belt and our point is that this is not a valid claim of right that was preserved by Section 5 and the claim of right exception in the Submerged Lands Act and I think --"
1977.5_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.214,2480.473,May I interrupt?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2494.63,2496.738,Based on the interpretation of the proclamation?
1977.5_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.738,2500.55,"No, no -- based on the interpretation of the 1953 statue."
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2500.55,2514.536,Yes because the reason is if they had put the submerged lands in to the -- into the monument in 1949 –
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.536,2515.193,Expressly --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2515.193,2515.99,Expressly –
1977.5_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.99,2516.456,Which you said they already do –
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2516.456,2517.74,They had the power expressly –
1977.5_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.74,2519.977,You concede that they had the power to do that?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2519.977,2528.919,They had the power to do that but our point is that that's the claim of right resting solely upon the paramount rights doctrine of the 47 decision.
1977.5_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.919,2535.422,Why isn't that the claim of right doctrine resting on the presidential proclamation pursuant to the -- the Antiquity's Act?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2535.422,2538.281,Well presidential proclamation is simply a reservation.
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.696,2552.451,Why don't you tell us how you interpret the claim of right in the Submerged Lands Act?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2552.451,2569.898,"Well I would submit that the -- the clear indication here is that, when we're talking about claim of right, if we look at the legislative history which California has set fourth in detail in it's brief, the purpose of this was to not preserve reservation of this language."
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.947,2604.157,Suppose the government had -- there were piers built out from these islands far out into the – far out and all past the sea bed and there were a 100 offshore oil platforms operating with in the one mile zone under leases from the United States – the 1953 reservation wouldn't have --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2604.157,2606.994,They were expressly recovered by another exception Your Honor.
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.254,2627.825,You don't think that -- you don't think that -- a presidential occupation expressly reserved in the sea bed would have been a reservation for the --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2627.825,2639.656,"In answer that I question Your Honor, suppose the President tomorrow walked in to your home and announced I proclaim this as a national monument, would he have a claim of right to that property?"
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2639.656,2649.983,"That is in the situation in 1949, the government, the government had until to 1953 it was the government's underwater sea bed."
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2649.983,2656.558,"Well how did the government get the title to that underwater sea bed or whatever right it had, it's right to control, it was in the 1947 decision --"
1977.5_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.558,2661.148,It sort of the same way California got the tidelands –
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2661.148,2662.559,But we got them by --
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2662.559,2664.159,Through decisions of this Court –
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2664.159,2665.556,"Yes, yes."
1977.5_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2665.556,2671.184,Let me follow through on Justice White's suggestion as to piers.
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2680.787,2684.566,They'd have to have to obtain -- our theory is that we own that particular until it's adjudicated –
1977.5_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2684.566,2687.437,"Now if you loose this case, what they do?"
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2687.437,2692.768,Well if we loose this case then you'll adjudicating that they own the submerged lands and they could put out a pier.
1977.5_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2692.768,2694.908,How would they get over your tidelands?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2694.908,2698.546,Well I think they'd have to get a permit to cross our tidelands
1977.5_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2698.546,2699.909,And they couldn't?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2699.909,2740.281,"Well, I am not saying that California wouldn't exercise the jurisdiction to allow them a permit to cross our tidelands but yes there is that intervening area and they would have to resolve that with the state of California and clearly own those tidelands and it -- and basically what is happened here is that we have a situation that is probably an exception to all of the uniform rule that mariners can rely on, the governments can rely on that the states at the present time are the agencies that have jurisdiction over the three-mile belt except around Anacapa and Santa Barbara island and possibly for Jefferson National Monument in the Dry Tortugas in Florida."
1977.5_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2772.927,2777.309,What's the difference between a claim of right and assertion of right?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2777.309,2785.242,Well a claim of right must have a basis and the basis here is the paramount rights decision in 1949.
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2865.753,2878.235,Yeah but you -- you put a great big but before in there and it's the absence of that but for on which the government relies i.e the 1947 decisions in the first California case.
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2878.235,2903.229,"Well if -- but the senate reports expressly states with regard to the claim of right exception that there is not a good claim of right when that claim of right rests solely upon the doctrine of paramount rights and I submit that we don't want to the reservation we look to the way in which the federal government owned or control bad land, the reason why it owned control that land as being claim of right."
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2930.432,2937.952,But the government's claim of right doesn't rest only derivatively on the paramount rights.
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2941.676,2945.987,But I don't see a pro -- a proclamation as being a claim of right in any sense.
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2947.304,2954.651,You say a proclamation is basically a reservation of land that the government already owns transferring it out of category to a national --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2954.651,2957.156,Well that's -- that's what the proclamation says -- I -- let me --
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2957.156,2960.806,"Well that extension of the authority under the Antiquity's Act too, isn't it --"
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,2960.806,2964.67,That is the statement of President Truman.
1977.5_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.764,3018.479,Well this be -- I just and I'm -- would this be a fair statement of your argument that -- we should read the original decision and the statute as saying in affect that any claim of right shall be decided as though the California case had been decided the other way?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,3018.479,3033.382,"Yes I think that's -- I think that would be a fair statement because that what the legislative history, the senate report says that we in effect are not allowing a claim of right based solely on the paramount rights doctrine -- and in fact it seems to be --"
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3033.382,3034.903,And you talking now about the 1953?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,3034.903,3036.808,The 1953 act --
1977.5_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3036.808,3037.547,The submerged lands act.
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,3037.547,3042.067,Yes and the claim of right language that is contain within Sections 5 of that act.
1977.5_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.067,3048.559,And if it had been decided the other way then President Truman would not have had the power in 1949 to make any reservation?
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,3048.559,3079.539,"That's correct and I would submit as well in analyzing the legislative history of the proclamation that the essence of what was -- what was intended by the actual occupancy under claim of right exception was the situation where the federal government had a claim and litigation or a claim that may have been brought in litigation and if that language had not been placed in Section 5, all of those claims either good or bad would have passed to California and federal rights would have been relinquished."
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3079.539,3087.573,But why then the -- why then the California stipulate that this land was -- actually occupied --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,3087.573,3094.872,We'll not answer why admit the actually occupied because we don't think that they've got a good claim of right and therefore there are two parts to the language.
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3094.939,3095.701,You give away one part --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,3095.701,3098.65,-- we give away one part but we don't give away the claim of right part.
1977.5_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3098.65,3101.054,Why don't you hold on to both parts in your case and litigate --
1977.5_orig,1,39571,russell_iungerich,,3101.054,3114.074,Because that would have involved an extensive factual issue and I think probably that the federal government would have prevailed on that issue and that was a attachable judgment.
