1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,58.38,59.327,Thank you.
1974.73-1723,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,59.327,59.757,Very well.
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,59.757,64.188,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,260.67,261.749,Being a --
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,261.749,262.67,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.67,267.948,Do you have to render the property that turns out -- that is exempt?
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,267.948,274.003,"I believe you do because for instance as to personal property, the exemption is a dollar amount."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,275.5,277.419,No.
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,286.753,289.563,"To be very honest, I don't know."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,318.197,331.726,"Now isn't that -- would they render -- in fact, the people render just their securities they own, they don't render tables and chairs and do they and television sets and washing machines."
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,331.726,335.787,"I just -- again, don't know -- I think it varies from place to place."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,345.185,345.974,On an automobile?
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,345.974,354.14,"I know that in my office in Dallas when I was in private practice, the tax assessor used to come through the office and list every table and chair we own."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,354.14,356.915,"Well now -- but you didn't render them, he listed them?"
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,356.915,357.92,"Well, that's the alternative."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,362.472,375.987,"And the -- how about this voter qualification if it's not a voluntary action on the part of the individual taxpayer would be voter if it's rendered for him by a tax collector, does that make him eligible?"
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,375.987,377.735,I would think that would be considered a rendition.
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.735,378.798,It's not what you think.
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,378.949,380.644,"I'm sorry, I don't know."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,386.81,387.782,If it's rendered for you?
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,387.782,387.874,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.874,389.527,As well in -- rendered involuntarily?
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,389.527,391.834,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,391.834,396.752,"And this -- and in practice, you know what the facts are, what the actual facts of life are so --"
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,396.752,402.454,The reason I don't know is that they vary from tax assessor and collector to tax assessor and collector.
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.264,405.705,Why not?
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,405.705,415.074,"Some render, some go out and very precise I believe in listing a person's property, others do not."
1974.73-1723,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,415.074,417.361,"Is this the -- the county, is that the end of it?"
1974.73-1723,0,21086,david_m_kendall,,417.361,420.386,"Again, it can be the county; in this case it's a city."
1974.73-1723,1,20896,don_gladden,,1680.876,1683.846,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1723,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.834,1778.335,How about intangible personal property?
1974.73-1723,1,20896,don_gladden,,1779.666,1781.736,"No, they're from a practical standpoint."
1974.73-1723,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1801.394,1802.397,State income tax?
1974.73-1723,1,20896,don_gladden,,1802.397,1803.565,"No sir, we do not."
1974.73-1723,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1803.565,1805.851,And how do you raise all these money that you're --
1974.73-1723,1,20896,don_gladden,,1805.851,1812.952,"By ad valorem taxes on real proper -- real and business person, real property and business personalty is where the money comes from."
1974.73-1723,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1812.952,1814.424,And that's it?
1974.73-1723,1,20896,don_gladden,,1814.424,1815.538,We have a sales tax.
1974.73-1723,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1815.538,1817.916,You have a sales tax but no state income tax?
1974.73-1723,1,20896,don_gladden,,1817.916,1819.144,We have no state income tax.
1974.73-1723,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.781,1830.676,"What happens if I go and say, use your words in Texas that I want to render a $100.00 worth of personal property?"
1974.73-1723,1,20896,don_gladden,,1830.676,1835.21,"Well, its kind of hard to do, Mr. Kendall can't point it up that it just isn't done, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1974.73-1723,2,21086,david_m_kendall,,3688.443,3689.97,If I may just take a minute or two.
1974.73-1723,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3759.26,3760.912,In Fort Worth --
1974.73-1723,2,21086,david_m_kendall,,3760.912,3762.222,What?
1974.73-1723,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3762.222,3769.964,"In Fort Worth, how can a man render his personal property?"
1974.73-1723,2,21086,david_m_kendall,,3769.964,3773.866,Go down to the tax assessor and collector's office and --
1974.73-1723,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3773.866,3777.052,What would he be taxed for?
1974.73-1723,2,21086,david_m_kendall,,3779.769,3780.965,"Yes sir, very definitely."
1974.73-1723,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3801.317,3803.029,Isn't that additional property?
1974.73-1723,2,21086,david_m_kendall,,3803.029,3803.703,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1723,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3803.703,3805.061,Homes?
1974.73-1723,2,21086,david_m_kendall,,3805.061,3817.487,"No, homes have come as ad valorem on the real property but I don't know what its comprised of, it can be anything but real property and the record is silent as to --"
1974.73-1723,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3817.487,3819.717,"Could be automobiles and boats, couldn't it?"
1974.73-1723,2,21086,david_m_kendall,,3819.717,3824.744,"Automobiles and boats, it could be fur coats, it could be bank deposits and securities --"
