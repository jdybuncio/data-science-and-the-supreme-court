2016.16-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.674,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-399, Perry v. The Merit Systems Protection Board. Mr. Landau."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,9.674,24.91,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The parties here agree that a Federal employee has a mixed case when he alleges that he was affected by an appealable civil service action and discrimination."
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,102.33,102.58,I'm sorry --
2016.16-399,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,102.58,126.955,"Just -- just as an introductory question, Mr. Landau -- it's really probably more for the government than for you -- but if the government were to review, this same case could potentially go from the Board to the Federal Circuit, back to the Board, then to the district court. Is there any other scheme like that? Is there anything that the government might point to that is an analogous scheme?"
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,126.955,129.15,"I don't think they will be able to, Your Honor."
2016.16-399,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,142.0,142.41,Certainly --
2016.16-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.41,149.745,But the district court couldn't resolve the case at this point either because the internal revenues weren't exhausted.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,166.14,169.485,"Well, you raise an interesting question, Your Honor, about exhaustion."
2016.16-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,194.4,201.14,The government -- the government takes the position that it hasn't been in exhaustion as a requirement.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,206.505,208.35,"It could take that position, Your Honor."
2016.16-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,253.465,259.31,Can I -- you could go to the district court right away simply by skipping the MSPB; right?
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,259.31,260.0,Absolutely.
2016.16-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,283.31,285.92,"Well, I think -- I think you're right that it -- it's a problem."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,299.71,301.18,"Yes, but you certainly don't --"
2016.16-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,301.18,304.98,You -- you would have to exhaust before you go to the district court.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,307.185,308.07,"Correct, Your Honor."
2016.16-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,309.75,313.81,But that -- that -- that takes place -- I just want to make sure I've got the flow here right.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,321.56,321.99,Yes.
2016.16-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,321.99,324.93,-- and then you can go either to the district court or to the MSPB.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,324.93,325.3,Correct.
2016.16-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,325.79,328.88,"Now, before you can do that, you have to exhaust; right?"
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,328.88,329.85,No.
2016.16-399,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,394.07,418.55,"If you had chosen to go directly to the district court, if you had bypassed the Merit System Protection Board, would you be able to raise in the district court the question whether the alleged removal was proper under 7 -- 7513, whether it was -- would promote the efficiency of the service, or would you have at that point only the discrimination claim?"
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,418.55,428.015,"Well, Your Honor, just to be clear, you -- in any of these mixed cases, you have to exhaust somewhere, either in the MSPB or in the agency EEO."
2016.16-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,433.7,436.805,But say -- say you exhaust in the agency EEO.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,436.805,437.3,Yep.
2016.16-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,437.3,441.6,Do you still have your civil service claims that you can bring in district court?
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,441.6,442.32,Absolutely.
2016.16-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,443.43,446.97,"The government says not, but it doesn't cite anything when it says not."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,446.97,454.53,"And we'd point out a footnote in our reply brief that we find that a very surprising assertion in the government's brief, because that's clearly wrong."
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,476.3,476.51,Mr. --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,476.51,477.54,-- firmly disagree with that.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,477.54,480.75,"Mr. Landau, that -- that raises a question I have for you."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,490.37,490.985,Correct.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,490.985,503.85,"Where in the statute is that provided? I look at 7703(b)(2), and it speaks of cases of discrimination filed under Federal discrimination laws go to district court."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,503.85,505.35,That's a -- right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,505.35,508.375,And then I look at the standards of review.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,514.675,515.18,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,515.18,517.73,-- which makes sense for civil service claims.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,517.73,518.185,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,518.185,522.26,The only standard of review mentioned for district courts is de novo --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,522.26,522.73,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,522.73,529.915,"-- which makes sense for discrimination claims, but not for civil service claims that might tag along in district court."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,529.915,530.22,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,530.22,536.765,So but -- by what -- what authority does a district court ever have the power to hear a civil service claim?
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,536.765,546.3,"Just to -- just to start with the latter part of your question, Your Honor, the -- the statute, as is often the case, is not the most carefully drafted."
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,552.515,554.055,But putting aside Kloeckner --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,554.055,554.33,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,554.33,555.28,-- looking at the plain language --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,555.28,555.37,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,555.37,556.0,-- of the statute --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,556.0,556.41,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,556.41,557.48,-- if you could just help me with that.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,557.48,569.41,"Sure, sure. Well, I -- the -- there is no question, even before Kloeckner, that the statute sends cases of discrimination -- basically, cases go from --"
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,569.41,577.82,I would have thought cases of discrimination under Federal discrimination statutes are cases of discrimination under Federal discrimination statutes --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,577.82,577.91,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,577.91,579.48,-- and not civil service disputes.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,579.48,579.91,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,608.095,609.09,Shall be filed under --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,609.09,627.48,"Shall be filed, right. And then it sends you, though, shall be filed -- you know, subject to the provisions of 7702 shall be filed under -- and -- and what that is really saying is you file those cases as a standalone complaint; in other words, you are not seeking review of agency action at that point."
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,634.66,635.07,Right.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,635.07,635.35,So 70 --
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,635.35,650.659,"But why -- I'm sorry for taking up so much time, I apologize. My last question: Why does ""subject to"" mean it has to meet the standards of 7702 rather than it's a claim that's subject to the test of 7702?"
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,650.659,651.98,"Well, it is."
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,673.66,679.13,But it's always only actions of discrimination filed under Federal discrimination statutes.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,679.13,681.79,"But what we're talk -- right, because you have a claim on that."
2016.16-399,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,718.415,738.515,"Can I ask you a question about the language of 7702(a)(1)(A) and (B), which is the provision that specifies the jurisdiction of the So, subparagraph A says: --"
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,738.515,740.18,"Yes, sir."
2016.16-399,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,740.18,743.68,"-- ""Has been affected by action."""
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,743.68,744.8,Right.
2016.16-399,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,744.8,765.95,"And subparagraph B says, ""Alleges that a basis for the action."" So what should I read into the different language used in those provisions? The second one, B, certainly concerns allegations, but it -- A doesn't say alleges that he has been affected by."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,771.105,773.325,"Your Honor, you are exactly right."
2016.16-399,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,786.43,787.96,What's -- what's wrong with it?
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,787.96,805.76,"But what's wrong with it is, as this Court reiterated as recently as SW General last month, whenever you're talking about this kind of negative implication, it has to be a sensible one, and you have to ensure, as a Court, that Congress really wanted to say no to the other one."
2016.16-399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,883.24,888.755,I don't -- I don't see the -- the needless frolic.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,915.52,916.57,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2016.16-399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,949.62,952.705,"You -- you're being generous to the government, Mr. Landau."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,968.545,979.14,"I think even you are being generous to the government, Justice Kagan, because I think they say that some of these regulations don't even necessarily apply, and they even invoke equitable tolling in one of the footnotes to their brief."
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,998.885,1011.18,"Mr. Landau, does that not suggest that this detour to the Federal Circuit may not be what's prescribed by the statute and that, again, bifurcation should take place and discrimination claims should go to the district court in the first instance --"
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1011.18,1011.35,We -- well --
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1011.35,1019.14,"-- rather than hang around waiting in the Federal Circuit? Hopefully -- hopefully, with a regulation that might or might not say that those are tolled?"
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1019.14,1033.59,"But, Your Honor, I -- I think the point is bifurcation -- you are absolutely correct that the statute -- or -- or let me make clear -- the statute wants to avoid bifurcation by allowing employees to bring these claims together."
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1035.39,1036.66,My question is just where.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1036.66,1036.94,Oh.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1071.22,1072.38,Cases of discrimination?
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1072.38,1076.05,"Discrimination, subject to all this, are cases that can still be --"
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1076.05,1076.59,Keep going.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1077.205,1083.3,"-- subject to the provisions of section 7702 of this title, shall be filed under section 717(c)."
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1083.3,1083.835,Right.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1083.835,1084.185,Right.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1090.53,1094.23,"You also have to ask what are cases of discrimination filed under 717, right?"
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1094.23,1094.92,Correct.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1094.92,1100.15,And those are classic discrimination claims that are filed in Federal district court.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1100.15,1100.755,Correct.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1106.66,1107.35,I hope so.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1107.35,1107.66,Okay.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1109.16,1110.235,I'm not really sure.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1110.235,1111.67,I -- I -- I think I am.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1123.44,1128.58,The question is where is the detour to the Federal Circuit that you also anticipate and seem to agree can happen.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1128.58,1129.32,"No, we don't."
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1130.04,1133.59,"Well, but you say -- the question is whether it's tolled while it's sitting in the Federal Circuit."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1133.59,1133.97,"No, no, no."
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1242.93,1243.51,I'm sorry.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1260.47,1261.23,"Well, we're saying that --"
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1261.23,1266.95,Or that any ruling where the Board says we don't have power to hear this case --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1266.95,1267.07,Well.
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1267.36,1268.68,-- is not jurisdictional?
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1268.68,1278.11,"It is not -- when the Board decides -- if you -- as long as the complainant alleges something that is one of the serious civil service actions, if the -- if the Board rejects --"
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1278.11,1279.94,"First, let's -- let's go to the suspension."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1279.94,1280.03,Okay.
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1280.03,1282.39,You need to have a suspension of a certain number of --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1282.39,1283.205,"14 days, Your Honor."
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1283.205,1283.74,All right.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1290.1,1291.0,Correct.
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1291.52,1296.98,"In fact, the extra two days that they thought they served was taken off of medical leave."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1296.98,1297.2,Uh-huh.
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1297.2,1298.825,For some reason it didn't fall.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1300.57,1301.265,No.
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1302.0,1305.12,"You think that any dismissal, whatever the basis --"
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1305.12,1308.88,"As long as it has been alleged, that's enough to trigger the Board's jurisdiction, but it --"
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1308.88,1311.73,But as long as the person thinks the Board can hear this?
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1311.73,1325.0,"Well, as long as the person alleges that, just as you can -- in Bell v. Hood, a person brought what turned out to be a Bivens claim in 1946, and this Court said there is jurisdiction over that claim."
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1331.34,1347.935,"It's a strange use of the word ""merits,"" because generally, merits is an adjudication of the actual claim, i.e., I was discriminated against or I was furloughed improperly, not that a Board doesn't have the power to hear something."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1350.02,1354.18,"But, see, I think the Board did have the power to -- to hear that. Well, look, it is --"
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1354.18,1363.63,"You're absolutely right. Every court has -- or every entity has the power to determine their own jurisdiction, so there is a circular problem to this argument."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1363.63,1379.33,"And your point is --that you started with, Your Honor, is particularly powerful here, in a case of constructive discharge, where there is a complete and total overlap between the merits of his claims and what they're calling a jurisdictional determination."
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1391.09,1391.3,Can I ask --
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1391.3,1391.88,-- discrimination claim.
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1391.88,1400.05,"Can I just ask a simple question? What happens if you had gone to the district court first? If you were permitted to, as you did."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1400.05,1407.97,"Well, yeah, we would have to exhaust, either in the agency EEO or through the MSPB, and then what we would ask the court to do --"
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1407.97,1410.08,Let's assume you went to the agency.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1410.08,1410.75,Okay.
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1410.75,1413.465,And you then went to -- back to the district court.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1413.465,1413.91,Okay.
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1413.91,1420.96,What happens to the Board's finding that the settlement was voluntary?
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1420.96,1421.55,Well --
2016.16-399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1421.55,1423.725,How does that get reviewed and by whom?
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1423.725,1425.37,It gets reviewed in district court.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1434.89,1435.49,(c).
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1435.49,1440.42,Because it doesn't refer to the district court's standard review of the civil service claim.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1457.03,1459.14,"No, just to continue to make it up."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1459.14,1459.95,"Well, no."
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1468.22,1470.48,Just because it's not there doesn't mean it shouldn't be there.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1472.13,1472.74,It's not there.
2016.16-399,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1472.74,1473.22,All right.
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1473.22,1490.99,"But then the part -- again, you face a textual imperative cutting both ways, because the text clearly does send some of the -- send these mixed cases to district court in cases involving discrimination claims. So the question, then, is, what standard of review should apply to the civil service component of the mixed case when it arrives in district court."
2016.16-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1529.405,1530.54,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.16-399,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1530.54,1533.23,Thank you.
2016.16-399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.23,1536.21,Mr. Fletcher.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1536.21,1543.415,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit generally has exclusive jurisdiction to review the MSPB's decisions."
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1565.14,1566.53,"Well, that's what --"
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1566.53,1568.51,Go ahead.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1568.51,1576.19,"That's what the -- the Board says, but we don't know that, right? Isn't it for the district court to make exactly that determination?"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1576.19,1582.03,"Well, I think what the Board said is that he doesn't have a mixed case, and that has shaped what he is asking the courts to decide."
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1587.68,1592.53,"He still -- he still thinks he has civil service claims, in addition to discrimination claims."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1592.53,1610.7,"And the only thing he wants the court to do, and I think this is clearest on page 18 of the reply brief, he wants whichever court it is, either the reviewing court or the district court or the Federal Circuit, to decide to reverse the Board's decision that he didn't suffer an appealable action and send the matter back down to the Board for further proceedings on both his discrimination claims and his civil service claims."
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1610.7,1618.075,"Well, that's because the Board didn't -- said that it was not reviewing the merits of his civil service claims."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1635.42,1637.25,"If it is a mixed case, it's going to go back to the MSPB --"
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1637.25,1640.07,"It's going to go back to the -- to the district court, eventually."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1640.07,1640.42,Exactly.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1643.76,1649.795,"So I don't see that, Mr. Fletcher, as addressed by this statutory language that you talk about."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1703.35,1706.94,"Well, for purposes -- that question could come up at different points."
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1718.0,1721.385,"I'm just asking you -- you know, you point to this language."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1733.33,1741.79,"Well, let me first take a run at you on this language, because I think what it does say, as Justice Alito pointed out, is that the employee's allegation is sufficient as to the discrimination content --"
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1741.79,1742.2,"No, it obviously --"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1742.2,1743.2,-- but not as to the other.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1743.2,1768.75,"No, it obviously makes a distinction between allegations and -- and being affected by an action, but only -- all that this provision does is it defines what a mixed case is, and says the -- the Merit System Protection Board will decide that mixed case. And the definition of a mixed case has one element, which is an actual thing, and another element, which is an allegation."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1768.75,1769.045,Yes.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1769.045,1783.3,"But this is only the statement that the Board will address mixed cases. It doesn't say anything about what happens if there's a dispute as to whether there is a mixed case, who gets to decide that question."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1783.3,1800.39,"And the only point I'm trying to make is that I think -- it may not answer that question definitively, in your view, but I think the fact -- it cuts against my friend's answer, which is that we should take the employee's word for it; that if the employee alleges he has a mixed case, it ought to be treated as such for purposes of these questions, because the statute makes an allegation sufficient only as to one of two elements."
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1800.39,1800.69,But that's --
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1800.69,1803.915,"But that's the way -- that's the way the system works, generally."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1840.905,1869.55,"Well, I think our system does work that if you have a provision that a tribunal, a court, an agency, whatever, can hear a certain kind of case, by necessity, when someone comes in and claims to have that sort of case, you have to take their word for it; at least insofar as you have to hold proceedings to figure out if they're right. I think our point, though, is that when you have jurisdictional allegations like, say, diversity jurisdiction, or any other number of other jurisdictional elements and you then have factual proceedings or legal proceedings to test the sufficiency of those jurisdictional allegations, if they're found lacking, then the result is that the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction."
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1869.55,1876.44,"And -- and that -- and, normally, that you can appeal that, and -- and have a choice to seek a review of it."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1882.985,1883.59,That's right.
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1883.59,1890.685,"And we've -- we have had -- I won't say difficulty, but we've had a lot of cases trying to decide whether something is jurisdictional or procedural."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1909.775,1911.18,And so let me say a couple of things about that.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1948.55,1965.3,"But the whole point of this scheme, generally -- and we have said this, and it appears on the face of the statute -- is to make sure that the employee doesn't have to claim-split. And so we've said when the Board dismisses your claim on the merits, you can take it to the district court."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2005.485,2008.485,"Justice Kagan, I disagree that this is claim-splitting."
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2025.83,2027.6,"Well, the claim -- it's temporary claims-splitting."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2043.405,2043.92,Right.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2044.04,2045.015,That's a kind of claim-splitting.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2069.87,2073.17,But I think the only thing -- none of that is unique to our rule.
2016.16-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2098.02,2098.25,All right.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2107.735,2108.615,I do.
2016.16-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2108.615,2119.35,"So there is -- you're saying that the regulations that provide, essentially, for tolling, that there's no statutory basis for them. Are you saying -- or at least not --"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2119.35,2121.17,"Not 7702(f), yes."
2016.16-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2121.17,2130.77,"Are you saying that there isn't another one, or that this regulation is open to challenge, and if it is, then nothing gets tolled?"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2130.77,2131.74,"No, certainly not."
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.6,2183.9,"It is odd, though. It is odd that the only category of cases that you say has to go to the Federal Circuit through the MSPB are the cases in which the MSPB thinks they don't have jurisdiction."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2183.9,2184.39,Well --
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2184.39,2196.58,"You have two cases here, and one was come together, and the one they say, no, no, that's got to go to the MSPB and the -- I mean, that's got to go to the Federal Circuit because we need uniformity are the cases where they don't think there is a claim under the Civil Service Act."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2196.58,2200.45,I -- I actually think I understand that that may seem logical from -- from one angle.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2241.08,2241.29,Then why --
2016.16-399,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2241.29,2255.96,"So that label, jurisdictional -- I mean, as I see it, the -- and the employee says, these adverse actions were taken against me, I was suspended, and then I was forced into early retirement."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2270.955,2275.85,I think this is most clearly laid out on page 4A of the Petitioner Appendix in the D.C. Circuit's opinion.
2016.16-399,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2332.24,2348.68,"Mr. Fletcher, the -- the one thing about this case that seems perfectly clear to me is that nobody who is not a lawyer, and no ordinary lawyer could read these statutes and figure out what they are supposed to do. (Laughter.)"
2016.16-399,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2348.68,2354.34,"And this isn't -- this isn't your fault. Now we'll decide this case, and that will make things clearer."
2016.16-399,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2360.55,2374.445,"This is a case that's about, at bottom, not very much substantively, right? No matter which side wins, Mr. Perry will, in the end, get a decision if he wants it in the district court on both of the questions."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2374.445,2375.035,Yes.
2016.16-399,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2375.035,2380.55,So what can be done to clear up this? This is unbelievably complicated.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2380.55,2387.91,"I'm not going to fight your point that this is a complicated statutory scheme, or your point that it's going to remain so whatever the Court does with this case."
2016.16-399,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2402.44,2407.91,Who wrote -- who wrote this statute? Somebody who -- (Laughter.)
2016.16-399,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2407.91,2412.325,-- takes pleasure out of pulling the wings off flies? (Laughter.)
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2412.325,2420.07,"I think Congress was trying to balance and mesh together two systems, the Civil Service system and the anti -- and the federal discrimination laws."
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2420.73,2431.935,"Well, but the way -- the way you end up, though, is a situation where, peculiarly, the MSPB has jurisdiction because uniformity is desirable in a particular area."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2460.56,2463.75,"Well, I -- I don't think -- the Court did reject those arguments in Kloeckner."
2016.16-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2475.74,2490.82,"Could you please tell me, besides this voluntary settlement issue, what else is jurisdictional? What else besides something that doesn't match 7512, the furlough and suspension?"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2490.82,2491.305,Right.
2016.16-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2491.305,2504.27,"So if we go down your route, and I'm writing that opinion -- which I hope not, but if I were -- (Laughter.)"
2016.16-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2504.27,2517.195,What -- what would I tell the practicing bar about what the board labels as jurisdictional really counts as jurisdictional?
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2517.195,2544.8,"I think you would tell them that it's yolked to the text that this focused on in Kloeckner, which is Section 7702(a)(1), which says that to be a mixed case, you have to have been affected by an action which you can appeal to the board. And in Elgin, this Court explained that the actions that you can appeal to the board generally are determined by the kind of action which you've suffered, a removal or suspension and so forth, and the kind of employee that you are: Are you a -- a civil servant? Are you preference-eligible? Are you otherwise in a category that's entitled to these protections and given rights to appeal to the board."
2016.16-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2545.33,2545.62,So there's --
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2545.62,2545.81,-- mean by --
2016.16-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2545.81,2549.77,"-- a whole lot of cases besides what I thought, 7512."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2554.865,2555.72,That -- that's right.
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2585.17,2615.43,"Mr. Fletcher, when we're talking about folks knowing where to go and making it easier on them, can you help me with the same question I had for Mr. Landau? Which is (b)(2), as I read it, talks about cases of discrimination filed under Federal discrimination laws go to district court, and everything else goes to the Federal Circuit. Now, that would be a nice clean rule; right? Individuals would know that their civil service disputes go to the Federal Circuit and discrimination claims go to district court."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2643.065,2655.74,"So I -- I think it might be a simpler system, but it would be a system that would require the sort of claim-splitting that Justice Kagan referred to earlier in a much more serious way. I think also I agree with you that the statute doesn't expressly provide for district courts to decide civil service claims."
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2660.37,2660.52,Where?
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2660.52,2661.51,Let me give you a couple reasons --
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2661.51,2662.005,Where?
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2662.005,2662.49,Yes.
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2662.49,2663.255,Not reasons.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2664.63,2688.02,"Absolutely. So we start with the general rule that says you -- in Section 7703(b)(1) that says, ""Except as provided in paragraph 2, a petition to review a final order or a final decision of the Board shall be filed in the Federal Circuit."" The provision that we've been talking about that says you can bring a discrimination case in district court is an exception to that rule, which suggests to me that what you're doing is seeking a review of the Board's decision, which, of course, included civil service claims."
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2688.02,2688.98,It doesn't say that.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2696.41,2698.97,But let me -- let me just quote the language.
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2713.65,2714.13,Where?
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2714.13,2718.31,"In Section 7702 itself, where it says a case of discrimination subject to --"
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2718.31,2729.775,"But that -- that just raises the question what ""subject to"" means, right? And -- and you're equating ""subject to"" with ""meeting the test of."" But ""subject to"" can also mean subject to."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2737.45,2738.55,I -- I understand.
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2745.49,2745.66,Right.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2745.66,2747.15,I don't think that's how Congress used it here.
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2747.15,2749.82,"It may or may not qualify, not that it does qualify."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2749.82,2750.2,I guess --
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2750.2,2752.37,"Often, it's used in that sense, right?"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2752.37,2755.03,I -- I'm not sure that it -- I -- I can agree with that.
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2755.03,2757.12,Really? Why not? You just gave me a good example.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2757.12,2759.61,Then I think maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2770.84,2772.72,Do you have any authority for that proposition?
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2772.72,2775.41,"Kloeckner, which I think says, you know, this is a --"
2016.16-399,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2775.41,2776.83,Besides Kloeckner. Anything else?
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2776.83,2786.355,"Well, Kloeckner certainly says it, but beyond Kloeckner, I mean, merits cases that -- that have been -- have been going to district court for years prior to Kloeckner; isn't that right?"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2786.355,2786.85,That's right.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2794.965,2795.33,Right.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2802.74,2804.43,"It would be a big change, yes."
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.43,2810.67,"So when it goes to the district court -- well, here, first, you could go to the district court at the beginning."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2825.965,2826.51,Uh-huh.
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2826.51,2832.88,"-- and in -- in the MSPB. We then can -- if they kept it for 120 days more, we go right to the district court."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2854.02,2857.515,"So in our view, the answer to that question has to be yes."
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2857.515,2859.565,"Otherwise, you're going to bounce, bounce, bounce."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2859.565,2866.92,I don't think that's right. I think those are -- those are provisions that you've described that give the employees options to short-circuit the administrative process in the district court.
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.92,2867.22,"Well, no."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2889.81,2891.01,I -- I think so.
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2893.18,2893.535,Yes.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2893.535,2896.69,Our view -- and this is not -- certainly not all the courts of appeals have agreed.
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2900.84,2901.55,Yes.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2901.55,2904.78,-- and doesn't wait for a final decision and instead goes straight to court --
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2904.78,2905.15,Yes.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2905.15,2907.735,-- what he can bring to court are his discrimination claims.
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2909.39,2912.57,"Oh, really? Now suppose they decide it in the MPSB --"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2912.57,2912.85,Yes.
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2912.85,2914.5,-- and then he goes to district court.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2914.5,2914.87,Yes.
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2914.87,2918.3,Does he get review of the civil service claim in district court?
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2918.3,2919.74,"Absolutely, yes."
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2919.74,2920.79,All right.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2923.59,2923.76,So but --
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.76,2924.46,I see where you're going there.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2924.81,2927.0,"-- the question, Mr. Fletcher, is a contested one."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2927.0,2927.52,Absolutely.
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.05,2992.505,"So just as a matter of pure simplicity, if we could get there, why, if they're going to decide in the district court, I guess, under an ordinary AD-law set of standards, they're going to decide in the district court the civil service claim as well, and you will have nonuniformity in a whole bunch of cases where the MPSB decided no, why not bring this one in too? Because this one in too would give you the added uniform -- it -- it -- there's no more disuniformity than there is in any of the other cases. And all that you have here are just what he said on jurisdiction. What this case is really about is whether there was a voluntary departure from the -- from the civil service or whether he was really fired."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,2992.505,3003.66,"Well, I think, Justice Breyer, taking this sort of decision, this appealability determination is going to take and introduce disuniformity into a whole nother category of issues, like those I was discussing with Justice Sotomayor, and it's going to do it for no good reason."
2016.16-399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3010.12,3010.29,Yeah.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3040.06,3042.13,"But I -- I think it is, Justice Breyer."
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3080.09,3080.59,I'm sorry.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3081.505,3086.3,"I was just going to finish out the thought that under my friend's view, at that threshold point, you go to the district court."
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3104.46,3106.84,You said there has to be a detour either way.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3110.87,3111.225,Yes.
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3111.225,3115.095,But where is the other detour? I thought the other route was straight to the district court.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3115.095,3121.48,"It's straight to the district court, but keep in mind -- and, again, this is page 18 of Petitioner's reply brief -- what he's asking the district court to do."
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3126.07,3126.3,Right.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3126.3,3129.2,"-- reverse it, and send it back to the MSPB for further proceedings."
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3129.2,3132.09,Do you think he has to ask that? Suppose he asked something else.
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3136.7,3138.255,I don't think he could.
2016.16-399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3147.8,3154.25,"There are times where the district court does it without the Board's doing it first, right? When the Board -- when the time period lapses?"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3154.25,3175.97,"It's not in our view, but that's the contested issue, where some -- some courts do allow that to happen, but in -- but in our view, it -- it ought not happen. And I think, in addition, you know, to -- to -- to make the point, I think, my friend has suggested that some of the efficiency, from his view, actually happens when the employee is wrong, when you go to the district court and the district court says, no, the MSPB was correct, this is not an appealable action, what you have is a pure discrimination case."
2016.16-399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3176.72,3190.615,"What happens if he went to the district court and said, I don't care about the Board deciding this issue, voluntary or not voluntary, I just want to pursue the -- the discrimination claim?"
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3190.615,3199.88,"I think if that's what he -- if that's what he wants, he should not seek review of the Board's decision at all, because the regulation that we talked about earlier, 1614.302(b) positions him."
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3218.23,3244.92,"So under your theory, the problem is that if you don't go to the MS -- if you don't go to the Federal Circuit, the district court, it will all get mucked up in the CSRA business because they can't go ahead and decide it, you have to wait, and it has to go back later because of Chenery issues and the like. And the other side is, well, if -- if you go to the -- if you have to go your route, it's the discrimination claim that gets all mucked up, because it may have -- you may need to toll the complaints, the exhaustion issue may be complicated."
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3246.63,3249.57,"I think, though -- I think he has our problem, too."
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3252.53,3255.35,By -- by the tolling and allowing them to start over again?
2016.16-399,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,3255.35,3258.89,"Yes, because -- but you need that, too, even if you send these cases to the district court."
2016.16-399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.75,3342.735,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Landau, four minutes."
2016.16-399,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3342.735,3345.88,"Thank you, Your Honor. Just very briefly, I would like to make two points."
2016.16-399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3473.615,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
