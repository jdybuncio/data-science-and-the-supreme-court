2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.68,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-43, Dahda versus United States. Mr. Shanmugam."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,7.68,27.12,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The federal wiretap statute, Title III, was enacted 50 years ago in response to national concern over wiretapping and the threat it posed to individual privacy. Title III prohibits wiretapping unless a series of detailed requirements is met."
2017.17-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,52.64,80.8,"Mr. Shanmugam, the expression ""insufficient to authorize,"" this order was sufficient to authorize all of the interceptions that were introduced in evidence. The problem was that it authorized more, but that more was never introduced."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,103.56,109.88,"Justice Ginsburg, let me go directly to that threshold argument which the government makes for the first time before this Court."
2017.17-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.16,111.84,You -- you said that.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,117.6,136.84,"The magistrate judge and the district court seemed to conclude that, by virtue of the fact that all of the interceptions that were introduced were interceptions that took place within the court's territorial jurisdiction, that there was no problem, and that, therefore, suppression was not required."
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,193.48,194.36,But those -- but those weren't --
2017.17-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,194.36,199.48,"But it was fully sufficient for what, in fact, happened, other than Missouri, and we'll have leave that out."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,199.48,209.6,"But, Justice Kennedy, if the statute merely prohibited the introduction of evidence from unlawful interceptions, I might be inclined to agree with you."
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,248.48,272.56,"Well, I understand ""inadequate"" being the same as ""insufficient,"" but I don't understand ""invalid."" I mean, if you have a requirement, you know, you must have these four things in your -- in your order, and you have -- and you fill them out and you've got all four, and then you've got another one that's not required, it seems to me that that might be invalid, but -- but you can't say it's insufficient."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,288.64,303.96,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I suppose that one could try to draw fine distinctions between all of these terms. I think each of the three dictionaries on which the government relies defines the term ""invalid"" to mean ""inadequate,"" and they define ""inadequate"" to mean ""insufficient."" But I think even if you think --"
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,303.96,306.96,"Yeah, but you need them to define ""insufficient"" to mean ""invalid."""
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,306.96,314.04,"But I'm happy to -- to -- to fight this case on the ground that we're talking about insufficiency or, as you put it, inadequacy."
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,315.04,324.08,"Well, what about invalidity? Forget I said inadequacy. You have to say that ""insufficient"" -- you have to say that ""invalid"" is the same as ""insufficient."""
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,324.08,326.76,"I don't think that that's necessarily true, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.17-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.44,337.04,Could the orders have been used for anything?
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,337.04,337.36,No.
2017.17-43,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.08,339.64,"Well, then it's invalid."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,339.64,340.4,"Well, correct."
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,354.0,359.32,"You didn't -- the -- the order didn't need any statement with regard to the territorial limitation, did it?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,359.32,360.56,We believe that --
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,360.56,365.56,"If that were not in this order, the order would still be sufficient, correct?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,365.56,377.04,"We believe that the orders would still be insufficient if they did not contain that; in other words, we believe that the better reading of this statute is that it requires the jurisdictional limitation to appear on the face of the order."
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,378.6,380.44,Do you -- do you have any authority for that?
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,380.44,382.52,I would rely on the language of the statute itself.
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,382.52,384.64,Do you have any judicial authority interpreting the statute?
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,384.64,392.4,"So I'm not aware of any case that presents the question of what would happen if a jurisdictional limitation were entirely omitted, and my understanding is that --"
2017.17-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,392.4,395.16,Where do you see it in the statute as requiring that?
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,395.16,398.48,So I would point to 2518(3) itself.
2017.17-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.52,452.6,"So if the -- if the -- if the application just says telephone X pursuant to whatever it is, whatever the -- cites the statutory section, but doesn't say District of Kansas?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,452.6,464.88,"I think that that would still be insufficient. But, Mr. Chief Justice, to get back to your question that started this discussion, I don't think that the Court needs to answer that question where, as here, you have a provision that goes further."
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,465.64,471.0,"But it doesn't go -- wait -- wait just a second, because I -- I might be missing this."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,481.96,482.28,Yes.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,483.28,486.32,"Were you telephone number 1 or number 2, one of those two?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,486.32,489.08,"You know, there were multiple communications pursuant to --"
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,489.08,491.0,"I know that, but I mean for purposes of this order."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,491.0,491.48,Yes.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,491.48,491.52,Okay.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,502.96,508.08,So the orders -- and let me take you to page 97 of the Joint Appendix.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.08,508.64,That's what I'm on.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,508.64,508.68,Okay.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.68,539.88,"And it says -- it doesn't say anything about -- it talks about outside the territorial jurisdiction in the one -- in the relevant full paragraph on page 97. I don't see here anywhere. I mean, if what you said was true, why didn't you challenge this on the ground that it's insufficient because it does not claim or put in words that, in respect to telephone number 1 and telephone number 2, you have authority to intercept within the jurisdiction of the issuing magistrate, which I think was New York, wasn't it, or was it?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,539.88,542.08,So the judge who entered this was a judge in Kansas.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,542.08,543.12,Kansas.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,543.92,544.2,Right.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,544.56,544.76,Yeah.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,544.76,545.88,And I think that this language --
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,545.88,546.48,All right.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,549.8,552.64,"Well, I think it's -- that is implicit in the paragraph --"
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,552.64,552.92,No.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,552.92,553.6,-- on page 97.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,553.6,553.88,No.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,574.68,576.12,"Well, you know, I -- I --"
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,576.12,578.32,I take from your hesitation it does not.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,578.32,578.48,No.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,580.6,581.76,Implicit that it says other --
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,581.76,586.64,"-- that if the telephone is in the territorial jurisdiction, that interception may take place within the territorial jurisdiction."
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,586.64,586.8,All right.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,588.16,591.28,"But I think our -- but I think our argument would be the same, Justice Breyer."
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,606.52,606.96,All right.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,606.96,608.12,-- of these phones and the other phones.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,608.12,628.16,"The reason -- see, I -- I can't ask my question because you've stopped me cold; that is, what I thought was that we'd have an order which says you can tap in Kansas and you can also tap outside of Kansas. And I find the paragraph which says you can tap outside of Kansas."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,663.4,663.76,Yeah.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,664.16,665.44,So you see my puzzlement?
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,665.44,667.04,"I do see your point, Justice Breyer."
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,702.84,703.4,All right.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,727.52,729.6,"I mean, you can do that, Justice Breyer."
2017.17-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,754.8,766.2,"Is your -- is your view dependent on our accepting that, that it's not only a foundational requirement but that it's a foundational requirement that has to be on the face of the order?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,766.2,769.24,"No, because of the overbreadth of the orders."
2017.17-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,789.76,790.56,I -- I tried to --
2017.17-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,790.56,796.52,"Well, irrespective of whether the jurisdiction has to be stated on the face of the order?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,796.52,831.4,"Yes, that is correct. In other words, our view is that because there is a conceded failure to comply with one of Title III's requirements, that's all that's needed. And I think that the government's argument would really lead to strange and anomalous results here. In our reply brief, we give the example of an order that authorized interception for 180 days rather than 30 days. I think the government would take -- I think the government would take the same position: That that order would not be facially insufficient because it would merely be overbroad, in Justice Ginsburg's words."
2017.17-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,831.4,844.8,"Yeah, but in that situation, if the -- if there were interceptions beyond the period that's allowed by the statute, then -- then those would be suppressed under, I guess it's Subsection 1, right, so it was acquired illegally?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,844.8,848.72,"Well, I'm not sure about that, Justice Alito."
2017.17-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,862.76,876.08,"I thought the circuit split that we had granted on was whether the core concern analysis applied to subdivisions ii and iii, three."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,877.32,879.88,That is the question on which this Court granted cert.
2017.17-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,880.6,890.96,"Well, it wasn't the question presented, but that seemed to be the focus of the entire briefing in this case, with the exception of the government's new argument that this wasn't insufficient, but --"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,890.96,891.16,Yes.
2017.17-43,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.36,895.44,"-- putting that aside, I thought that we granted cert on that."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,895.44,898.76,That is the question on which the circuits are divided.
2017.17-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,924.52,926.08,"But, you know, if we --"
2017.17-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,926.08,939.96,"But why -- why should we, if we think that the phrase ""insufficient"" doesn't mean overbreadth, why should we proceed to base a decision on a premise that we think is wrong?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,939.96,940.92,"Well, first --"
2017.17-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,940.92,959.92,"And -- and -- and your point about why was the district court wrong when it said simply the government did not actually intercept communications outside this Court's jurisdiction; therefore, as applied, the orders did not violate the statute."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,962.44,966.36,I think that that is a regime that Congress could have enacted.
2017.17-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,985.84,992.56,"I mean, I tried to figure out where this ""insufficient on its face"" language came from, because it is somewhat curious."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1012.52,1017.8,So I don't think that we know that that is where the phrase came from.
2017.17-43,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1048.8,1072.12,"I mean, if you -- do you think that if this situation had been presented to the Congress that enacted the -- the 1968 legislation, which was basically anti-crime legislation, that they would have said, yes, in this case, Mr. Dahda can't be convicted even though what happened here had no effect whatsoever on him?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1072.12,1140.84,"I do think so, and I think so precisely because of what Congress, or the Senate, to be more precise, said in the Senate report, where -- where the Senate made quite clear -- and this is at page 96 of the report -- that it intended to compel compliance, strict compliance, with the requirements of the statute. And, again, as I indicated at the outset, Title III was enacted against the backdrop of a vigorous national debate over whether wiretapping should even be permitted in the first place. And I think, as part of the compromise that was struck when Congress enacted Title III, it included a very muscular suppression provision. Now I think what the government tries to do throughout its brief, and I suspect you'll hear this from my friend Mr. Tripp today, is to try to get this Court to think about this case in traditional Fourth Amendment terms where the Court is always taking into account broader principles of prejudice and causation and the like. And I think that where this is clearest is in the government's argument that the Court should somehow sever the invalid applications of the orders from valid ones."
2017.17-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1140.84,1142.84,But there was no invalid application.
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1160.72,1161.8,"Well, in fact, there were."
2017.17-43,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1211.56,1220.92,"But you -- you -- you did recognize that if that paragraph were deleted, this order wouldn't be sufficient?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1220.92,1221.52,Potentially.
2017.17-43,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1308.68,1319.96,"But here's the problem that -- look, first, if I look at this, what that -- what you just pointed to says you have to have in this document the nature and location of where the authority to intercept is granted."
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1387.04,1392.52,"I understand that instinct, Justice Breyer, because that would be a natural Fourth Amendment instinct."
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1430.72,1431.16,You keep --
2017.17-43,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1431.16,1432.48,"Well, Mr. Shan --"
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1432.48,1454.56,"You keep mixing, as you just did, ""insufficient"" and ""invalid."" And I want to make sure I understand your view on it. If somebody told you to bring to a party apples, bananas, and pears, and you brought apples, bananas, pears, and cherries, the person would not say that's insufficient. Right?"
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1454.56,1458.56,I think that a person might say that that's insufficient.
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1460.64,1461.84,Who would do that? I'm sorry. (Laughter.)
2017.17-43,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1461.84,1468.88,"I mean, I don't think you would -- I don't think in that context, you know, you would ordinarily talk about insufficiency."
2017.17-43,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.48,1559.04,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Tripp."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1559.04,1584.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think, as most of the questioning has already picked up, the best way to encapsulate our basic position in this case is just to imagine what would have happened if everything was exactly the same except this -- this language was missing from the orders, it didn't add this additional authority telling us that we could put the wire room outside Kansas. If that had happened, there would clearly be no basis for suppressing any of the evidence we relied on here."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1591.68,1594.6,"I'm sorry, let's go back to that point."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1616.48,1624.08,"It's not the -- so Title III says in no uncertain terms what every Title III order ""shall"" specify."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1627.88,1629.96,"25 -- yes, and I was reading that."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1629.96,1638.2,And -- and -- and the -- the -- the location of the place where we're going to put our wire room is not one of those items.
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1651.04,1652.68,It's actually in subdivision (3).
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1652.68,1653.92,"Right, on 16a of our -- our gray brief, yeah."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1653.92,1670.48,"And it says ""may enter an ex parte order as requested or as modified,"" et cetera, ""within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is sitting."" You take that ""within"" to mean that the judge has to be within that jurisdiction?"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1670.48,1671.64,"Well, so -- wait, sorry."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1671.64,1674.0,Or that the order has to be within that jurisdiction?
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1674.0,1687.2,"So we -- we now agree -- there -- there was dispute in the lower courts about whether a tapped mobile phone qualified as a mobile interception device within the next clause of that, saying that we could put our wire room anywhere in the country."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1692.4,1693.52,I -- I -- I'm sorry.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1704.8,1709.08,"Yes, so an -- an order from the District of Kansas, we need to put our wire room in the District of Kansas."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1709.08,1709.12,All right.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1716.4,1718.44,"Yeah, that is absolutely our position."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1718.44,1719.08,That's your position?
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1719.08,1719.76,"Yeah, absolutely."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1720.16,1720.32,All right.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1720.32,1722.4,-- follows just straight from the text of the statute.
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1723.04,1737.56,"So you're saying only a violation of those four, of -- of subparagraph (4), even though the whole process of ordering is premised on it being an order within the jurisdiction of the Court?"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1737.56,1742.96,"Well, I -- I -- so this is obviously an order from the Kansas court."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1747.56,1755.12,"That's such a strange position, though, that you would have an order that wouldn't tell you where you could do this."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1755.12,1756.88,I -- I -- I think it -- it just follows.
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1772.8,1784.24,"What did it do with the requirement of every warrant that you have to give a time, place? We know the rule requires a time, a place."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1784.24,1784.84,Right.
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1784.96,1786.04,But there's no place here.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1786.04,1794.48,"No, the -- the -- the -- so if you look at the checklist of items that -- that the statute expressly requires every order to contain, it -- it does all of those things."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1795.76,1806.68,How about if the judge fails to make the required findings under (3)? Would the order be insufficient if he didn't do what subparagraph (3) requires?
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1806.68,1811.48,I -- I think actually that is a classic example of something that would fall within prong 1.
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1830.84,1830.96,Uh-huh.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1840.4,1841.52,If jurisdiction is --
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1841.52,1843.0,"i, I should say, not 1, under --"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1843.0,1853.04,"Sorry, an important point. So, if jurisdiction is missing and we sought to introduce evidence that was intercepted from outside the jurisdiction, right, if we had -- if there had been no language in this case, in -- in these orders --"
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1853.04,1854.72,This is a more interesting argument --
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1854.72,1855.0,It is.
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1855.0,1862.12,-- what you're -- because I can't figure out how you could have an order that doesn't have jurisdiction.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1868.2,1869.56,So I -- I think --
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1869.56,1874.0,"So, if it's not correctable somewhere, it makes no sense to me."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1874.0,1877.84,The -- the -- it does not need to say where the wire room needs to be located.
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1904.68,1957.88,"But, Mr. Tripp, if -- if -- if you -- if the order doesn't have to include anything about territorial jurisdiction, how is anybody to know whether it approves interception only within the territorial jurisdiction or instead outside that jurisdiction? I mean, there's a -- there's a -- there's a choice here, depending on whether there's a mobile interception device, right? If there's a mobile interception device, you can approve interception more widely than if there's not a mobile interception device. So I would think looking at this statute -- and I recognize that it's not included in one of the things that's said in Number 4, but that Number 3, you know, just implicitly requires a court to say which one it is, is it just within the jurisdiction or is it outside the jurisdiction, because there's a mobile interception device at issue."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1957.88,1966.48,So I -- I -- I think our first response is that the statute doesn't require it to appear in the order because the statute doesn't say that. And then I think the -- the second is that the background --
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1966.48,1971.48,"Well, how is -- I guess what I'm saying is -- I appreciate that -- but how is anybody to know unless the court says that?"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1971.48,1972.24,So I think --
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1972.24,1975.96,"I mean, they're not going to know what they can do unless the court says what they can do."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,1975.96,1976.16,Right.
2017.17-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2009.92,2011.04,But you -- you were wrong about that.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2011.04,2012.16,We were wrong.
2017.17-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2012.16,2020.68,"Am I -- am I right that that's an obsolete thing? The mobile interception device you thought was the mobile phone, but it's really the bug."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2020.68,2021.84,"It's really the bug, that's right."
2017.17-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2021.84,2024.92,"And now they don't use bugs anymore, do they?"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2024.92,2038.92,"Not -- not never, but, you know, you -- you -- you might install a bug inside a car or something to track all the communications in the car, not just the communications over a phone. It's just a different kind of case and -- and -- and would -- none of that --"
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2038.92,2041.24,"But let me say this another way, Mr. Tripp."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2084.16,2084.56,"Well, I --"
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2084.56,2086.6,Where is the interception supposed to take place?
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2086.6,2086.76,So --
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2086.76,2092.6,"Either within the jurisdiction or outside, depending on whether there's a mobile interception device."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2096.52,2096.68,So I --
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2096.68,2098.72,-- which of those two possible things is true?
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2098.72,2100.32,So I -- and two follow-ups on that.
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2109.6,2113.76,"Well, no, but it is an either/or because if it's -- if there's a mobile interception device, it's both."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2116.64,2117.24,"Right, and I think --"
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2117.24,2120.96,"And that's a disjunctive thing, it's only one or it's both?"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2120.96,2146.4,"Yes, but -- but that is something that goes to how the government is going to implement the order, how we're going to go about intercepting the communications. It -- it -- it is not a -- a -- a determination that the judge needs to make up front when issuing the order. Actually, I think another thing that drives that home is in 3, 3 goes on and lists a number of things that come after this jurisdictional provision that the judge must determine on the basis of facts submitted by the applicant."
2017.17-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2150.08,2150.8,It does say --
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2150.8,2153.12,-- whether we're using a mobile interception device.
2017.17-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2155.36,2156.6,This was a new --
2017.17-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2156.6,2173.0,"Mr. Tripp, how do you -- how do you answer Mr. Shanmugam's positing, suppose this order had authorized the interception to continue for 180 days when the statute says only 30 days?"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2173.0,2173.28,Yeah.
2017.17-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.84,2244.64,"I'm a little bit still worried about what we discovered at the outset, that at least they are claiming that this order has to say you have authority to wiretap in Kansas as well as outside. So it occurs -- there are two things which worry me."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2253.32,2253.88,Right.
2017.17-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.88,2274.44,"So it may be that they're thinking, given 3, you know, given what you read us in -- on page 16a where it says a judge can within his territorial jurisdiction authorize a wiretap, that that's good enough. It says he's in Kansas."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2324.56,2325.0,Right.
2017.17-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.0,2328.24,"-- on those thousands, if there are those thousands."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2329.36,2333.08,I would say I'm quite worried about that as well.
2017.17-43,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2363.56,2363.72,Okay.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2383.32,2391.32,"Well, so, on that, I think I'd like to echo what Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, which is that we -- we won on the basis of severability in the district court."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2412.48,2433.64,"Mr. Cox (sic), just so I understand your argument, your argument really is that the core -- the court's approach was right, that the core concern analysis applies to (ii) and (iii), that what we announced in Giordano and -- and -- was it Chavez?"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2433.64,2434.76,Chavez -- yeah.
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2434.76,2438.56,-- that that inquiry applies to those two subdivisions.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2438.56,2439.52,I -- I think --
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2439.52,2458.56,"So let -- let's assume for the sake of argument, because I understand you're saying the only thing needed by the order is subparagraph (iv), that if it misses any one of these four things, we apply the core concerns analysis."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2458.56,2461.6,"No, I don't think that's a -- that's an accurate description of our position."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2461.6,2463.36,So what is your -- your -- your -- your point?
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2463.36,2468.8,"So I think it would help if I could clarify what exactly we mean by ""insufficient"" and ""overbroad."""
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2468.8,2470.84,"No, I don't want to know those terms."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2492.32,2495.68,So the way I -- I like to put it is -- so our front line --
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2495.68,2498.16,"No, just answer my question."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2498.16,2505.24,"We think that the court of appeals -- to the extent the Chavez and Giordano test is relevant, we think the court of appeals put it in the wrong box."
2017.17-43,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2520.64,2522.8,Your point is that this is not insufficient?
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2522.8,2523.72,Our -- right.
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2531.44,2534.28,"Mr. Tripp -- I'm sorry, finish your sentence."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2534.28,2537.12,"Well, I -- so I just want to be clear about --"
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2537.12,2538.68,"Well, if you're really --"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2538.68,2539.56,Go ahead.
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2540.96,2559.6,"When you say ""insufficient,"" I mean, you know, the Chief Justice raises a very good point that ""insufficient"" doesn't usually mean invalid, that it usually means lacking something. So then the question is, well, was this order lacking something? And you say no, it wasn't because it didn't have to have anything about the jurisdictional reach of the interception."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2600.48,2602.44,"No, I don't think that's the upshot of our position."
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2656.84,2657.68,I guess --
2017.17-43,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2657.68,2666.64,"If the -- if the -- if you were seeking to use a mobile -- a real mobile interception device, would that appear in the application?"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2666.64,2695.84,"I think if we were going to actually seek for approval to put a bug in somebody's car like a mobile interception device in that way, I think it would be clear from the application that that's what we were talking about doing. But the -- the orders -- you know, in the applications and the orders, we didn't explain to the court that we were going to be tapping from a wire room on the -- on the basis of a provider cooperation obtained under a different federal statute that the --"
2017.17-43,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2695.84,2699.88,"I mean, when this statute was enacted in 1968, there were no cell phones."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2732.76,2733.04,No.
2017.17-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2761.16,2769.12,"Mr. Tripp, one thing that -- one thing that the statute requires is that the order identify the person authorizing the wiretap."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2784.72,2787.4,Maybe you could read the statute that way.
2017.17-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.72,2797.72,So you think something that literally complies with the statute can be insufficient because it's invalid?
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2797.72,2811.84,"It -- it's more that I think when the statute says that you need to identify -- so each order needs to identify the identity of the person who approved the application and then when the -- the Title III tells you that that has to be a person of, you know --"
2017.17-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2811.84,2812.52,Right.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2812.52,2815.04,-- that -- that that incorporates that into the requirement.
2017.17-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2824.56,2826.6,"Then it would be lacking, lacking something."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2826.6,2829.48,It would be lacking something that Title III expressly makes necessary.
2017.17-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2829.48,2833.08,What would it be lacking? It says that you should identify the person authorizing it.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2837.36,2837.8,I would -- so --
2017.17-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2837.8,2840.2,"I mean, it's not permitted under the statute."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2840.2,2858.96,"I think -- so our -- our -- our definition of what ""insufficient"" on its face means is that if it is lacking something that is necessary for the government to actually just rely on the orders to intercept the communications at issue, I think in that case it would be quite clear that the order would be lacking something that is necessary for the government to intercept those communications."
2017.17-43,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2885.2,2920.84,"Mr. Tripp, I'd like to ask you about the Glover case, a D.C. Circuit case which is set up as creating a split with this decision. Am I wrong in my understanding of Glover that the district court in the District of Columbia authorized something that she had no authority to order because she ordered a bug to be attached to a truck in another jurisdiction? So it wasn't a question of overbreadth."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,2934.08,2934.64,Right.
2017.17-43,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3005.88,3034.56,"I mean, if we're talking about easy ways to resolve this case, I have to say the more I think about this, the more it seems really complicated to me, what's supposed to be in these orders and what's not supposed to be in these orders. The only thing I'm sure of in this case is that there's no core concern requirement. So why isn't that the easy way to decide this case and leave everything else for cases where actually people have briefed and addressed these questions of what has to be in and what has to be out and when you can call something insufficient and when not?"
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3034.56,3057.64,"So, of course, we agree that the Court could send the case back to the court of appeals on that basis, although I just -- a couple caveats. We agree that, basically as a full-back argument on insufficiency, that the -- that the Chavez and Giordano test is -- is appropriately considered as to whether the order is insufficient on -- in -- in the first place."
2017.17-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3095.92,3112.68,"On that one point, might it have been true that you did use some of the California intercepts from -- that originate from Missouri as part of your general investigation? Maybe that hasn't been raised in this case."
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3112.68,3113.76,"Yeah, and this is --"
2017.17-43,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3113.76,3116.44,Maybe a fruit of the poison tree argument or something like that.
2017.17-43,1,56164,zachary_d_tripp,,3116.44,3117.64,"Yeah, this is something I wanted to clarify."
2017.17-43,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3230.2,3233.08,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Shanmugam."
2017.17-43,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3233.08,3249.4,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The district court in this case exceeded its power under Title III by authorizing what was effectively a nationwide wiretap for the phones at issue.
