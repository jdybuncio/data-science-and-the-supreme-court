1992.92-641,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.937,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-641, Leonard Nobelman against the American Savings Bank."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,39.206,43.11,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,472.48,475.431,You mean your clients weren't trying to alter a secured claim.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,475.431,479.305,"They were not and, in fact, have not."
1992.92-641,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,497.516,507.674,"Mr. Palmer, I'm not sure that 1332(b)(2) refers to secured claim."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,518.96,519.941,And that argument--
1992.92-641,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.941,539.694,"It's an identification of the instance in which the... where there is a security interest in real property that is the principal residence, it says no modification of the rights of holders could be made."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,556.365,564.52,"--Let me answer or state to the first one first, and then we'll come to the rights of holders."
1992.92-641,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,622.207,625.921,"Well, that's dangerous business, I suppose."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,626.562,634.506,"It's been cited several times for the grammatical analysis which, frankly, does appeal to me at this moment."
1992.92-641,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,703.262,714.929,"Mr. Palmer, I hope you will discuss either now or after we return from the noon recess, the bearing you think the Dewsnup... our opinion in Dewsnup against Timm has on this."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,719.921,729.668,"Dewsnup and lien pass through, we can certainly start it now and may not finish."
1992.92-641,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.143,981.373,We'll resume there at 1:00.
1992.92-641,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,981.373,996.673,"Mr. Palmer, you may resume."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,996.673,1007.101,"When we took our noon break, we were discussing Dewsnup, and I'd like to pick up again at that point."
1992.92-641,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.642,1210.203,"Favored over Chapter 7, Mr. Palmer?"
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1210.203,1211.933,Favored over Chapter 7.
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.201,1223.902,Under Chapter 7.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1223.902,1226.574,"Than he would have to do under Chapter 7, yes."
1992.92-641,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1226.574,1232.079,But he also gets some benefits from Chapter 13 that a Chapter 7 debtor doesn't.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1232.079,1233.619,That is true.
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.474,1324.138,"Mr. Palmer, would you explain... explain how your system works?"
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1353.566,1365.206,"Let me begin by explaining it in an area where there is absolutely no controversy between the parties, the $50,000 lien on the $100,000 automobile."
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.453,1423.594,"No, I understand that."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1457.696,1463.639,"Well, the single instrument is defined as between the parties and in a nonbankruptcy context."
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1472.194,1473.305,"Well, I understand that."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1494.05,1501.794,"Well, at the inception we apply 506 and 1322(b)(2), and we've talked about that."
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1532.905,1533.975,"Well, but we're not talking about the revesting provision."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1555.279,1556.731,"--Well, we're not going to modify the unsecured rights."
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1565.887,1572.359,"No, but the provision we're talking about is a provision that allows rights to be modified, right?"
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1573.962,1575.763,That's 506(a).
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1575.763,1576.344,And... right.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1593.734,1595.454,I say the latter.
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.454,1605.642,And just give me an example of a real life mortgage agreement in which you modify the unsecured portion but not the secured portion.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1610.694,1617.21,"That approaches it backwards, I have to admit, from the way I've always looked at it."
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.21,1619.691,"Well, I do things that way, I guess."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1621.193,1627.127,I've always looked at it that we're modifying the secured portion and thereby automatically making the rest unsecured.
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.041,1638.193,"Well, I don't care if there's a case or not."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1654.493,1656.095,All right.
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.252,1690.758,"Does the... in 13 does... if the secured creditor wants to participate, does he have to file a claim?"
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1690.758,1698.782,All claims are supposed to be filed in a 13.
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.782,1699.473,Yeah.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1699.804,1701.296,There's nothing equivalent to 111(a) where--
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.296,1714.092,"--Under 506... under 506 does a secured creditor... with 506 in mind, does he just file a claim for the full amount of his security?"
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1714.092,1715.324,"--Traditionally, yes."
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.324,1723.038,And he never then files a claim for the unsecured portion.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1723.038,1723.869,No.
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.482,1728.291,Yes.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1728.291,1735.016,"Which says we value... as they did here... we value your equity at $23,500."
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.369,1740.77,But the secured creditor has filed a claim for the full amount.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1740.77,1742.893,Has filed a claim for the full amount.
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.893,1745.255,As a secured creditor... as a secured claim.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1745.255,1747.304,It... as a secured claim.
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.304,1767.046,"And so he has an... so the secured creditor, whether it's a... whether it's a homestead or not, he has a... he has a chance to litigate the value that they assign."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1767.046,1769.109,That is so.
1992.92-641,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1787.821,1788.572,Yeah.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1788.572,1790.713,But the opportunity is always there.
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.383,1797.537,Mr.... is this another point or are you still responding to the same one?
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1797.537,1798.428,"--No, it was another point."
1992.92-641,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.428,1806.262,"Before you do that, let's take a... I'm not satisfied or I don't understand your answer to my previous question."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1825.416,1826.075,They do.
1992.92-641,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1834.122,1843.207,"But even if that is so, you're still modifying it because you're not going to pay the same mortgage amount for... or the same periodic payment amount for the same period of time."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1843.207,1843.786,No.
1992.92-641,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1843.786,1848.351,"No matter how you cut it, you've got to modify something with respect to what's left of the secured portion."
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1848.351,1862.449,"Well, the... if you reduce the balance that's due... the unpaid principal, if you will, to the $23,500, when the payments, after interest service, have reached $23,500, that lien will be paid off."
1992.92-641,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1862.449,1863.19,Yeah.
1992.92-641,0,38244,philip_palmer,,1877.599,1890.669,I have reduced the amount of the debt by what we have determined to be unsecured.
1992.92-641,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.669,1894.11,"Thank you, Mr. Palmer."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,1896.713,1901.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.007,1997.366,"""Other than the holder of a claim secured only by a security interest. """
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,1997.366,1998.288,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.288,1999.179,"Yes, uh-huh, all right."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,1999.179,2016.55,"And applying Mr. Palmer's rule of last antecedent, several courts which have allowed lien strip-down have simply gone back and applied the ""other than"" words simply to the phrase ""secured claim""."
1992.92-641,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2030.539,2041.027,"Under your view, what is the result if there is a second mortgage as to which there is no adequate security at all?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2049.152,2059.447,"So long as he had a perfected security interest in the property at the time of the filing of bankruptcy, he would be a secured creditor, that's correct."
1992.92-641,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2062.55,2071.625,Even though the value of the property does not support any portion of his secured... any portion of his claim as a secured claim.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2071.625,2072.255,--That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2102.586,2105.99,It's difficult for me to square that with 506(a).
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2110.942,2112.442,"I understand that, Your Honor."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.422,2185.682,"Well, I suppose your colleague on the other side would... the meaning he would ascribe to 1322(b)(2) would be the same if it just read"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2203.522,2207.594,I think for Mr. Palmer's position that would be correct.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.412,2223.897,And but you... but rights you figure are those rights defined by State law.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2223.897,2225.847,That's... I'll get into that argument--
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.847,2235.915,"Well, I know, but you have to get to it because otherwise you can say... you could argue that well the rights are those that are... that are described in 506."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2239.745,2254.194,"--Well, we would take the position, Your Honor, that the term ""rights"", as opposed to the words ""claim"", and ""security interest"" and ""lien"" and other words of art in the Bankruptcy Code... the word ""rights"" is not defined anywhere in the Bankruptcy Code itself."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.194,2255.386,"So it's State law rights, I guess."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2255.386,2271.317,"Well, this... this Court, in Dewsnup, gave us some direction as to some of the rights that a holder of a mortgage has, with respect to its note and deed of trust, a mortgage."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.71,2328.173,Well I... I'm surprised this is even an issue.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2350.499,2351.25,And that's exactly--
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.25,2352.98,Certainly everybody understands that's what it means.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2352.98,2353.601,--And that's exactly--
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.601,2354.811,"And those are State rights, aren't they?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2354.811,2355.312,--That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.312,2362.216,"So why isn't your answer to Justice White simply yes, it includes State rights?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2362.216,2363.576,"Yes, it does include State rights."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.918,2367.679,How about not... but limited to.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2378.038,2380.078,--Yes.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.092,2386.951,"Yes, all right."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2386.951,2387.402,"So, yes."
1992.92-641,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2408.485,2417.722,"Mr. Schroeder, could I just interrupt you for a second--"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2417.722,2418.122,--Yes.
1992.92-641,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2418.122,2419.772,--With what I assume is an easier question.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2426.618,2427.679,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2427.679,2428.05,Okay.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2428.05,2429.68,"If it's not homestead, for example."
1992.92-641,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2429.68,2431.22,"The second one is not homestead, that's right."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2431.22,2431.661,If that's--
1992.92-641,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2431.661,2434.563,"One, he's got a lien on the homestead and then he's got a second mortgage."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2435.734,2437.574,"--That would be our interpretation, yes."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.006,2443.308,Rights means the rights to which the lien that's a lien on a homestead relates.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2443.308,2445.24,--Correct.
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.24,2446.209,Okay.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2454.905,2455.866,"And that's... yes, sir."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.607,2470.286,And that alone.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2470.286,2474.911,"--And that... under that statute alone, that seems where that protection is directed, that's correct."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2510.043,2516.327,"To be fair, it refers... it refers not just to a claim, but to a claim secured, which is poetic for secured claim."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2519.63,2522.402,"Some courts have interpreted it that way, yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-641,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2535.658,2543.603,Only lawyers could come up with that sort of a distinction.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2545.746,2548.318,That's what I was told when I got my certificate from this Court.
1992.92-641,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2549.179,2563.248,"Counsel, what can the debtor in a Chapter 13 proceeding do, then, in a situation such as the Nobelmans have?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2571.472,2580.739,"They have several elections or alternatives, and some of the alternatives are not very realistic."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2648.393,2653.415,"Yeah, but he's got to keep... he's not only got to make up arrearages; he's got to pay his current amounts due."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2653.415,2653.996,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2656.006,2663.523,"Well, and in your position, pay off the whole principal balance even though the property isn't worth it at all."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2663.523,2664.873,Well--
1992.92-641,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2664.873,2668.545,"So does he have another alternative, just walk away from it?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2668.545,2669.727,--He can walk away from it.
1992.92-641,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2681.426,2686.819,"Well, if he wants to walk away from it, would he have to do it in a Chapter 7 proceeding, very likely?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2686.819,2689.58,"If he wants to avoid personal liability, that's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-641,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2743.365,2758.105,"Now, a majority of the circuits have gone the other way."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2758.105,2758.894,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2758.894,2763.959,How do you... how do you explain that?
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2771.843,2779.817,"Well, if I might answer your question, Your Honor, by addressing the four specific cases individually."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2972.817,2983.704,So your submission is that a plan may not be confirmed unless it provides for the payment of the entire principal amount.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2983.704,2985.524,To a home mortgage lender.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2985.524,2985.915,Yes.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2985.915,2986.676,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.676,2989.838,And no part of it can be treated as an unsecured claim.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,2997.161,2998.383,Not necessarily.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.383,3004.297,--How may the rights of unsecured creditors be modified in a Chapter 13 proceeding?
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3004.297,3006.158,How may the unsecured rights--
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3006.158,3006.648,Uh-hum.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3006.648,3007.309,--Be modified?
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.309,3011.583,Do they have to pay them at all?
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3011.583,3020.138,"In a Chapter 13 proceeding, a debtor is required to submit to the court, as required by the Code, his disposable income."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.138,3020.777,Right.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3020.777,3023.95,"That income that is over and above his living expenses, simply."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.95,3024.621,Right.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3024.621,3033.826,That disposable income goes in part to pay certain claims in the bankruptcy case.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3035.279,3035.616,Sure.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3035.616,3037.008,"Potentially, attorney fees."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3037.008,3037.419,Yes.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3037.419,3038.308,Unsecured creditors.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.308,3040.481,How about secured creditors?
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3040.481,3044.883,Secured creditors are dealt with... and potentially secured creditors.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.307,3056.771,"Well, how about the... how about the principal amount, the unpaid principal amount?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3056.771,3065.497,The unpaid principal amount in a typical residential mortgage situation--
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.497,3065.877,Yes.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3065.877,3069.87,"--Is going to be included, in part, in the prepetition arrearage."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3069.87,3070.662,Yes.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3070.662,3071.631,Because the prepetition arrearage--
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.631,3072.032,Right.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3073.741,3075.403,--But now... the unpaid amount?
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.403,3076.673,"The rest of it, yeah."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3076.673,3083.889,"It's our position that there cannot be any modification on that, whether it is secured or not."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.665,3091.155,Yeah.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3091.155,3095.366,Those rights cannot be modified as against a residential--
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.366,3112.598,"But when... when the... suppose the disposal income is not enough to pay anything more than, say... it just obviously isn't enough ever to pay off unsecured claims, all of them."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3112.598,3115.05,"--Usually that's the case, yes."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.05,3115.539,Yes.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3120.323,3121.673,Debt.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3130.689,3149.994,"--But in any event, the principal amount, the unpaid principal amount of the contract or on the mortgage on the principal residence just lingers."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3152.424,3154.295,"That is our position, yes, sir."
1992.92-641,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.295,3156.906,May I just ask to get one thing clear in my mind.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3167.935,3187.337,"That is... my position on that, Your Honor, is that is dealt with by another section of the Bankruptcy Code, specifically section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code and, in certain cases, section 1301 of the Bankruptcy Code which imposes upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition an automatic stay."
1992.92-641,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.337,3190.229,So this is done by statute rather than by a plan.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3190.229,3191.471,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.634,3196.534,I see.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3196.534,3197.185,"--""Other than""."
1992.92-641,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.185,3199.405,That is not a modification caused by the plan.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3199.405,3200.066,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3207.383,3209.994,Yeah.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3209.994,3210.785,In addition--
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.785,3216.327,"Mr. Schroeder, what... what if you have two mortgages on a property, okay?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3216.327,3216.788,--Yes.
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3216.788,3221.09,And even the first one is undersecured.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3228.744,3233.72,"Under our reading of the statute, the way it is currently written, yes."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3233.72,3238.732,Even though that second mortgage doesn't even qualify as a secured claim at all.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3241.594,3245.097,"Under 506 it may not be secured, that's correct."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.567,3246.258,It is not secured.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3249.07,3249.678,--That--
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3249.678,3251.391,It is not a secured claim under 506(a).
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3251.391,3252.219,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3252.219,3261.316,"But under your reading it would have full protection under... as a second mortgage even though the first mortgage gobbles up the entire value of the security, right?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3261.316,3261.807,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.807,3262.558,Wow.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3262.558,3269.042,And so our position would be that the debtors need to make some elections and some choices about whether that home is worth keeping or not.
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3289.686,3290.297,"Well, they--"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3290.297,3290.764,The--
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.764,3303.544,"--I would think under your position in this case, it would be better for the... for the homeowner just to say go ahead and foreclose, just abandon the property to you."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3303.544,3306.065,--Yes.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3310.389,3313.501,"And then... and what rights would you have, then, by the way?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3326.459,3333.052,No secured claim after liquidation of the collateral through foreclosure.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.052,3333.503,"Yeah, yeah."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3333.503,3334.014,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3334.014,3335.594,But you'll still have a deficiency.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3335.594,3336.335,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.335,3340.119,"And that is still... except for the bankruptcy, he would still owe it."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3340.119,3341.017,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.017,3347.693,Well he still owe it to you if he abandons the property to you?
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3347.693,3349.165,Yes.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3353.546,3355.567,Wouldn't it be--
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3355.567,3357.32,--Let me answer that question this way.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3374.19,3383.045,--But I would have thought that your deficiency would be discharged in the... in the proceeding.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3383.045,3390.161,"It may be discharged, and that's a question that I don't think is before this Court today, but--"
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.161,3392.452,"Well, it may not be, but it's kind of an interesting question, isn't it?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3393.423,3394.863,--That... you're right.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.553,3410.314,1328.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3410.314,3413.988,Which has the certain exceptions to discharge for Chapter 13.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.262,3457.634,"Well say it was... it didn't exceed the length of time that... say it would... it didn't exceed that length of time, would it be discharged?"
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3457.634,3458.275,"--Yes, it would."
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.275,3458.854,Because why?
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3458.854,3463.098,Because it does not fall within the exception of section 1322.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3463.098,3463.469,"Well, I know."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3469.082,3471.103,We... my client would--
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3471.103,3474.645,--Your client... your client would have... would have scheduled it.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3474.645,3475.326,--Would have filed and mended.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3475.326,3476.637,Exactly.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3476.637,3479.17,Proof of claim for the deficiency after foreclosure.
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3479.17,3479.989,And that would be discharged.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3479.989,3483.642,If the last payment fell within the 3 or 5 year period--
1992.92-641,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.642,3484.803,Yeah.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3484.803,3485.534,--Of the Code... of the plan.
1992.92-641,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3485.534,3488.825,May I just be sure I understood one of your answers to Justice Scalia.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3500.952,3521.055,"When he comes into the bankruptcy proceeding before there's any claim determination or any action by the debtor, that creditor holds a security agreement or mortgage on property that is the debtor's that becomes property of the estate when the debtor files bankruptcy."
1992.92-641,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3529.744,3530.702,"All right, but then go to 506."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3533.454,3545.682,"--Under 506(a), I believe he's a secured creditor only where he falls within the protection of the 1322(b)(2)."
1992.92-641,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3562.903,3572.21,"Well, but it seems to me your argument is circular, because of... (b)(2) does not apply except to the holders of secured claims."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3578.684,3579.923,He--
1992.92-641,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3579.923,3589.3,--To read (b)(2) as applying to someone who has a... a holder who has some portion of his claim secured.
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3589.3,3590.171,--That--
1992.92-641,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3590.171,3598.859,"But in the situations... the cases supposed and put to you by Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia and earlier by me, that is not the case with the second mortgagee."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3598.859,3603.732,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is a plausible reading of the two statutes together."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3603.732,3609.555,"Mr. Schroeder, I'm sure it's in the interests of your clients to protect the second mortgage as well as the first mortgage."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3614.106,3615.548,"I understand that, Your Honor."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3615.548,3633.972,"I can read the word... as Justice Kennedy said, the word, the phrase 506(a)."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3633.972,3635.902,"Your Honor, that may be a plausible reading."
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3635.902,3640.025,"You would rather... you would want us to go further, but we really don't have to to agree with you on the first mortgage."
1992.92-641,1,36660,michael_j_schroeder,,3640.025,3640.894,That's correct.
1992.92-641,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3640.894,3641.705,Yes.
1992.92-641,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3641.705,3642.917,"Thank you, Mr. Schroeder."
