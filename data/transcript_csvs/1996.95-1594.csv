1996.95-1594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.599,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-1594, Barbara DeBuono v. NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,19.455,23.077,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.482,165.859,"Ms. Smith, do you agree with the outline offered by the Solicitor General as sort of a summary of this Court's holdings in this area?"
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,165.859,167.151,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.151,170.653,Would you adopt the same outline yourself without variation?
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,170.653,174.545,"Your Honor, the outline of this... what this Court has decided--"
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.545,177.957,"Well, they construct a kind of four-part simple test."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,177.957,178.208,--Yes.
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.208,179.009,Do you agree with that?
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,179.009,180.128,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.836,219.404,And do you agree that all general health laws that would affect clinic operations are validly applied to an ERISA health clinic?
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,219.404,219.985,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,219.985,227.17,"The standards of degrees required for people engaged in the health care business, and so forth?"
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,227.17,228.7,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.161,250.075,And I suppose there might be some disagreement by respondents on that issue.
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,250.075,272.719,"The respondents' argument is that at least in the health care area, but I think that their theory is equally applicable to those other four benefit areas that involve services... day care, prepaid legal services, and apprenticeship training... that when plans operate in those areas, the State may not regulate them."
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.26,302.398,"Well, do you think the same principles should govern whether a general tax law or a general State requirement for background training or cleanliness concerns or something of that kind--"
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,302.398,303.009,--In these--
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.009,306.491,--the same principles govern the answer to both questions?
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,306.491,323.313,"--In these service areas... in these service areas, yes, so a generally applicable health care tax, a generally applicable day care tax, or in these four service areas, whether, if you can regulate in those areas in a generally applicable way you can tax in those areas in a generally applicable way."
1996.95-1594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.313,332.138,"Ms. Smith, I don't understand what you think the effect of the very broad language, relates to, is."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,346.858,356.204,"Justice Scalia, the way that the Court has formulated preemption analysis to date, there are two prongs."
1996.95-1594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.834,410.922,"But that's normal field preemption, isn't it, that you cannot... you can neither reduce nor increase the protection that the Federal Government gives."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,413.763,425.25,"--My understanding of field preemption, Your Honor, is that a State law that specifically kept whatever was being regulated out of the field would not be preempted."
1996.95-1594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.25,427.38,I don't know what you mean.
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,430.743,431.184,Right.
1996.95-1594,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,459.742,478.585,"In any event, do I understand that... you said you agreed with the Government's outline as a summary of what this Court has held, that however you might wish Justice Scalia's concurring opinion in the Dillingham case to be speaking for the majority, the majority has not yet spoke that way."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,478.585,479.835,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,481.847,491.202,"But how would this case come out, do you think, under Justice Scalia's field preemption theory?"
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,491.202,502.981,"Your Honor, we are asking the Court basically, in making this distinction between services and plans, to carve out--"
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.981,509.494,"Well, I think the question I asked you was, how would the case come out if you were to apply normal field preemption principles to it?"
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,509.494,537.023,"--It would come out that this law does not relate to plans because the service area is outside the field of employee benefit plans, that while employee benefit plans are concerned with the funding and payment of benefits, that the services which those benefit payments may fund, the quantity of the services, the quality of the services, the availability of the services, are not an area with which ERISA is concerned with."
1996.95-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,537.023,545.097,"But does it work to distinguish that which is doing the providing, namely the plan, and that which the plan buys, like the services?"
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,581.361,584.894,"That distinction works very well, Your Honor."
1996.95-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,589.699,592.871,"No, no, but that just happens to be because they went and supplied it themselves."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,592.871,593.562,"Right, but--"
1996.95-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.562,595.483,That's just an artifact of the situation.
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,595.483,598.003,--But basically that is the distinction that we are asking the Court to draw.
1996.95-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,623.539,650.167,"I mean, you've really looked into this a lot, and so what I'm quite serious is... if there were some words in an opinion that said when you look into that area which, when you look into those things which the plan buys, as opposed to the management of a trust, when you look into that area, normally there is no preemption unless the State law conflicts with a purpose of Congress, and a rather specific purpose at that."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,651.9,653.991,"--No, Your Honor, not in our view."
1996.95-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,653.991,657.774,"Not in this case it wouldn't but I mean, in your experience in general would it cause trouble?"
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,657.774,682.44,"No, Your Honor, not in our view, because in general, again, we're dealing with a very limited area of ERISA benefits that actually involve something that the plan purchases as opposed to money that the plan is giving, and when ERISA plans are operating as ordinary commercial entities, they may well purchase services."
1996.95-1594,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,700.872,724.506,"But you don't want to draw a line... the difference between buying the service, because I think this is a case where the plan itself is providing it, so I think in your brief you try to look at the other side of it and say when you're talking about plan funding, plan administration, that's what ERISA covers."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,724.506,731.932,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but you could also look at this when an ERISA plan provides services in kind, they're simply purchasing them in a different way."
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,731.932,732.413,Yes--
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,732.413,738.958,"Instead of purchasing them from a third party, they are directly purchasing them from the doctors and--"
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,738.958,742.438,--But it would have a direct financial effect.
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,762.433,763.021,--Your Honor--
1996.95-1594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,763.021,775.1,"But if it were to provide the services itself, then the ERISA plan is certainly liable for the full tax, so it may end up costing ERISA less to contract out."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,775.1,786.068,"--Your Honor, in this case the incidence of the tax is not on the ERISA plan but on the hospital which, although it's not critical to my argument, is a separately incorporated corporation."
1996.95-1594,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,823.062,827.064,"But what I run into, you know, with my own thought there is, I run into a problem."
1996.95-1594,0,36605,m_patricia_smith,,865.001,875.888,"Your Honor, in those cases you're impacting upon what the fund is paying, what services, as opposed to the services themselves."
1996.95-1594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,907.847,909.7,"Very well, Ms. Smith."
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,911.551,931.483,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,992.403,993.164,Mr. Kneedler--
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,993.164,993.454,--Yes.
1996.95-1594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,993.454,1005.783,"--how do you think the so-called field preemption notice, the field preemption doctrine would play out in these ERISA cases--"
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1005.783,1006.373,I think--
1996.95-1594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1006.373,1007.983,--and how would that apply here?
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1007.983,1018.821,"--In this case, the field preemption analysis would certainly lead to sustaining the State tax, because the State tax operates, again, in the area of health care."
1996.95-1594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1029.788,1035.852,Do you think that principle would explain most or all of our previous cases?
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1035.852,1036.733,--It would explain most.
1996.95-1594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1047.348,1047.859,Which is what?
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1047.859,1058.195,--The portion of the Mackey case that held that an express exemption from State garnishment laws for ERISA plans was preempted.
1996.95-1594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.432,1112.894,"Mr. Kneedler, there... is it not fair to say that there is also some inconsistency in our expression of the rule we were applying in the earlier cases as compared with the expression that we've used in the last few?"
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1112.894,1114.186,Yes.
1996.95-1594,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1130.018,1131.928,What is the field preemption?
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1144.045,1144.486,Right.
1996.95-1594,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1144.486,1147.688,"Is that called conflict preemption, or field preemption?"
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1156.794,1157.434,Right.
1996.95-1594,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1158.165,1162.308,"--If that's right, then if you use the word field preemption, what will it do in general?"
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1164.098,1189.884,"--Well, for example, it's very important under ERISA because the Court has said on a number of occasions, and we agree with this, that ERISA preempts State laws in some circumstances even where ERISA itself does not furnish governing law, in particular in the design of ERISA plans themselves, what benefits to offer, who they would be paid for, paid to, what the amount of them will be."
1996.95-1594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.032,1216.311,"In a broad sense, Mr. Kneedler, I suppose any preemption involves a conflict."
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1216.311,1216.732,That's--
1996.95-1594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.732,1219.233,Any preemption is conflict preemption.
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1219.233,1226.689,"--In that sense, under this, and particularly when you have an express preemption clause, anything that conflicts with the express preemption clause."
1996.95-1594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.689,1236.156,"And I thought in our cases what conflict preemption meant was, where an inconsistent obligation is placed upon the regulated party."
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1240.979,1241.93,"Right, or--"
1996.95-1594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.93,1242.779,--that is a conflict.
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1242.779,1249.545,"--Right, or perhaps including the category where the State law would stand as an obstacle to the full accomplishment of the Federal purpose."
1996.95-1594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1249.545,1249.995,Yes.
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1249.995,1252.647,"Which affecting benefit structure would, we think--"
1996.95-1594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.647,1270.428,"Whereas I thought we've said field preemption would apply where the Federal law tells you to do X, and the State law says do X plus 10, which wouldn't... you're doing X, but you're doing more than X."
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1270.428,1270.668,--Right.
1996.95-1594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.668,1280.175,"But if the Government wanted this thing to be complete, and we're occupying the field, you're not supposed to address this area at all, X plus 10 would be preempted."
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1280.175,1301.859,"That's correct, and so the sorts of things that are occupied by the field, some of them are addressed by ERISA itself, but things having to do with the internal management of the plan... benefit structures, investment decisions, fiduciary responsibilities, things having to do with the way the administrator handles the plan... and with respect to those things, we think the things that the State can't regulate it ordinarily can't tax."
1996.95-1594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1336.081,1349.211,"Well, how would field preemption play out in the context of direct State regulations going to the educational background of employees in the clinic, and cleanliness requirements, and so forth?"
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1349.211,1363.3,"As to that, they would not be preempted because they do not address the internal affairs of an ERISA plan as such in its capacity as a plan with respect to funding, and financing, and what services will be paid for."
1996.95-1594,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1407.989,1409.93,What else besides sales tax?
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1413.713,1420.485,"We think it would have to pay, for example, unemployment compensation taxes that... for its employees."
1996.95-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1459.381,1460.934,"Well, what if the State--"
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1460.934,1461.144,--the State could regulate it.
1996.95-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1461.144,1466.627,--What if the State taxes numerous other corpuses that have nothing to do with ERISA plans as well?
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1466.627,1474.421,"That would... it's that point we think that may make that a closer question, and we would urge the Court not to decide that question in this case."
1996.95-1594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.421,1479.125,Would that be field preemption or conflict preemption?
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1487.86,1488.301,Right.
1996.95-1594,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1505.074,1516.721,"But that's just why... that's exactly why I'm nervous about the words, field preemption, because in trying to work out what the field is you have to make roughly the same analysis that you'd have to make on purpose."
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1523.257,1538.724,"I would, I think, refer to whether the State law is addressing the ERISA plan as an ERISA plan, in its capacity as an ERISA plan, not when it is purchasing goods and services outside of the plan's operations."
1996.95-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.724,1540.076,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1996.95-1594,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1540.076,1540.677,I think it's the former that's the field.
1996.95-1594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.677,1541.726,Thank you.
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1545.199,1548.382,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1617.31,1622.623,Why not the sales tax on items that the fund uses to operate?
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1622.623,1627.255,I think in that case the fund is actually acting not as a fund but as a purchaser.
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1647.958,1651.101,"But when the plan is operating a private hospital, why shouldn't it be treated like any other hospital?"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1651.101,1653.364,Because a plan does provide benefits.
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1663.77,1666.421,"What about other benefits that a plan might provide, like legal services?"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1668.992,1688.637,"--Well, if the plan is providing legal services and there's been a tax imposed on the contributions that the plan is providing to the attorneys who are providing the services, I would say yes, that that tax would be preempted, because that tax is being imposed on the very activities that make the plan a plan."
1996.95-1594,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1688.637,1694.701,"Well, what about the State requirement that anyone giving legal services has to be a licensed attorney?"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1702.295,1708.459,"Well, obviously that's not the case that we have here today, but we're not looking at it from a cost standpoint, Justice O'Connor."
1996.95-1594,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1737.908,1747.896,But my question related not to the tax but to this sure knowledge that the State law requirement that legal advice be given by licensed attorneys will cost more.
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1751.536,1776.013,"We would say, and the probabilities are in that situation, if you look at the structure and objectives and ERISA, that there probably was not an indication of congressional intent, as there was in the Travelers case, that Congress intended ERISA to preempt that type of regulation, and in this case we have explicit language in the statute that says State tax laws, they don't have a charmed existence."
1996.95-1594,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1777.876,1780.326,"Well, that refers to the Hawaii exception, doesn't it?"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1780.326,1782.477,"I'm sorry, Justice Souter."
1996.95-1594,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1782.477,1787.15,Doesn't that reference to State tax laws refer to the specific provisions for the Hawaiian plans?
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1787.15,1799.779,"I think it refers to the Hawaiian plan, but what it says is, it kind of mirrors the language of the preemption clause and says State tax laws that relate to plans shall not... shall be preempted, in essence."
1996.95-1594,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1847.06,1847.911,Mr. Caruso--
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1847.911,1849.732,--that they should be treated like any other law.
1996.95-1594,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1849.732,1851.294,--May I ask you a different question?
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1894.149,1897.703,"Of course, I disagree with your definition because I think the term otherwise was being used."
1996.95-1594,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1898.922,1905.708,"Okay, but if the definition were as I've suggested, then your argument would fail, I take it."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1905.708,1912.202,Then I take it you would be saying that the tax is being imposed not on the plan but on a hospital.
1996.95-1594,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1912.202,1914.273,"To put it crudely, to provide means to finance."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1923.028,1934.636,"I'm afraid I'm not... I don't feel that I can concede that point, because I think what Congress was saying is that they have structured a system of national tax exemption."
1996.95-1594,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1947.755,1976.754,"No, but on my theory, if we're going to treat pro... if we're going to treat the word provide as, in effect, synonymous with financing, then it would follow that the taxation here is not on the ERISA plan as the financing authority but, rather, on the ERISA plan wearing a different hat in operating a hospital, and if that's the way we analyze it, then I take it your argument would fail."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,1976.754,1997.057,"--I mean, that's one way to look at it, but the way I look at it, if Congress said that a State law that... a State tax law that relates to a plan is preempted, and the plan is the party that's paying that tax on the activities that make it a plan, then I would submit that if this type of law is not preempted, I don't know what other type of tax--"
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.057,2011.159,"So in other words, if they have a travel bureau, if they decide in the... the ERISA plan decides to set up its own travel agent to arrange for employee vacations, and there's a uniform tax in the State on travel agents, it doesn't have to pay."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2011.159,2016.21,--That... we would take the position that that doesn't involve the activities of the plan as a plan.
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.21,2030.52,"Well, why... so if they have to pay that if they set up a travel bureau to arrange for employee vacations, why do they have to... how do they get out of paying when they set up a hospital to provide the employee medical treatment?"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2033.591,2034.791,"Right, but it's not--"
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.791,2037.635,"--from others, but in this particular instance it provides it itself."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2037.635,2038.604,--But it isn't buying it here.
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.665,2042.427,It isn't buying it with the travel agent either.
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2043.797,2050.632,"--But when... a travel agency may have one point, but in the case of a clinic that we operate, this is not like a commercial clinic."
1996.95-1594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.568,2060.038,"Mr. Caruso, it says through insurance or otherwise."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2077.86,2080.851,"Well, we're getting into the other area where we get into the--"
1996.95-1594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.851,2082.443,It's exactly parallel.
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2095.141,2108.489,"--I would say no, because there's a... there's the deemer clause in ERISA itself which says that the State may not consider an ERISA plan an insurance company for purposes of insurance regulation, so this issue here where--"
1996.95-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.489,2109.16,"Well, but--"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2116.236,2121.529,--It's where your... there is insurance regulation that the State is trying to apply to the fund as an insurer.
1996.95-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.075,2132.496,Right--
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2132.496,2133.477,--you've got a different status--
1996.95-1594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.477,2134.819,--You wouldn't have to say that.
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2134.819,2136.128,--as opposed to going out and purchasing it.
1996.95-1594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.128,2150.517,"Why was the deemer clause put in the statute if, as you tell us, it is clear from the general preemption provision that if you're providing insurance directly you can't be regulated, just as if you're providing otherwise directly you can't be regulated?"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2160.605,2162.275,"Well, in the insurance area--"
1996.95-1594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.275,2163.076,"As an insurer, okay."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2163.076,2165.377,--In the insurance area they specifically say insurance regulation.
1996.95-1594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.377,2165.777,But what about the otherwise?
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2168.019,2168.269,Right.
1996.95-1594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.269,2172.082,"But it doesn't say in a deemer clause, shall not be deemed to be a hospital."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2172.082,2173.444,I understand that.
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2210.457,2227.447,"But you do agree that the plan-operated medical center would be subject to regulations, the State qualifications for physicians, for staff people--"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2227.447,2230.089,We're not suggesting otherwise.
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2245.41,2245.79,--But I don't--
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2245.79,2246.301,I can't see it.
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2246.301,2246.682,--I don't--
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2246.682,2247.312,I don't see it.
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2247.312,2250.984,"--You don't see which, that--"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2250.984,2260.259,I do not see that anything in ERISA would suggest that the State could not exercise its traditional police powers in regulating health care service.
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2270.447,2284.976,"--But if we take out your tax reference and say, we read that as discrete to this special Hawaii situation so please concentrate on the statute without that provision, then what is your distinction between the tax--"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2284.976,2291.051,"--I would hope you wouldn't do that, because I think if you looked in 1974, the executive branch actually went to Congress and said to Congress--"
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2291.051,2292.16,"--Well, I'm asking you to do that."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2300.076,2310.011,"--Well, I think there's a direct relationship when the fund is being asked to take some of its assets and provide those assets to the State, to the State's general coffers."
1996.95-1594,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2320.099,2332.848,"Well, it can't just be that it's getting money from the State, from... and putting it into the State's coffers, because you've already said unemployment compensation, sales tax, that's all okay, even though that comes out of the corpus."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2332.848,2333.187,--I agree with you.
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.905,2390.013,"The line, I think, that they want to draw, the Government, is to say, distinguish between, in the benefit area, that which does the buying, namely the plan, and that which is bought, namely, the benefits, and in the case where you're talking about the latter, by and large you can impose uniform taxes, and if it turns out that in a particular instance the former, namely that which does the buying, itself decides to provide that which is normally bought, it's treated as if it bought it."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2405.067,2405.354,"--Well, if you took that approach, then that's what saying, that--"
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2405.354,2405.875,--Yes.
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2405.875,2409.518,--if ERISA... an ERISA plan cannot be defined as the direct provider.
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.713,2423.576,"Well, they don't always... they don't necessarily... the ERISA plan I take it in many instances buys hospital care from others."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2424.447,2425.329,It does that on occasion.
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2425.329,2425.789,"--Yes, well--"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2425.789,2428.051,In that situation then it would be treated like other buyers.
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2428.051,2448.845,"--So why... but if you take your position, then what you do is, you simply get the ERISA plans themselves, through a real tax advantage, to start going into the businesses of providing those things which normally would be bought from others, and they'd get a tax break."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2451.947,2460.472,"Because Congress has done it that way, and I think you'll find that if you look at the Metropolitan Life case, that the same type of special status was given to self-insured plans."
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2460.472,2473.089,"So your actual answer, if you happen to have an ERISA plan that bought paid vacations for its employees, and they decide to go into the travel business limited to employees, the answer then to the question is, they're tax exempt, right, in your view?"
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2473.089,2473.519,Correct.
1996.95-1594,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.519,2473.96,"Yes, okay."
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2473.96,2474.381,Correct.
1996.95-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2474.381,2482.385,But am I correct in understanding you do... you would not make the same argument about regulations such as the requirement of a second opinion of a physician?
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2482.385,2483.045,That's correct.
1996.95-1594,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.045,2483.767,You draw the--
1996.95-1594,2,20716,donato_caruso,,2483.767,2484.758,That is correct.
1996.95-1594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.669,2490.84,"--Thank you, Mr. Caruso."
