1979.78-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,81.77,We will hear arguments next in Martinez against California.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,85.599,87.239,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.97,174.641,"Well, you don't claim that the defendants here, or the respondents, should be treated as if they were the parents or owners of the criminal actor, do you?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,174.641,175.157,"I do, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,188.902,191.262,"It was quite a different setting, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,191.262,193.481,But it was a good quote for the purposes of argument.
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.118,220.827,The restatement isn't talking about public officials.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,220.827,224.059,It doesn't delineate between categories of people.
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.882,257.236,"Well, what if a judge, faced with these same facts, had decided to grant probation rather than sentence and confine, and the next--10 days later the person commits another rape?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,260.146,264.503,"I would say so, but I would follow the law in Stump v. Sparkman and say he cannot be liable."
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,269.516,271.516,How--why is there that much difference between them?
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,271.516,278.765,"Because the procedural safeguards set down by this Court in the Butz case says, we look to see what due process is available."
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.372,301.847,"Well, the--nobody had any right to appeal when a judge sentences someone, says, ""I'll give you probation instead of putting you in jail for 10 years."""
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,305.649,315.269,"But the public policy set down by the Court in Stump v. Sparkman and Imbler, and no further yet, is that the judiciary must be kept separate."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,328.119,339.191,"Aren't we talking--doesn't my brother Rehnquist suggest--his present question suggest, at least, that we're talking about two different things, or both--two separate things, and intermingling them?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,362.448,365.17,"It's a difficult area for us, Your Honor, but I agree with that."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,365.17,368.745,But I think it'll be less difficult if we keep the two questions separate.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,368.745,369.218,All right.
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.757,390.02,"I thought Scheuer v. Rhodes involved only the immunity of the defendant, didn't it?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,390.02,394.797,"But, Your Honor, that's where I have trouble, is to determine whether the defendant is acting in good faith."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.797,407.93,"Well, first of all, let's--if there was no question of this defendant being immune from suit, the question would still remain - Have you stated a cause of action under 1983?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,407.93,409.406,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,409.406,420.967,"And conversely, if there were no question but what you had stated a cause of action under 1983, the question still remains - Is this particular defendant immune from suit, or immune from liability under 1983?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,427.599,428.918,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,434.629,438.282,"Well, that's a question which your brother greatly argues."
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,438.282,438.302,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,438.302,442.483,"Mr. McGrath, it's a deprivation of life without due process of law, isn't that the--"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,442.483,443.375,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.375,449.974,What is the failure to follow due process that the defendant is guilty of?
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,449.974,462.658,"The defendant knew, or should have known, as the Court said in Wood v. Strickland, that the medical people, the psychiatric people, in California said Thomas was hopelessly incurable."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.862,481.392,Wasn't there some evidence or some practice of letting people out at a certain stage of their incarceration that would support the decision to--wasn't it arguable as to whether or not he should have been let out?
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,481.392,487.58,"No, I don't--I think that it was arguable that a lot of prisoners got out early because of an overcrowding situation."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,492.979,499.57,"But doesn't that go to the merits of decision as to whether to grant him parole, rather than the procedure followed by the Parole Board?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,503.225,503.544,I'm challenging--
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.544,505.427,When you say there was no due process of law?
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,505.427,506.898,"Yes, Your Honor, I am challenging the procedure."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.898,509.143,Then what was the error in procedure that you allege?
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,509.143,513.159,"They ignored his known dangerous propensities, and the fact that he had not been cured."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.159,515.732,That's not procedure.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,515.732,519.376,"Well, the steps--I suppose you can--it's mixed procedure and substance."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.376,521.405,They made an incorrect decision.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,523.934,529.436,They ignored their own procedures in that they should check to see that a person was safe to let into the community.
1979.78-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,532.436,535.636,"Well, safety is a conclusion, isn't it?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,535.636,536.166,The problem was--
1979.78-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,536.166,543.777,"Whether he's safe or not is a conclusion which the trier of fact must reach, isn't that so?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,543.777,545.797,"Yes, sir and I'd like to get to the trier of facts."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.519,559.996,"Mr. McGrath, doesn't the case come to us on the assumption that there was a violation of constitutional rights?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,559.996,561.02,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.02,564.648,The basis for the decision below was immunity.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,577.712,582.608,"I believe that's the basis, and I think that's what Justice Stewart was trying to tell me to confine me to."
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.608,591.08,"On the other hand, your opponent urged that the judgment below be upheld on the grounds that there was no violation of constitutional law."
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,591.08,596.427,"Well, that's why I said that I thought Justice Stewart put me in a position where I had to answer both questions."
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,621.69,634.642,"But your Scheuer argument seems to me to lack a good deal in analogy, because there the National Guard troops were at least arguably the agents of Governor Rhodes."
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,641.891,649.702,"No, but the patrolling officer was the agent of the higher authority of the State, just as was Governor Rhodes."
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,650.538,669.693,"Yes, but don't you have a break in causation of some sort when you got to a private individual who is--by hindsight, obviously, mistakenly released, but who is not a state employee, who is detained against his will by the State for a period of time and then finally released?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,669.693,672.132,"No, sir, no more than the National Guardsmen."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.773,679.987,You didn't join the parole officer as a defendant?
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,679.987,684.05,"The--after the fact, the supervisory officer?"
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,685.141,685.823,Yes.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,685.823,692.511,"We have numerous Does but--and we suspect a lack of supervision of this individual, and we've generally pled it."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,698.01,705.586,"Well, are you pinning the case not on release but on lack of supervision?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,705.586,708.788,"I think we're pinning--primarily the answer is yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,731.575,734.513,"In California, whose responsible for that, the judges?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,738.975,751.829,"No, the Parole Department, an executive branch, supervises the parole or probation officers, It's an executive function, not judicial."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,841.675,851.782,"In the Rhodes case, Scheuer v. Rhodes, did Ohio law purport to grant absolute immunity to the defendant?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,851.782,853.574,As I recall it did not.
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,856.429,858.115,"It wasn't as clear-cut as California law is in this case then, was it?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,858.115,860.103,"No, sir, it was not."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.869,876.466,"But was there reliance on state law, as there is in this case?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,876.466,890.488,"Yes, there was as to the executive function, and the emergency of the Governor needing to call out the National Guard, the lack of foreseeability - calling out National Guard, would that kill students at Kent State?"
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,892.546,895.88,"Well, then it's a matter of the merits again, not of immunity, isn't it?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,895.88,897.675,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.01,1004.303,"Mr. McGrath, just so I can be sure I have your case, you're--we're only concerned with the fifth cause of action in your complaint, is that not correct?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1004.303,1007.918,"Yes, Your Honor, and its incorporation of the other causes of action."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.918,1009.288,The other allegations.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1017.225,1018.347,"Yes, it is."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.347,1022.01,Because they just end up by saying there's no liability to plead under the Civil Rights Act.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1027.426,1028.512,I didn't feel they said that.
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.963,1042.367,"But they don't cite the statute in their rejection of that--the fifth claim, in that portion of their opinion."
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1042.367,1048.498,"It may not be in that particular portion, but I found them discussing 1983 fairly carefully at one point."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.498,1050.718,In Federal cases on immunity.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1050.718,1051.94,Yes.
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.94,1053.609,Fitzgerald v. Procunier.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1053.609,1055.999,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.999,1062.591,"But I--the question I'm asking you is, I don't really think it's fair to say they relied on the California statute in disposing of that claim."
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1065.292,1067.717,I can't say I agree or disagree.
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.968,1069.347,Yes.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1069.347,1074.733,"But when you lose at that level, you don't think they even saw the 1983."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1125.678,1148.511,"The cases in which--in this Court on which you rely involve, as the previous questions of my brother Rehnquist imply, a situation where--which would be analogous here--if a member of the Parole Board had raped and murdered little Miss Mary Ellen Martinez; you see what I mean?"
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1151.447,1151.852,"No, sir."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1153.352,1162.888,"In other words, the National Guard in Scheuer v. Rhodes were the ones who actually did the shooting and injury to the plaintiff, injuries and deaths of the plaintiffs."
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1162.888,1163.365,At the Governor's--
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.365,1165.397,Here--here it was a third person.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1172.06,1174.817,"No, sir, the Governor sent the National Guard out."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1174.817,1174.968,Yes.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1174.968,1177.278,The Parole Board sent Thomas out.
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1178.62,1184.672,"But not direct--the Parole Board didn't send Thomas out to represent the Parole Board, or to act for it."
1979.78-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1187.531,1188.311,Yes.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1188.311,1192.472,"But should they have, with knowledge of the facts?"
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.472,1196.984,That's quite a different inquiry.
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1196.984,1199.186,"Excuse me, Your Honor, did you have any--?"
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1267.08,1270.908,"Well, judge are above the law, according to Stump v. Sparkman."
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1270.908,1273.938,I think what the Court says is that the judges are the law.
1979.78-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.842,1290.722,"Well, but judges may make just as botched up decisions as parole officers."
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1290.722,1296.687,But they don't have--the parole officers don't have the inherence conflicts that do judges.
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.235,1383.894,"Mr. McGrath, I just have to question you once more about this notion of being above the law."
1979.78-1268,0,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,1399.41,1399.944,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.944,1409.171,Yes.
1979.78-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1409.171,1414.147,Mr. Miller.
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,1414.147,1418.926,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1640.596,1647.973,"Before you proceed, General Miller, may I simply ask, was the Grimm case a 1983 case?"
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,1647.973,1649.455,"No, Your Honor, it was not a 1983 case."
1979.78-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1649.455,1655.539,So that was just a matter of the State tort laws saying we're not going to give absolute immunity to this defendant?
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,1655.539,1657.43,"That's true, Your Honor, it was--"
1979.78-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1657.43,1657.782,In a State court action.
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,1660.932,1662.384,"You're correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1671.261,1674.695,"Yes, I understand your feeling that it was necessary to mention it."
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,1680.725,1689.6,"Yes, you're correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1865.28,1866.722,"General Miller, let me go back to Semler."
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,1876.939,1886.286,"First, Mr. Justice Blackmun, we can't see how the principle of Semler is at all relevant to this kind of an inquiry."
1979.78-1268,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1886.286,1899.131,"Well, as I read the Court of Appeals' decision, they didn't stop at the break that Semler would represent, to wit, the ministerial act as distinguished from the other."
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,1899.131,1916.835,"My understanding of the opinion was that the official in question was not exercising any discretionary or quasi-judicial function in that case, but was merely engaging in a ministerial kind of activity and--"
1979.78-1268,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1916.835,1922.385,And therefore I ask you whether the Semler decision is at all embarrassing to your decision; and I take it your answer is no?
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,1922.385,1923.377,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.377,1941.751,"Isn't it also true with respect to Semler that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit looked to Virginia law, and if one were to perform the analogous function here of looking to California law, clearly California law says there should be no liability."
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,1941.751,1942.891,"That's true, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.103,2118.344,Can I interrupt you with a question?
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2141.041,2145.175,"Yes, Your Honor, we would still argue in that kind of a case, there would."
1979.78-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.636,2152.49,Do you concede there is a cause of action under 1983 in this case?
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2152.49,2155.075,"No, Your Honor, we don't."
1979.78-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2158.57,2165.954,"It's your view is, that if there's a cause of action, no matter how extreme and no matter what it covers, there is total immunity?"
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2165.954,2171.311,"Yes, in the example--in the hypothetical you posed, Mr. Justice Stevens, that would be our position."
1979.78-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2177.05,2182.665,There's total immunity of the parole board with respect to their decision to release somebody.
1979.78-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2191.887,2193.286,Or commits any other crime?
1979.78-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2193.286,2193.97,Yes.
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2193.97,2195.117,That's correct.
1979.78-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2195.117,2201.656,"Well, then your answer to Mr. Justice Stevens was perhaps--was a little too hasty."
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2213.961,2214.896,I would agree with that.
1979.78-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2214.896,2229.265,"Well, then if he hires--if he induces the parolee to kill someone on the basis that he will be released for the purpose, that's not within the scope of his official function, is it?"
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2229.265,2229.582,It's--
1979.78-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2229.582,2230.246,You really think--
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2230.246,2234.472,It's arguably within the--he is exercising a power.
1979.78-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2269.904,2273.56,Would he not be subject to liability though under California criminal law?
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2273.56,2274.27,Exactly.
1979.78-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.035,2298.287,"But General Miller, would he be--wouldn't he be immune under the California statutes if the decision was made--if it was injury resulting from determining whether to parole or release a prisoner?"
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2301.701,2305.414,"Your question, Mr. Justice Stevens, is whether or not--"
1979.78-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.414,2307.504,I will vote--I have the authority to release you.
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2320.411,2336.804,"I think the motivation or the intention behind an actual release in any particular case is irrelevant; and certainly, if this case had been brought solely under California common law we would have urged, as we did in this case, the application of the immunity under 845 point--"
1979.78-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.804,2350.554,"But I suppose you could say there are two grounds that--for liability, one is the release, which you say there is absolute immunity for; but you wouldn't claim any immunity for conspiring with somebody else to kill somebody?"
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2350.554,2351.532,"No, I would not, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.532,2359.109,"If you--if the parole officer went around to a prisoner and said, ""Why don't you escape and I'll pay you and you kill this fellow?"""
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2369.928,2385.864,"In that kind of a hypothetical, I don't think he would, Mr. Justice White; where the individual was actually out on parole, and they entered into a private agreement for the purpose of taking the life of a member of society, I don't think that there would be any immunity, under 1983."
1979.78-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.864,2388.621,"Well, you couldn't state a cause of action."
1979.78-1268,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2388.621,2396.46,"General Miller, the complaint also alleges, I think in the fourth cause of action, a breach of the duty to supervise."
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2398.792,2403.446,"I will address it now, Mr. Justice Powell."
1979.78-1268,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2468.663,2476.685,"In California, does the Board have, as a matter of fact, responsibility to supervise the conduct of parolees?"
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2476.685,2478.042,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1979.78-1268,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2478.042,2479.115,Who does that?
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2479.115,2483.544,"Individual parole agents, parole officers do that."
1979.78-1268,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2495.298,2498.922,Are any of those correctional officials parties defendant to this suit?
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2498.922,2500.761,"No, they are not, Mr. Justice Powell."
1979.78-1268,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2500.761,2509.259,And you're telling us that the parole board members themselves have no responsibility whatever for the supervision of parolees?
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2509.259,2514.261,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2514.261,2518.14,Let me understand your answer to Mr. Justice Powell on the fourth cause of action.
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2524.318,2534.787,"The statute does not make any express reference to the supervision of parolees once they've been released, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.78-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2567.279,2568.113,"Yes, on the revocation."
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2594.441,2597.172,"No, Mr. Justice Stevens, I would not argue that."
1979.78-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.367,2609.055,It would only go to the--basically to his authority to decide whether or not the man belonged on parole?
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2609.055,2610.504,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2610.504,2634.321,"If indeed the parole board members are liable, for a bad decision to release, an erroneous decision to release, would it follow that they would also have some liability for a wrong decision not to release?"
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2634.321,2634.735,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2634.735,2641.534,"A deprivation of liberty claimed by the prisoner who said, ""I should have been released two years ago."""
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2641.534,2651.65,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that would certainly be a logical result; and that would even create a greater burden on this vital aspect of our rehabilitation process."
1979.78-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2840.763,2858.1,"Under California law, I assume that the victim here had a tort cause of action against the actor, whether or not he was judgment-proof I suppose might be a question; but there's no question of immunity on the part of the person who actually raped her?"
1979.78-1268,1,32052,jeffery_t_miller,,2858.1,2860.143,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that's absolutely correct."
1979.78-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3187.357,3189.593,"Your time has expired, counsel."
1979.78-1268,2,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,3192.756,3194.463,"Briefly, Your Honor."
1979.78-1268,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3208.129,3209.619,What would you do about a jury?
1979.78-1268,2,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,3220.639,3222.76,Procedural due process would have--
1979.78-1268,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3222.76,3223.861,Would you hold the jury liable?
1979.78-1268,2,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,3223.861,3224.828,"No, I would not."
1979.78-1268,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3224.828,3225.793,For a bad decision?
1979.78-1268,2,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,3225.793,3227.555,"No, sir, I would not."
1979.78-1268,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3266.463,3273.122,"Well, you can go to the California legislature tomorrow and get them to pass a law that gives damages in your situation, can't you?"
1979.78-1268,2,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,3273.122,3280.388,"But 1871, we had Section 1983, and damages tend to discourage this type of behavior, so says the Court."
1979.78-1268,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3280.388,3289.143,"Yes, but you're talking about general policy terms about why we, the public, shouldn't have to endure this."
1979.78-1268,2,21259,donald_mcgrath_ii,,3292.814,3294.475,"Well, I'm sure they could, but they haven't."
1979.78-1268,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3330.909,3335.791,"Thank you, gentlemen."
