1968.453,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,26.696,"Number 453, Gregg against United States."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,29.175,32.133,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,156.864,163.229,"But, Mr. Richards, matter of fact, there's nothing in this record to show that a judge saw it while the jury was out, is there?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,163.229,168.632,The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals had a set of facts presented in the record to them.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,180.487,192.16,"Well, I'm familiar with that statement, but where in any record is there anything showing that he saw it while the jury was out?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,192.16,195.175,The jury returned its verdict.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,215.616,219.586,"Well, did the judge say that “I read this while the jury was out”?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,219.586,220.431,"No, the judge--"
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,220.431,223.548,Did anybody see and read it while the judge was out?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,223.548,224.741,Did anyone?
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,224.741,225.218,"Yes, sir."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,225.218,226.905,There is no record on this.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,226.905,236.139,"Well, where does the Court of Appeals get the fact, and I emphasize “fact,” that the judge read it while the jury was out?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,236.139,238.133,Because when the--
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,238.133,240.418,"No, where is the fact?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,240.418,242.067,The fact would be the time element.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,243.342,244.8,"That's not a fact, is it?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,246.355,249.316,"A conclusion, but when the--"
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,249.316,252.97,But there is nothing in the record to show that he read it before.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,252.97,263.814,"Well, the question here is not whether he had read it or whether he had seen it, but whether the judge was in receipt of the presentence investigation."
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,264.064,268.323,Did he-- When did he receive it?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,268.323,277.909,It would be our conclusion that he'd have to receive it and be in receipt of the presentence investigation before the jury returned its verdict.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,353.611,356.723,"Well, that's what the rule says."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,364.788,365.549,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.549,377.091,"I gather your argument is that, in this instance, it was clear since the judge said he had it, that, somehow, it had been submitted to him before the jury returned its verdict."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,377.091,377.478,That's right.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,378.895,383.829,"Or, if the rule means what it says, then obviously, the Court below was wrong, wasn't it?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,383.829,384.386,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,459.788,466.178,"Well, there, I suppose that the dangerous part of the prejudice issue is the power-accepting rule."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,466.178,467.109,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,481.173,484.145,I suppose we view it as it was.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,487.219,487.726,Yes.
1968.453,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,487.726,488.991,What was it?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,488.991,513.72,"Well, our feeling that why a -- it should not be submitted to the Court would be possible prejudice to the defendant and I also, along with this, I argue that the rule also states that a presentence investigation should not be bait before a conviction or a plea of guilty unless there's intelligent consent."
1968.453,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,531.901,534.313,"Well, that's not really before us."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,538.11,539.882,Yes.
1968.453,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,539.882,553.24,"That question of whether the presentence investigation may be made without petitioner's consent and before a guilty plea or a finding of guilt is not really presented by this case, is it?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,553.24,554.269,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,565.329,572.228,Is there really anything for us to decide beyond whether the rule is going to be enforced as written?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,572.228,573.446,Yes.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,573.446,579.622,"If it's a prophylactic rule, whether or not there's prejudice, I would suppose, is unimportant."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,584.532,585.341,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,585.341,585.553,Alright.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,585.553,592.978,The prejudice that we're speaking of here is not prejudice to the defendant's substantial or substantive rights.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,592.978,595.643,I don't even see why you talk about prejudice.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,595.643,596.428,"Well, the--"
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,596.428,601.522,"If your position is that the rule should be enforced is written, why isn't that the end of your case?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,601.522,614.183,"Because -- we have mentioned it in our case because the Solicitor General's brief, in response to our brief, has made-- as trying to make a question of this, is why I am mentioning it before the Court now."
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,622.124,624.964,"Mr. Richards, what do you want us to do, give him a new trial?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,624.964,625.873,Yes.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,625.873,626.749,A new trial?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,626.749,628.995,Yes.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,628.995,632.567,"Well, how did this affect the jury's verdict?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,632.567,633.583,I feel that --
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,633.583,635.308,How?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,639.298,639.37,They did not.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,639.37,640.686,The presentence report?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,640.686,641.997,"They did not, but --"
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,641.997,645.306,"Well, how did this affect the jury's verdict?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,645.306,651.87,Because it could have affected the Trial Court's handling of the trial.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,655.034,661.549,"Well, are you arguing to us that the judge had it before the trial?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,661.549,661.681,I'm arguing that --
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,661.681,665.534,"And, if you say “yes,” I'm asking you, where do you get it from?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,665.534,668.376,I do not know when the judge had it before the trial.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,668.376,668.438,"Well, how do you --"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,668.438,673.151,"The judge admitted, after the verdict was returned, that he had it in his possession and he'd already read it."
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.641,677.593,"Because the judge, according to you, violated the rule."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,677.593,678.232,Yes.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,678.232,681.493,The man is entitled to a whole brand new trial.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,681.493,682.647,"Yes, as --"
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,682.647,685.121,"Well, he can still be tried on the same indictment, I hope."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,685.121,686.177,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,686.177,687.093,Thank you.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,687.093,693.357,"The rules, if they are advisory, then the defendant Gregg have no standing."
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.952,730.152,"Well, wasn't it physically possible for the judge to have read the -- to have seen and read the report after the jury came in and return its verdict?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,730.152,732.685,We are contending no.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.722,733.608,Why?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,733.608,737.441,The presentence investigation is generally a lengthy document.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.363,739.531,How long?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,739.531,746.375,I have not seen the presentence investigation and that there has not been a Court order to let counsel read these presentence investigation.
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,746.375,748.977,Why do you say you couldn't have read it?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,748.977,749.896,Because the jury --
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,749.896,753.548,It might have been a page actually.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,753.548,770.071,"Well, this is very possible but the jury, with the petitioner in the room, the trial judge in the room, the jury walked back into the courthouse -- courtroom and then it returned its verdict at this time."
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,796.763,799.195,He read it before his eyes.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,799.195,802.943,"Yes, it was there on the bench at this time."
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.943,804.948,Was the jury told?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,804.948,806.814,Yes.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.681,811.591,That the judge could've read it during that time?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,811.591,812.22,Your Honor?
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.22,814.723,That the judge could've read the report during that time?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,814.723,818.653,"The jury, during this -- the judge, at this time, was polling the jury."
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.653,819.775,Yes.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,819.775,829.082,"And, when the jury was polled, then there was a comment concerning when that they were to return to further jury duty and, without pause --"
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.082,832.885,Did the judge call the jury in this case or the clerk?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,832.885,835.987,"The clerk -- the judge, I believe, asked counsel if --"
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.987,836.315,"Well, no."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,841.216,841.503,Yes.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.503,845.595,"If that's your verdict,” which I should suppose means that the judge himself polled the jury."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,845.595,846.543,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,978.474,984.013,"I gather, resentence, in this case, is meaningless because it's a mandatory sentence, isn't it?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,984.013,984.582,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,984.582,985.656,25 years?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,985.656,987.391,"Yes, but in the case --"
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,987.391,988.487,"Well, I mean, in your -- in this case."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,988.487,989.633,Yes.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,989.633,998.541,"I gather you -- one of your arguments, that it's not enough just to send it back for resentences that the judge is powerless to give him anything less then."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,998.541,998.576,Yes.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,998.576,1000.067,"Only five years, is that right?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1000.067,1000.786,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1003.918,1007.299,I thought we could put him on probation?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1007.299,1015.734,"He has an alternative decision, probation or a mandatory 25-year sentence with no possibility of parole."
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.734,1022.032,"Well, if that -- then it could be a resentence procedure, is that it, here?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1022.032,1023.116,No.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.116,1024.252,Why?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1024.252,1025.954,"It could be, but the effect was just now."
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.954,1029.557,What he got was 25 -- he got mandatory 25 years.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1029.557,1030.315,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.315,1037.183,"But, on resentence, it might be that he get probation out of that."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1037.183,1046.825,The district judge has read the presentence investigation with -- had a presentence investigation was made without even an interview made of the defendant.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.825,1062.631,"But, is it your argument that the purpose of the -- of this rule is to except the tryer or the judge, presiding judge with the jury from becoming prejudice against the defendant by reading the presentence report."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1062.631,1068.362,We're speaking -- the petitioner is speaking of prejudice to the federal rules.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1069.32,1072.774,Is this sort of an error to the principle?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1072.774,1077.441,"That's correct, procedural irregularities, either they're advisory or they're mandatory."
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.441,1086.832,When you say that we not only -- that it isn't because of possible prejudice against the defendant during the trial that you wanted to try.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1086.832,1087.531,No.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.531,1087.633,It's just --
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1087.633,1088.739,Based -- That's correct.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.739,1095.334,"Just because -- as a deterrent, as a remedy, as a remedial matter, you ought to order a new trial --"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1095.334,1095.591,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.591,1097.578,Just to make judges obey the rules.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1097.578,1098.475,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.245,1111.131,And you don't suggest there was any prejudice in any respect of this.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1111.131,1111.54,Yes.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.087,1117.028,"I mean, prejudice to the defendant -- in any concrete way --"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1117.028,1117.062,Yes.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.062,1118.687,Of having the report.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1118.687,1119.83,"Yes, I feel that --"
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.83,1120.247,What is it?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1120.247,1122.373,I have not looked at the report.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.373,1126.094,"I know, but what would you say the prejudice is?"
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1126.094,1128.128,You don't have a right to look at it.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1128.128,1129.902,I understand that there is not -- there has been a report.
1968.453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1129.902,1131.839,"Well, you're not raising that point, too, are you?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1131.839,1132.615,No.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.668,1144.538,Would you say there is a likelihood of prejudice in this case on these facts?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1144.538,1146.085,I feel that there is prejudice.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.001,1149.412,What is it?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1149.412,1172.52,"Well, the prejudice would be, from the record, such as the Court's not letting the defendant have an instruction on lesser included defense, the undue haste, in which this trial was given or was directed through, not allowing --"
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.52,1174.939,Was there a competency hearing in this case?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1174.939,1175.857,No.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.913,1188.187,"And, what did that have in it?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1188.187,1189.163,What did that have in it?
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.163,1189.562,Yes.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1189.562,1194.945,It had the defendant's -- part of the defendant's past criminal background.
1968.453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1200.369,1203.231,Do you suppose they had as much in it as the presentence report did?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1203.231,1225.037,"It could have, but I presume that the pre-mental examination report would be only used for the purpose of determining whether the petitioner was competent to stand trial, not to be used to determine whether the petitioner should be given probation or should be given a 25-year mandatory sentence."
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1225.037,1237.251,"Well, I must say, from what the Court revealed of what the presentence investigation report contained at page 7, it must've been a lengthy report."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1237.251,1238.606,"Yes, it was."
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1238.606,1240.875,"He certainly had quite a record, didn't he?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1240.875,1241.053,Yes.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1241.053,1256.957,"Juvenile record, 1960, an automobile -- stolen automobile, parole in 1965, parole in 1962, parole violator in 1965, convicted of armed robbery in Arizona, 7-10 years, several warrants now against him charging robbery."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1256.957,1257.287,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1257.287,1258.742,That's in the long report.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1260.758,1262.804,"That was in the competency report, yes."
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1302.516,1321.133,"Suppose, in this case, it was shown that the pretrial investigations and mental capacity showed every fact from the beginning to the end, in every word, in the same length that was shown in the presentence report."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1324.652,1327.894,I do not know what was at the presentence investigation.
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1327.894,1332.132,"I know you don't, but you were saying it should be automatically reversed."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1340.352,1346.697,"Yes, because our appeal is based upon prejudice not to the defendant, but prejudice to the federal rule of criminal procedures."
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1346.697,1349.682,Maybe the rules don't have a right to appeal.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1349.682,1351.896,"But, defendants do and the only way that --"
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1351.896,1356.215,"I know, but you say prejudice to the federal rules."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1356.215,1356.834,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1356.834,1360.13,"Prejudice done to the federal rules, that's the appeal."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1360.13,1360.657,That's the appeal.
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1360.657,1362.851,I thought it was the appeal of the defendant.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1362.851,1371.4,"That's correct, but the defendant has asked in this Court for a strict enforcement of the federal rules of criminal procedures."
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1371.4,1373.644,Even though it didn't have it?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1373.644,1374.89,"We, it is --"
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1374.89,1377.633,"If you assume it didn't hear him, you say he's entitled to it?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1377.633,1378.11,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1378.988,1382.431,To vindicate the rules.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1382.431,1385.8,Your Honor?
1968.453,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1400.343,1413.17,"Well, the purpose of the rule is to prevent what the Rules Committee, and presumably Congress, thought was prejudice, possible prejudice, to defendants."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1413.17,1413.815,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1413.815,1432.128,"If all of the stuff that's in these presentence investigatory report, hearsay, gossip, or whatever is in there were scrutinized by the judge in the course of the trial, isn't that the purpose of the rule?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1432.128,1433.017,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1433.017,1461.391,"And, when you say you're not claiming prejudice to the defendant you mean you're not relying on him, but fact of the rule, the purpose of the rule is not just to say something for fun but it's to safeguard, protect, against what the draftsmen of the rule consider the potential source of unfairness and danger to defendants."
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1461.391,1462.878,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1968.453,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1498.045,1534.521,"This is in a -- if the contrary practice were permitted, it would be like tolerating ex parte statements to the judge about the character of the defendant in his associates and whatnot, ex parte statements with no evidentiary restrictions and with no opportunity for counsel for the defendant to know what's being said to the judge with no rules against hearsay, gossip, or whatnot, isn't that right?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1534.521,1535.309,That is correct.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1589.931,1595.632,"Mr. Gordon -- Mr. Richards, when did this rule take its present form?"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1595.632,1599.392,I do not know the -- July of 1966.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1599.392,1602.137,"These criminal rules were recently revised, you think--"
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1602.137,1602.674,That's correct.
1968.453,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1602.981,1603.73,1966?
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1603.73,1608.079,I believe so.
1968.453,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1610.245,1610.952,You may.
1968.453,0,21446,dean_e_richards,,1610.952,1611.828,Thank you.
1968.453,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1611.828,1614.034,Mr. Glazer.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1614.034,1618.643,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1675.64,1680.219,"Excuse me, Mr. Glazer, may I ask you the question I asked Mr. Richards."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1683.361,1684.846,"1948, this is --"
1968.453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.846,1685.694,19 --
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1685.694,1688.878,1948 and the rules were recently amended in 1966.
1968.453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.878,1697.618,"Well, I'm thinking strictly the sentence “the report shall not be submitted to the Court or its contents disclosed unless defendant has pleaded guilty or has been found guilty.”"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1699.323,1699.512,It's been --
1968.453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.512,1700.099,In that form?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1700.099,1702.233,It's been that way since 1948.
1968.453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.233,1702.55,I see.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1706.023,1734.233,"Petitioner has pointed out that the record shows that, immediately following the verdict, the jury was polled, defendant was called for resentencing, and the Court advised him of the mandatory 25-year sentence which a statute imposes for the robbery of a postal station when lies in jeo -- when lies are placed in jeopardy by a dangerous weapon."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1774.047,1775.834,"Now, how long did all of that take?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1776.81,1780.393,"The record doesn't reflect how long that took, Your Honor."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1780.393,1788.282,"Well, I understood from something in the brief said it was a time between 3:30 and 3:36."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1788.282,1790.476,"Well, that may be -- that's right, excuse me."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1790.476,1791.921,"Now, that's six minutes."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1791.921,1791.944,Six --
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1791.944,1799.707,For all of these to happen and for the judge to review the presentence report and so forth.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1799.707,1811.301,"In the circumstances of this case, considering the options that the judge had, the judge could've scanned the probation report during the time of sentencing."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1811.301,1818.879,You are certain that the guard -- the judge could have looked at this probation report during that time?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1818.879,1819.768,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1819.927,1823.827,"Well, may I ask you one question before you get so certain."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1825.833,1829.974,The probation report has been lodged with the Clerk's Office.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1840.866,1842.004,How long is the report?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1842.004,1844.13,The report is four pages long.
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1844.13,1847.411,Four pages long and the whole thing took six minutes.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1847.411,1848.619,Right.
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.619,1851.104,"So, that would be about, what?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1853.103,1860.395,"Well, if the judge had said “I am reading the report” or “I have scanned it,” we wouldn't have a lawsuit here."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.395,1862.339,"No, he said “I have read it.”"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1862.339,1863.267,“I have read it.”
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1863.267,1868.979,"Which means, “I have read it within the six-minute period.”"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1868.979,1869.101,And --
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.101,1870.738,According to you.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1870.738,1873.52,He -- this is a situation and he could've read --
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.52,1873.95,Wouldn't that --
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1873.95,1877.591,"He could've read it, speed-read it, during the six-minute period --"
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1877.591,1877.764,Was there anything --
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1877.764,1878.88,Considering the fact --
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1878.88,1882.581,Is there anything in the record to show the judge has taken speed-reading?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1882.581,1884.655,"No, Your Honor, there isn't."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.655,1898.428,"My point is that, seriously, it appears to me that in the six-minute period he should've been listening to what defense counsel was arguing in the -- for his client."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1908.939,1922.159,"Well, in the first place, all defense counsel said during this period is “I want to stay until Monday morning because my client is facing a long sentence and I would like him to spend the last few days with his family.”"
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1922.169,1924.921,I also read that his wife was pregnant and other things.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1927.656,1940.13,"Right, and it'd be very simple for the district judge to just scan the report because this is not a sit -- this is a case where the district judge was familiar with the defendant's background."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1953.107,1961.998,"Well, do you mean by such things that he could wipe out the necessity of seeing the report, the probation report?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1961.998,1963.234,No.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1963.234,1967.623,And decide it on those things and not on the -- in accordance with the report?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1967.623,1967.713,No.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1984.332,1990.365,"But, should it be prejudiced by it if there's anything good in the probation report?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1990.365,1991.66,Should it be prejudiced by it?
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1991.66,1995.931,"Yes, by what he knew before it?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,1995.931,1997.785,There's no indication that he was prejudiced by it.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1997.785,2006.546,"Well, you said he knew all about the defendant and, I suppose you meant by that, that he knew about his criminal background and so forth before it ever came --"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2006.546,2010.309,And he knew about his social history and the problems of the --
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2010.309,2015.806,"Well, do you suppose it decided on that or is this probation report supposed to have some significance?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2015.806,2022.934,"The probation report has significance but, in this situation, what did the judge have to decide on sentencing?"
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2122.682,2126.285,What was the date of trial?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2126.285,2130.129,What was the date of trial?
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2138.231,2138.661,How long--
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2138.661,2140.216,Five or six weeks after arraignment.
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2140.216,2141.99,How long did the trial last?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2141.99,2146.796,The trial lasted one day.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2181.737,2183.731,Was that all of the evidence offered when he decide?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2183.731,2184.709,That was all the evidence.
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2187.703,2199.037,"May I ask, Mr. Glazer, I take it part of that six minutes was taken up by the judge's polling each of the jurors."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2199.037,2205.193,"It indicates -- the record indicates the jury was polled, but --"
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2205.193,2210.839,"Now, it wasn't part of the six minutes taken up by the judge just polling the jury."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2210.839,2211.655,I think it was.
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2220.849,2228.308,"What the judge said “I'll ask each individual juror if that's your verdict,” whereupon all jurors indicate “affirmatively.”"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2228.308,2239.256,"Yes, well, it's not a situa -- now, it's -- you can't tell from this record, I assume from this record, that this was a situation where all 12 jurors shook their head affirmatively."
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2239.843,2241.489,Why should you assume that?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2241.489,2244.361,"Well, maybe it's the other way, but --"
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2244.361,2247.519,"Just to uphold your reason, I didn't do it that way."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2247.519,2253.645,"Well, normally, if the juries are polled the other way, “Mr. So-and-so, is this your verdict?”"
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2262.432,2271.158,"And then, apparently, the judge had some problem whether or not he should ask the jury to come back and that took a little time for this colloquy, didn't it, out of the six minutes?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2271.158,2272.935,"Right, it took some time."
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2272.935,2273.642,I mean --
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2273.642,2274.575,"And, it also--"
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2274.575,2287.282,"Some of the six minutes taken up by his polling the jury and some of the six minutes taken up while he checked on whether or not they were to be called back and, after that was done, then he said “let the defendant come forward.”"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2287.282,2287.337,Right.
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2287.337,2290.525,And how much of the six minutes was left then?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2290.525,2303.589,"And also, on the other hand, when the judge came to recite the defendant's record, it indi -- it seems that he's reading the record at that time."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2325.904,2330.992,Did he offer the defendant an opportunity of allocution?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2330.992,2331.888,"Yes, he did, Your Honor."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2332.816,2335.419,What did the defendant say?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2335.419,2349.333,"Both the defendant and his lawyer, the only thing they said was that they would like some time, another couple of days, the defendant can remain out on bond and be with his wife."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2367.702,2411.261,"I know but, Mr. Glazer, do you believe that it is asking too much of the trial judge before he gives any man, I don't care who he is, any man 25 years of his life in the penitentiary that he do no more than poll the jury ask the defendant whether he has anything to say and after his counsel has spoken briefly, then to say to a man whether he read the probation officer's report before the jury came in or afterwards that “I sentence you to 25 years” in six minutes time?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2411.261,2411.598,"Well, it seem --"
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2411.598,2424.317,Do you not believe that a federal judge should have more dignity in his Court and more respect for human life than to do a thing of that kind in six minutes?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2424.317,2433.318,"Well, I think that the whole thing boils down to what is only six minutes is because you know that the Congress hasn't given the federal judge any choice in this case."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2458.254,2459.899,"Well, Mr. Glazer --"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2459.899,2461.184,In this --
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2461.184,2462.931,Why does he have a probation report for --
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2462.931,2463.448,Right.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2463.448,2466.819,If he doesn't go ahead and pay any attention to it?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2466.819,2492.758,"Well, he did pay some attention to it, but I think he paid the attention to that all this report -- all he had to do, all this report -- this case required is not -- if I would agree with Your Honor that if he had a situation where he could tailor the sentence to fix -- to fit the individual, yes, I say maybe he should spend more time."
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2505.368,2512.382,Does this six minutes that you're talking about begin from the time the probation report was given to the judge?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2512.382,2513.797,"Well, the record in this case --"
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2513.797,2515.743,When was it given to the judge?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2515.743,2519.354,The record in this case does not show when the probation report was giv --
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2519.354,2522.288,But where do you get the six minutes?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2522.288,2541.292,"Well, the Court has assumed that there's six minutes on the basis of the jury returning -- from the government's brief that says the jury returned its verdict at 3:24 and then, that the sentencing procedure occurred and was concluded at 3:30."
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2543.266,2544.005,Perhaps I may suggest --
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2544.005,2551.079,It might be possible that the judge had it while the party will argue the case and what of it is in the argument.
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2551.079,2551.786,That's true.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2551.786,2553.86,It would be a lot more than six minutes.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2553.86,2555.086,"Well, it's that where there's --"
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2555.086,2566.619,"Mr. Glazer, I suggest to you that the probation report, in which I have just looked, is dated May 19 which was the same day as the trial was held."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2576.077,2576.993,Before the trial commenced.
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2576.993,2582.806,"But, on the other hand, if the trial had gone on for about a week, he would've had the report for a week."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2582.806,2585.918,I understand that the practice in this --
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2585.918,2589.579,But the trial wouldn't have gone on for a week because it didn't have enough witnesses.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2589.579,2589.966,That's right.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2589.966,2594.128,They only had the witnesses who swore that he committed the bank robbery.
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2594.128,2598.547,"Well, I thought this trial was on May 31, not May 19."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2610.653,2612.547,"Well, the record here does show --"
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2612.547,2613.124,"Well, alright."
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2619.37,2621.953,But didn't you tell me that the trial was on May 19?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2621.953,2622.889,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2629.015,2630.41,Perhaps it was my error.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2640.672,2641.927,Well --
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2641.927,2648.283,"It's not clear what that signifies, but that is the date that appears on the probation report."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2648.283,2656.182,"Well, this record does not reflect when the probation officer submitted the report to the judge."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2679.251,2680.566,Is that in the record?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2680.566,2680.617,What?
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2680.617,2681.555,Is that in the record?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2681.555,2684.939,The record has no indication at all.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2685.306,2688.65,Why do you ask us to put it on that basis when you know nothing about it?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2688.65,2694.127,I'm not -- I'm just -- I'm not asking you.
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.774,2738.025,"Don't you agree that not only is the rule that it shouldn't be given to the judge until after the guilt has been determined, but also didn't it assume that the judge is going to read it, number one, two, give it this careful consideration, and, three, to take mature time to think it over, even if the record shows the man is guilty as all, get out?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2741.299,2741.547,Well--
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2741.547,2747.543,Or is it your position that the judge is given a probation report and he just scans it?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2747.543,2748.354,Well --
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2748.354,2749.916,"Now, which is your position?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2749.916,2756.74,My position is that whether a judge has a probation report or not is optional.
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2758.913,2766.207,"I -- in my case, I'm talking about where a judge gets a probation report."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2768.243,2769.758,"Right, correct that he had one."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2769.758,2777.958,"And he -- do you agree with me that he should've considered it, thought it over after having carefully read it?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2782.896,2793.235,"Well, it seems to me that the judge have -- the moderate time a judge spend on a probation report varies with the individual case."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2807.562,2818.406,"But if he has a crime where all the witnesses are on one side and he doesn't take the stand, I gather you don't think there's a need for probation to put it on."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2818.406,2822.788,"Well, I don't -- I think, in this case, where he --"
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.788,2824.034,You didn't need one.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2824.034,2832.579,"In this case, there would be no need for a probation report because he did not have any option as to what sentence to impose."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2852.439,2854.187,"Well, why did he read it?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2854.187,2854.696,What?
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2854.696,2855.744,Why did he read it?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2859.586,2868.861,"Well, I would think that one thing he'd be interested is whether the probation officer's can -- recommendation agrees with his."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2893.76,2900.319,"He had to do it that day, he couldn't have thought it over that night and sentence him the next day, could he?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2900.319,2900.876,Well --
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2900.876,2904.533,You got to be certain it's that day within six minutes.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2904.533,2912.686,I don't see any virtue of delaying the sentencing process.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2938.09,2939.977,"Well, Mr. Glazer, let me ask you this."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2954.159,2955.095,Clearly.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2955.095,2955.804,Right.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,2962.938,2968.585,I would say not in this case for this reason.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2996.567,3009.99,"Your belief is that even though the judge has clearly violated the rule, that it is still incumbent on the defendant to establish that he was prejudiced thereby."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3009.99,3021.138,"No, we -- no, I'd say the government will take the burden of showing lack of prejudice and I say, in this case, lack of prejudice appears beyond the reasonable doubt."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3040.963,3055.465,But do you concede then that in a situation where the judge does violate the rule that it's incumbent upon the -- upon the government to establish there was no prejudice to him?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3055.465,3055.974,Yes.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3072.556,3076.628,"Well, also, does the record show that he was prejudice, the judge was prejudice?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3076.628,3077.844,"No, the record doesn't show as the --"
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3077.844,3080.287,Is there any indication that he was prejudice?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3080.287,3080.796,No.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3080.796,3086.568,Is there anything in the rule that Congress considered to have a growing effect?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3086.756,3087.612,The --
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3087.612,3112.171,"Is there anything in the rule, written in the rule, that Congress consider to have growing effect which says or indicates to anybody that a failure to read -- to follow that rule must always result automatically in reversing the a case of a man where all the evidence that was offered shows he's guilty?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3112.171,3114.564,No.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3114.564,3120.862,How could the defendant show prejudice if he is denied an opportunity to see the report?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3120.862,3124.253,The defendant wasn't denied an opportunity to receive the report.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3124.253,3125.421,"Well, he's always denied it."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3125.421,3126.708,No.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3144.872,3146.709,Why didn't he get it here?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3146.709,3147.745,"He didn't ask for it, Your Honor."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3147.745,3149.17,I thought he did.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3149.17,3154.669,"No, he never asked the district judge to see all or any part of the probation --"
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3154.669,3158.207,"“May” doesn't mean “must” as it choose there, does it?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3158.207,3159.565,It says “may.”
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3159.565,3161.21,"Yes, and “may” means “may.”"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3161.21,3162.006,"“May,” right."
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3162.685,3164.082,The Court has discretion.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3164.082,3174.902,"Right, and the reason the Court has discretion is there are certain situations where there may be confidential information in the probation report, for example --"
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3174.902,3189.455,"Now, are you saying to me that all federal judges disclose presentence investigatory reports except where the specific report has confidential information?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3189.455,3190.032,No.
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3190.032,3190.848,I hope you wouldn't say that.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3190.848,3192.615,"No, I'm not saying that."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3217.611,3235.986,"I thought, Mr. Glazer, that when petitioner's counsel requested to be released on bond for a short period so that he could visit his family, and that was denied, then petitioner's counsel asked for a presentence report."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3235.986,3241.864,"No, he said “I would like to ask that a presentence investigation be made.”"
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3249.382,3251.825,He wanted to see it.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3251.825,3261.056,"It -- to me, that's the impression I have is he wanted the probation officer to conduct a presentence investigation."
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3262.511,3276.945,"You think he should've said that “if a presentence investigation report has been made, I'd like to see it,” even though it's quite obvious that he didn't know that a presentence investigation report had been made."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3276.945,3278.633,"He could've said that, right, and, apparently, it --"
1968.453,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3278.633,3280.807,I think that's what he had to say.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3280.807,3296.152,"Apparently, I assume that he assumed that he didn't realize that a report had -- an investigation had commenced."
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3355.746,3362.251,"Well, where were the defendant and his lawyer at the time the judge told them there had been mandate and he read it?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3362.251,3362.389,As I just --
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3362.389,3364.453,Where were the defendant and his lawyer?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3364.453,3376.296,"The defense counsel stated, “Your Honor, I would like to ask that a presentence investigation be made of -- “He was interrupted in the middle of his motion, his request."""
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3379.101,3381.426,But that answered that part of his statement.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3381.426,3381.895,That's correct.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3381.895,3384.211,And what did the defendant or his lawyer say?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3384.211,3387.263,The defendant or his lawyer wasn't given the chance to say anything.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3388.179,3389.686,You mean he cut him off?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3389.686,3391.532,"Yes, he cut him off."
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3391.532,3392.93,They couldn't talk?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3392.93,3393.487,The --
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3393.487,3395.531,Were they standing there before him?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3395.531,3397.505,The Court stated --
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3397.505,3398.573,Were you his lawyer?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3398.573,3399.828,Yes.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3399.828,3401.525,Were you cut off in talk?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3401.525,3403.272,"Yes, because he had stated it was --"
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3403.272,3405.396,"Well, where exactly in here, he first --"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3405.396,3406.821,Page 7 of the appendix.
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3406.821,3410.432,"Yes, but he first asked you what did you have to say."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3421.172,3422.188,That's correct.
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3422.188,3424.911,And you did speak.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3424.911,3424.944,I --
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3424.944,3428.904,"And then the Court turned to Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Gregg spoke."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3428.904,3429.443,That's correct.
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3429.443,3430.78,Right?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3430.78,3431.16,That's correct.
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3431.16,3433.743,"So, where were you cut off?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3433.743,3443.42,"When I find out that a presentence investigation had been made, that the Court had read it, and then the Court pronounced sentence."
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3443.42,3445.933,But you -- I don't see where you were cut off.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3445.933,3448.456,“Custody of the martial.”
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3448.456,3449.931,That cut you off.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3449.931,3452.167,Maybe if --
1968.453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3452.167,3453.951,I see.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3453.951,3462.306,"You mean that if you -- if you were to add more to read that -- wanted to see that thing, you wouldn't have asked him?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3462.306,3463.863,"At this time, we were so surprised --"
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3463.863,3465.051,"Well, why wouldn't you?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3467.953,3471.007,We were so surprised that a presentence investigation had been made --
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3471.007,3473.221,"Well, that's right, but did you ask him to see it?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3475.257,3476.354,Because the --
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3476.354,3482.868,Maybe the last paragraph of the colloquy would clear that up.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3482.868,3483.697,I've just read it.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3484.873,3498.552,"Mr. Richards: “Your Honor, I would like to ask that a presentence investigation be made of --"" and then the Court interrupting, “a presentence investigation has been made."
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3555.225,3566.871,Do you believe that a lawyer who represents his client from the beginning to the end could be stopped from talking by what was said there?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3566.871,3567.36,At this time --
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3567.36,3568.648,Would you?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3568.648,3568.689,No.
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3568.689,3570.883,He was the lawyer.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3570.883,3573.396,Would you stop from talking with what was --
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3573.396,3575.42,"It certainly was not, except the defendant --"
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3575.42,3577.454,Did you want to see it?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3577.454,3578.729,Did I want to see the presentence investigation?
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3578.729,3580.366,Yes.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3580.366,3582.222,"At that time, no."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3586.46,3588.975,You mean after this colloquy was over?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3588.975,3589.484,Yes.
1968.453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3611.394,3614.546,"Well, what were you going to say that you didn't get to say?"
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3614.546,3617.438,"At that time, I had nothing to say, Your Honor."
1968.453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3617.438,3618.067,"Well, no."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3625.367,3631.223,I was requesting that a presentence investigation be made.
1968.453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3632.948,3633.824,That's something --
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3633.824,3633.954,This was all about --
1968.453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3633.954,3639.032,That's something which you sought would take a little time and the sentence would be put off until it was completed.
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3640.068,3640.854,"That's correct, and I was --"
1968.453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3640.854,3650.209,"And said of which you discovered, I gather that it's something you didn't know, that it'd already been done so you couldn't get a delay in sentence while pre-investigation."
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3650.209,3650.708,That's correct.
1968.453,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3652.155,3657.006,Are you sure you're not asking a leading question instead of stating what you thought?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3657.006,3658.441,"No, Your Honor, I believe I am."
1968.453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3659.0,3662.683,Are you leading question or not?
1968.453,1,41398,sidney_m_glazer,,3662.683,3665.575,"At this time, I was not going to ask."
1968.453,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3676.153,3678.209,Very well.
