1991.90-967,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,"We'll hear argument now in case No. 90-967, Guy Wooddell, Jr. v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers."
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,11.808,14.424,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and my it please the Court:"
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,39.558,41.743,Do you want us to rule on it?
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,41.743,44.779,"Well, it seems to me the most appropriate thing to do--"
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,44.779,47.145,"Well, what if we disagree with both of you?"
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,47.145,50.766,"--Well, I understand that's possible."
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,56.753,59.372,"Hold it, the court below disagreed with you."
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,59.372,62.156,The court below did disagree with us.
1991.90-967,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.916,82.118,"Well, I think that we're wanting to deal right now with the argument before this Court."
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,89.474,90.291,Fine.
1991.90-967,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.436,612.546,"Mr. Meckler, do you think Congress had in mind when it passed section 301 an intent to Federalize internal disputes between unions and its members?"
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,612.546,615.581,"Yes, I think it did."
1991.90-967,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,619.468,623.003,I would have thought the evidence might be to the contrary.
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,623.003,632.876,"--Well, it seems to me the evidence, the main basis of evidence in that regard is the language of the statute itself."
1991.90-967,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,663.611,672.952,"If Congress has chosen to indicate a Federal policy, such as Justice O'Connor was inquiring about, to Federalize, they could have equally well done that."
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,672.952,698.501,"Well, I suppose that's true, but as the Court looked at in Plumbers, the... it's very clear that at the time of the passage of section 301 back in 1947, union constitutions were the primary form of contracts between labor organizations."
1991.90-967,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.113,723.984,You think the principal thing Congress had in mind in the Taft-Hartley Act when it defined the term were union constitutions?
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,723.984,728.586,--I don't think that that was the principal thing.
1991.90-967,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,728.586,730.705,"I thought from what you said a moment ago, maybe you did."
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,730.705,733.574,"No, Your Honor, I didn't mean to suggest that."
1991.90-967,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,801.635,812.609,"I take it under your view that if there were an auto lease or a lease for a building between one labor union and another, that that would be a 301 suit, or am I incorrect about that?"
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,812.609,821.298,"Well, I think there's a question there, to be sure, but the question is a Federal question."
1991.90-967,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.94,834.356,"No, no."
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,838.594,845.08,--I believe that probably falls within the language of the statute.
1991.90-967,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.405,872.998,"Mr. Meckler, how do you distinguish Lockridge?"
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,888.007,890.859,"Well, I distinguish Lockridge on a couple basis."
1991.90-967,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.094,920.546,"But to be committed not as a contract violation, but as a violation of the act."
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,920.546,933.655,"--Well, yes, that's true, but I think the important thing there is that the Court indicated that it's a matter of Federal concern."
1991.90-967,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.273,1067.658,"Well, maybe they were wrong about 301 preempting it."
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,1067.658,1071.629,"Well, maybe they were."
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.546,1106.45,Does 301 mention a suit between a union and a member?
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,1106.45,1107.302,No.
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.46,1122.562,It does mention a suit between two unions.
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,1122.562,1127.383,"It does mention a suit... well, it talks about... no, Your Honor, I beg to differ with you there."
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.286,1135.569,Exactly.
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,1139.773,1148.296,"No, it talks about contracts between two or more labor organizations, I think, is the language of the statute."
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.296,1148.996,Exactly.
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,1148.996,1161.52,"And the point being this Court has already decided, in Plumbers, that union constitutions are that kind of a contract, are a 301 contract."
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.946,1182.767,Would you be making the same argument if the 301 didn't mention contracts between two or more labor organizations?
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,1182.767,1185.385,--I don't think so.
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.305,1193.739,Why not?
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,1193.739,1202.145,Because the statutory language defines the bounds here.
1991.90-967,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.785,1223.974,"Yeah, but it still doesn't mention contracts between a union and a member."
1991.90-967,0,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,1223.974,1240.084,"It doesn't mention contracts between a union and a member, but I would suggest to the Court that a union constitution is a contract between labor organizations by virtue of its usage over years, and more importantly by virtue of Plumbers."
1991.90-967,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1255.695,1259.147,"Very well, Mr. Meckler."
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1261.766,1265.818,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-967,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.965,1291.703,You do concede the jury trial issue?
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1291.703,1293.571,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-967,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.571,1297.356,Although the court of appeals ruled in your favor?
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1297.356,1300.224,That is correct.
1991.90-967,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1303.593,1305.043,That's before Terry?
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1305.043,1306.212,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1583.074,1588.478,"Well, which of the two categories does that fall into?"
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1593.132,1594.449,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.449,1599.119,Or does it deal with the relationship between the international and its subordinate unions?
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1610.192,1619.866,The international constitution prescribes duties for the local union and the local union officers.
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1631.174,1633.34,So it does speak to the rights of the members of the union.
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1633.34,1633.824,--Right.
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.976,1639.094,But it also speaks to the duties of the officers of the union.
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1639.094,1641.28,--Those are the local union officers.
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1641.28,1641.763,Right.
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1641.763,1643.815,Not the international--
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1643.815,1644.465,So therefore it does--
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1644.465,1647.784,--Those are the duties of the local unions officers.
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.784,1648.267,--I understand.
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1648.267,1656.873,And that's the relationship... that's almost a third kind of thing where you have a relationship that I'll get to later between the local union and its members.
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.841,1672.149,It seems to me it says the local union owes a duty to the international to do something for the members of the local union.
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1676.036,1678.636,"No, Justice Scalia."
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.779,1876.933,"Mr. Cloppert, let me understand what your case is."
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1887.123,1889.425,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.425,1904.6,"And you're confident that we can tell as to each of those which of them is type one that involves the relationship between the international and the local, and type two, which involves the relationship between the international and individual members of the local."
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1904.6,1907.202,I have all that confidence in the Court.
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.606,1925.248,"And just let me add, and you're confident that a provision that says, a member of the local is entitled to get certain service from a vice president of a local."
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1942.96,1947.094,"--When you're dealing with the individual, those are individual rights."
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.187,1967.472,What other provisions of the constitution do you think are Plumber-type provisions?
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1977.613,1983.516,"The per capita dues, that's the support of the international union--"
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.516,1985.166,That involves what?
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,1988.285,1988.668,--Right.
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.591,2000.643,That's an easy one.
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,2002.995,2015.886,I think our analysis takes care of many of the concerns that counsel mentioned here of the law being different depending on whether it's an individual member bringing the lawsuit or it's an organization.
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.124,2052.742,And what is your touchstone?
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,2069.253,2075.607,"The only way I can say it, Justice Scalia, is does it deal with the relationship between the international and the subordinate bodies?"
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.052,2127.473,What about a provision that the local elections shall be conducted in a certain fashion?
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,2129.156,2133.025,"If it regulates... right, elections."
1991.90-967,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.119,2306.171,Was that an international in Allis-Chalmers?
1991.90-967,1,23795,frederick_g_cloppert,,2308.638,2308.988,Yes.
1991.90-967,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2354.151,2356.169,"Thank you, Mr. Cloppert."
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2358.871,2361.323,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.846,2405.067,"There wasn't always an interest in it, of course, or it wouldn't be in the constitution."
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2441.373,2446.477,"I think you're going to get into all sorts of problems drawing those distinctions, number one."
1991.90-967,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.505,2471.627,"Give me an example of one that really is the hardest to categorize, doesn't fit into a neat one."
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2477.013,2478.615,"--Well, okay, and I probably should."
1991.90-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.189,2627.144,"Yes, but Smith was... when you're talking about collective bargaining agreements, you kind of have a presumption based on the whole history of labor law that all collective bargaining agreements have an impact on interstate commerce."
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2634.417,2644.856,"Well, it seems to me Plumbers answers the question and tells us that union constitutions are contracts within the meaning of 301."
1991.90-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.86,2653.426,It goes to positions being rejected.
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2700.741,2706.478,"Well, that's correct, although I think the question presented here is a little more limited than that, really."
1991.90-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2706.478,2709.679,"I know, but once you get... if you win, then that's the next step, obviously."
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2715.35,2715.6,I would have to agree with you there.
1991.90-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.702,2717.568,Let me just ask one other--
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2717.568,2718.068,--I'm sorry.
1991.90-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.068,2725.224,--Are you limiting your position to cases in which the union constitution actually defines the relationship between an international or a national and locals?
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2731.145,2735.914,I'm not sure... you mean like an independent local?
1991.90-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2735.914,2738.032,An independent local has its own constitution.
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2738.032,2743.52,"Well, I think you probably fall outside the language of the statute because we've got to back to the language of the statute."
1991.90-967,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2746.655,2749.439,"Right, and your labor organizations are the parent and the subsidiaries, or the--"
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2749.439,2750.073,That's right.
1991.90-967,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2825.954,2840.398,--I grant you Plumbers said that there could be a suit on a contract between two unions and that union constitutions are contracts.
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2855.823,2857.592,That's true.
1991.90-967,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.592,2863.663,"Well, it didn't mention a suit on a contract between a union and a member."
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2863.663,2866.965,We're not going to a contract between a union and a member.
1991.90-967,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2871.167,2885.509,"All right, it is a contract, but call it a constitution or a contract... and it is a contract, Plumbers held that, but 301 doesn't authorize a suit on a contract between a union and its members."
1991.90-967,2,43113,theodore_e_meckler,,2885.509,2901.888,"--Well, I go back, to answer your question, Justice White, to the language of the statute itself, which talks about the between language, which Smith addressed, modifies contracts and not suits."
1991.90-967,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2911.977,2915.095,"Thank you, Mr. Meckler."
