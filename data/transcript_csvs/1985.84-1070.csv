1985.84-1070,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.449,We will hear arguments first this morning in Witters against the Washington Department of Services for the Blind.
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,15.058,17.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1070,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,51.964,58.072,"Mr. Farris, before you proceed, has Mr. Witters completed his training for the ministry?"
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,58.072,62.818,"No, Your Honor, he was required to drop out because of lack of financial ability."
1985.84-1070,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,62.818,63.474,I see.
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,66.567,78.094,"He was in Bible School which was leading to a B.A. Degree, which was an undergraduate program, which would have qualified him by itself for certain ministerial positions."
1985.84-1070,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,78.094,86.45,I take it if he were eligible he would pursue his education for the ministry under this State of Washington program?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,86.45,87.841,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.745,95.274,Is he pursuing some other educational degree at the moment?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,95.274,98.93,"No, Your Honor, he is washing dishes in a medical laboratory."
1985.84-1070,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,182.193,184.8,How does the Social Security... Would you explain that?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,187.002,200.763,"If a person's father, for example, passes away while they are going to college, they would be eligible for certain dependent's benefits under the Social Security program which they could use for various forms of training, including ministerial training among others."
1985.84-1070,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,200.763,203.59,"They could use it to start a filling station too if they wanted, couldn't they?"
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,205.729,213.929,The benefits that I was referring to were educational benefits that you are entitled to as a student under certain Social Security programs.
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.585,272.639,"Mr. Farris, do you concede that the State of Washington could, if they chose, have a vocational rehabilitation program which expressly excludes any educational funding for the ministry?"
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,272.639,278.356,"We would concede, Your Honor, that this would be a much more difficult case here."
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.559,287.431,"Well, do you think it would be valid under the Establishment Clause for the state to have such an express provision?"
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,287.431,289.071,--It would be valid under the Establishment Clause.
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.117,293.506,Would it be valid under the Free Exercise Clause?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,293.506,296.787,I don't believe that it would under this Court's holdings in Sherbert and Thomas.
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.782,318.747,"So, it is your position that if the state wants to fund educational aid for students, it must include educational aid for religious students of study."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,318.747,323.463,--I think there is a difference between educational aid perhaps and vocational rehabilitation which is career training.
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,332.662,338.145,Should it matter what code the legislature enacts it under for a constitutional inquiry?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,338.145,343.065,"--It shouldn't, but this Court's decisions seem to have treated various sections differently."
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,350.671,364.117,It just seems to me that your argument would lead inevitably to conclude that a state could not withhold funding for religious education at any level and in any program.
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,364.117,367.21,"I don't think that we are required to go that far, Your Honor."
1985.84-1070,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,380.393,384.61,Has this Court ever funded religious education before?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,384.61,387.485,"--No, this Court does not appropriate funds."
1985.84-1070,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,389.405,392.388,"Well, I don't mean that, of course, obviously."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,399.121,402.118,"Yes, Your Honor, it has."
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,436.932,448.569,"Mr. Farris, does Mr. Witters urge that his religious beliefs and practices require him to study theology?"
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,448.569,463.329,"Your Honor, his position is that he feels a religious call to the ministry, much as Reverend McDaniel did in the case of McDaniel versus Paty, and that is a personal religious call, it is not something the belief system per se requires."
1985.84-1070,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,468.076,472.387,What about veterans' benefits after the various wars we have been in?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,479.339,479.978,No.
1985.84-1070,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,794.917,803.178,"You would make the same argument if he were studying, what, Hinduism or Islam or Confucianism."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,803.178,805.88,It would not make a difference to our theory--
1985.84-1070,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,805.88,807.411,To be a clergyman in those respective faiths?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,807.411,807.786,--Yes.
1985.84-1070,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,828.623,833.62,"Mr. Farris, I gather the Supreme Court didn't reach the entanglement question."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,833.62,834.105,--No.
1985.84-1070,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,846.663,850.316,"If we thought that issue was still open, what should we do, send it back?"
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,850.316,859.421,"Well, it would only be open, Your Honor, if the state is allowed to proceed into its new argument and I think that the face of the record is pretty certain."
1985.84-1070,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.92,875.745,"But, the state is entitled to present that position, I suppose."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,882.789,890.302,"They did not argue, Your Honor, at the Washington Supreme Court level or at any level below that the program violated the First Amendment."
1985.84-1070,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.612,900.735,"Well, nevertheless, the Washington Supreme Court thought there was an entanglement issue, but it just put it aside."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,909.996,912.356,--They are entitled to argue it certainly.
1985.84-1070,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,912.356,918.884,Is it also possible the Supreme Court of the state thought there was so little to the argument that it didn't deserve any comment at all?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,918.884,932.739,"I think that would be more in line with our position, Your Honor, but, in any event, the State Supreme Court said that... Rather than there was an entanglement issue, they thought that the analysis was ill-suited to the case and there was no record."
1985.84-1070,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.925,939.393,"Mr. Farris, is that a fair statement, what they did?"
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,947.312,949.764,"--They did use the phrase, Your Honor, that the--"
1985.84-1070,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.764,956.183,"It is unnecessary for us to attempt... I guess they said a strained analysis of the entanglement effect, but they had already decided the case."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,956.183,957.026,--That is correct.
1985.84-1070,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.882,971.755,I guess Justice Utter's dissent rejected the entanglement argument.
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,971.755,972.395,Yes.
1985.84-1070,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1035.465,1042.585,You mean remand it after this Court disposes of the issues that the Supreme Court of Washington did decide?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1042.585,1043.272,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1070,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.499,1127.833,"So, you don't think that even if... For instance, you said it would not be an establishment, that you think the Washington... the State of Washington would have to extend it; that it just couldn't say, well, whether this is an establishment or not, we prefer not to furnish aid to this kind of religious education."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1127.833,1131.565,"That would be our position, Your Honor, but that is not this case."
1985.84-1070,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.623,1152.104,I suppose the Commission thought that extending the aid would violate the state Constitution.
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1152.104,1152.823,That is correct.
1985.84-1070,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.823,1154.213,What are you going to do about that?
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1154.213,1161.054,"Well, it is our position that the state constitutional provision as so applied is unconstitutional as applied just like--"
1985.84-1070,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.054,1164.256,"So, you have to get to your free exercise argument."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1164.256,1165.208,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1070,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.208,1167.816,"And, you have to win on it really in the long run to do any good."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1167.816,1169.268,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1169.268,1183.123,"And, in fact, if it is correct that the state Constitution prohibits this kind of state aid, then we do have the case that I posed to you and Justice White posed to you in the question."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1192.041,1195.57,"It would be analogous to Sherbert and Thomas in that kind of situation, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1070,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.57,1198.679,"But, we don't have that case at the present time, do we?"
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1198.679,1211.329,"It is my position that you do not, because there has been a distinction between applying a constitutional provision... I think there is a distinction between applying the state constitutional provision and the policymakers of the state saying we want to fund this aid."
1985.84-1070,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.767,1220.092,"There is no question that the State of Washington legislature passed a statute which is construed by the Supreme Court of Washington, said we want to fund this aid."
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1237.772,1238.46,--It has not directly said.
1985.84-1070,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1239.538,1240.569,"Well, is that the whole picture?"
1985.84-1070,0,35793,michael_p_farris,,1252.875,1259.342,There is a policy that has been advanced but it is not a form of a regulation.
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,1561.425,1566.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1070,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.49,1676.033,In which Constitution?
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,1676.033,1677.22,The state Constitution.
1985.84-1070,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.339,1734.182,It is a state constitutional policy?
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,1734.182,1735.276,--The state Constitution.
1985.84-1070,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1824.942,1830.892,"General Malone, that certainly isn't the position taken by the Supreme Court of Washington."
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,1845.996,1848.308,I am not saying the statute doesn't authorize it.
1985.84-1070,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1859.584,1869.299,"--But, the Supreme Court of Washington certainly took the position that ministerial training was going to be funded unless there was a constitutional objection to it, don't you think?"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,1869.299,1871.345,Let me put it this way.
1985.84-1070,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1890.759,1897.163,"Mr. Malone, is it our function to try to construe the state Constitution here when the Supreme Court did not--"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,1897.163,1897.756,--No.
1985.84-1070,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1910.453,1930.337,"--Well, Mr. Malone, under your version, the applicable Washington law, would it be perfectly all right to have funded Mr. Witters' education at Inland School if he wanted to study history, for example?"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,1930.337,1933.055,"--If he wanted to study solely history, yes."
1985.84-1070,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1933.055,1934.491,He could do that in a religious school?
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,1934.491,1934.773,Yes.
1985.84-1070,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1935.476,1943.502,"And, it would be all right under the state Constitution as well as the federal to pay the tuition."
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,1943.502,1958.855,"--Not certainly the federal, probably the state at least if he wants to be a historian, if he wants that to be his profession."
1985.84-1070,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2175.958,2195.701,"Mr. Malone, are you asking that we focus on the fact that in order to get the aid Mr. Witters must subject himself to state regulation, is that your concern, or is it that it advances religion in your view because Mr. Witters wants to become a minister?"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2196.466,2197.011,Both.
1985.84-1070,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2203.884,2215.756,Do you think the Court normally looks at the program as a whole rather than focusing on the individual receiving the aid in these cases?
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2215.756,2217.098,It is precisely... Yes.
1985.84-1070,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2221.83,2229.983,"Well, do you think this Court generally has given a broader focus to the inquiry rather than just looking to the individual?"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2244.572,2247.774,"Absolutely... Of course, yes."
1985.84-1070,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2342.298,2347.499,"General Malone, was this Inland Empire Bible School, was that an undergraduate institution?"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2347.499,2348.529,I believe that it was.
1985.84-1070,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.529,2358.572,"And, if Mr. Witters had qualified under the G.I. Bill, could he have done... taken just the courses and enrolled for just what he proposed to enroll under the G.I. Bill."
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2358.572,2360.648,I believe he could have as I understand the G.I. Bill.
1985.84-1070,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2556.413,2562.521,"General Malone, what is there in the record to tell us anything about the likelihood that any of these things might happen?"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2562.521,2567.674,In terms of the actual operation--
1985.84-1070,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.46,2601.677,"Did you, at the trial level in this case, have an adequate opportunity to present evidence of this kind of problem that might develop in this case?"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2601.677,2605.004,Yes and no and let me explain that answer.
1985.84-1070,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.552,2647.407,"Whether you elected to rely on the federal Constitution in defending your opponent's claim was certainly within your control, not within your adversary's."
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2647.407,2647.736,Certainly.
1985.84-1070,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.875,2650.782,Let me ask one other question.
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2660.31,2660.607,--Yes.
1985.84-1070,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2660.607,2664.371,"And, they haven't decided it and say we send it back and decide the entanglement issue."
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2667.042,2669.244,"Certainly, certainly, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1070,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.894,2690.141,Your hypotheticals have triggered a question in my mind I would like to put to you if I may.
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2702.137,2702.637,"No, no."
1985.84-1070,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.354,2707.4,Would he have to prove that he had really been a minister and that he was eligible and all that sort of stuff?
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2707.4,2715.787,"One, would he have to be denied unemployment compensation under the Establishment Clause?"
1985.84-1070,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2832.272,2834.693,It all depends on the lens with which you view it.
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2852.17,2867.196,"I am using the religion-specific/not religion-specific distinction, Justice O'Connor, as a distinction which should be embodied in applying the Free Exercise Clause."
1985.84-1070,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2930.202,2943.289,"General Malone, I notice there were hearings first before an initial hearing officer and then a review within the administrative agency."
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,2949.521,2970.857,"None of what I am discussing now was brought out at those administrative proceedings, because again, Justice Rehnquist, what we were focusing on was at that stage all the way up until the Supreme Court of the State of Washington issued its opinion, all we were focusing on were the state religion clauses."
1985.84-1070,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2982.164,2995.94,"Mr. Malone, what would you say about a foundation that was created to grant scholarships, only one purpose to grant scholarships to students studying for the priesthood of the Roman Catholic Church."
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,3001.969,3012.622,"Yes, and I believe that it would, and I believe that it would under the reasoning of this Court in Walz."
1985.84-1070,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3017.665,3019.305,--It wouldn't make any difference.
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,3026.084,3027.022,Yes.
1985.84-1070,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3040.438,3044.514,Do you think that is like the tax case in the New York situation?
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,3044.514,3046.169,"No, the tax case in Mueller."
1985.84-1070,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3046.169,3047.716,I beg your pardon?
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,3047.716,3052.074,I am referring to Mueller when I say the 501(c)(3) is like the--
1985.84-1070,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3052.074,3059.617,"Well, is it not also comparable to the general rule which has been laid down that churches are not to be taxed?"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,3059.617,3060.991,"--Oh, Walz as well, yes."
1985.84-1070,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3060.991,3064.897,"In other words, 501(c)(3) merely implements that--"
1985.84-1070,1,43058,timothy_r_malone,,3064.897,3065.194,Yes.
1985.84-1070,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3203.029,3204.528,Very well.
1985.84-1070,2,35793,michael_p_farris,,3208.355,3214.946,Yes.
1985.84-1070,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.011,3334.304,"But, if we just reverse... Our usual mandate says reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this judgment."
1985.84-1070,2,35793,michael_p_farris,,3348.485,3358.762,"I suppose not, Your Honor, but I think if this Court held we were correct on the Free Exercise Clause issue, that would foreclose the other inquiry in all likelihood."
1985.84-1070,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.762,3361.636,"So, you really think we must decide the Free Exercise Clause?"
1985.84-1070,2,35793,michael_p_farris,,3361.636,3364.338,It is our desire that this Court would and we think--
1985.84-1070,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3364.338,3365.213,I know desire.
1985.84-1070,2,35793,michael_p_farris,,3378.146,3389.36,"--It is not required absolutely, but if there is no prudential consideration of the Rescue Army type of criteria for failing to do so, we would urge this Court to decide the Free Exercise Clause issue."
1985.84-1070,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3389.36,3400.449,"Of course, if it went back to the State Supreme Court and the State Supreme Court went against you, conceivably you might be up on a Free Exercise claim or you might try to get up on a Free Exercise claim here."
1985.84-1070,2,35793,michael_p_farris,,3400.449,3401.668,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1070,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3454.787,3456.084,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1985.84-1070,2,35793,michael_p_farris,,3456.084,3456.303,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1985.84-1070,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3456.303,3456.959,"Thank you, gentlemen."
