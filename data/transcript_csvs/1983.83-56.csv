1983.83-56,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.42,We will hear arguments first this morning in Heckler against Community Health Services.
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,14.76,18.262,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,426.204,428.323,"Mr. Geller, can I ask you a question right there."
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,449.67,453.138,"The case would be no different, for reasons that I will get to in a little while, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-56,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.122,468.015,"Mr. Geller, do you see room in any case for a so-called ""affirmative misconduct"" kind of an exception for application of this rule?"
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,468.015,480.622,"We have argued in our brief that there is no exception, because it's inconsistent with the whole analytical framework of the rule that the Government cannot be estopped."
1983.83-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,524.301,539.744,"Assuming, Mr. Geller, there is a statutory entitlement if someone had followed the correct procedure, but there was a representation by the General Counsel that this is the way to go about it and then it turns out it really wasn't?"
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,539.744,550.968,"That would be very much like Schweiker versus Hansen, where there arguably was a statutory entitlement, but the procedures were not followed, and this Court said that the procedures are a part of the statutory entitlement."
1983.83-56,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.203,555.939,Would be the same?
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,555.939,556.655,--Would be the same.
1983.83-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,559.057,571.132,Would it be correct to say that CHS was no worse off so far as what it was entitled to get from the Government after it had followed the intermediary's advice than before?
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,571.132,571.982,"Well, I think that's correct."
1983.83-56,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.951,577.769,"Now it has to pay them back, and it's because it wasn't entitled to them."
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,577.769,578.753,"Yes, that's correct."
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.442,1238.994,"Well, why wouldn't the intermediary have the same substantial doubts?"
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1238.994,1244.898,"Well, this case arises because the intermediary was negligent in construing these statutes."
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.502,1258.656,You don't think there's any room at all for argument on the fact that this might have been seed money?
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1258.656,1259.422,"--Well, I think it's--"
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.422,1260.858,It's perfectly clear it was not seed money?
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1260.858,1262.358,"--Well, I think we can look at the following."
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.225,1288.525,Perhaps Travelers is just plain incompetent?
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1288.525,1292.795,"Well, the person... we don't know, for example, what CHS--"
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.795,1296.331,The Secretary did hire Travelers to do this job.
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1296.331,1302.585,"--The Secretary hired Travelers, although the particular person who gave this advice I'm told was not a lawyer."
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.904,1311.54,"Well, there's no claim that they misrepresented the facts."
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1315.242,1317.092,"Well, one of the problems in this area... we don't make that claim."
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.083,1335.155,I thought they had a written financial report that was filed each year or something like that; wasn't there?
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1335.155,1346.777,"--But the requests to Travelers for advice on whether the CETA grants were reimbursable was all done orally, and that's one of the points here."
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.479,1351.015,"But you'd surely take the same position if everything was in writing, I think."
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1351.015,1362.889,"--We would, but my point is that if the Court of Appeals is correct in this case that even these sorts of informal oral conversations, as to which there's no record of what was said by any party, would be sufficient to estop the Government."
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1363.806,1366.525,"And also no dispute as to what was said, as I understand it."
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1366.525,1372.429,"--Well, but in many cases there will be disputes, and the rule can't be that estoppel occurs only when there's no dispute."
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.406,1403.631,"But you seem to be arguing that the answer was plain, but I think your argument would cover a situation in which Travelers' construction was a perfectly reasonable one which most of us might have adopted the first time we looked at it."
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1403.631,1404.114,"It would, it would."
1983.83-56,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.766,1407.183,"Oh, I see."
1983.83-56,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1407.852,1414.939,The Third Circuit's opinion suggests that CHS acted completely reasonably and did everything it could do.
1983.83-56,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1453.231,1454.564,Very well.
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,1460.134,1464.619,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.671,1754.725,I'm not sure I got your point on the fact that they did not possess the manual.
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1757.86,1760.462,It's a Government manual and it would--
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1760.462,1761.397,Are you suggesting--
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,1761.397,1762.131,--Pardon me?
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.131,1768.485,--Are you suggesting there's some obligation on the Government to see that everyone has a copy of it.
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,1768.485,1778.424,"Well, whether it's their obligation or the party's obligation to obtain it, they did obtain it from Mr. Reeves, Mr. Reeves at the time of the meeting, and the problem was after that."
1983.83-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.747,1855.357,"Mr. Hasley, though, that was true in Schweiker against Hansen, too, that had the person made the application the way the Government regulations provided, rather than the way she was advised to by the Government official, she probably would have been better off."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,1855.357,1867.248,"But in the question of detrimental reliance, I believe Mr. Geller said that CHS was not disadvantaged, that they would nonetheless had the CETA employees."
1983.83-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.966,1875.184,"Well, perhaps you're right in thinking there was some disadvantage along the line of your analysis."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,1883.657,1888.292,"Well, this is one, this is of course just one aspect of what happened."
1983.83-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.331,2069.774,"Mr. Hasley, it seems to me your arguing as if the standards which would estop the Government were very much the same as are held in state law to estop private individuals: detrimental reliance, reasonable assertions, and that sort of thing."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2084.116,2097.041,"Well, as the Court of Appeals noted, in accordance with his duties... he was under a duty to communicate... any communications from CHS were to be communicated to the Secretary."
1983.83-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.495,2103.514,"Well, that's just a mistake."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2107.799,2113.635,"Well, I don't know what affirmative misconduct would be, then."
1983.83-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2126.11,2129.662,"Yes, and breach of duty is ordinarily negligence."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2132.847,2135.066,The Government says they're immune.
1983.83-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.126,2229.945,"But the regulation doesn't require any mistake of fact to reopen, does it?"
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2235.348,2245.556,"Well, when you look back at Medicare there is no law in Medicare as Congress enacted it that said you had to offset any grants."
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2343.786,2346.319,"But it's still my money, isn't it?"
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2346.319,2347.438,--It's not the same money.
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2347.438,2349.84,I mean my tax money.
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2349.84,2356.76,"Well, the money that's in the Department of Labor is everybody's tax money, the corporations' and everybody's tax money."
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.76,2357.925,That's what I'm talking about.
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2357.925,2363.096,But the money in the Medicare are the specific beneficiaries.
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2366.615,2368.65,"Well, what we're interested in here is my money?"
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2368.65,2370.483,"Well, I think--"
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.483,2372.452,"We're interested in the tax money, aren't we."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2372.452,2374.285,"--Yes, we are."
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2386.779,2389.731,"What's the magic of the phrase ""seed money""?"
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2389.731,2392.949,--If we go back into the--
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2392.949,2394.933,Is it that you can just do whatever you want with it?
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2394.933,2395.768,--Pardon me?
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.768,2397.635,That you can just do whatever you want with it?
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2397.635,2400.802,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.043,2494.362,Don't be misled that I don't know what seed money means.
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2494.362,2495.164,Pardon me?
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.164,2501.751,Don't be misled by thinking I don't know what seed money... I just wanted to know what you say it means.
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2501.751,2505.27,"Well, I hope that our views are consistent."
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.27,2507.638,"Oh, not necessarily."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2507.638,2519.26,It was in fact treated as seed money by Community Health Services in the expansion of services for the community and for the Medicare beneficiaries.
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2532.686,2541.292,"Mr. Hasley, in the colloquy I think you may have overlooked that there was a question about whether Travelers is immune, and if so why are they immune."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2541.292,2541.775,Yes.
1983.83-56,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2571.994,2575.196,Have you accepted that or do you go ahead on your own?
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2575.196,2583.802,"We have raised that issue in this case, but Third Circuit did not reach these issues of Travelers because of the disposition on an estoppel grounds."
1983.83-56,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2608.437,2610.52,Have you instituted suit against Travelers and the answer was no?
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2610.52,2612.555,"That's part of this, that's part of this case."
1983.83-56,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2612.555,2613.907,You have?
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2613.907,2614.257,Yes.
1983.83-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2698.411,2702.046,"Well, what's the consensus in this Court?"
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2702.046,2712.585,"Well, as I read it would be estoppel may... in the affirmative misconduct situation."
1983.83-56,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2743.304,2749.108,"None of our cases, Mr. Hasley, suggests that the ordinary rules of estoppel do apply to the Government."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2756.031,2776.61,"Well, I guess this is a case where the issue will be addressed further as to whether it would be no estoppel against the Government in any circumstances, in which event the Government can literally destroy people like CHS, who have in good faith relied on it, and wipe them out."
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2776.61,2787.918,"I suppose you would agree, Mr. Hasley, that the meaning of a statute or a regulation is ultimately and finally for this Court, would you not?"
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2787.918,2789.352,"Yes, yes."
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2789.352,2806.696,"In the meantime, does your position not amount to saying that some clerk in some Government agency can reach a contrary conclusion and that that's binding until we set it aside?"
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2806.696,2810.415,"It would amount to that, Justice Burger."
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2818.771,2824.858,"That's one of the problems, the millions of employees who can make decisions from day to day."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2824.858,2825.408,Yes.
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.649,2840.953,"It's certainly a heavy burden in individuals, on citizens."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2849.975,2854.21,But we as lawyers know that's not a practical rule in today's society.
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2854.21,2857.412,"But it's still the rule, is it not, of the law?"
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2857.412,2858.212,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-56,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2871.12,2875.088,"Except as applied to the Government, generally."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2875.088,2909.661,"--Well, I can argue no more than that every circuit court in this country has looked at this issue in different factual contexts and, while they recognize the position of the sovereign and these distinctions and have acted with restraint, as this Court has on the problem, nonetheless could you really have an effective Constitution that did not guarantee the private sector the right of estoppel in some circumstances in some circumstances?"
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.826,2966.915,Do you believe that a Government officer can violate a rule on equitable principles?
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2966.915,2969.717,I think in some circumstances.
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.901,2972.235,"No, no."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2976.722,2987.811,--I think that he could do something that was inequitable and that the Government should be estopped from doing otherwise.
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.811,2990.03,"Well, you talk a lot about equity."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,2994.501,2997.369,Does the Government have clean hands?
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2998.886,3002.605,In your case does if it has dirty hands is it equity?
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,3002.605,3005.809,We contend that we have clean hands.
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3006.759,3015.33,"I mean, in your case you just said that where he's going to give this equitable relief to this person he knew better."
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,3015.33,3017.616,Maybe I misunderstood.
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3017.616,3030.94,"Well, if he deliberately violated a rule to do what he thought was right, would that excuse him and the Government?"
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,3030.94,3039.63,"Not if the other person was not privy or knowledgeable, if the other party would be totally innocent, and yes, I would bind the Federal Government in that case."
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3042.848,3046.7,How low down would that go in the governmental offices?
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,3055.139,3055.539,"No, no."
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3075.669,3076.269,What rule gives--
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,3076.269,3077.755,"--you know, reasonable scope of authority."
1983.83-56,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3077.755,3083.659,--What rule gives a federal employee that right to violate the rules?
1983.83-56,1,39557,raymond_g_hasley,,3089.813,3095.899,"I guess that's the argument, as to whether in this case he did or did not."
