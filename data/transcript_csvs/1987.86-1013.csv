1987.86-1013,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.356,"We'll hear for argument first this morning, Number 86-1013, Richard E. Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association."
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,13.141,18.009,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1013,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,145.709,150.796,Would that include the strip where the six-mile road would be built?
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,150.796,151.796,--Yes.
1987.86-1013,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,152.363,158.284,Within it are sites used by the Indians for their practices?
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,158.284,169.325,"--Your Honor, it's not clear from the record, I don't think, whether specific sites... I don't think that the report purported to document every exact site where a ritual is performed."
1987.86-1013,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,198.511,212.936,"No, but if actually the site included the site of the six-mile road, that might have a bearing, might it not, on the extent of the burden on their free exercise rights?"
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,212.936,217.388,"Well, Your Honor, as I said, from the Indians' point of view, I don't think they would distinguish in any way between the site."
1987.86-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,327.292,331.263,"Mr. Pincus, can I ask one factual question I was a little unclear on?"
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,335.215,343.904,"Well, it's the remaining unpaved segment that was left from the original when the entire road was unpaved, yes."
1987.86-1013,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.904,351.225,But is it possible today to drive from one... from the point of origin to the point of destination by just going over six or seven miles of unpaved road?
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,351.225,369.488,"Well, it's not because Congress designated after the District Court proceedings in this case, Congress designated a large segment of this area as a wilderness, and what the wilderness designation does is to close the area to traffic, and the site of the paved road was preempted from the wilderness designation."
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.29,374.99,I see.
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,379.827,380.444,No.
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.17,397.805,"Well, then, why couldn't a car drive today over the unpaved portion?"
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,397.805,399.24,"Well, the paved road--"
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.24,400.34,That's on a different location?
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,400.34,400.907,--It's on a different site.
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.907,401.859,I see.
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,401.859,416.952,"The route alternative that the Forest Service selected was actually farther away from the specific spiritual sites than the unpaved road was, and, so, it's a different site in that the site of the unpaved road is in the wilderness designation."
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.952,427.324,"Mr. Pincus, while you're interrupted, I think the courts below held that the Government had failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water Act."
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,427.324,428.241,"Yes, they did."
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.241,432.295,"Now, what about that?"
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,439.448,440.567,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,458.279,462.397,Are proceedings going forward to comply with those two acts?
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,462.397,467.301,"Well, the Forest Service internally is working to revise its plans to comply."
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.437,480.608,And how is it that the courts below dealt with the constitutional issue in view of the fact that they had these statutory ones to rely on?
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,480.608,487.798,"Well, Your Honor, I can't speak for them as to why they went ahead to reach... actually, the way they wrote their opinions--"
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,487.798,491.5,"So, do you think we should reach the constitutional issue, Mr. Pincus?"
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,491.5,502.122,"--Well, Your Honor, we think, as we said in our certiorari petition, we believe that we can comply and we have every intention of complying with the rulings on the statutory grounds and that, really, the only--"
1987.86-1013,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.122,511.212,"Well, should we just vacate the opinion and judgment below and say you've done enough when you decided the statutory issue?"
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,511.212,513.847,"--Well, Your Honor, that is one option for the Court."
1987.86-1013,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.049,595.651,"That timber cutting can no longer occur, though."
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,599.536,600.452,"Yes, Your Honor, to a large--"
1987.86-1013,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.452,601.136,When did that occur?
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,606.59,616.146,"--There are two administrative decisions before the Court, the road decision and then the separate decision to adopt the management plan that provided for cutting in this area of a forest."
1987.86-1013,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.119,644.213,"Well, maybe the District Court wouldn't have found the way it did concerning the degree of interference with the Indians' religious observance had it known that there was not going to be substantial logging operations in this area."
1987.86-1013,0,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,647.516,661.674,"Well, Your Honor, I think what the District Court said, really, was that anything that changed the area from its natural pristine state was an interference with the Indians' religious beliefs."
1987.86-1013,1,36287,marilyn_b_miles,,1601.25,1609.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1013,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.276,1678.817,"Does the record show, Ms. Miles, how many square miles or square feet there are involved or how long a trail in miles or yards of progression would be?"
1987.86-1013,1,36287,marilyn_b_miles,,1678.817,1682.852,--The Court... yeah.
1987.86-1013,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1693.91,1694.694,"May I ask, Ms. Miles?"
1987.86-1013,1,36287,marilyn_b_miles,,1704.634,1715.49,--What I am suggesting is that you have to look at where the government action is occurring and what conduct is it impacting.
1987.86-1013,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1715.49,1719.561,"Well, now, it's occurring, I gather, only at the six-mile strip, isn't it?"
1987.86-1013,1,36287,marilyn_b_miles,,1719.561,1719.877,Right.
1987.86-1013,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1719.877,1724.881,"But that's an invasion of the whole site or twenty-five miles, is it?"
1987.86-1013,1,36287,marilyn_b_miles,,1724.881,1725.865,Not necessarily.
1987.86-1013,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.642,1770.16,"Well, what is the area again?"
1987.86-1013,1,36287,marilyn_b_miles,,1774.898,1775.481,Yeah.
1987.86-1013,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3176.598,3179.117,"Just a few things, Your Honor."
1987.86-1013,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3246.826,3249.862,The Government still wants to go ahead with this road?
1987.86-1013,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3249.862,3250.678,"Yes, we do."
1987.86-1013,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3250.678,3251.228,Paving this road?
1987.86-1013,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3251.228,3252.064,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1987.86-1013,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3312.034,3312.984,May I ask one question?
1987.86-1013,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3318.605,3319.455,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1013,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3319.455,3326.894,"Will that statement contain any analysis of the extent, probable extent of use of the road and how much it will affect the environment?"
1987.86-1013,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3337.183,3341.053,"Well, Your Honor, as I said earlier, if the Court--"
1987.86-1013,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3341.053,3350.826,"I know you say it's okay with you, but I'm just wondering, to what extent may there actually be more enlightenment on this issue by the things that must be done before you can build the road anyway?"
1987.86-1013,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3350.826,3365.753,"--Well, Your Honor, there might be enlightenment, but it's really only... it will only be effective if those changes will cause the Indian believers to withdraw their claim because if they come into court and say notwithstanding the change, these effects still burden our religion, the District Court and this Court will have to accept that claim."
1987.86-1013,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3369.405,3370.821,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
