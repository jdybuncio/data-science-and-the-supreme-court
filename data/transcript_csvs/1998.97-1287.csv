1998.97-1287,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.367,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97 1287, Hughes Aircraft Company v. Stanley Jacobson."
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,10.619,14.191,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1287,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,49.585,53.016,"This is a defined benefit plan, Mr. Cappuccio?"
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,53.016,53.587,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1287,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,53.587,60.873,And your point is that they have received the benefits defined under the plan?
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,60.873,61.975,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1287,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,79.744,84.578,And I suppose under that plan there might be a deficit instead of a surplus.
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,84.578,88.421,"There certainly may well be, Your Honor."
1998.97-1287,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.3,94.275,"And the theory of the court below, if there were a deficit, would be what?"
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,94.275,114.047,"I think the theory of the court below would be that the employer would have to make up the difference, which is, in fact, how a defined benefits plan works, so I think what your question points out, Your Honor, is the theory of the court below in a sense creates a defined contribution plan with a defined benefits floor, which as Judge Easterbrook--"
1998.97-1287,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.047,120.602,Are these defined benefit plans becoming used less often in today's world?
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,125.334,126.937,"--I think they're still very much around, Your Honor."
1998.97-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.073,161.969,"If this were a voluntary plan, then would the employees be entitled to all the benefits?"
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,161.969,180.742,"--There is a provision in section 1054 of ERISA that provides if you are allowed to make voluntary contributions over and above the mandatory contributions, that you vest in those also, but here the contributions are mandatory."
1998.97-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,182.502,189.807,They're man... after the amendment they were not mandatory because you could go to the other side.
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,192.209,194.119,"--I would disagree, Justice Kennedy."
1998.97-1287,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.881,215.584,You had to make the election at one time and then you were... you couldn't reelect to go under the noncontributory--
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,215.584,217.185,"--I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,219.388,221.912,"--Mr. Cappuccio, did you mean to say, which plan you choose to be in?"
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,221.912,222.941,--I'm sorry.
1998.97-1287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,224.383,224.914,I see.
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,224.914,226.804,--Let me take that one on--
1998.97-1287,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,274.197,282.042,"Well, if you could change from the contributory to the noncontributory at any time, then it would look more like a voluntary plan."
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,282.042,290.988,"No, Your Honor, I don't think the fact that you could even... which is not this case, that you could switch back and forth, would make the contributions any less mandatory."
1998.97-1287,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.082,341.283,"Mr. Cappuccio, is this kind of amendment commonplace, or is it extraordinary, that you go from a contributory plan to one in which there are no contributions?"
1998.97-1287,0,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,341.283,343.445,"Justice Ginsburg, I think it's quite common."
1998.97-1287,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1003.314,1017.914,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1287,2,41576,seth_kupferberg,,1417.876,1422.59,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1287,3,37789,paul_t_cappuccio,,3165.68,3180.031,"Very briefly, Justice Breyer, our position of the Donovan line of cases is that first of all it's a court of appeals case, and it only speaks to the issue as to when a promise is sufficiently definite so that it becomes a plan and is covered by ERISA."
