1987.86-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,57.289,"Mr. Gary, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,57.289,60.521,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.588,111.064,"Mr. Gary, there seems to be some dispute between you and your opponents as to whether this particular conduct was criminal under the laws of Oregon."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,111.064,115.585,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, the conduct is criminal under Oregon."
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.287,153.212,"Well, but, the statute prohibits possession, not use, is that right?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,153.212,154.241,That's correct.
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.241,170.383,"And it is, I guess, theoretically possible that someone in a Native American church ceremony might have peyote buds administered to him rather than possessing it, is that right?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,170.383,192.095,"Your Honor, as I understand the practice, it would be difficult to have it administered without possessing, but, in any event, under Oregon law, the mere presence of an individual in the ceremony where the peyote is there would probably constitute sufficient possession of the drug to be criminal under Oregon law."
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.287,221.465,"Has the Oregon unemployment compensation law dealing with commission of crimes been satisfied in this case, either by the obtaining of a conviction of a felony or by the admission of it?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,221.465,230.561,"--No, and the Oregon Supreme Court correctly concluded that that was not the basis for disqualification of these claimants under state law."
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.209,242.379,The employer's policy.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,242.379,243.21,"--Yes, and--"
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.21,247.773,Willful misconduct of an employer rule or requirement.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,247.773,248.943,--That's correct.
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.943,268.157,"But the Oregon court went on apparently to find that the purpose of the Oregon unemployment compensation law did not include a purpose to enforce Oregon's criminal law, didn't it?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,268.157,269.437,"Your Honor,--"
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,269.437,283.227,"It seems to have determined as a matter of state law that the purpose is to protect the fund and to take care of the unemployment compensation policies, not the Oregon criminal law policies."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,283.227,283.875,--No.
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.298,311.164,"Well, it certainly isn't because the oregon court said, as I read its opinion, that its purpose, that the purpose of the Oregon law was to protect the fund."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,311.164,312.716,--No.
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.239,400.313,"You can't derive that from the face and text of the opinion, can you?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,400.313,400.753,No.
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.38,412.772,What is... say it again.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,414.402,434.524,"--The Oregon Court concluded that it was bound by this Court's decision in Sherbert to look only at the fiscal integrity of the fund as the state's interest, that it was prohibited to look at other compelling health and safety interests."
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.524,437.126,"So, you think that sentence, which reads"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,455.889,456.72,Yes.
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.72,461.212,"What they're saying is that under Sherbert, you have to find it within the state's--"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,461.212,462.364,Yes.
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.84,536.451,--Unless it's unconstitutional to render it criminal.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,536.451,537.363,Precisely.
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.971,752.113,"You can say the same thing about hospitals that have cocaine, I suppose."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,753.325,760.59,"--In Oregon, Your Honor, hospitals would not have cocaine because it's a Schedule 1 drug."
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.59,770.087,"--Well, pick some other narcotic that is generally illegal for traffic but is allowed to be used for some purposes."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,770.087,770.548,Yes.
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.768,773.11,Laudanum or whatever you want.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,773.11,781.895,"That's correct, and that problem is addressed because there is a conclusion that there are some safe uses for the drug and that it serves a purpose."
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,781.895,784.696,"Well, the purpose alleged here is a religious one."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,784.696,786.917,That's correct.
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,815.825,824.992,"Well, Mr. Gary, I'm still concerned because I'm not sure we even get to that question, unless we get over the initial hurdle that I asked you about."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,840.844,843.545,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,871.722,877.226,"Even when the Oregon Court, as a matter of state law, perhaps has refused to do it?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,877.226,883.911,"Well, if they refuse to do it as a matter of state law, then my burden is much heavier to carry."
1987.86-946,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.582,889.754,But we don't know that for sure.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,890.896,891.567,--No.
1987.86-946,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.959,1002.769,"Then, it seems to me you're suggesting that really the critical issue in the case that has to be decided is whether the conduct of using peyote in a Native American religious ceremony is constitutionally protected or not."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1009.054,1010.773,Yes.
1987.86-946,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.328,1042.645,"You say if there really is no free exercise right out there, then we don't even reach the problems of Sherbert and those cases, is that right?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1042.645,1044.578,That's precisely correct.
1987.86-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1046.667,1064.259,And do you read the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion as resting perhaps by implication on the proposition that the religious use of peyote cannot be punished or burdened by the state because of the federal free exercise clause?
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1064.259,1066.38,"--No, I don't."
1987.86-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.696,1114.722,"So, the Supreme Court of Oregon rested its decision on the federal free exercise clause, but not on the ground that you could not criminalize peyote?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1114.722,1117.083,That's correct.
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1140.989,1160.264,"Specifically, you think they read Sherbert xx requiring that whatever state interest exists in order to overcome the claim for an exemption or an unwritten exemption, whatever state interest exists must be reflected in the compensation statutes themselves?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1160.264,1161.326,That's correct.
1987.86-946,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.326,1163.256,Rather than just in some criminal law?
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1163.256,1163.927,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.039,1216.912,"Well, suppose there hadn't been any First Amendment issue at all, did the Oregon Supreme Court indicate that benefits should have in any event been granted in this case because the legality of the conduct was just irrelevant?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1216.912,1218.534,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.588,1232.482,And that was in the part of the opinion that dealt with Oregon law?
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1232.482,1233.173,That's correct.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.173,1234.313,The first part of the opinion?
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1234.313,1235.014,That's correct.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.014,1259.971,"So that the second part of the opinion where the Court says that the unemployment benefit, the Board, the Division concedes that the commission of an illegal act does not in itself disqualify, if that were true, why, you would think that they wouldn't have needed to get to any federal issue."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1259.971,1261.76,Yes.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.078,1307.271,"Because they did in the end rest their judgment on the free exercise clause, did they not?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1307.271,1308.121,Yes.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1360.146,1373.384,"Well, they said that aside from any federal law, this claimant would have lost, should have lost under state law."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1373.384,1374.426,Correct.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.426,1387.174,"But only because... not because the conduct was criminal, but because it was wholly incompatible with the employer's business."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1393.097,1393.816,Yes.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.226,1411.358,"Well, let me put it another way."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1436.776,1438.008,That's correct.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.207,1640.109,"Well, suppose this employee had worked for Harry and David and just used peyote in a religious ceremony and was fired because of that and the employee applied for unemployment compensation, he would have gotten that."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1640.109,1653.856,"If the conduct was not job-related, they would get unemployment benefits, but the reason for that, Your Honor, is because, as I indicated, Federal Unemployment Tax Act limits our inquiry to job-related conduct."
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1653.856,1655.038,All right.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1666.075,1668.806,Sherbert v. Verner.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.848,1672.439,Under state law.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1672.439,1681.164,It would have been as a matter of state law because the misconduct must be job-related in order for anyone to be disqualified.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.164,1696.115,"Well, isn't that essentially what happened in the... here in this case, when the Court was talking about Oregon law?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1707.572,1709.024,Yes.
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.655,1712.837,And the fact it was criminal had nothing we do with it.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1712.837,1720.28,"Yes, but even the rule that is cited in the Respondent's brief relating to disqualification--"
1987.86-946,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.28,1742.904,"Well, how can you really argue that although criminal conduct is not enough to deny compensation for, it, nevertheless, can be relied on to overcome a free exercise claim?"
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1742.904,1744.186,--For two reasons.
1987.86-946,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1769.131,1772.294,I'm not sure I understand why that's a second reason.
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1777.239,1779.149,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-946,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1786.733,1801.953,"If you had a statutory exemption from the prohibition on drug use for this particular... for religious use of peyote, then it seems to me one could argue that the conduct was constitutionally protected and the regulatory interest would fall by the way side."
1987.86-946,0,44824,william_f_gary,,1805.265,1810.15,"--If there were an exemption from the state criminal law, then I think you're correct."
1987.86-946,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.57,1828.35,"Thank you, Mr. Gary."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,1830.253,1836.107,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.831,1861.242,"Ms. Lovendahl, you say that's been your position all along."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,1879.935,1888.049,"Well, in my brief in opposition, I said that the state law correctly applied to principles in the context of the state... the state court applied them in the context of the state law."
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.049,1890.33,You had two points.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,1906.162,1907.064,"Well,--"
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.064,1908.163,It's just not there.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,1908.163,1913.638,"--I was responding to the way that they had done their issues, but within that response was the assumption that that was a state law issue."
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.638,1931.159,"Well, I would have thought that the reason they did their issues that way is that the sentence you're relying upon, to wit the state's interest in denying employment benefits must be found in the unemployment compensation statutes, that is two sentences away from the lead sentence of the paragraph, which reads:"
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,1972.697,1982.241,"The decision, though, that the interest had to be found on the state unemployment compensation statutes was a decision, they were interpreting the state law."
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.241,1995.371,"Yes, but the... I thought your argument was that given that interpretation of state law, there's just no really substantial federal question because it's so clear that Sherbert governs it."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,1995.371,1996.47,Correct.
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1996.47,2002.994,But that's still a federal... that still leaves the decision below resting on the federal ground.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2002.994,2007.107,It rests on a federal ground in that it was controlled by Sherbert and Thomas.
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.989,2011.4,"So, you really don't say that the case went off on a state ground?"
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2011.4,2011.97,No.
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.045,2017.244,"Yes, yes."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2017.244,2018.205,Rather than it was not decided--
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.205,2021.858,"Given that interpretation of the state law, the federal issue is perfectly clear."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2021.858,2023.067,--Exactly.
1987.86-946,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.002,2064.545,"Well, I guess they say they would have been denied benefits on the grounds of employee misconduct."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2064.545,2065.156,Right.
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2197.652,2205.478,"May I ask you right there on that question, of course, it's more than labelling it, I suppose they do have a statute that makes it a crime to use certain drugs."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2213.091,2216.915,"--Well, I think that that balancing test has to be applied."
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2218.886,2234.808,"But if you apply the balancing test, do you end up with... in order to prevail, is it not correct that you must submit that your clients had a constitutional right to make... to use peyote in their religious ceremonies, that the state could not interfere with that right?"
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2234.808,2239.65,"Well, our position is that if you xx to look at the statute at issue that's imposing the burden."
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.753,2256.099,"Well, it's relevant if you say that the state may enforce a neutral law that prohibits all drug use xx that that is religiously motivated."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2263.385,2263.816,Right.
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.484,2310.757,"Yes, but the difference that I don't think you're really confronting is the fact that there's really no dispute that in the Sherbert and Hobbie and Thomas cases, the conduct that was... that caused the discharge was conduct that they had a constitutional right to engage in."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2318.05,2319.062,"--Yes, and in--"
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.062,2323.455,And don't you have to convince us that they did have a constitutional right in order to prevail?
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2323.455,2331.259,"--No, I don't think we do, because I feel that that's the problem with their argument, is that they can't boot strap another statute."
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.91,2337.243,"If you don't have such a federally protected right, I don't see that there's even a federal question in the case."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2337.243,2353.674,"--Well, there would be if that issue could be decided, but under the state unemployment statute, the interest to be served by that statute is to protect involuntarily unemployed workers, and I think the question in this case really is would that interest be thwarted by giving unemployment benefits--"
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.674,2382.022,"Yes, but the Court ruled that under Oregon law, there was... these benefits were properly denied, and the claim then was, well, yes, but the first... the free exercise clause forbids you to deny benefits in this case, even though to every other employee that engaged in misconduct, benefits would be denied."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2391.878,2395.612,"--Well, the fact is that other people who want to argue this--"
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.612,2401.324,"Well, let me just ask you, do you think there is a free exercise clause right to engage in criminal conduct?"
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2401.324,2407.399,"--Well, it's our position that this particular religious practice is protected, and we've argued that in our brief."
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.399,2412.822,"Well, I think you have to convince us of that."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2424.67,2435.629,"Well, not to use drugs, but in terms of whether the conduct is criminal or not, in Wisconsin v. Yoder, the Court made clear that you still have to go through the entire balancing test."
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.554,2458.973,I read the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion as reciting without any criticism the fact that the Oregon Court of Appeals had held that religious use of peyote are not exempt from criminal sanctions in Oregon.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2464.296,2464.797,--Right.
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.797,2469.67,And they don't seem to take any exception.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2471.042,2475.824,"Well, because that wasn't the issue before them and that was why they didn't address it."
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.915,2482.649,But is it part of your submission here that this wasn't criminal conduct under Oregon law at all?
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2484.349,2493.725,"--Well, our position is that there would be no distinction between this case at all, if the conduct... if it was clear that this conduct was constitutionally protected."
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.372,2516.31,"--I understand that argument, but are you asking us to affirm on another ground, namely that this conduct wasn't criminal under Oregon law anyway?"
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2516.31,2520.794,"--Well, we don't really feel that that's an issue that has to be decided in this case."
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2520.794,2521.215,All right.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2521.933,2522.444,No.
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.444,2523.005,All right.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2543.057,2544.368,Job-related drug use?
1987.86-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2545.079,2545.338,Yes.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2553.805,2557.176,"Well, let me correct myself to your last question, though."
1987.86-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2573.558,2579.671,That they didn't smoke the stuff or whatever you do with it voluntarily?
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2579.671,2583.225,It was in response to a dictate of their religion.
1987.86-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2593.28,2600.065,"Yes, but in Sherbert and Thomas, there was no question but what the conduct engaged in was perfectly lawful."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2600.065,2615.135,"--That's correct, and that's the question in this case, is does that have an effect or not, and our position is that you look to the state law and if, under the state law, that's not an interest to be served by that particular legislation, then it has no bearing."
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.135,2621.139,Is that a question of federal law or state law whether you look to the state law?
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2668.971,2669.75,Yeah.
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.75,2674.243,"Can you say as a matter of state law, it's irrelevant for Sherbert and Thomas or is that a question of federal law?"
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2674.243,2690.363,"Well, what they did was they were deciding how to consider the legality and decided that it was irrelevant and then went on and did their balancing, but under state law, it wasn't anything that could be considered because the legality wasn't relevant, and--"
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.363,2691.425,What do you mean under state law?
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2695.097,2707.236,--My reading of that portion of the opinion was that they looked to the legality before they did the balancing test to see whether it should be considered or not.
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2726.688,2734.792,Determine the state law issue and it was conceded that it was a violation under state law.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2743.09,2752.774,The state law portion of it was that they interpreted their Constitution more restrictively than the federal Constitution has determined.
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.832,2939.887,"Well, is it necessary for the state's case in order to refute the necessity... the constitutional necessity for an exception to their unemployment scheme, is it necessary for them to show that this particular conduct would have been unconstitutional or isn't it enough to show that there is a general state policy against the use of drugs?"
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2955.268,2963.993,"Well, in Wisconsin v. Yoder, this Court found that the interest should be weighed where the state's interest in enforcing that law against this particular religious group."
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.097,2971.197,I'm not quarreling about the weighing argument.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,2978.271,2979.143,Right.
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.113,2995.673,I'm saying I don't see how that's relevant.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3000.976,3004.469,Right.
1987.86-946,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.469,3006.592,Against the possession.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3010.944,3011.605,Right.
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3061.928,3078.389,"Even so, I take it that the Oregon Supreme Court essentially held that whether the conduct is criminal is irrelevant to determining the free exercise clause, and I guess that that's your submission, too."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3078.389,3079.018,--Right.
1987.86-946,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3079.018,3090.886,"And if we disagree with you, I would think we could disagree with the Oregon Supreme Court's conclusion that it is irrelevant and send it back."
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3099.612,3100.393,Right.
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.886,3156.279,May I ask another question?
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3165.125,3168.768,The Native American Church practice conduct?
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.768,3169.318,Yes.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3174.201,3179.153,"Well, in the Soto case, I believe that was disposed of under the federal Constitution."
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.508,3190.412,You have to help me a little more.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3192.473,3195.435,--That the individual could not even raise the defense.
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.435,3196.006,The what?
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3196.006,3200.899,The individual who was charged with the possession could not even raise the religious freedom defense.
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3203.891,3206.752,They implicitly held that it was not constitutionally protected.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3206.752,3208.004,--Right.
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.008,3221.613,But the reason they couldn't... was it a procedural reason or because there's no constitutional protection for the use of peyote?
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3221.613,3229.466,They just considered that the fact that it was made criminal under state law was sufficient to over-ride the individual's claim.
1987.86-946,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.466,3230.738,As regard to state law.
1987.86-946,1,41667,suanne_lovendahl,,3230.738,3240.803,"Yeah, and there was a strongly worded dissent in that case, essentially to the effect that the Court was abdicating its responsibility as final arbiter of constitutional rights."
1987.86-946,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3411.507,3414.599,"Thank you, Ms. Lovendahl."
1987.86-946,2,44824,william_f_gary,,3482.274,3419.321,Thank you.
1987.86-946,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3483.165,3485.636,"Thank you, Mr. Gary."
