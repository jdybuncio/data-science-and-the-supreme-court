1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,61.99,"Mr. Elrod, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,61.99,67.692,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,224.894,243.438,"Had he... does the record show to what extent, if any, he had passed these notions and ideas and his recommendations on up through channels before he went public?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,243.438,265.971,"The record reflects in a truncated fashion, since this comes up from summary judgment, the record reflects that the petitioner made some efforts within the organization through his representative in the manpower office to obtain some alleviation as to his personal problem."
1982.81-469,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.599,314.534,"It was perceived by... perceived by whom, Mr. Elrod?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,314.534,322.157,--By the what was then called the Appeals Review Board of what was then called the Civil Service Commission.
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,474.272,475.39,Mr. Elrod.
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,475.39,476.64,"--Yes, ma'am."
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.64,499.59,"I suppose it's your position on behalf of Mr. Bush that what was lacking here was a right to obtain compensatory damages for embarrassment or anxiety resulting from the demotion, and the failure to have a means of getting punitive damages and attorney's fees."
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,500.123,501.625,In damage terms--
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,501.625,506.677,Those are the elements that are lacking in the Civil Service remedies?
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,506.677,508.279,--It is--
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.279,519.253,And is it your position then that denying Mr. Bush the right to get those elements of damages violates the Constitution?
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,519.253,530.542,"--It is my position that it would, although I am speaking to a judicial tribunal, that it would be an invidious kind of distinction."
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,530.542,534.096,"Well, would it violate the Constitution--"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,534.096,534.963,"Yes, ma'am, I think it would."
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,534.963,536.596,--to... and what provision of the Constitution?
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,536.596,584.196,"I did not... it would... it would, in my judgment, and I realize that I am venturing where in... rushing in where some people fear to tread... in my judgment, a decision that the denial of the dignitary elements of a government employee's claim in a Bivens-type suit otherwise well grounded, assuming that, of course, as we will upon summary judgment, that denying him that would be denying a discrete isolated group of people the same protection of the law that the citizenry at large has."
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,584.196,586.062,An equal protection clause--
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,586.062,588.231,Access of courts--
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,588.231,588.914,--violation?
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,588.914,595.217,--whether it be viewed as part of equal protection or as an extension of freedom of expression.
1982.81-469,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.978,645.167,"Well, if a government... a government employee who was beat up or unreasonably searched by FBI people would certainly have a Bivens claim."
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,645.167,651.304,"Yes, sir, he would, and he would not be covered by any Civil Service act that I know of."
1982.81-469,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.304,659.244,"No, because the Civil Service doesn't purport to regulate... the Civil Service doesn't purport to regulate that relationship."
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,669.616,673.937,That act... that argument has certainly served as plausibility.
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,776.837,796.981,"Well, your position necessarily means, I take it, that in unlawful discharges or demotions or failure to get a promotion that was due, the Civil Service remedy enacted by Congress is not the exclusive remedy?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,796.981,800.35,It is unless it's constitutional deprivation bar.
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.35,801.535,Unless what?
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,801.535,815.343,"Unless the promotion... the adverse action, as they used to call it, I think we call it unwarranted or unjustified now... unless the adverse action is unconstitutional, the Bivens... there is no Bivens remedy, of course."
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,819.413,821.747,"Bivens had nothing to do with an employee of the government, did it?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,821.747,822.449,Sir?
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,822.449,829.619,"The Bivens remedy, as defined in the Bivens case, was not a remedy for government employees, was it?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,829.619,839.975,"As... in the Bivens case it was a remedy for Webster Bivens, who as the Court perceived, or a majority of the Court, no other remedy that was made."
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,865.773,869.141,"A citizen... a citizen who was not an employee, however."
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,869.808,878.581,"--So far as I know, this is the... the first employee case to reach this Court with a... where a government employee was asserting a Bivens-type claim."
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,878.581,888.352,"Well, he might... the government employee might, as Justice Rehnquist suggests, have a Bivens-type claim in some circumstances."
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,899.16,906.398,"Well, with some deference, I suggest that I have failed adequately to state what we are complaining about."
1982.81-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,976.808,986.782,"Mr. Elrod, in the Bivens case, following up on the Chief Justice's question, there was no other remedy available to Bivens, was there?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,986.782,999.34,"There... arguably, the New York remedy as tort law remedies were rather meaningless, and of course, the--"
1982.81-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,999.34,1004.328,"Well, you realize that my next question is going to be that this one wasn't remedyless?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1004.328,1006.028,--He had... he had--
1982.81-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1006.028,1007.362,You had a remedy in your case.
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1007.362,1008.88,--He had a remedy.
1982.81-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1010.581,1012.197,"Well, how do you say this is a Bivens case?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1014.099,1015.016,"--Well, in Carlson--"
1982.81-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1015.016,1016.318,Your case has two remedies.
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1016.318,1034.697,"--In Carlson, Mr. Justice Marshall, in Carlson against Green, the first issue assumed that the allegations of the complaint would support an action under the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1982.81-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1058.312,1064.466,"Well, why do you say it's a Bivens-type case?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1064.466,1067.918,Because it's directly under the Constitution--
1982.81-469,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1067.918,1069.168,"You're relying on another case, not Bivens."
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1069.168,1071.87,"--Well, Bivens is an extension of Carlson."
1982.81-469,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1095.151,1108.578,"Mr. Elrod, I suppose one could say that there are some advantages in going the Bivens route, if you have it, over the administrative route."
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1116.749,1118.534,"Eminently so, sir."
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1128.957,1135.312,"--Now, did he recover some $30,000 in back pay before he was reinstated?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1135.312,1144.668,"At the time of his reinstatement under the Back Pay Act, as amended, he received full pay."
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1144.668,1149.453,"And that amounted to some $30,000?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1149.453,1150.572,"Some $30,000."
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1186.226,1212.977,"On your theory, is it not true that a great, great number of employee discharges or failures to get promotions or tenure or whatever in government might well be open to both the Civil Service remedy and the remedy that you are seeking here?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1243.579,1245.365,On paper.
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1266.861,1288.627,"Well, in 1883, if that was the year when Congress created what we now call the Civil Service System, was not the purpose of providing a remedy that would be inexpensive and fair and not put him... put the employee to going into the courts?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1288.627,1294.78,I don't read anything in the Pendleton Act that has anything to do with remedies.
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1327.585,1330.37,"Prior to that... prior to that there was no real remedy at all, was there?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1330.37,1333.572,"Initially, it was hard to tort, insofar as... in remedial terms."
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1527.178,1554.181,"Mr. Elrod, do you suppose Congress could expressly adopt remedies saying that they intended to provide a cause of action here that would be a substitute for Bivens but a cause of action that would not grant punitive damages or attorney's fees?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1554.181,1554.964,"Yes, ma'am."
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1554.964,1555.714,Would that be all right?
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1555.714,1556.797,I have to--
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.797,1562.034,So it isn't a constitutional requirement thing that these remedies be provided.
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1562.034,1570.288,--It's a constitutional requirement that all litigant assemblies situated receive similar treatment.
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1570.288,1576.109,So Congress couldn't provide something otherwise even if it expressly intended to do so?
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1576.109,1580.412,"It could limit it to government employees, in my judgment."
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1580.412,1581.429,Congress could not--
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1581.429,1582.614,Without some demonstration--
1982.81-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.614,1587.649,"--expressly limit a remedy to government employees, in your view, under the Constitution?"
1982.81-469,0,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,1587.649,1604.961,--Not... and not in view of the careful treatment which this Court has given similar problems in such cases as CSC against Letter Carriers and in BMW against Mitchell where it has searched and strained and required experiential empirical data to justify the restriction.
1982.81-469,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1604.961,1609.329,Mr. Geller.
1982.81-469,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1609.329,1615.083,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.426,1892.442,What ground did the Court of Appeals go on?
1982.81-469,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1892.442,1908.637,"The Court of Appeals focused on the... on the second ground, the counseling hesitation, although in the course of it it described the very comprehensive Civil Service remedies that... that the... that federal employees have... have available to it."
1982.81-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.326,1926.182,So they didn't... they didn't come out with the ultimate conclusion that you suggest in your first argument that Congress intended the remedy provided to be exclusive?
1982.81-469,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1926.182,1935.038,"Well, they didn't in those terms, Justice White, but both questions are really designed to answer the same question, which is: What is the intent of Congress?"
1982.81-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.988,1938.407,"So you are just presenting one ground, not--"
1982.81-469,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1938.407,1958.736,"--We rely on both grounds here, although we think that the... the way to analyze this case is to look and see as the court did in Bivens and Davis and in Carlson whether there was some other adequate remedy available to the claimant, and if there is, and if Congress intended that remedy to be exclusive, that's really the end of the judicial inquiry."
1982.81-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.736,1969.442,"--Well, if we disagree with that, if we didn't embrace the Court of Appeals' rationale, you nevertheless suggest we affirm on--"
1982.81-469,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1969.442,1970.294,"Absolutely, yes."
1982.81-469,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.994,1971.778,--the ground you present?
1982.81-469,1,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1971.778,1972.294,--Yes.
1982.81-469,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2286.9,2290.102,Thank you.
1982.81-469,2,44605,william_harvey_elrod,,2294.638,2328.061,May I submit to the Court a close and careful collation of the legislative materials which the government itself cites in this case will not disclose that Congress has ever done more in the area of remedies for the type of grievance that Mr. Bush has than it did for the type of grievance that Mrs. Green had in Carlson against Green.
1982.81-469,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2362.532,2364.317,"Thank you, gentlemen."
