2018.17-1672,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.36,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-1672, the United States versus Haymond. Mr. Feigin."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,7.36,26.56,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There's no dispute that the district judge's finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent possessed child pornography was constitutionally sufficient to revoke his supervised release and reimprison him under Section 3583(e)(3)."
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,28.6,39.12,Is there any other area of the law in which we permit imprisonment by a preponderance of the evidence?
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,39.12,43.68,"Well, Your Honor, there is -- there are areas where -- I mean --"
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,43.68,44.16,Whether it's a jury --
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,44.16,46.0,-- that are precisely analogous to this --
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,46.0,46.36,Right.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,46.36,48.92,"-- for example, parole and probation revocation."
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,48.92,61.64,"Well, in parole, the original sentence was already X number of years, and the state granted a benefit and said, instead of serving 10 years, we'll let you serve eight if you behave."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,77.76,78.16,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,78.16,79.8,On a preponderance of the evidence?
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,79.8,99.16,"-- there was no jail for an additional period of time here. Petitioner's original sentence, which was authorized by the jury's verdict, included a 10-year period of supervised release, which is precisely analogous to a 10-year term of automatic parole. His reimprisonment upon revocation of his supervised release was only five years, which was --"
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,99.16,99.88,"Well, that's the facts of --"
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,99.88,100.92,-- less than the 10-year --
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,100.92,106.24,That's -- that's almost like harmless error argument.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,116.0,118.4,"Your -- Your Honor, it does not extend further than his original sentence."
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.36,121.12,"Well, his jail sentence does."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,121.12,123.0,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,152.96,153.76,But we're still back to the same --
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,153.76,154.56,-- are precisely analogous.
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,154.56,162.8,"We're still -- no, it's not quite, because he was sentenced originally to the 38 months, not to another term of jail."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,176.48,181.24,"Your Honor, I don't think we have any more than would be true under a parole system."
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,181.24,184.64,But you're trying to mix -- to compare apples and oranges.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,204.92,208.36,"Well, let me say two things about that, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,221.84,224.32,"Well, let -- let's talk about this."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,250.04,253.0,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I'd need to know a little bit more about --"
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.0,255.08,Not a charged crime; it's just an act.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,256.6,268.52,"So, Your Honor, if your question is can a judge impose a sentence that says you'll, for example, spend five years in prison and then there will be some period after that during which if you -- a judge finds if you commit a certain act --"
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,268.52,270.16,"No, no, no."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,297.16,298.24,That's right.
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,298.24,319.84,"I'm trying to figure out why a judge now gets to say, after you've been sentenced to the five years, instead of five years for the original crime, I'm going to find by a preponderance of the evidence, after you've been sentenced to the five years, that we really should have given you eight years."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,319.84,319.92,"Well, Your --"
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,319.92,328.76,"Because you've now committed a new crime or a new -- not a new crime, but a new -- well, a new crime or a new act, whatever that act may be."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,328.76,331.84,"Your Honor, and that's not what's happening here."
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,348.08,348.88,"You know, if it looks like --"
2018.17-1672,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,348.88,352.48,"Mr. Feigin, I -- I'd like to understand what question we are deciding here."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,366.76,367.4,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-1672,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,368.36,370.72,Is Mr. -- is Mr. Lunn making that argument?
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,370.72,382.36,"No, Your Honor, and, in fact, I don't think that issue's properly before the Court because the relief he sought in the court of appeals and the relief the court of appeals granted was reimprisonment under Section 3583(e)(3)."
2018.17-1672,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,395.84,414.48,"But what about the fact that, without finding that he committed a violation of 3583(k), without that, the minimum term of imprisonment -- the minimum term would be zero years, but, with that factual finding, it becomes five years?"
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,414.48,436.96,"Well, let -- let me say a few things about that. First of all, the Court held in Morrissey that these kinds of sentence administration proceedings, where what the judge is looking at is whether there was a violation of the terms of the sentence, is a proceeding to which the Sixth Amendment doesn't apply. So Apprendi is a Sixth Amendment-based rule, and, therefore, it doesn't apply by its terms in the circumstance."
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,436.96,448.48,"Would that be true if, instead of a five-year minimum, the minimum sentence was a sentence of death? Would the government take the position that the Sixth Amendment doesn't apply there either?"
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,448.48,451.48,"Your Honor, I think, first of all, there might be some Eighth Amendment -- particularized Eighth Amendment concerns."
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,451.48,454.56,"I didn't ask about an Eighth Amendment question, Mr. Feigin."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,456.68,473.16,"So, assuming that the original sentence that was imposed, that had the death condition on it for certain violations, didn't itself violate the Eighth Amendment, I don't think there would be a -- necessarily a Sixth Amendment problem with this -- with this proceeding."
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,473.16,475.56,"I think that has to be your answer, right? Yeah."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,475.56,475.72,Yeah.
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,481.92,483.52,Can I ask you this --
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,483.52,485.36,The second --
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,485.36,486.12,-- issue.
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.8,492.44,-- and so -- so I thought that it says this --
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,492.44,494.68,"We're fine if you stick with that, Justice Breyer. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,494.68,495.2,All right.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,531.88,535.96,"Well, there's an exception, Your Honor, for the fact of a prior conviction."
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,536.92,537.4,"Yeah, all right."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,539.32,540.52,And I -- I think one thing that this case --
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,540.52,542.24,Forget the exception. I wrote that one.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,542.24,551.6,"-- points up is that Apprendi only applies in a context -- because the Sixth Amendment-based rule, under the text of the Sixth Amendment, it only applies in the context of a criminal prosecution. One thing --"
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,551.6,551.88,All right.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,628.96,640.6,"Well, Your Honor, that argument was raised in the court of appeals and even the court of appeals rejected it because the 10-year maximum is only for one part of the sentence for the original term of imprisonment. There's also a separate --"
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,640.6,640.84,"Yeah, yeah."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,640.84,642.44,-- portion of the sentence for supervised release.
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,642.44,643.12,Correct.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,643.4,648.88,"And the sentence -- let me just preface this by saying, even if you thought that was the rule, we should --"
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,648.88,649.04,Yeah.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,649.04,655.68,"-- win because he spent 38 years -- 38 months, excuse me, in prison on his original sentence, and the reimprisonment term is only 60 months."
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.68,656.24,"Well, that -- that might be."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,656.64,658.6,So we're only at 98 months at that point.
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,658.6,659.28,Maybe you should.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,659.28,659.56,But I --
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.56,661.84,But I want to know the answer to my question.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,696.72,701.0,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that's the right way to think about it. And that's not even the argument they're making."
2018.17-1672,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.04,703.48,That's true.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,703.48,717.44,"And that's because, I think, they recognize, consistent with this Court's decision in Morrissey against Brewer, which addressed the parole context, and it was reiterated in Gagnon against Scarpelli, which addressed the probation context. There are multiple parts to this sentence."
2018.17-1672,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,721.92,760.8,"Mr. Feigin, you keep talking about the parole cases, but the parole cases are cases that are very different from Justice Breyer's hypothetical because, by definition, in parole, you cannot serve longer than your original sentence. So you never get to the question in the parole cases that Justice Breyer is asking you about, which is whether, once the judge-made finding takes you above the original authorized sentence, it creates an Apprendi problem. Isn't that right? Isn't that the difference between parole cases, is that you can never get into this problem of -- of serving longer than the original authorized sentence?"
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,760.8,763.56,"Well, two -- two things, Justice Kagan."
2018.17-1672,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,780.36,805.48,"Well, that just incorporates a different argument about how the supervised release is baked into the original sentence. But I'm talking about in normal terms. People think: Oh, this statute authorizes a punishment of up to 10 years. Now what Justice Breyer is saying is now maybe somebody -- it might not be this person -- but somebody is serving 12 years instead because of a judge-made finding."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,838.76,841.92,"Your Honor, I don't think this is a longer sentence than was originally authorized."
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,859.64,871.68,"Well, counsel, Congress thought there was a difference, right? I mean, we had parole systems previously, probation systems previously, and Congress chose to abandon that system."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,886.48,887.04,"Well, Your Honor --"
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,887.04,890.32,"It would be a rather simple thing to convene a jury, wouldn't it?"
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,890.32,896.04,"We don't think it would be simple to convene a jury, although that would be a better remedy than facially striking down the statute."
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,900.68,901.28,And historically --
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,901.28,902.76,-- sentence administration context.
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,902.76,905.0,-- there's never been this kind of system before.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,919.0,935.04,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, we are relying on this Court's decisions in Morrissey and in Gagnon that make clear that there can be reimprisonment for a violation of conditions of a previously imposed sentence that was authorized by the jury's verdict. They don't even dispute that."
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,935.12,935.4,Maybe -- maybe we'll put it --
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,935.4,937.08,-- for reasons I've explained to Justice Alito --
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,937.08,938.24,"I mean, we're just talking."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,949.84,952.36,It doesn't have any consequence that's relevant here.
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,952.36,953.12,Okay.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,957.12,959.96,"Well, it would depend how you disagreed with me, Your Honor. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,959.96,964.36,"If you disagree with me such that you think that Respondent here had a jury trial right, then I --"
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,964.36,965.76,But they're not the same thing.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,965.76,966.0,Yeah.
2018.17-1672,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,966.0,978.76,"They are different. The Congress, when it bothered to revamp sentencing in this country radically, it actually intended to and accomplished something, as opposed to doing, effectively, nothing."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,978.76,994.32,"So, Your Honor, one way in which I think supervised release is different -- and this gets back to Justice Kagan's question -- is that there is a way under the supervised release statute for the term of reimprisonment to exceed even the period of conditional liberty that's represented by the supervised release itself. And let me suggest --"
2018.17-1672,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,994.32,1040.52,"Well, that -- that's an interesting -- it's an interesting question and I -- I think it's a hard one, and it's not briefed, and I -- I just don't -- I'm having enough trouble with what I understood to be the issue presented by this case without deciding whether we should overrule an enormous amount of precedent and wipe out probation and parole or decide this novel question which isn't presented here. It -- it -- Mr. -- Mr. Haymond has to make an -- an as-applied challenge to the part of the statute to which he objects, and he -- his -- he is not in this situation, where he is required -- he's required to serve a term of imprisonment that exceeds the statutory maximum."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1040.52,1042.36,"That's right, Your Honor. And I think that would be --"
2018.17-1672,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1042.36,1045.08,He's certainly in the situation of the mandatory minimum.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1046.16,1089.84,"So let me say a few things about the -- about that, Your Honor. The first thing I would say is, again, because this is a context in which the Sixth Amendment doesn't apply, I don't think Apprendi would by its own force apply. The second thing is that the jury's verdict authorizes reimprisonment under (k) just the same as the conceded authorization of reimprisonment under (e)(3). The third thing I would say is that what they're really asking for here, even if Apprendi applied, is a bespoke application of the Apprendi rule. Apprendi does not say that if you are subject to a heightened sentencing range that you are entitled to an even higher standard of proof than would apply to other kinds of fact findings."
2018.17-1672,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1121.44,1122.04,Could I go to your --
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1122.04,1123.6,The only difference is the legal consequence.
2018.17-1672,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1124.52,1134.8,"-- what I think was number two on your list, which is, well, the jury found this and the jury's finding includes whatever (k) allows and, therefore, there's a -- I mean, that's kind of a, like, bitter with the sweet argument."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1157.36,1168.48,"Well, Your Honor, there -- there may be limits, but there -- they concede in their brief that the jury's verdict authorized reimprisonment under (e)(3) based on a judicial finding by a preponderance of the evidence."
2018.17-1672,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1178.4,1180.04,"No, but I'm -- I'm not sure that's responsive."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1196.8,1199.4,"No, Your Honor, and that -- that's -- that's not our argument."
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1218.8,1223.64,"Mr. Feigin, I -- I have, I guess, a fundamental problem."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1315.92,1330.84,"Well, Your Honor, as a due process matter, that's exactly the issue that was facing the Court in Morrissey against Brewer in the parole context, where someone who's on parole for life could potentially be reimprisoned for life, and the Court set out some minimum due process --"
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1330.84,1331.56,But we -- we've already talked --
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1331.56,1332.48,-- protections that were provided here.
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1332.48,1334.76,-- about the differences between parole and this.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1363.12,1384.68,"So, Your Honor, let me explain a few reasons why you shouldn't consider this a new criminal prosecution. First, it arises in the context of active supervision by probation officers. They're not simply reacting to arrests. They're going out and supervising and trying to reintegrate these defendants into the community. Second, the revocation proceedings are initiated by probation officers, not by prosecutors."
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1409.04,1411.52,But I don't see how a minimum can be anything but.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1411.52,1412.08,Your Honor --
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1412.08,1435.64,"Because, here, the judge very clearly -- the judge and the court of appeals very clearly said that if this had been a crime that would be determined beyond a reasonable doubt, they don't think the government could win. And the judge even said that he thought the sentence was inappropriate to the nature of the allegations and proof in this case."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1435.64,1450.96,"Well, Your Honor, the question -- the -- the guidelines themselves adopt this philosophy that in sanctioning the violation of supervised release, there -- it goes on a breach of trust theory. So what you're trying to do is to deter violation --"
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1450.96,1472.96,"But how does -- how does a mandatory minimum, the Alleyne problem, where we said that really should be determined by a jury, not a judge, how does a mandatory minimum deal with a breach of trust? Once you've tied a judge's hands in the sentence, then how does that promote --"
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1472.96,1475.04,So the Court has -- the Court has addressed --
2018.17-1672,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1475.04,1483.6,"-- the respect for the breach of trust? If the judge doesn't believe that's the right sentence, why would that promote the needs of the community?"
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1483.6,1496.12,"Well, I think Congress should have some leeway to decide that these are particularly egregious types of breaches of trust by defendants as to whom it's particularly concerned that, when they get back into the community, will commit crimes that resemble their previous crimes that are harmful --"
2018.17-1672,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1496.12,1497.24,"Well, but the question is where --"
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1497.24,1497.84,-- to the population.
2018.17-1672,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1497.84,1505.8,-- where Congress's leeway stops because the Constitution kicks in. And that's what we've talked about in Apprendi and then in Alleyne.
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1557.48,1595.8,"So, Your Honor, let me just very quickly, before I reserve the remainder of my time, address the -- the mandatory nature of this, which this Court has also addressed in the parole context. If you look at Black against Romano, which is cited in our briefs, this Court has recognized that, in some circumstances, but it depends on the facts and circumstances, a defendant might be able to claim that the mandatory revocation of a period of conditional liberty is a substantive constitutional violation. And the Court, in fact, found one, such a violation in Bearden against Georgia, where there was mandatory revocation of probation based on the failure of a defendant to pay fines that he just didn't have the means to pay."
2018.17-1672,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1595.8,1596.36,But revocation --
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1596.36,1597.72,So we're a far cry from that here.
2018.17-1672,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1597.72,1608.04,"Revocation of parole seems to me seems like a denied benefit, whereas revocation of supervised release seems like a penalty."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1608.04,1610.84,"Your Honor, I really don't think there is any difference between --"
2018.17-1672,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1610.84,1620.36,"Because you're at -- you're denying the period of liberty and reimposing the sentence up to -- the prison sentence up to what it was, so denying that benefit."
2018.17-1672,0,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1630.8,1648.96,"Well, as a period of conditional liberty that's included in the sentence, this is exactly like the type of automatic parole that existed at the time of Morrissey, as we've pointed out in our brief. And this Court has considered things like revocation of good time credits to be the denial of a right and, nevertheless, not attached full protections to them."
2018.17-1672,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1662.48,1672.64,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lunn."
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1672.64,1765.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I liked the verb that Justice Sotomayor used at the beginning, ""stretches."" What 3583(k) does is that it stretches what the original conviction -- the -- the amount of sentence that was authorized by the jury's verdict in this case. It aggravates the punishment in the sense that it -- where the original verdict allowed only a zero- to 10-year sentence that a judge could have imposed, to a mandatory five-year sentence, all the way up to life in prison. And I also think that Justice Gorsuch's comment that when -- if -- if the Sixth Amendment didn't apply, would this also apply if you had a -- if the sentence was a death penalty? And the potential life in prison without parole, which 3583(k) allows, is the second-most serious punishment that's allowed in the law. And those types of heightened punishments that 3583(k) allows create tremendous due process problems and they also create tremendous problems with regard to the right to a jury trial."
2018.17-1672,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1765.2,1774.76,What about the government's argument that you are conceding that revocation and reimprisonment under (e)(3) is okay?
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1774.76,1811.08,"The -- the -- (e)(3) reads that the Court may revoke a defendant's supervised release to allow him to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release. The term of supervised release is -- has a very minimal -- it's a fairly minimal sanction in that it's designed to rehabilitate a prisoner who has just finished his -- his prison sentence, and to retransition that prisoner back into the community."
2018.17-1672,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1811.08,1813.08,Is (e)(3) okay?
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1813.08,1815.84,(e)(3) is okay to the point --
2018.17-1672,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1815.84,1819.96,Yes? It's just a yes or no on that if you can.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1819.96,1822.64,Yes with regard to Mr. Haymond.
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1838.36,1852.4,"Just to understand what you mean there, yes with regard to Mr. Haymond because Mr. Haymond can't be brought -- he's not going beyond the statutory maximum here? Is that what you mean?"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1852.4,1853.48,Yes.
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1853.48,1861.2,So he has -- he has no -- he -- he himself has no claim that the statutory maximum is being stretched?
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1861.2,1865.52,"That's -- well, the -- the -- the statutory minimum is being stretched --"
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1865.52,1866.36,"Yes, that's what I said."
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1866.36,1866.8,"-- obviously, with regard to him."
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1866.8,1869.48,He has no claim that the statutory maximum is being stretched.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1869.48,1870.36,That's correct essentially.
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1870.36,1874.56,"So that when you said to Justice Kavanaugh yes with respect to Mr. Haymond, that's why?"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1874.56,1876.48,Yes.
2018.17-1672,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1912.44,1932.32,"So why couldn't a remedy, instead of requiring a jury trial or striking down this part of this provision, which the Tenth Circuit did, why couldn't a simple remedy in your view be adequate that says the judge can do anything within the original sentence?"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1932.32,1932.96,Because --
2018.17-1672,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1932.96,1942.12,"And if your -- if your reincent -- if your reimposition requires a minimum of five years and that's what you got, we'll strike that down."
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,1956.96,1993.44,"That -- that would not be a violation of Apprendi, but it could be -- you could still have due process problems with that type of situation. For instance, if someone had been sentenced to one year and then the judge, by a preponderance of the evidence, was allowed to impose a far more restrictive -- a far more punishment-related sentence, let's say, of nine years, he might very well have an argument that that was a violation of due process rights, because he's looking at a -- certainly a heightened incapacity as a result of -- of that type of sentence."
2018.17-1672,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1993.44,1998.24,The -- the -- let me try this again.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2016.48,2016.76,Yes.
2018.17-1672,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.76,2017.08,Okay.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2096.68,2122.6,"The Sentencing Reform Act, when it was initially enacted in 1984, may be the answer for you in that type of situation because the Sentencing Reform Act allowed exclusively, if a person violated a new law, the -- it's a violation of their supervised release."
2018.17-1672,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.6,2123.68,"Yeah, yeah."
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2123.68,2125.84,The judge could hold them in contempt.
2018.17-1672,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2160.04,2164.56,And how long could the contempt penalty be?
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2164.56,2180.4,"Well, if you're dealing with contempt, there are rules under this Court's holding in Bloom that, if you're looking at more than six months, then you're entitled to a jury trial."
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2180.4,2204.64,"Well, can I ask you about Alleyne? What Alleyne held is that the touchstone for determining whether a fact must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the fact constitutes an element of the charged offense. So you're saying that all of the conditions of supervised release are elements of the charged offense?"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2204.64,2231.68,"All of the -- well, it -- my understanding of Alleyne is that if you increase the mandatory minimum or you increase the maximum that was authorized by the jury, that that, in effect, creates a -- you aggravate the punishment by creating a new element, and that makes an entirely new crime."
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2231.68,2232.08,Right.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2240.76,2246.96,"They -- well, the conditions that are imposed are not unlike a contempt situation."
2018.17-1672,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2272.88,2284.04,"But your answer's no, there are not elements of offense in the -- in the -- in the standard case, where 10 years in prison is the statute --"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2284.04,2284.28,Yes.
2018.17-1672,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2284.28,2287.16,-- plus five years supervised release.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2315.32,2316.16,Yes.
2018.17-1672,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2316.16,2318.76,"So the answer, I guess, is?"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2318.76,2322.92,Alleyne obviously adds to that with regard to a mandatory minimum.
2018.17-1672,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.92,2323.16,Right.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2323.16,2353.6,"So you have a situation in Alleyne -- and this is how this -- Alleyne applies directly to Mr. Haymond's situation. Alleyne holds that, by aggravating the punishment at either the mandatory minimum or heightening the maximum, that you create a situation that heightens the loss of liberty and it empowers the prosecutor to get the judge to do something that the judge wouldn't ordinarily do. And that's precisely what happened in this case."
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2358.92,2375.88,"But what -- what does the Sixth Amendment protect? Does it protect the rights of -- the rights of -- of people to have a jury of their peers, or does it protect the rights of judges to exercise discretion?"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2375.88,2397.24,"The -- the Sixth Amendment provides further assurances to the right to jury trial that had already been guaranteed in the Constitution under Article III, Section 2, Clause 3. And -- and the Sixth Amendment, in fact, was not needed to ensure trial by jury in cases of crimes."
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2399.64,2405.6,"I mean, I thought the right -- the reason for the jury trial right was fundamentally distrust of judges."
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2427.16,2433.28,You're talking about supervised release? I'm -- I'm --
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2433.28,2440.44,"Well, you're saying that there's a problem with the mandatory five, because it ought to be up to the discretion of the district judge."
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2440.44,2440.8,Yes.
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2440.8,2444.84,And that's based on the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2444.84,2446.28,Yes.
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2446.28,2446.64,Okay.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2453.12,2453.44,Yes.
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2453.44,2458.52,How do you connect that with the right to a jury trial?
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2458.52,2514.36,"Again, a jury trial applies when someone has committed a serious or atrocious crime under Callan versus Wilson, going all the way back to 1888, or any public wrong, which is the Bloom case, which is a case that didn't necessarily involve a criminal prosecution because it dealt with a contempt. So the right to a jury trial is when you are looking at a -- what amounts to a prosecution for a serious or atrocious crime. And it doesn't matter what label you put on it, whether it's revocation or a sentencing guideline or contempt or whatever. That's what the holding in Ring is. This is nothing more than a label for what really amounts to the -- the trial of a crime."
2018.17-1672,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2514.36,2548.8,"I thought of a way of putting this question, this case, is let's imagine a statute that says up to 10 years in prison for possession of drugs with intent, okay? A certain amount. Then the statute adds the following: If the offender had a gun, there is a three-year mandatory minimum, but in no event will the total sentence exceed 10 years."
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2563.68,2565.2,I -- I believe they do.
2018.17-1672,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.2,2566.84,Is there any authority on that?
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2566.84,2570.76,"Well, to some extent, it may be the O'Brien case."
2018.17-1672,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2613.08,2628.0,"What do you think of the government's proposal as a fallback that, rather than strike down the statute, you convene a jury and have the jury make the finding?"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2628.0,2656.96,"There are two responses. First of all, it's just a simple question as to why you need to do it at all, which is, if -- if you really are looking at a situation that is -- you want to prosecute someone for -- by guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, why don't you just prosecute them by indicting them? But, beyond that, if you then want to bring the jury trial system into the revocation system, it creates immense difficulties."
2018.17-1672,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2660.2,2661.8,"Well, that's what you want, though."
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2667.16,2678.92,"Well, I understand that. And -- and we obviously believe that this type of situation, based on the allegations that are being made, are something that needs to be presented to a jury."
2018.17-1672,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2678.92,2688.92,"If you're -- if you're not satisfied with -- with the jury as a remedy, that raises the suspicion that the mandatory minimum is really what you're objecting to, not the lack of a jury."
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2688.92,2718.84,"But there are problems. And this Court has looked at that type of situation, for instance, in both the Jackson case and in the Pennsylvania Board of Parole versus Scott, where it -- it describes what happens when you -- when the court tries to create that jury in the revocation process. You would have burden of proof issues, you'd have confrontation issues, you'd have potential double jeopardy issues that would arise."
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2815.2,2829.28,"Mr. Lunn, you're raising a lot of objections, but, I mean, you can't argue with the proposition that such a system would cure the constitutional violation that you're complaining of, isn't that right?"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2829.28,2840.04,"If -- if you had a jury trial, assuming that you -- you get around these constitutional problems, such as presentment to a grand jury, that the judge is the party that's initiating all of this --"
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2840.04,2844.0,"The constitutional violation that you're complaining of, the Apprendi/Alleyne constitutional --"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2844.0,2844.12,Yes.
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2844.12,2847.4,"-- problem, a jury would cure, is that right?"
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2847.4,2855.48,"A jury in a revocation hearing, if that's where the Court wanted to go, and if you thought that that is what Congress would do in this situation --"
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2855.48,2856.04,That's what I was --
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2856.04,2856.44,-- then very well.
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2856.44,2859.2,I think that's right. I think it is what Congress wanted to do.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2888.96,2910.92,"Because the entire tradition of supervised release, and, in fact, parole and probation, has always been highly discretionary because -- and Congress has -- has recognized that throughout the time and, in fact, in terms of when it -- when it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act in 1984."
2018.17-1672,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2910.92,2914.12,It seems to me that now you're arguing against yourself on the merits.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2926.56,2933.84,"Clearly, the Court can say that -- that a jury should impose -- be imposed in a revocation hearing."
2018.17-1672,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2939.44,2940.16,It would alter it.
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2942.44,2951.64,"Well, but it -- it would create an adversarial system, potentially, that would be quite a bit different from what we've known for revocation proceedings --"
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2951.64,2957.88,Do you have any idea how many revocation proceedings there are every year?
2018.17-1672,1,63098,william_d_lunn,,2957.88,2960.44,There are -- are numerous revocation proceedings.
2018.17-1672,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2965.12,2974.16,"But the total number of revocation proceedings, maybe Mr. Feigin has an idea, so we know what we're dealing with with some of these potential arguments."
