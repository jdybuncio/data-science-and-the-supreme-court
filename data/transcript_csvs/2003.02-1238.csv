2003.02-1238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.489,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1238, Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League and Missouri Municipal League against Southwestern Bell."
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,58.662,61.195,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,130.448,131.108,I don't think that's right.
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,136.309,139.076,"Well, I don't...  I'm not even sure whether that's true."
2003.02-1238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,156.743,162.582,The only...  the only thing I question is your statement that the statute itself is a grant of power to a local entity.
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,165.82,166.259,"Well, I think..."
2003.02-1238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,166.259,169.602,It preserves power from being preempted.
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,169.602,172.241,"Well, perhaps it's a question of semantics, but..."
2003.02-1238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,172.241,172.696,It is.
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,172.696,182.523,but...  but the...  but the...  the issue here is that in Missouri political subdivisions do not have the authority to provide telecommunications services.
2003.02-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.386,216.247,Is it your view that in all instances we must interpret this statute so that any entity...  that phrase...  does not include a local subdivision of the State?
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,216.247,227.598,"Yes, because under the Gregory rule, if you...  if the Court were to construe the statute so that it did include political subdivisions, it would be a intrusion into State sovereignty."
2003.02-1238,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.598,230.382,It would be under the circumstances of this case.
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,247.91,260.458,The other...  I can't imagine cases...  and I'm not aware that any have come up in the cases that have addressed the...  the question presented here...  where there are some other restriction that a State has passed that has nothing to do with political subdivisions.
2003.02-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.666,290.385,"Mr. Feldman, do we need to apply the clear statement rule of Gregory v. Ashcroft for you to prevail?"
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,290.385,294.061,I think it's our understanding...  it's our understanding that the rule would apply here.
2003.02-1238,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,312.759,313.668,Exactly.
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,313.668,332.161,"And I would say that it raises the question that I was...  the...  the problem that I was referring to before in responding to Justice Stevens, which is State...  the application of 253(a) would depend on the form in which a State chooses to give or not give its power to its political subdivisions."
2003.02-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.928,349.295,Are those home rule States established in that fashion by the State constitutions?
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,349.295,352.639,I think so sometimes.
2003.02-1238,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.639,366.264,In which case the language of section 253(a) which says no State or local statute or regulation or other State or local legal requirement may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting.
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,370.183,380.957,It would at least be a difficult question to try to figure out whether there is still something that prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting rather than something which just never granted the authority before.
2003.02-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.676,428.595,"Suppose you didn't give that very broad meaning to any entity, but you included State entities that had been in the business and were otherwise authorized by State law to go into this business and then the State changes its law and without having a section (b) requirement, because you have loads of power under section (b), so we assume the entity meets section (b)'s test, but it passes another law which says, by the way, the municipality can't go into it."
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,437.883,439.991,I...  I don't...
2003.02-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,439.991,441.189,"Now, why...  why would that not be included?"
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,441.189,451.387,I...  I don't think it...  because I...  I think that there is...  it's very difficult to imagine that Congress intended that the...  the scope of this statute should turn on the exact historical steps...
2003.02-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,451.387,451.963,"No, no."
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,451.963,452.872,that they once had or...
2003.02-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,452.872,461.417,"But what we want...  we want...  we have implicitly there and it would be necessary in the State case but not in the private entity case an entity that is fit, willing, and able."
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,476.733,486.847,"But I guess what I was responding to was it's not...  the...  the definition of what a political subdivision is fit, willing, and able to do is something that...  it is a creature of State law."
2003.02-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,489.159,499.729,"That...  that's correct, but it's defined by State regulatory law in respect to those entities at least that have previously offered the business."
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,499.729,507.531,"I think there's actually very few...  before 1996, I think there were very few...  and I'm not aware of examples."
2003.02-1238,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,518.145,525.78,"You see, in other words, but your argument here is coming down to the difficulty of trying to draw the distinction I'm suggesting."
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,525.78,540.186,"I think that...  I think part of my argument is the difficulty of drawing that distinction, but the most important part of it is that this is an intrusion into a State's understanding of its government and what it wants to do with its authority."
2003.02-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.179,559.838,"If the...  if the statute were clear, if it said public...  it said any entity, public or private...  but you're...  you're making an argument now that seems to say no matter how clear this was, there would still be a vulnerability."
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,559.838,561.203,No.
2003.02-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,575.237,576.518,"Well, wouldn't...  wouldn't any..."
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,576.518,576.823,That would have been...
2003.02-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,576.823,578.764,"any entity, public or private, wouldn't that do?"
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,578.764,582.024,I think it's likely that that would do.
2003.02-1238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,641.717,642.793,May I ask you...
2003.02-1238,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.415,645.977,May I ask you this one more sort of general question?
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,662.734,663.849,It actually is broader than that.
2003.02-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,762.467,768.783,"What is the United States' position about utilities, public utilities, electric companies?"
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,768.783,771.384,I'm not sure what you mean.
2003.02-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,774.622,775.47,To enter this business.
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,775.47,777.206,"Yes, they certainly can."
2003.02-1238,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,779.601,781.83,"Suppose it...  suppose it's mixed ownership, city and private."
2003.02-1238,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,781.83,793.553,"The Federal Communications Commission's position is if, under State law, it's treated as a private entity, the fact that stock, some or even all of the stock, is owned by the political subdivision wouldn't be...  it would still be an entity."
2003.02-1238,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,819.354,820.84,"Very well, Mr. Feldman."
2003.02-1238,1,39977,ronald_molteni,,822.781,831.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.37,895.477,Why isn't any entity clear?
2003.02-1238,1,39977,ronald_molteni,,896.713,898.199,Justice Scalia...
2003.02-1238,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.199,900.762,What do they have to say to make any...  any entity clear?
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1495.697,1503.294,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1532.977,1533.859,"But it doesn't mean any fish, for example."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1535.866,1544.411,"I...  I wouldn't...  I wouldn't...  I guess it doesn't mean any fish, Justice Breyer, but of the...  I think it has a very broad meaning."
2003.02-1238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.762,1560.758,"When you...  when you say the statute has to be ambiguous, the Gregory rule as put forth in the opinion is that there has to be a clear statement covering the Federal...  Federal aspect of the thing."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1567.567,1576.484,What the Court...  the Court said in Gregory that the statute has to be ambiguous and it reiterated that in Salinas and more recently in Yeskey.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.484,1579.827,It depends on what you mean by...  by ambiguous.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1585.4,1588.167,"Well, the unambiguous language in Gregory was employee."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1611.095,1611.55,In your view does...
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1636.064,1636.436,Yes.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.862,1651.751,I think there are various levels of...  of clear statement rules.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1651.751,1668.469,"Well, I think the...  the best illustration of that is the contrast between the Court's decision in Raygor and the Court's decision in Jinks which have the advantage of focusing on exactly the same statutory language, any claim asserted in a supplemental jurisdiction statute."
2003.02-1238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1715.327,1717.843,"Does the word, any entity, cover the State itself?"
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1717.843,1719.785,"Yes, I think it covers the State itself."
2003.02-1238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1719.785,1729.194,"So if the Governor is about to sign a contract to...  to allow the State to enter into communications facilities and the legislature instructs him not to, that statute is void?"
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1729.194,1731.218,"No, that statute is not void, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.759,1758.839,Why don't neutral principles of corporate governance apply to the relations between the State and its subdivisions?
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1758.839,1759.21,They...
2003.02-1238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1759.21,1760.575,Suppose there's a constitutional provision.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1760.575,1763.547,They absolutely do if they are truly neutral principles.
2003.02-1238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1777.764,1780.819,But you say that it can't be made precise to telecommunications.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1780.819,1781.052,That's right.
2003.02-1238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.052,1785.566,"That was my example in the State hypothetical, in the first hypothetical."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1785.566,1792.708,"Well, the...  what's...  what's operating there is the general rule that Governors have to do what the State legislature tells them to do."
2003.02-1238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1792.708,1796.961,"Well, here it was operating as a general rule that subdivisions have to do what the State tells them to."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1796.961,1797.621,"Well, when this..."
2003.02-1238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1797.621,1802.701,"I don't see why the general rule applies in one instance and not the other, given your definition of entity."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1802.701,1820.572,"Because in the...  in the case like this one, what the State has done is to enact a specific, targeted rule not competitively neutral...  that issue is, strictly speaking, not before the Court yet...  a targeted rule that keeps an entity out of the telecommunications business."
2003.02-1238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.397,1834.856,"Yes, but Raygor had any entity too and we said that was not conclusive there."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1834.856,1835.887,Raygor said any claim.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.953,1862.515,"Well, that was not the only difference."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.515,1862.681,No.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.681,1866.934,"I mean, there were other factors in Jinks besides...  besides just the language, any claim."
2003.02-1238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.934,1877.253,And also the fact that sovereign immunity had never extended...  a State Eleventh Amendment immunity had never...  had never been extended to counties.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1877.253,1879.278,"Well, that's of course right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1238,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1903.631,1910.03,But those are all under the Fourteenth Amendment where the Thirteenth...  Fourteenth Amendment altered the Federal balance with reference to those.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,1910.94,1916.923,"Well, I understand that the Fourteenth Amendment has special significance for purposes of State sovereign immunity."
2003.02-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1927.78,1933.353,If...  if for purposes of...  will you assume with me...  and I may be the only one who thinks this.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2004.109,2004.973,No.
2003.02-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.973,2030.608,"So given the...  the sovereign immunity...  you know, the sovereign...  all...  all the things we've been talking about in general, given the difficulty of drawing a line, which seems virtually impossible or very hard, and given the one-way ratchet I just described, it can't be that Congress intended to include municipal entities within the scope of the word, any entity."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2033.209,2033.375,Yes.
2003.02-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2033.375,2034.49,What's your response to that?
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2034.49,2034.573,Yes.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.375,2063.28,The State...  the State cannot tell it not to enter.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2063.28,2067.987,"The State cannot tell it not to enter by a targeted, non-competitively neutral provision."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.987,2068.36,I don't understand.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2078.306,2089.824,It...  the reason why it's targeted...  targeted is what I'm using to embrace the notion stated in 253(b) which preserves an enormous realm of regulatory authority to the States.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.556,2107.247,"Well, what...  what's your answer to the hypothetical I give you?"
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2108.444,2114.388,"Well, I think that would be...  if it...  if it specified certain commercial activities but not others, I think that would be a difficult question."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.957,2116.496,That's why I asked it.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2117.072,2122.44,"Well, the question...  the question would be a 253(b) question for the FTC in the first...  FCC in the first instance."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.44,2124.791,"Well, it had nothing to do with whether it's competitively neutral."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2128.468,2128.839,I mean...
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2128.839,2135.981,"If it...  if it were a gerrymander designed to keep...  really just designed to keep entities out of telecommunications, it would be unacceptable."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2135.981,2144.897,"So we're going to have to get into inquiring into whether State legislatures...  well, of course...  of course, they didn't want it."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2150.182,2151.13,That's...  that...
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.13,2156.497,"If your question is whether it was designed to keep them out of telecommunications, the answer is unquestionably yes."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2156.497,2157.983,This...  I agree...
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2157.983,2164.876,"But...  but if you say it's okay if they not only keep them out of telecommunications, but they keep them out of a lot of other stuff as well, does that make it okay?"
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2164.876,2172.185,This is the question that would have to come up when the FCC applied 253(b) to a public or a private entity...
2003.02-1238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.185,2172.807,But why should we...
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2172.807,2173.466,public or private.
2003.02-1238,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.466,2180.32,"Why should we interpret a statute in that awkward way, that the FCC has to make this kind of factual inquiry in every case?"
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2180.32,2184.407,I think the FCC is in that business with respect to private entities anyway.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.15,2187.751,What is the...  I don't even understand what the factual inquiry is.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.751,2188.001,What is it...
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2188.001,2188.91,"Well, the inquiry..."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.91,2190.192,that the FCC would be looking for?
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2190.192,2191.966,The inquiry...  it's 253(b).
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.563,2203.983,So the FCC is going to decide what is necessary to promote...
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2203.983,2204.393,That's...
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.393,2206.788,Missouri's public objectives?
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2206.788,2211.452,That is the business...  that is unquestionably the business Congress put the FCC in with respect to private entities.
2003.02-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.188,2218.139,"I see the answer to that part, which is you're saying they have to do it anyway, and I understand that."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2283.321,2287.613,"The reason it's not a one-way ratchet, Justice Breyer, I think turns on the word prohibit."
2003.02-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2311.641,2314.074,But the State could not repeal the statute.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2314.074,2320.101,The State could not repeal the statute unless it were part of a competitively neutral reorganization of local government or something like that.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.046,2338.594,"Why...  why would Congress design such a strange system where...  where the municipality can get in and then get out, but the State can't allow the municipality to get in and then decide, no, we want to allow them to get out?"
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2338.594,2339.216,I...
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.216,2341.278,It's just bizarre.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2341.278,2351.515,"I think it applies...  I think for these purposes, municipal corporations and private corporations are simply on a par as, of course, they were for large parts of our history."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.853,2379.999,"Just so I understand you, a State can...  can grant certain powers to municipalities, does not have to grant them the power to enter into...  into telecommunications activity."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2380.62,2381.28,Yes.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2382.145,2383.797,It does not have to grant them that power.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2383.797,2392.176,"Well, the...  the restraint is the competitively neutral language which will ordinarily allow municipalities to say...  the States to say, look, here's what you can do and here's what you can't do..."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2392.176,2392.919,Right.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2392.919,2397.089,provided they aren't acting in a way that is competitively non-neutral with respect to telecommunications.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.089,2405.8,"Right, but...  but once they have let them get into telecommunications, it's...  it's only the municipality that can decide to get out of it."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2405.8,2406.255,No.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2418.514,2421.652,"Okay, but...  but the municipality itself can say we're going to get out of telecommunications."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2421.652,2422.274,Yes.
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.274,2426.072,The State cannot say no...  no municipality shall do telecommunications.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2426.072,2426.322,That's right.
2003.02-1238,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2432.183,2441.387,"Mr. Strauss, may I go back and ask a variant on Justice Breyer's question, assuming that there is some implicit limitation on...  on the scope of any entity?"
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2539.551,2541.037,"Two points, Justice Souter."
2003.02-1238,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2560.689,2562.713,So you say the...  the excision was a redundancy excision.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2562.713,2563.251,"Yes, that's right."
2003.02-1238,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2571.092,2571.358,Okay.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2615.097,2625.5,"The conference committee report, I believe, Justice Souter, used the word private to describe...  in describing the sort of competition it believed would be brought about."
2003.02-1238,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2645.524,2645.812,Okay.
2003.02-1238,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2645.812,2656.669,"What we're left with, it seems to me, is...  is at least...  maybe let's call it tension between the conference committee report and the preamble language which was then inserted."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2682.015,2686.762,"I think the ambiguity to which Gregory refers...  I mean, I don't think."
2003.02-1238,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2691.963,2692.585,I...  I think so too.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2692.585,2692.957,And...
2003.02-1238,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2692.957,2706.497,"And...  and maybe what I'm saying is we...  we ought to...  those of us who would look into the...  the legislative history, as I would, maybe ought to take advantage of a slightly broader Gregory rule."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2706.497,2722.928,"Well, the...  the case I think that would stand in the way more than any other perhaps...  well, many would I think, but the clearest example I can think of is Yeskey where the...  the question in Yeskey whether the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, applied to inmates of State prisons."
2003.02-1238,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2748.191,2752.111,"Isn't the difference, though...  and I...  I see your argument."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2805.61,2822.207,"Justice Souter, I guess the difficulty I'd have with that approach in general would be it has to be common for there to be this sort of uncertainty in legislative history with feints in a certain direction and withdrawals for reasons that are difficult to...  to fathom."
2003.02-1238,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2822.207,2831.411,"Well, I...  I grant you that, but when...  when the...  when the issue relates to the kind of State sovereignty issue that...  that Gregory addresses, that's a good reason for having a Gregory rule."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2831.411,2852.3,"Well, but as to the legislative history, I think that sort of uncertainty is going to be easy to generate, and what we do have here...  in addition to any entity, what we do have here, not just in the legislative history, but on the face of the statute, is, as I said, agreement I think all around that utilities are prominent among the entities that Congress envisioned."
2003.02-1238,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.665,2865.303,"But would you also say that the legislative history makes it pretty clear that there's a distinction in meaning between the term private entity on the one hand and the term entity on the other hand, and the statute used the term entity?"
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2865.303,2867.161,"Well, that's true, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2872.612,2873.521,So what does...  what does...
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2909.187,2910.096,"Well, I think...  I think that..."
2003.02-1238,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2910.096,2910.551,What do you think about that?
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2910.551,2913.44,I think that is the scheme although not under 253(a).
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.916,2968.512,You say...  you say that that's...  I...  I could...  I could understand that there's no ambiguity if you simply say any entity means any entity.
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3032.476,3037.055,"As...  as to 253(a), Justice Scalia, I am absolutely embracing that."
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.69,3063.805,impact upon (a).

2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3067.77,3068.225,I...
2003.02-1238,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3068.225,3072.106,"If you're using an ambiguous (b) to explain (a), (a) itself is ambiguous."
2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3072.106,3072.933,(b) does not explain (a).

2003.02-1238,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,3210.683,3215.347,"Well, it has to in a sense...  I agree with you, Justice Scalia, it doesn't."

2003.02-1238,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3326.559,3336.051,"Well, Mr. Strauss points to subsection (b) of the statute as indicating Congress did contemplate giving some leeway."
