1998.97-1992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.439,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-1992, Vaughn Murphy v. United Parcel Service."
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,73.629,76.897,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1992,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.359,150.862,You say that your first point is that he's covered by the ADA because his hypertension limited major life activity.
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,157.701,160.503,"In its unmedicated states, Chief Justice."
1998.97-1992,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.503,180.549,"Well, if we were to decide that the statute contemplates looking at it in the medicated state, is he still limited in his major life activities even medicated, because as I understand it, it doesn't fully correct his condition."
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,180.549,182.117,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-1992,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.356,195.41,You would suggest that we make the assumption--
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,195.41,196.226,--Yes.
1998.97-1992,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.226,200.878,--then that in his fully medicated state he can function.
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,200.878,202.397,"They make that assumption, yes."
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.397,203.997,Mr. McAllister--
1998.97-1992,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.997,217.407,"--But you say that even if that's... even if we look at it from the standpoint of his medicated state, if he's regarded by the employer as being disabled, that's enough, of course, under the statute."
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,217.407,217.94,"Yes, it is."
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.94,230.38,"Mr. McAllister, your client can be rendered better, and you say we should assume not disabled, by regularly taking medicine."
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,259.75,262.602,"Justice Scalia, two points in response to that."
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.807,274.659,"Why should that make a difference, then?"
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,298.109,303.096,"With all due respect, Justice Scalia, we believe there is a difference between those two things."
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.118,314.735,So what?
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,344.423,353.695,"--Justice Scalia, it would... the question seems to be premised on the notion that there is a perfect correction in a case like Vaughn Murphy."
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.98,357.663,That's the theory we're arguing the case.
1998.97-1992,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,365.999,381.175,"--It's an easier case to think about, perhaps, in thinking about one that will be argued later this week, 20/20 vision if you wear glasses, but without them, terrible, terrible handicap."
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,387.412,397.435,"Justice O'Connor, fundamentally, to serve what we believe are the purposes of the statute, the critical question here, first of all, is whether this person is disabled."
1998.97-1992,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.291,414.064,"Well, but I think the regarded as feature protects the person who alleges the disability, notwithstanding the corrective measures."
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,423.752,426.121,"I agree with that, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.045,466.531,"Before we get to the regarded as, though, let's talk a little more about, you know, whether he's disabled or not, never mind the regarded as."
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,516.697,517.847,"Yes, it is used in the findings."
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.847,528.855,"Well, how can you possibly say it's a discrete and insular minority if people who, you know, wear glasses and have all sorts of corrective measures for what would otherwise be disabilities?"
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,532.241,540.847,"Justice Scalia, what Congress was talking about was a large group, I think, rather than whether or not it's a discrete and insular majority."
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.847,543.281,They said some 43 million Americans.
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,544.515,546.083,IS a large group.
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.083,549.435,"--I mean, a lot of Americans wear glasses and couldn't function without them."
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,549.968,551.47,More than 43 million.
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.992,565.242,"--No, I thought... discrete and insular minority, they said."
1998.97-1992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,565.242,573.848,"But Mr. McAllister, the concept of disability requires some reference to the average."
1998.97-1992,0,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,573.848,574.966,"--Yes, it does."
1998.97-1992,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,574.966,587.19,And I presume that by means of that referenced you would exclude from the class of the disabled myopic people like Justice Scalia.
1998.97-1992,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.559,594.344,--Ask Justice Souter how long his arms are.
1998.97-1992,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1147.359,1156.964,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1992,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1194.506,1198.624,What's your answer to the 43 million finding of Congress?
1998.97-1992,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1202.843,1209.432,"Right, and I think that under respondent's view of the statute there would be a lot fewer than 43 million."
1998.97-1992,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.586,1218.288,Do you know how the 43 million figure was developed.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1745.424,1751.062,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.789,1793.805,"--a lot of trouble, Mr. Kilberg."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1795.888,1803.911,--Well--
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1843.286,1851.892,"May I ask, before you leave the 43 million, could you tell me, identify what you think are the components of that class of 43 million?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1853.01,1854.144,--Certainly.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1882.077,1883.279,"--Yes, but there's no... well, go ahead."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1883.846,1897.205,"--It relied on a survey of Americans which actually looked to functional limitations, and took into account mitigation or ameliorations."
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.205,1901.074,"It seems to me... you mean, that survey was prepared by the Census Bureau?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1901.074,1904.026,That survey was prepared... yes.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1905.792,1911.363,And is that Census Bureau survey identified somewhere by name so I could read it if I wanted to?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1911.363,1918.452,It is identified in the legislative history which is cited in our brief and in United's brief.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1924.606,1934.629,"What you cite on that page is something called Bureau of the Census Disability Functional Limitation of Health Insurance Coverage, 1984-1985, P-70, that's what you're talking about?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1934.629,1935.429,That's what I'm talking about.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.429,1935.88,Okay.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1935.88,1939.865,"That data, and then the way they got to the 43 million--"
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1939.865,1943.567,"Then my next question is, it says there's 37, 3 million people with a functional limitation."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1943.567,1943.567,--Yes.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1943.567,1952.304,"Can you give me some examples of the functional limitation that made up that figure, or it's just a ball park figure?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1952.304,1972.3,"It's a... I suspect it's a bit of a ball park figure, and then Congressman Coelho then added to it by saying that the number has been growing, and so he then estimated it to be 43 million as of the time of the act, because this was 19... I believe 1980, or maybe it was 1990 census... no, it must have been 1980 census data, and he was estimating--"
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.3,1985.744,"For example, would I be able to tell from that document whether someone who had... say, was legally blind, without glasses, had 2200 vision but who could wear glasses and be corrected to 20/20, whether that person would be in the figure or out?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1985.744,1986.244,"--Yes, you would."
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.244,1987.044,You could tell?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1987.044,1990.029,"Yes, and you would find that that person was not counted."
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1990.029,1992.564,Even if that person was legally blind?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,1992.564,1998.618,"That's correct, so long as the person had correctable vision to normal."
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.32,2017.58,"If you look through there, would you discover, for example, that people who have, let's say prosthetic limbs, or the people who have high blood pressure of an unusual nature... I mean, really quite high... that they were counted or not counted?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2019.448,2020.798,--That would--
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.798,2032.139,--for going through and deciding where and under what circumstances a corrective device would or would not be counted in deciding whether a person was disabled?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2032.139,2034.405,"--No, Justice Breyer, not with that--"
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.405,2034.689,Why not?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2034.689,2037.257,"--Not with that degree of specificity, but what you--"
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2037.257,2037.674,All right.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2067.562,2071.264,"--But the statute here provides a definition, and--"
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.264,2073.197,It doesn't say anything about corrective device.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2087.274,2087.924,"--No, I disagree."
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.84,2089.19,"Well, what does it say?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2090.876,2095.911,"--Well, we believe that this case begins and ends with the language and structure of the statute."
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.911,2096.78,If I accept that you're right.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2106.302,2119.626,"Well, the... we believe here that prong 1 of the statutory definition defines disability as an impairment that substantially limits the major life activities of a particular individual."
1998.97-1992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.699,2164.322,"Yes, I think, Mr. Kilberg, that the petitioner has said that is the way the case should be accepted here, so I don't think that point is in contention."
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.322,2184.569,"Mr. Kilberg, I assume that if we reject your is argument, I mean, even if one assumes that your is versus would argument is wrong, it is still your position that the statute requires an either-or."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2212.155,2213.505,I agree there is--
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.505,2214.538,Is there any way to get that out of the language?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2214.538,2216.857,"--No, there is no way to get that out of the language, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.857,2217.54,"That's what I want, exactly the question I--"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2217.54,2218.04,"I'm sorry, no."
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.04,2219.223,"--put it, because the--"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2219.223,2220.106,I did not understand--
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.106,2239.536,"--the way I... what I wanted you to focus on, just that question, is that isn't it very frequently you find a statute which is silent on the subject, and rather than reading it either-or, it becomes up to the agency to say where, looking at the purpose of the statute, you would do it this way, and where you'd do it the other way."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2262.783,2265.652,"--Because in this case, Justice Breyer, the statute is clear."
1998.97-1992,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2282.963,2300.241,"Well, could the agency say that substantially limits is very easily complied with, you just put your glasses on and off, but in other cases, medication has to be taken in a certain dosage, and you have to be very, very careful about it, and so that there's a distinction in the two?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2308.514,2310.997,"It is difficult, Justice Kennedy."
1998.97-1992,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2314.085,2314.451,--Yes.
1998.97-1992,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2314.451,2317.953,I don't know why you'd want to get into anything like that.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2329.177,2329.877,That's correct.
1998.97-1992,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2329.877,2330.627,--under the statute?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2330.627,2331.41,That's correct.
1998.97-1992,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2331.41,2342.918,"It could be that someone takes medication, but it doesn't totally cure the problem and the person is still disabled, and you would look at the individual circumstance, would you not--"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2342.918,2343.77,That is correct.
1998.97-1992,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2343.77,2344.354,--under the statute?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2344.354,2369.302,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor, and indeed, one of the major inconsistencies in petitioner's argument, or the EEOC's argument, is that throughout the EEOC's regulations and their compliance manual and so on, they talk in terms of actual effect, actual impact, the results on an individual, which is inconsistent with this notion that you don't take mitigating measures into account."
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.302,2371.587,I'm not giving up yet.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2410.712,2417.985,"And I believe, Justice Breyer, that the star... the Congress came to a similar conclusion to yours, but they did it with prongs 2 and 3."
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.678,2434.761,All right.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2444.117,2444.617,No.
1998.97-1992,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.617,2445.417,They don't.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2445.417,2446.652,"I don't believe so, no."
1998.97-1992,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2446.652,2458.459,"But if... Mr. Kilberg, if what we're thinking about is the correction, and... it was brought up, well, what about a permanent correction through surgery as opposed to a pill every day."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2504.588,2514.546,"In the record here, however, there's simply no evidence that UPS perceived Mr. Murphy as being substantially limited in the major life activity of working."
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2514.546,2520.082,"But isn't the question not whether they perceived him in a subjective sense, but how they treated him?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2526.604,2528.988,I don't believe so.
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2530.173,2533.592,"Don't believe they did treat him, or don't believe that that's the--"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2533.592,2534.925,--I don't believe that that's the correct reading of--
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2534.925,2541.328,--So that you believe the reading for regarded is in effect subjective state of mind?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2541.328,2542.613,"--Yes, and I--"
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2542.613,2549.851,"Then the results are going to be extraordinarily disparate, I suppose, because in the one... I mean, take this case."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2578.451,2588.39,--The... I believe the case law under the Rehabilitation Act and under the Americans With Disability Act is quite consistent on the point that it is the subjective view.
1998.97-1992,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2591.009,2607.285,"Well, I would think the employer's treatment of Mr. Murphy itself is some evidence of their attitude that he wasn't qualified, and I don't understand how a summary judgment could have been rendered on that issue on these facts."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2614.005,2621.944,"--In this instance, Mr. Murphy had been employed for 22 years as a mechanic."
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2685.554,2688.673,How come he worked for the prior 23 years without it?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2690.573,2692.739,It suggests... he had not worked for UPS.
1998.97-1992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2702.713,2709.283,What if actually DOT didn't require what UPS thought it required?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2709.283,2714.521,--The issue would still be UPS's perception.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2733.082,2756.079,"Are you saying that if they had a special rule, a very strict rule on blood pressure that nobody else in the industry had, because they thought that's a health requirement relating to safety and all the rest, wouldn't one say that whether... regardless of what all the rest of the industry regarded as disability, that UPS regarded anyone who did not meet that standard as being disabled?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2756.079,2762.5,--They may be regarding that criteria as a necessary criteria for their job.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2766.72,2770.672,"Well, it's a perception of every individual who fails the... who doesn't meet the standard."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2770.672,2778.361,And in those circumstances it would be evidence that the plaintiff could put in to show what the employer's perception might be.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2778.361,2779.177,"Well, isn't this--"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2779.177,2780.396,--but in this case there is no such evidence.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.396,2782.746,--Does it answer the evidentiary issue itself?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2796.756,2810.749,"Because again there is... the only line of work that we would be talking about here if we got to that point, the only class of job are mechanic's jobs, which require someone to drive in interstate commerce."
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2822.39,2828.544,"You mean, the availability of jobs in other companies always is a defense to your saying, we won't hire people with this characteristic?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2828.544,2837.316,"--Indeed, even the EEOC in its regulations looks to not only the number of jobs, but the number of jobs in the geographic area."
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.605,2855.576,"Well, this wasn't UPS's regulation anyway."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2855.876,2856.426,No.
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.027,2862.395,--It isn't that UPS deemed him unqualified because of blood pressure.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2867.299,2867.583,--That's correct.
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.633,2872.37,Would UPS have been in violation of the law if it hired him?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2872.37,2873.553,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2878.024,2885.761,"Well, it's hard to see, then, that it's... UPS' mere compliance with the law is any indication of what UPS deemed."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2890.998,2900.62,It is... the petitioner takes the view that there was an opportunity to depart from the DOT guidelines.
1998.97-1992,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2900.62,2916.482,"That you could get a waiver from the DOT, and that's hotly contested, and the... I think the other side, in all fairness, is taking the position that the... this person was qualified, indeed got a certificate from the DOT saying he could drive."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,2948.498,2950.617,They really are separated.
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.927,2993.396,"Well, let's--"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3022.314,3026.017,"Well, indeed--"
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.017,3028.184,That would be okay.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3028.184,3029.219,--That would be okay.
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.219,3029.636,Wow.
1998.97-1992,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3032.854,3038.492,"--That depends on how you interpret the statutory requirement, a class of jobs."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3038.492,3039.125,Yes.
1998.97-1992,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3039.125,3042.86,And we have a case coming up that gets us into that I think--
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3042.86,3043.479,Yes.
1998.97-1992,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3043.479,3044.212,--in a day or so.
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3044.212,3046.098,Could we go back to Justice--
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3046.098,3046.431,That's correct.
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3046.431,3049.633,--I'm... are you done?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3049.633,3050.049,Yes.
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3050.049,3052.133,Could we go back to Justice Ginsburg's question?
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3098.714,3104.017,Fail the regarded prong and win on the qualification.
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3104.017,3119.96,"In other words, it was... you regarded the person as disabled, but it was perfectly... given the definitions of disabled, but the person was nonetheless not qualified."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3157.832,3182.366,"You would have to have a situation where the employer perceived the individual as being substantially limited in a major life activity, and the... presuming that the individual was not, but the individual... HIV might be a good case of that, where the individual... the employer assumes, regards the individual as being unable to function."
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3216.188,3228.828,"But I would think that in every case in which the Court ultimately said yes, the person is qualified, the Court would in effect be saying, your basis for deeming the person unqualified was an illegitimate basis."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3242.572,3246.857,"Well, but certainly employers can set physical standards."
1998.97-1992,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3280.447,3300.693,"Mr. Kilberg, do I understand your argument correctly to say that people who have diseases with dread names but are very well controlled by a pill a day, like an epileptic, like a diabetic, that they would be the same, they would not be disabled for purposes of this statute?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3300.693,3311.716,"To the extent that the ameliorative measure... in this case, we're talking about pills... in fact put them on the other side of the line."
1998.97-1992,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3321.857,3323.773,So that hypertension could be in that category.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3323.773,3324.975,--It could be in that category.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3327.342,3330.027,"May I ask this question, just for your comment?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3340.234,3341.884,No.
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3342.634,3343.85,"No, you won't comment?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3343.85,3348.538,"The answer is yes, I would comment, and no, I don't believe that we need to look at the legislative history."
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.538,3349.538,"And why not, other than offending Justice Scalia?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3349.538,3350.154,Well--
1998.97-1992,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.656,3355.339,And good reason.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3355.339,3357.506,"--First, because the statute is clear."
1998.97-1992,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3360.224,3363.143,"If regarded as is perfectly clear, too."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3363.143,3364.678,And I believe it's clear on regarded as.
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3391.912,3399.685,"But if we do go beyond it, and I agree with you, I looked at the legislative history, and I think it takes you in each direction."
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3407.605,3415.527,"The... frankly, because the agency's interpretation itself doesn't have the power to persuade."
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3419.598,3443.095,"Well, we may say that... I'm not saying this, but we may say they have done a far less than perfect job in the consistency of their regs, and I... you know, I understand your argument there, but there isn't any question the position that the agency is taking in relation, not only to this case, but to cases of a class like this, and isn't that enough for some degree of deference if we're looking for a tie-breaker?"
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3443.095,3449.534,"In fact, even there, Justice Souter, you have to say that the agency is taking diametrically opposed positions."
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3484.439,3489.409,And in that case there were no side effects from the mitigating measure that would have justified it on their theory.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3489.409,3489.876,--No.
1998.97-1992,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3492.945,3493.98,I see.
1998.97-1992,2,45169,william_j_kilberg,,3493.98,3506.87,"And the position that the EEOC took was that... I forget whether it... it was Ms. Kienast, because Frank was the Postmaster General, that Ms. Kienast was not disabled because she was able to wear glasses."
1998.97-1992,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3506.87,3509.072,"Thank you very much, Mr. Kilberg."
1998.97-1992,3,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3511.608,3515.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1992,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3555.517,3556.636,"Thank you, Mr. McAllister."
