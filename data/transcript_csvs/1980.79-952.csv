1980.79-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.426,We will hear arguments now in Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division et al. Mrs. Bianchi.
1980.79-952,0,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,16.426,19.895,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,67.977,72.946,"What did they make there, what kind of fabricating did they do there?"
1980.79-952,0,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,72.946,85.087,"Mr. Chief Justice, this is not a matter of record but I can inform the Court that the roll foundry was engaged in the production of steel rolls to be used in the steel industry."
1980.79-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,85.087,88.891,"Some of it might get into tank turrets, I suppose?"
1980.79-952,0,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,88.891,90.741,It is possible; yes.
1980.79-952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,90.741,92.26,Or trucks and--
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1422.162,1426.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.524,1517.908,"Well, who litigates before the Review Board?"
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1518.726,1519.46,The employer--
1980.79-952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.46,1520.21,--and the employee.
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1520.21,1520.893,--and the employee.
1980.79-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.893,1527.03,What sort of proceeding would the Review Board put in such evidence?
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1527.03,1530.832,It would have to be remanded to some lower court.
1980.79-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.803,1544.575,"Are you suggesting that we... if we thought compelling state interest was relevant, we should send it back to the Supreme Court of Indiana to hold an evidentiary hearing?"
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1544.575,1546.193,I certainly hope it doesn't come to that stage.
1980.79-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.193,1548.979,"But if it does, is that what you're suggesting?"
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1548.979,1555.383,I'm suggesting that the Review Board certainly should have an opportunity to present facts as to the existence of a compelling state interest.
1980.79-952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.383,1562.97,What cases of ours would you say they would be guided by?
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1562.97,1580.332,"I think perhaps they would have to go back... if the decision were against us to the point where we were required to have a hearing on a compelling state interest, we would have to look to Sherbert, perhaps Wisconsin v. Yoder, and that line of cases."
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1580.332,1583.383,How would Yoder help you there?
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1583.383,1588.52,I'm sorry; I stated the wrong case.
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1588.52,1589.02,How would the Yoder case--
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1589.02,1589.303,No.
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1593.538,1594.507,--Sherbert v. Verner--
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1594.507,1596.057,--Sherbert v. Verner; right.
1980.79-952,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1596.057,1597.823,--You feel Sherbert helps you?
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1597.823,1603.211,"No, I think we would have to be guided by that if we went back for a hearing on compelling state interest."
1980.79-952,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1603.211,1605.746,Do you think that Sherbert should be over-ruled?
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1605.746,1614.5,"I think it should be modified, I think there are some very good points in Sherbert but I think it goes too far."
1980.79-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1674.223,1694.202,"Well, I think the... my understanding of the reason for that language in Sherbert was to take care of my brother Blackmun's earlier hypothetical question as to what about the person whose religious convictions taught him that it was sin to work at all, at anything."
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1694.202,1701.458,"Well, I agree that there may be a spectrum here, going from that situation perhaps to a Sherbert."
1980.79-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1701.458,1709.479,"Such a person, say, in the absence of that language in Sherbert, could say, I'm entitled to workmen's compensation... I'm entitled to unemployment compensation."
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1709.479,1728.691,"And the petitioner did not deny that that person should... in fact, the petitioner's position is that if there is a sincere religious conviction, sincerely held by an individual, that person is entitled to unemployment benefits no matter what his conviction is, even if it is that I should not be required to work at all."
1980.79-952,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1728.691,1730.493,That's not this case.
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1730.493,1731.143,No.
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.893,1745.903,"What is the status of people, if any, in many of the courts, who would have a religious objection and scruple against participating in social security?"
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1745.903,1748.439,In the Indiana courts?
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.439,1751.89,"There have been some cases on that, haven't there, in the lower courts?"
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1751.89,1756.96,I'm not prepared to discuss that; I'm sorry.
1980.79-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1828.741,1833.044,"Mr. Daily, I don't think it's quite correct to say that there were no state interests involved in Sherbert."
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1849.22,1849.986,--That is correct.
1980.79-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.83,1948.65,"Mr. Daily, wasn't that argument specifically rejected in Verner, both by the majority and by the dissenters?"
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1948.65,1954.721,--To that extent I am arguing for a modification of Sherbert v. Verner.
1980.79-952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.721,1955.923,That's why you asked for the modification?
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,1955.923,1961.225,"To the extent that that has been found by other courts, I think it should be modified."
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2164.908,2188.773,"Do you think it is not clear in this case that his position was placed entirely on his formal religious beliefs as distinguished from just disagreeing with some particular facet of a war, as Vietnam, for example?"
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,2188.773,2196.629,"I think Mr. Thomas stated that his beliefs, it was a personal religious belief."
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2196.629,2204.385,"Well, a personal religious belief against doing anything relating to making the weapons of war, direct weapons of war?"
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,2204.385,2206.552,"Directly involved in it; yes, sir."
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2206.552,2229.433,"He backed that up by saying that making steel alone, as he had previously, was not a barrier, and we can only infer that he meant that some of that steel might go into other purposes, and that he was only raising the question and he was helping to make a tank, for which there was no use except in war."
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,2229.433,2236.939,"I think that's clear from the record, that his only objection was to being put on an assembly line where he could clearly see what he was making."
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2247.979,2253.549,"Religious beliefs, as a member of Jehovah's Witnesses."
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,2256.417,2264.34,"--Yes, in my view it's very clear that as long as it were something that he could not recognize as a weapon, he had no--"
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2264.34,2279.433,"It was not just a general appeal to conscience in the abstract as in the hypothetical posed by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it was specifically his membership and adherence to the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses that he relied on."
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,2279.433,2286.539,"--I'm not sure that he relied on his Jehovah's Witness beliefs, but on his beliefs."
1980.79-952,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2286.539,2293.376,"Well, is that true from the record, when there is another Jehovah's Witness who is not upset by this situation?"
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,2293.376,2294.876,That's the point I'm making.
1980.79-952,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2298.513,2305.417,So it gets down to a matter of a personal religious belief wholly apart from Jehovah's Witnesses?
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,2305.417,2307.535,On the record in this case that's true.
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2330.299,2335.203,"But it is not unrelated to the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses, as a faith."
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,2335.203,2338.654,"On the record in this case, I don't know that you can make that determination."
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.654,2346.26,"I thought the record in that respect was crystal clear, open to no possible doubt."
1980.79-952,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2346.26,2356.283,"Well, it's a factor, I suppose, but the fact that another Jehovah's Witness went the other way would indicate it isn't a compelling factor."
1980.79-952,1,44472,william_e_daily,,2369.341,2376.946,"Examining the record in this case, the Supreme Court in Indiana could not find a basis for finding that this was a tenet."
1980.79-952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2376.946,2381.248,That probably led to the 4-3 decision in the Indiana Supreme Court to some extent.
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,2986.935,3025.876,First we would like to address the contention of the respondent that the Court of Appeals never said there was there was a concession of no compelling state interest and we would like to address the attention of the Court to pages 13(a) and 19(a) of our petition for certiorari where the Court of Appeals clearly said that the task of applying Sherbert in this case is focused by the Board's concession in oral argument that no compelling state interest exists in this case to justify an infringement.
1980.79-952,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3079.861,3101.876,"Mrs. de la Torre, what if at the time that your Mr. Thomas applied for work at the foundry he was told that as a matter of company policy someone who is in the roll mill automatically at the end of six months would be placed, rotated to the tank production department?"
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,3101.876,3111.399,That would be different from our case because that would indicate knowledge on this petitioner that that job was in conflict with his religious beliefs.
1980.79-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.435,3158.563,"Could I ask you, suppose that his request to the Jehovah's Witnesses had been answered by the religious body saying, there's nothing contrary to our religion to work in the turret factory."
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,3169.419,3178.274,"--We will still argue that the First Amendment protects that belief because it's religious in nature, it's sincerely held."
1980.79-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3178.274,3181.412,As long as you say it's religion.
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,3185.364,3193.903,"Well, that is consistent with the tenet of the Jehovah's Witnesses and would also be a belief protected by the First Amendment."
1980.79-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.903,3203.659,"And you would say the same thing, then, if a person went to his employer and said, I can't work in a turret factory, I'm going to quit, and the employer said, well, why?"
1980.79-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.659,3205.444,I have a religious belief.
1980.79-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.444,3208.48,"And his employer said, well, what religion are you a member of?"
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,3229.976,3239.432,"Then we would have to urge this Court to adopt the definition of religion in Seeger and Welsh, which has not been extended to the First Amendment as of today."
1980.79-952,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.432,3242.634,"--Well, no, he would say, this isn't just conscientious."
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,3245.903,3258.262,"Okay, then, we would have to look, as I said, to the test of sincerity and religious nature and how central this belief is to the life of this individual."
1980.79-952,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3278.474,3284.896,So you're close to conceding that all this Jehovah's Witness business is irrelevant.
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,3284.896,3288.098,What we're saying is that if--
1980.79-952,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3288.098,3289.248,For the precise issue here.
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,3289.248,3290.082,--Pardon?
1980.79-952,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3290.082,3291.884,For the precise issue here.
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,3300.519,3315.629,"He doesn't need the backing of the well-known religious organization to come to this Court and urge protection of his First Amendment rights, but in this case that backing is persuasive as to the issue of sincerity and is very crucial."
1980.79-952,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3315.629,3320.949,--but your response to Mr. Justice White was that eliminating that you would still be here.
1980.79-952,2,36782,mrs_blanca_bianchi_de_la_torre,,3320.949,3322.932,"Yes; yes, Mr. Justice."
