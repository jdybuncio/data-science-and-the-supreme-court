1968.76,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.0,"Philip Cardinale, Jr., petitioner, versus Louisiana."
1968.76,0,37981,preston_h_hufft,,39.95,40.801,"Oh, no it’s--"
1968.76,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,40.801,41.685,That makes no difference.
1968.76,0,37981,preston_h_hufft,,47.352,47.912,"No, sir."
1968.76,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,47.912,49.485,Alright.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,52.847,56.773,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,338.032,344.733,Did you seek to exclude it on the basis of the United States Constitution or just as a matter of state?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,344.733,351.905,"In the District Court, if Your Honor please, this trial occurred in May of 1966."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.702,377.008,"No, but I’m-- I think you understand my question."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,377.008,378.903,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,378.903,387.721,"Wondering if you-- the time you raised or, in any event, when for the fede-- when you raised any federal question in this case."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,387.721,389.751,Upon application for the writ.
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.751,391.051,Of certiorari in this Court?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,391.051,392.743,Yes.
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.309,504.683,"But, as Mr. Justice Stewart asked you, was the federal question which you raised here decided at all in the lower Courts?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,504.683,506.109,"No, sir, it was not."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.109,509.468,"So, there’s been no state decision on any federal question--"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,509.468,509.895,That is correct.
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,509.895,511.166,In this case?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,513.91,536.282,"Because of the contention that the constitution was violated with reference to the admissibility of the evidence per se, in other words, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that the confession must be considered as a whole."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.282,546.112,"When the case comes here from the state Court, doesn’t our jurisdiction depend on the State Court having decided a federal question?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,546.112,567.473,"The federal question, if Your Honor please, in connection with this matter was not raised in the State Court for the reason that there was no-- in the Trial Court, there was no expression which actually hit this on the button as it did in the dissenting opinion in the Spencer case which came out after this trial in the State Court."
1968.76,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,567.473,575.732,"Well-- but when you got to the State Supreme Court, the error was not assigned and the Bill of Exceptions isn’t constitutional error, was it?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,575.732,576.49,"No, sir, it was not."
1968.76,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,576.715,587.381,"And the Supreme Court opinion did not treat it on the ground of constitutional error, did it?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,587.381,588.882,"No, sir, it did not."
1968.76,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,589.617,593.585,"Then, how-- what is the answer to Justice White’s question?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,593.585,600.97,The issue as to constitutionality was not raised prior to the time of the preparation of the application for the writ to this Court.
1968.76,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,600.97,603.512,Then do we have any jurisdiction to go through it?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,603.512,608.783,"We submit that the constitutional issue is present, if Your Honor please."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,623.171,629.709,Where in the record is the exact language of the opinion?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,629.709,640.509,"I believe that I refer to it at transcripts, page 496-510."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,640.509,643.815,"Where is it, 496?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,643.815,645.635,Through 510.
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,645.635,648.255,You don’t have it printed?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,648.255,658.705,"No, in the appendix we refer to the Bill of Exceptions, which, Bill of Exception sets forth the actual reference to-- as to the manner in which it was raised."
1968.76,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,664.078,666.989,It was cited in the jurisdiction.
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,666.989,673.373,But it doesn’t say anything-- it just says you objected to it.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,673.373,680.316,"Yes, sir, we did."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.316,687.727,"Well, in no place did you mention that you object on the grounds that it violates any provision of the constitution."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,687.727,688.083,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,701.427,704.412,Where is that in the Bill of Exception?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,704.412,733.405,"Now, I’m looking at the appendix here and, particularly, the Bill of Exceptions Number 3 which appears at page 9, 10, and 11 of the Bill-- of the appendix, and Bill of Exceptions Number 10 which appears at page 12, 13, and 14."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,733.405,741.18,"Well, i've scanned to 9, 10, 11, and I don’t see the US Constitution anywhere."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,741.18,741.378,This is--
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,741.378,741.807,Is this from the law?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,741.807,742.814,"Correct, sir."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,742.814,743.267,Sir?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,743.267,744.966,"This is correct, sir."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,744.966,746.286,"So, you didn’t write it?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,746.286,748.615,"Not in the District Court, no, sir."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,748.615,753.151,"Well, this Bill of Exception is in the Supreme Court, isn’t it?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,753.151,757.758,"No, this Bill of Exceptions was prepared and submitted to the trial judge and then--"
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,757.758,760.645,"Well, what was submitted to the Supreme Court of Louisiana?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,760.645,762.604,These Bills of Exceptions.
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.604,765.269,And no place in the federal question?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,765.269,769.536,"No, sir, not as to Bill of Exceptions Number 3 and Bill of Exceptions Number 10."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,769.536,772.281,"Well, my answer was no place."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,772.281,774.211,That is correct.
1968.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,787.289,794.962,But you argued in your briefs or orally that this was unconstitutional under the federal constitution.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,794.962,797.688,The exact question which was raised in the appellee’s--
1968.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,797.688,799.481,The one you’re arguing now?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,799.481,802.635,"No, sir, we did not."
1968.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,802.635,808.786,"Well, do you have any authority to the effect that we have jurisdiction in such a situation?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,808.786,824.647,"Well, if Your Honor please, the issue which we raised herein is one which really developed since the trial of this case."
1968.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,896.443,901.173,Do you take any comfort out of the opinion of the Court in the Spencer case?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,901.173,902.807,"Yes, sir, we do."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,987.139,992.816,"Well, what do you get out of that sentence you’ve just read from the majority that would help you?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,992.816,997.329,We submit that this actually leaves our question open.
1968.76,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1053.559,1056.322,"But, is that applicable here?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1078.767,1081.341,"Well, Your Honor is talking about the propensity of pattern-type--"
1968.76,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1081.341,1082.331,I’m not either.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1101.373,1101.861,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1101.861,1105.297,"Now, how could the state have proved motive?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1111.045,1111.831,That’s correct.
1968.76,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1111.831,1112.831,"Now, how could they--"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1112.831,1113.445,A different woman here.
1968.76,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1113.445,1114.652,Sir?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1114.652,1116.461,This was a different woman.
1968.76,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1116.461,1117.725,This was a different woman?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1117.725,1118.101,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1118.101,1120.052,"Oh, yes."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1120.052,1123.225,"Absolutely, a different woman at that time."
1968.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1123.225,1124.988,"In a different state, wasn’t it?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1124.988,1126.053,"No, same state."
1968.76,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1126.053,1126.775,Same state?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1126.775,1127.384,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.384,1134.427,"But, here, he’s now been convicted for killing a different woman than the one that he had the-- this alleged motive for killing."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1134.427,1134.895,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.895,1135.386,Yes.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1135.386,1137.463,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1183.814,1187.453,But you still don’t have any authority to afford this.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1187.453,1198.075,We don’t have any authorities to come before Your Honor and say “I know that I can point to such and such a decision” and say this is a basis of it.
1968.76,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1198.075,1215.032,"No, I mean, you don’t have the authority to say that you can raised in this Court, for the first time, a federal question that was not raised nor decided nor-- not raised, submitted, nor decided by the State Court."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1215.032,1215.757,I do not.
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.899,1261.889,"But, I suppose there remains-- still remains a federal forum you can get this question cited."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1261.889,1273.555,"Well, in the event, our rights of appeal would be terminated because we came up here in the normal course of the appellant review."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1274.501,1275.115,I’m not--
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1275.115,1281.015,Resort to habeas corpus in the Federal Court system to present the issue.
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1298.094,1310.289,"The Louisiana statute that the Court relied on, do you find that sort of a statute in other states?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1310.289,1313.646,The statute in connection with the entirety of a confession?
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1313.646,1315.342,Yes.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1315.342,1322.184,"We have not researched this one from a standpoint of other states, but my recollection is that there are some which have a similar statute."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1322.184,1328.522,"Which Louisiana has a different historical background, doesn’t it, in its--"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1328.522,1329.811,Not in a criminal law area.
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1329.811,1330.762,Doesn’t it?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1330.762,1336.177,Louisiana has a different historical background from a standpoint of development of the law in the civil law area.
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1336.177,1337.367,Only in the civil law area?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1337.367,1337.943,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.046,1347.023,That’s interesting.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1352.709,1355.949,"Oh Yes, sir, absolutely."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1499.002,1516.019,"I suppose the purpose of the statute that requires that if any part of the confession is offered by the prosecution, then the entirety must be offered was, at least arguably, to protect the defendant in the case, wasn’t it?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1516.019,1522.996,"Well, there isn’t any doubt in my mind, but that this was the intent of the statute."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1577.137,1578.864,Is this a written confession?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1578.864,1580.105,"No, sir, it was not."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.591,1583.665,When he was arrested in some other state.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1583.665,1583.778,Yes.
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.778,1587.081,"Oral confession to the law enforcement officers over there, the arresting officers."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1587.081,1589.922,That is correct.
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1611.76,1614.541,"This-- your client is under sentence of death, is he?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1614.541,1615.263,"Yes, sir, he is."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1617.067,1625.957,Suppose you said that Spencer against Texas was a case decided after the trial of this case?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1625.957,1628.652,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1628.652,1639.704,"Which explains, you say, why you didn’t raise this point as a constitutional point during the course of the trial or the appeals through the Courts of Louisiana."
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1652.061,1653.312,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.312,1655.478,We’ve got that kind of a claim in this case?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1655.478,1658.696,"Yes, sir, we do."
1968.76,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1658.696,1662.036,Just a question.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1680.772,1683.272,"May I just state this to the Court, if Your Honor please."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.598,1709.846,"Isn’t it also clear, however, that you did raise a good number of federal issues?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1709.846,1710.059,"Oh, yes."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1710.059,1712.174,For both the Trial Court and the State Supreme Court.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1712.174,1712.943,"Absolutely, sir."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.943,1715.155,And had them decided in the State Supreme Court.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1715.155,1715.912,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1715.912,1718.589,But you didn’t bring any of them here?
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1718.589,1720.121,"No, sir, not those."
1968.76,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.121,1724.961,And it’s-- the only one you brought here was one that you never took to State Court.
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1724.961,1726.27,That’s correct.
1968.76,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1731.818,1732.575,"And, what’s your ground?"
1968.76,1,37134,nathan_greenberg,,1737.671,1738.144,That’s correct.
1968.76,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1738.144,1740.315,I gather this is neither.

1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,1784.834,1788.35,"If Your Honor please, I represent the state in this matter."
1968.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1811.945,1814.168,"What would say-- you mean, that Spencer --"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,1814.168,1814.338,Spencer was --
1968.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1814.338,1815.893,Was available at the time of argument.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,1815.893,1818.899,Almost been for a year when we argued the case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana.
1968.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1818.899,1821.283,"And, Spencer was not relied on--"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,1821.283,1821.487,"No, sir."
1968.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1821.487,1822.551,Either in brief or in oral?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,1822.551,1823.74,Spencer was not relied on.
1968.76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.422,1878.652,"There was also a Schmerber point, wasn’t there?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,1878.652,1879.208,Sir?
1968.76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1879.208,1881.494,A Schmerber point?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,1881.494,1881.78,"I don’t recall, sir."
1968.76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.78,1885.421,But your Supreme Court relied on Schmerber v. California.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,1885.421,1889.86,"Yes, well they were-- it’s one of the cases that-- it’s a California case about the drunken driver."
1968.76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1892.199,1894.505,And had to do with hair and the blood of the victim?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,1894.505,1894.839,"Right, sir."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2121.207,2122.384,Where are you in the appendix?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2122.94,2124.292,That’s-- I’m not in the appendix.
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2124.292,2124.858,I see.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2124.858,2126.791,"This is on page 5 of my brief, sir."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2126.791,2127.183,I see.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2128.686,2129.931,"“Yes, he did."
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2138.684,2142.048,What was the preceding question about that?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2142.048,2148.165,They asked him if wel-- weather or not he had walked in this-- I’ll just put it this way now.
1968.76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.891,2193.605,Was there is a specific question and direct examination that calls for this prior crime?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2193.605,2194.916,There may have been.
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2232.484,2234.823,Why did you make that?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2234.823,2244.869,"Well, sir, we did this-- we-- in the introduction of this evidence, we go on a-- went on a two-pronged attack in so far as the introduction."
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.084,2263.162,And do you agree with the type of petition that that is for the protection of the defendant?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2263.162,2264.172,"Well, I’ll say this."
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2273.733,2274.191,"Well, couldn’t --"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2274.191,2274.345,It's meant --
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2274.345,2277.121,He waive that protection?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2277.121,2279.574,There is no provision to waive that protection.
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2279.574,2280.128,"Well, didn’t --"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2280.128,2280.234,The --
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.234,2281.406,He object?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2281.406,2282.265,"He objected, yes, sir."
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2282.265,2286.021,"Well, wasn’t that as far as he could go toward waiving it?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2286.021,2288.231,"I suppose he could go toward waiving it, yes, sir, but the state statute --"
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2288.231,2292.495,"Well, my final question is, did it help him?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2292.495,2293.709,The waive -- objection?
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.709,2297.972,"No, I -- didn’t this testimony help the defendant?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2297.972,2300.1,"No, sir."
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2300.1,2302.005,"So, you weren’t helping him, were you?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2302.005,2302.297,"No, sir."
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2304.357,2309.985,You were giving the jury -- the theory that this man was the type of man who went around murdering women.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2309.985,2310.549,"No, sir."
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2310.912,2312.207,Isn’t that what you did?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2312.207,2313.949,"Well, Mr. Justice, I’ll say this."
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2339.959,2340.108,That --
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2340.108,2341.446,This was one of those instances --
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.446,2343.549,That he made a business of murdering women?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2343.549,2345.773,That’s what I -- when you look at the circumstances--
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.773,2347.848,Is that what you -- the impression you were giving the jury?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2347.848,2349.39,"Well, again, the circumstance is so."
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2372.079,2375.247,"So, you’re not leaving -- you’re not relying on the statute."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2375.247,2376.723,"Sir, we had two bases."
1968.76,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.803,2381.575,I see.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2381.575,2386.573,"Now, this is the man’s statement, if I get back to it."
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2485.629,2509.058,"May I ask you as a matter of practice in Louisiana where you have a man under interrogation for hours, as happens in all states, do you, in presenting your case to the jury, relate everything that happened in those-- during those hours?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2509.058,2511.262,"Yes, sir, I would for this reason, and this is --"
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2511.262,2511.356,I’m --
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2511.356,2511.604,This --
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2511.604,2513.903,I’m not asking what you would.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2513.903,2514.717,This we did do in our office --
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2514.717,2517.449,"I’m asking you, as a practice, if that is done."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2517.449,2520.135,"In our area, yes, sir, for this reason."
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2561.594,2574.287,"Did you, at the time you took the confession by questioning the review of the man’s life and get all of the sort of things that might have occurred in his life and then attach that to the --"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2574.287,2575.552,"Well, you see, if Your Honor --"
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2575.552,2577.628,Confession and introduce it?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2577.628,2580.32,"If the Chief Justice would please, this is not that kind of a case."
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2586.859,2588.186,"Well, that’s his background."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2588.186,2589.272,This is background to this third lie.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2589.272,2593.064,"Yes, but this is not a question for them to ask him questions concerning this."
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2618.746,2630.811,"That so, would you make a distinction between the application of a Louisiana statute to a written confession and to this kind of a situation?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2651.3,2652.106,"Correct, sir."
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2652.106,2668.97,"Now, is there a distinction in the application of the Louisiana statute between that kind of situation and a written confession with respect to what is appropriate and what’s not appropriate?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2668.97,2669.619,"No, sir, there’s no distinction."
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2669.619,2676.1,"As a matter of commonsense, it would seem that maybe you could make such a distinction."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2676.1,2679.15,There is no distinction made in the jurisprudence of the state.
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2679.15,2706.189,"Yes, I noticed here that, actually, the state knew about the previous offense and its relationship with this other woman, as appears on page 509 of the typed transcript, that that was elicited by -- from the police officer, the Tucson police officer, by question of the prosecuting attorney."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2706.189,2716.716,"Yes, as I said before, if Your Honor please, they had given the background when this was mentioned in the old case in which we had to mention, in order to have it, appear in the trial and use it."
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2761.037,2761.405,Well I suppose --
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2761.405,2762.468,To go ahead and object.
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2762.468,2769.691,"Yes, I understand, but I suppose that it’s at least arguable that the question is, what is the confession?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2806.526,2813.939,"Well, the theory behind this particular statute, as I view it, sir, is the fact that they don’t give me, as a prosecutor, the discretion to say what I should or should not put in."
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2813.939,2828.575,"I understand that but, on the other hand, the question is whether that statute should -- has a different implication with respect to a written confession."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2828.575,2828.963,"No, sir, it --"
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2828.963,2834.335,"Or -- and, with respect to what the policeman says now."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2847.699,2848.582,"Correct, sir, it’s part of --"
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2848.582,2855.933,"Because everything he said is part of the confession, whether it properly relates to this crime or not."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2855.933,2857.799,"Correct, sir, that’s what the statute says and that’s the way --"
1968.76,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2857.799,2868.429,"Well that’s impossible and, I suppose, that it would be impossible for the police officer to do that and maybe if they taped every word he said, the defendant said, they could do it."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2868.429,2882.089,"Of course, if Your Honor please, he doesn’t have to say every word, but of course he has to give the -- a substance under the jurisprudence but he cannot leave out items such as that that he figures to be irrelevant under the state statute."
1968.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2882.089,2893.182,"No, but after the statute, what it says is it has to be a confession, an admission, or a declaration, and it has to be something that the prosecutor intends to use."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2904.171,2904.757,"Correct, sir."
1968.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2904.757,2906.17,That’s what your Court has said.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2906.17,2906.59,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2906.59,2914.245,"I suppose we’re concluded by that so far as this testimony of the Tucson officer is concerned, aren’t we?"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2916.001,2917.033,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2917.033,2918.036,Can I ask you a question.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2924.149,2928.467,"Our State Court, if Your Honor please, considered it under Title 15."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2929.083,2929.537,What does it say?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2929.537,2941.823,"And also, we have two other statutes which we’ve mentioned with respect to the admissibility of previous offenses when they tend to show motive, mode of operation, guilty, knowledge, and so forth and so on --"
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2941.823,2942.151,Did they--
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2942.151,2946.617,Within the traditional cases that this Court has recognized.
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2946.617,2951.008,But the Courts considered it at the last --
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,2951.008,2958.552,"No, sir, the Trial Court ruled that it had to come in on the basis that it was part of the confession, and our State Supreme Court did not go."
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2999.165,3000.986,Finish your sentence.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3000.986,3002.595,"It’s been on the books for many, many years."
1968.76,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3017.188,3019.155,"We’ll recess now, Mr. Hufft."
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3019.155,3021.446,"Thank you, sir."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3235.134,3247.242,Your view is under the (Inaudible).
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3247.242,3248.456,"Yes, sir, that’s our position."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3248.456,3252.246,Let me ask you this.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3265.851,3266.323,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3270.4,3270.935,Yes?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3270.935,3271.679,"Yes, sir."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3272.829,3276.55,Do you think any other than involuntary statements?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3276.55,3279.863,"Yes, it’s a general rule with respect to any --"
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3279.863,3281.232,All statutes say that?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3281.232,3281.641,"Right, sir."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3281.641,3298.481,"It’s construed in this case then that before a county can issue the instruction of that statute, they must consider, in general, the statute with respect to other involuntary statements saying that he wasn’t --"
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3298.481,3303.052,"Yes, if it’s part of the confession, it has to be introduced."
1968.76,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3303.052,3306.913,You said those other earlier cases in order to dissent from the --
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3306.913,3307.505,"Well, yes, sir."
1968.76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.174,3342.358,Didn’t you reach that?
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3342.358,3342.776,"No, sir."
1968.76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3344.565,3348.101,It didn’t say touch.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3348.101,3349.29,My brief says --
1968.76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.29,3351.277,The constitution is a little late.
1968.76,2,37981,preston_h_hufft,,3352.045,3352.407,"No, sir."
1968.76,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.302,3362.938,Do you object to our deciding this case under jurisdiction?
