1986.84-2022,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.511,"We will hear arguments first this afternoon in No. 84-2022, 324 Liquor Corporation doing business as Yorkshire Wine and Spirits versus Thomas Duffy."
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,17.837,27.364,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this afternoon I would like to establish three points in my argument."
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.97,153.735,The bottle price is a real price.
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,158.201,160.109,"Yes, Justice--"
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.109,162.544,"In which case he wouldn't be a wholesaler, I suppose."
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,162.544,165.011,"--Well, yes, Justice Scalia."
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,165.011,166.933,"Who do you charge the bottle price to, anyway?"
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,168.683,178.226,He would charge the bottle price to the retailer in the event that the retailer sought to acquire his liquor in less than case lots.
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.226,181.395,If he buys one and a half cases he gets half a case at the bottle price.
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,181.395,182.77,"Yes, I believe so."
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.041,217.288,But it is still not theoretically just a made up resale price that the wholesaler can impose without any real world consequences to himself.
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,225.503,227.832,I would accept the first portion of your proposition.
1986.84-2022,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.646,468.876,"Mr. Kantor, is it your position that the 21st Amendment will never justify a state interest in the protection of retailers?"
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,468.876,471.922,"Justice O'Connor, it is not my position."
1986.84-2022,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,495.663,501.223,Under the 21st Amendment you would concede that a state could properly protect retailers?
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,501.223,513.53,"Yes, I would concede that if the state, for example, were to put in place a mechanism whereby the state determined the liquor prices, that would not cause my problem."
1986.84-2022,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,560.889,569.042,"Well, there is much more of a record here than in Midcal of an effect of helping retailers."
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,573.713,580.367,--I don't know that I would agree that there is more of a record here about preservation of small retailers.
1986.84-2022,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,629.816,633.987,"But if it didn't violate the Sherman Act you wouldn't have any trouble anyway, would you?"
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,642.187,649.935,Presumably the state might be able to do something that might otherwise violate the Sherman Act if it actively supervised what went on.
1986.84-2022,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,678.642,696.526,"But that may be a sufficient argument, and I gather the Court of Appeals agreed with you, to dispel the state action exemption, the Parker against Brown, but that still doesn't answer, by itself doesn't answer the 21st Amendment question, does it?"
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,696.526,701.04,"No, but there are two parts to a 21st Amendment question, Your honor."
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,761.984,766.717,Surely they lose business to other brands.
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,776.572,785.788,"Well, they don't... they clearly don't lose any business to other brands because apparently everybody engages in parallel behavior."
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.557,820.18,On Smirnoff in particular?
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,820.18,821.274,--Because--
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.274,822.665,"Yes, but what about other vodka?"
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,827.147,845.031,"--Well, the answer to that, Your Honor, is that the wholesaler of let's say Gordon's Vodka when he sets his minimum resale price through setting the bottle price, obviously casts an eye over what his rivals are doing vis-a-vis Smirnoff Vodka."
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.031,848.016,There has to be some smart fellow who figures he will sell a lot more at a lower price.
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,851.371,857.526,"Well, Your Honor, many of these dealers don't, have one brand of vodka, they have numerous brands of vodka, so there is an element of horizontality here."
1986.84-2022,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.834,878.47,"Anyway, I gather resale price maintenance is per se invalid, whether or not it in fact restricts trade."
1986.84-2022,0,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,878.939,884.391,"That is what this Court has said, and that is what I understand to be the law."
1986.84-2022,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.904,901.134,"We will hear now from you, Mr. Cannon."
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,901.134,915.097,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it, please the Court, in Midcal this Court confronted a state statutory scheme it found to be a per se violation of the Sherman Act."
1986.84-2022,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.419,1013.665,Are you denying that if the wholesaler sells to the retailer in less than a case he has to charge the bottle price?
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1015.586,1016.852,"--Justice Scalia, no."
1986.84-2022,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.679,1020.132,Okay.
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1021.897,1023.365,--Pardon me?
1986.84-2022,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.365,1026.753,You are just saying he doesn't in fact sell in less than case lots.
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1026.753,1031.69,"Well, it is certainly possible, as Mr. Kantor said, in rare situations to sell in less than cases."
1986.84-2022,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.751,1065.317,"The only purpose of my question was distinguishing this case from the normal resale price maintenance, where the price established is simply a price at which the retailer will sell to the customer, and it has no other independent validation whatever, whereas here the bottle price is really in theory, at least, the price at which the bottle will be sold by the wholesaler to the retailer."
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1065.317,1078.453,"But only in theory, Your Honor, and the problem with the statute here is by allowing the wholesaler to independently set the bottle price as opposed to the case price, there is no necessary correlation."
1986.84-2022,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.223,1154.828,"Is that essential, Mr. Cannon, for us to conclude that there may be at least some connection between protecting small retailers and the New York statute."
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1158.124,1160.919,"--Well, Your Honor, I assume it is not absolutely essential."
1986.84-2022,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.97,1205.792,"The legislature... supposing this appeal were brought a month after the statute was passed, regardless of anything conceivable you would surely make the same statement."
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1211.57,1220.021,"Your Honor, it is important to recognize here that the interest of the state is effectuating a private price-fixing scheme."
1986.84-2022,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1237.047,1245.558,"Why is it that the state has a heavy burden, because the statute, as you put it, flies directly in the face of the Sherman Act?"
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1249.744,1263.458,"Well, Your Honor, if in fact, the state chose to protect small retailers in another manner such as the law in New York which prohibits any retail liquor store owner from having more than one outlet."
1986.84-2022,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.658,1272.86,The state needn't worry about the situations where it doesn't have a Sherman Act violation.
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1284.668,1293.929,"Well, Your Honor, again, it depends on the type of statute or the type of manner in which the state is trying to advance the interest in protecting small retailers."
1986.84-2022,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.902,1338.02,I take it you say this is really no different than if the state didn't have a statute and the wholesalers just made agreements with retailers.
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1338.02,1338.817,"Your Honor, yes."
1986.84-2022,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.017,1359.09,"Yes, and it would be no different... this case is no different than if the state had merely authorized the... but not required the wholesalers to set the retailers' price."
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1359.09,1362.074,Authorized but not required?
1986.84-2022,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.525,1370.447,"I understand, yes."
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1370.447,1372.244,--That would be quite a different thing.
1986.84-2022,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.615,1384.644,So a law that permits the wholesaler to set the retailer's price establishes a--
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1384.644,1386.598,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1986.84-2022,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1398.0,1404.889,--What would you say to a state statute that simply provided a minimum markup of 12 percent over what the retailer paid the wholesaler?
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1404.889,1413.775,"Justice Stevens, that is quite a different matter in that the discretion afforced to the private parties would be far less, and in fact the parties would have no--"
1986.84-2022,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1413.775,1414.603,I understand it is different.
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1417.524,1421.851,"--I think it certainly comes much closer to being protected under the state action doctrine, much closer."
1986.84-2022,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.851,1422.164,I understand it comes closer.
1986.84-2022,1,44255,w_stephen_cannon,,1428.411,1432.518,"I don't know, Your Honor, but I would simply say that it would come much closer to state action."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1549.879,1576.462,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court is whether New York may impose a statutory minimum markup on retail liquor prices when that statute which prohibits below cost pricing operates entirely within the state and involves no concerted action between independent entities."
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1718.578,1723.78,But does it depose the 12 percent... does it decide what the 12 percent markup shall be imposed on?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1723.78,1729.325,"Under the statute, yes, it provides a--"
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.325,1729.903,It fixes the bottle price?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1731.776,1753.064,--The state set forth a detailed statutory scheme for establishing the bottle price in which the wholesaler has very limited ability to change and can only change in accordance with those statutory commands.
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.064,1756.719,That mainly governs the time when he makes the change or the announcement.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1761.484,1790.893,"Under the statute he can only raise his price if the manufacturer's price to the wholesaler changes or if its labor costs or other operating costs go up and it secures the permission of the state enforcement agency, the SLA, to make that change, but the wholesaler has no freedom under the statute to change--"
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.893,1792.267,What about setting it initially?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1792.267,1809.793,"--Well, for the bulk of the prices under the statute those prices were set by the state in 1967 when it froze the percentage markup over manufacturers' prices."
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.799,1830.424,You say he can't change it after that except?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1830.424,1836.158,"Except in accordance with the provisions of the statute, for example--"
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.158,1839.0,"Which is what, that he is charged a higher price by the manufacturer?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1839.0,1842.559,--If the manufacturer raises its price to the wholesale--
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.559,1842.934,Right.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1842.934,1850.338,--then the wholesaler can raise its price by an equivalent percentage.
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.694,1867.285,"Well, how did the promotional situations that are at issue in this case arise?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1867.285,1902.068,"--Two years after the statute was enacted, the state enforcement agency, the SLA, promulgated a bulletin which permitted the wholesaler to conduct temporary sales as an exception from the normal operation of the statute as construed by the SLA and Rule l6, which mandates that the case and the bottle price under the statute be linked lockstep with only that breakage charge differentiating."
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.068,1909.393,"What prices have we just been talking about that can't be altered, the case price or the bottle price or both?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1909.393,1913.221,"Both, under the statute, as opposed to the bulletin."
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.221,1917.265,"Yes, but you can't say the bulletin doesn't interpret the statute, do you?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1922.012,1927.089,"Well, we are faced here with a facial attack on the statute."
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.089,1927.464,I understand.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1928.23,1928.667,Under the--
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.667,1929.417,Would you answer my question?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1929.417,1929.697,--Yes.
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.697,1934.368,Should we assume that the bulletin is a correct construction of the statute or an incorrect construction of the statute?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1934.368,1948.035,"It is a correct application of the SLA's power to make exceptions in the statute, and that is... from the normal operation, and that is exactly how the court below construed it."
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.361,1958.844,"Well, you can say that a statute that allows such exceptions is facially invalid."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1964.795,1974.088,"--It is true that the SLA on the face of the statute has the power to make exceptions, yes, from the statute."
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1974.839,1979.071,Including an exception of this sort that would allow you to fix whatever price you want for bottles.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,1979.071,2007.325,"That's correct, but in construing a facial attack on the statute on the antitrust laws this Court has made clear that it will strike it on preemption grounds only if that statute mandates or authorizes conduct which is going to be a per se violation in all cases, and the statute doesn't permit violation of the antitrust laws."
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.325,2018.618,In your view what was it that violated the antitrust laws in Midcal?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2018.618,2032.316,"In Midcal, in Midcal the Court focused on California's statutory requirement that parties enter into fair trade contracts."
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.769,2033.503,They didn't need to do that.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2038.579,2042.218,"--That is correct, but the--"
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.218,2050.06,"And all the retailers did was post their prices, and that became the wholesale price."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2062.304,2071.27,--The aspect of the resale price maintenance scheme in Midcal that was a per se violation was the fair trade contract.
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.27,2077.221,I just suggest to you that the wholesalers didn't need to enter into fair trade contracts.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2078.549,2080.204,That's correct.
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.685,2131.215,What you are suggesting is that Midcal was just wrong.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2131.215,2139.993,--To the extent that Midcal is read to apply as well to the price schedules this Court would decide it differently today.
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.993,2143.929,"Well, that is what... isn't that exactly what the fact was in Midcal?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2143.929,2152.097,"In Midcal there was, according to the state court--"
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.097,2157.845,The wholesaler could either bring in these contracts or post a schedule of resale prices.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2157.845,2158.892,--That's correct.
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.494,2183.133,So you are suggesting that we just went off the deep end in Midcal.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2184.085,2213.152,"--I would suggest that that, if it is read, Midcal is read that broadly, this Court would, squarely faced with the issue, would decide it differently, and that is exactly what this Court has made clear in Monsanto and Copperweld and in Fisher itself, that in order to establish a violation of the Section 1 you must have a meeting of the minds."
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2225.023,2227.71,"Mr. Hall, do you think we have also overruled the Schwegmann case?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2227.71,2230.912,--No.
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.802,2233.271,There is no meeting of the mind there.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2237.206,2261.4,"--Well, as Justice Douglas's opinion makes clear, there was concerted action by the distributors together using their fair trade contract which had been exempted under the Miller-Tidings law as a club to coerce the retailer."
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.554,2279.347,"All you needed in Schwegmann was one resale contract that bound the whole trade, and that was the coercive power of government was part of what was at stake, just as it was in Midcal."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2284.314,2290.373,"--But in Schwegmann the entire... well, the entire enforcement was by private parties."
1986.84-2022,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2314.269,2329.029,"Well, Mr. Halls do you thinks for instance, a state could pass a law telling all steel producers that they had to charge the price as set by U.S. Steel and just conduct a complete end run around the Sherman Antitrust Act?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2329.029,2332.122,There would be--
1986.84-2022,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2332.122,2339.119,"That seems to be the thrust of your argument, and I am not sure that an agreement by private parties is necessary."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2348.022,2387.819,"--Section 1, according to its plain language, as this Court found in Copperweld, addresses only concerted action, action which involves a meeting of the minds between... where the state there is unilaterally imposing that price requirement on private parties, even though that may be a gap in the Section l's coverage of restraints of trade, nothing in Section 1 reaches out to cover that."
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.819,2401.049,"In order to find that a state law is preempted by the Sherman Act and is incompatible with the Sherman Act, do we have to find that the state law violates the Sherman Act?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2413.557,2415.713,"Yes, you go, Justice Scalia."
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2444.952,2448.201,The conduct that it authorizes or requires must be.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2448.201,2449.528,That's correct.
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.528,2454.197,Not the law violates the Sherman Act.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2454.197,2460.679,The conduct... here there is no... under the statute--
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.679,2467.881,But the statute ends up being unenforceable because the conduct violates the Sherman Act.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2467.881,2470.832,--But there is no such conduct here.
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.377,2478.188,If we disregard Midcal you are right.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2478.188,2498.477,"--To the extent that Midcal was read to apply to the price schedules, but if you look at the language in Midcal, Page 102, this Court was addressing the effect of the repeal of Miller Tidings Act on fair trade contracts, and that is exactly the language it was using in--"
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.477,2502.881,"On Midcal all you needed was one fair trade contract, too, wasn't it?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2505.661,2514.58,"--That's correct, but there was at least some concerted action under that aspect of the statute which would--"
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.58,2519.952,"By one... at most by one retailer, even if they went the fair trace contract route."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2519.952,2536.15,"--That's correct, but looking at the New York statute here there simply is no agreement between wholesaler and retailer."
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.15,2545.131,"No, but the difference between this case and your Berkeley rent case is, there a public decisionmaker made a decision that affected the entire market."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2560.235,2561.343,"Well, the entire--"
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.343,2563.546,"And you had that in Midcal, and you had that in Schwegmann."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2563.546,2574.823,--But in Berkeley the entire ordinance was based on privately set prices which the ordinance--
1986.84-2022,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.823,2575.573,Has been for themselves.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2591.612,2595.392,--Under the statute we do.
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.655,2653.572,Do you think that Midcal decided that the conduct authorized in the California statute violated the Sherman Act?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2653.572,2661.616,--In Midcal the Court did assume a violation when it was discussing the Sherman--
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.616,2662.694,"Assumed, assumed, but did it decide it?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2662.694,2663.741,--discussing the 21st Amendment.
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.741,2665.896,Did it decide it or it just assumed it?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2665.896,2674.736,"No, it reached a decision that there was a violation of the Sherman Act."
1986.84-2022,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2743.444,2746.083,What if we think there is a violation?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2746.083,2766.543,--If this Court does consider that there is a violation then it would engage in balancing under the method set forth in Justice Brennan's unanimous opinion in Capital Cities where the state's interests are closely related to its 21st Amendment power.
1986.84-2022,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2786.677,2792.315,"Well, Midcal didn't seem to treat it as part of the core power in its discussion, did it?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2792.315,2813.587,--In Midcal this Court gave great weight to the state court's conclusions about state law and the state interest as well as great deference to the factual findings of the California court because that is what it does in the absence of exceptional circumstances.
1986.84-2022,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2906.66,2916.359,Could the state have met its goal of helping retailers by having simply a minimum markup statute in place?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2916.359,2923.247,--The state can meet its statutory goals under a simple minimum markup.
1986.84-2022,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2928.558,2943.412,Is there anything in the record then to justify the additional provision in New York for the price maintenance scheme as opposed to a minimum markup?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2943.412,2950.895,--There is nothing directly in the record on the necessity for the bulletin.
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.865,2992.817,"Mr. Hall, why don't you argue that this is just a minimum markup law?"
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,2994.956,3006.749,"That is exactly what the statute is, and that is exactly what we did argue in our brief, that this is exactly like minimum markup laws in other states, which have never been held to be per se violations."
1986.84-2022,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3006.749,3018.619,It requires a minimum markup on the bottle price but it is still just a minimum... is still just a requirement for a markup on whatever price the wholesaler sets.
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,3018.619,3023.289,Exactly and that is exactly the argument we--
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.289,3026.428,"Yes, but a markup usually means a markup on what he pays, not on what he says."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,3037.455,3065.615,"--Under the statute it is directly related to the price that he pays with the only difference the $1.92 per case breakage charge, but that is a statutory formula that New York used under its markup law, just as each state with a minimum markup law has chosen its own statutory formula for defining cost and which factors go into it."
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.755,3070.614,"No, they are not equally artificial."
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,3085.358,3092.916,--Under the statute it bears a direct relationship as distinct from the bulletin.
1986.84-2022,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3094.229,3096.352,The statute as distinct from the bulletin?
1986.84-2022,2,19171,christopher_keith_hall,,3096.352,3105.208,--Under the statute the bottle price and the case price are the same except for the imposition of a breakage charge.
1986.84-2022,3,17789,bertram_k_kantor,,3224.287,3227.691,"Unless the Court has further questions, I have no further argument."
1986.84-2022,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3227.691,3229.363,Very well.
