2015.14-232,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.019,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-232, Harris v. The Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission. Mr. Hearne."
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,10.019,79.505,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The one-person, one-vote principle of the Equal Protection Clause requires an apportionment authority to make a good-faith effort to equally apportion the population as -- as practically as possible, and while deviations are tolerated, they are only minor deviations made for legitimate purposes of a rational State policy intended not to be discriminatory or arbitrary. Here, the Arizona Redistricting Commission malapportioned Arizona State legislature by almost 10 percent, 8.8 percent, and the district court below found it did so for two reasons. The first reason was to obtain a partisan advantage for the Democrat party. The second reason was a perceived belief that malapportioned districts were necessary to obtain Justice Department preclearance approval. Neither of these reasons justifies a deviation from the constitutional principle of one person, one vote."
2015.14-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,79.505,80.39,Mr. Hearne --
2015.14-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,80.39,96.96,"The second part, do -- do you want us -- do you want us to overturn the factual finding that compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the -- the preclearance procedures, was the reason -- real reason for the deviation? Do you want us to overturn that as a factual finding?"
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,96.96,98.79,"No, I don't, as a factual finding."
2015.14-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,114.725,144.36,"May I ask you a -- a question? It's -- it's odd that you're making this charge that there was an impermissible effort to increase the Democratic authority, power, in the legislature, but the end result was that the Arizona plan gave Republicans more than their proportionate share of seats in the State legislature."
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,165.8,185.225,"Well, we would say, Your Honor, that a -- an incompetent gerrymander is no less a gerrymander when it unequally apportions the population than a competent gerrymander that obtained the partisan objective. I think the objective that we are trying to achieve here is the one-person, one-vote standard."
2015.14-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.56,215.29,"It -- it -- it's still not clear to me what -- what you want us to say about the -- the Commission's rationale for compliance and Voting Rights Act compliance that was wrong as a matter of law, because if you don't overturn the factual finding that they had a -- a good-faith belief that what they were doing is correct, then -- then you have -- then you have a problem, it seems to me. Or do you have a problem?"
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,215.29,233.71,"I don't believe I do, because I think it's not -- the good-faith -- what the district court found was that their advisor told them, you can depopulate districts up to 10 percent, and in fact, you should do that because you need to create these under-populated minority districts to obtain preclearance. That is wrong."
2015.14-232,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,246.03,265.04,"Well, I -- how confident are you of that? I mean, the -- the preclearance process at the Department of Justice is famously opaque, and usually the States and municipalities have to go through or had to go through several layers of back and forth, here's a proposal -- it's sort of a bargaining process."
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,269.195,275.9,"We certainly agree that the preclearance process was very opaque, as you said, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.14-232,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.935,330.045,So they were mistaken.
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,353.56,355.59,"Well, I think you have to look at, actually, both."
2015.14-232,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.83,363.84,So let's assume the answer to that is no.
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,363.84,364.74,Right.
2015.14-232,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.74,378.36,"But the people who -- who made this apportionment were mistaken, and they thought that it allowed and indeed may require you to do that. So? That doesn't show a bad motive on their part, does it?"
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,378.36,386.29,"No, but I don't think this Court's ever held that bad legal advice justifies a constitutional violation, which in this case that's what they're saying is the --"
2015.14-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,386.29,390.584,"Well, bad legal advice is different from an impermissible motive."
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,390.584,391.98,"Well, we have a --"
2015.14-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.98,395.77,Justice Scalia is asking what -- what -- what the test -- what is the test here?
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,395.77,431.15,"Well, I would say this case, as the district court noted, and all three judges split on what the burden of proof was, is a mixed-motive case where you have one assumed illegitimate motive, partisan advantage, and you have another motive which is, oh, it's okay because we needed to do this because our advisor said that was necessary for preclearance. Then I think it -- the task falls to the Commission to justify, under this Court's decisions in Mt. Healthy and Arlington Heights standard of a mixed-motive case to justify, oh, this was necessary in fact to comply with that. And that was not done."
2015.14-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,431.15,432.55,And -- and it was more than mixed motive.
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,439.935,446.78,"Two of the judges, Judge Clifton and Judge Silver, did find that that was a predominant motive or primary motive."
2015.14-232,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.78,453.69,And that's a -- that's a fact-finding which you -- you have a burden if you're seeking to overturn it.
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,453.69,481.88,"But they also found that there was another illegitimate motive that they assumed -- Judge Silver doesn't necessarily agree, but she assumed, for purposes of decision, that this partisan advantage was a illegitimate motive. So you have a case where this body is unconstitutionally departing from one-person, one-vote. They come forward with two explanations, one illegitimate, one supposedly legitimate: This preclearance based on erroneous legal advice."
2015.14-232,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,486.67,499.7,"Just to pin this down a -- a little bit, Mr. Hearne: You -- you are not contesting the factual finding that the predominant motive was to comply with the Voting Rights Act; is that right?"
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,499.7,503.76,We -- we take the -- the factual findings from the district court.
2015.14-232,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,522.0,536.585,"Well, you keep on saying mixed motive, and I guess people keep on coming back to you and just trying to figure out whether you are in fact or not in fact contesting that -- that the predominant motive was the Voting Rights Act."
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,536.585,540.5,"The -- when -- when we say the Voting Rights Act -- again, I want to make my position clear --"
2015.14-232,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,540.5,542.58,Was the attempt to comply with the Voting Rights Act?
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,542.58,542.87,Correct.
2015.14-232,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,542.87,550.75,"And this -- and the -- and the court found, and it is a factual finding, that that's the predominant motive? And I don't mean to harangue you on this."
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,553.04,553.275,No.
2015.14-232,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,606.765,611.79,You -- I'm -- I'm even further confused.
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,622.435,624.635,"That's absolutely correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-232,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,624.635,647.61,"Now, I understand there's one case you're relying on that was summarily affirmed, but is there any other case from this Court that has ever said that a -- a deviation of this amount is significant? I think we've always called it anything below 9 percent de minimis, correct?"
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,647.61,673.48,"What the Court has said, as I read the jurisprudence, is that a deviation of over 10 percent is prima facie constitutional, and the statements justify it. If it's a deviation of less than 10 percent, the obligation is on the party challenging it to come forward and present some evidence showing that it is done for an arbitrary or discriminatory purpose. That's what we understand that standard to be out of Brown v. Thomson."
2015.14-232,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,677.1,679.24,I -- I don't actually understand.
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,686.775,689.83,"Well, I think two -- I have two responses to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.14-232,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,726.79,730.06,"Well, in fact, they have."
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,736.655,742.035,It is certainly -- it certainly appeared in some of the district court decisions --
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,742.035,744.31,-- that -- that's -- that they have looked at that.
2015.14-232,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,746.28,763.52,"What it says, actually, in Brown v. Thomson, it says our decisions have established, as a general matter, that an apportionate plan with a maximum population deviation under 10 percent falls within this category of minor deviations."
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,789.51,789.955,Right.
2015.14-232,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,789.955,791.94,"Now, what do you think you have to do?"
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,791.94,812.08,"Well, I think we have to do, Justice Breyer, what we did, which is to come to the court -- to come to a district court and to present to them evidence which the district court found of you have a deviation that, though minor, is done for an illegitimate purpose. And yes, there was this other pretext of the preclearance issue."
2015.14-232,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,820.035,830.265,Why bother having a minor? Don't you think this will lead every single plan to be challenged as voter dilution?
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,830.265,831.44,"Well, no."
2015.14-232,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,838.97,839.81,You didn't show that.
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,847.325,863.76,"Well, I think in this case, this -- this case is a very unique case because, as Judge Wake found in his dissent, the chart shows statistically that there was systematic, partisan malapportionment done for that partisan reason."
2015.14-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.68,867.85,Looking at the chart at 112a of the appendix?
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,867.85,868.48,Yes.
2015.14-232,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,873.68,875.175,It's got the color chart.
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,875.175,877.435,Yes.
2015.14-232,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,888.15,906.11,"But I -- I thought -- I -- I thought, Mr. Hearne, that you were saying that the -- that the thing that you had presented had to do with an impermissible motive, and the impermissible motive was that they didn't have to do all this for Voting Rights Act compliance; is that right?"
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,906.11,914.69,"I'd say there's two -- the -- the first impermissible motive or illegitimate justification is partisanship, to gain an advantage --"
2015.14-232,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,914.69,914.98,Right.
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,924.0,924.64,That was --
2015.14-232,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,924.64,948.39,"The dominant part was the voting rights compliance, and I take it you want to undermine the voting rights compliance rationale. But then I'm stuck on the same question that Justice Scalia is stuck on, is what evidence did you present that -- that there was an impermissible motive with respect to that, as opposed to different views as to what the Voting Rights Act compelled."
2015.14-232,0,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,948.39,972.67,"Two quick answers to that, Justice Kagan. First is, legally the justice -- the Voting Rights Act couldn't compel them to do what they did, so that justification legally is invalid. Secondly, we bring up that point about the burden shift with Arlington Heights and Mt. Healthy, where when we show an illegitimate motive partisanship, then the burden -- task falls to the Commission to justify that. And I would reserve the balance of my time."
2015.14-232,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,972.67,977.095,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,977.095,987.275,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.14-232,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1082.99,1106.13,"It sounds fundamental that a statute can't authorize a constitutional violation, so that even an attempt to comply with the Voting Rights Act is not sufficient if it violates the Equal Protection Clause. Have we ever said that -- I mean it's obvious, but have we ever said that in the context of what the voting rights requires?"
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1106.13,1116.55,"Your Honor, this -- this Court has consistently, from Reynolds v. Sims, has always held that the concept and the principle of one-person, one-vote, any attempts to undermine that outside --"
2015.14-232,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1116.55,1126.99,So we have said that even -- you read our cases saying even minor deviations are not permitted if they are statutorily required?
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1126.99,1136.79,"No statute can trump the Constitution, and so if -- the Voting Rights Act, whichever way it's read, can't be read in a way that would violate the one-person, one-vote."
2015.14-232,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1136.79,1138.61,And that's what Judge Wake said in his dissent.
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1138.61,1149.455,"And that's exactly what Judge Wake said in his dissent. And that is the State's position, is that we don't dispute -- or we're not saying that complying with the Voting Rights Act may indeed be a legitimate State interest."
2015.14-232,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1171.74,1191.005,"Would you say it's correct that compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the desire to obtain preclearance, is at least like other traditional districting considerations, like respecting county lines, respecting municipal lines, having contiguous districts? Would you agree with that?"
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1191.005,1192.15,"Yes, Justice Alito."
2015.14-232,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1192.15,1221.295,"So if -- if that is the case, then is this what you were asking us to say with respect to the Voting Rights Act, that the things that were really necessary to obtain preclearance are legitimate, but you can't go -- but they went further. They -- they went beyond what was really necessary to obtain preclearance, so we would have to determine whether that was true or not, or some court would have to determine whether that was true or not."
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1221.295,1234.48,"In this instance, because of the systematic way the deviations, the under-population occurred, as well as the intention -- we know from the Independent Redistricting Commission that they intentionally under-populated those districts."
2015.14-232,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1254.27,1267.255,"Well, what if the only way that you -- that a State could obtain preclearance when Section 5 was still in force was to under-populate some districts? Would that be permissible?"
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1267.255,1267.71,Well --
2015.14-232,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1267.71,1278.775,Just as you might have a situation where the only way in which you could respect municipal lines or county lines was to under-populate some districts to some degree.
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1278.775,1293.45,"Justice Alito, the irony is in the draft maps; seven of the ten minority ability-to-elect districts were underpopulated. However, when the Independent Redistricting Commission went from the draft maps to the final maps, there was a one-way ratchet."
2015.14-232,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1297.01,1311.525,"But Justice Alito can protect his own question, but he's asking you whether or not a deviation is permissible for protecting communities of interest, protecting municipal lines, whether some slight deviation is permissible."
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1311.525,1312.125,Yes.
2015.14-232,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1315.54,1317.18,I guess I'm not sure what that means.
2015.14-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.18,1318.31,"Yes, I'm not sure."
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1331.21,1332.0,That is --
2015.14-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.0,1338.685,"If in fact your -- you don't have equally apportioned districts, it goes beyond what is tolerable."
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1347.35,1355.25,"Yes, Justice Scalia, but I think that it's important to note that we look at this as a qualitative not a quantitative analysis."
2015.14-232,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1397.13,1397.76,Can you explain --
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1397.76,1399.34,-- diluting the votes of those people.
2015.14-232,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1399.34,1400.58,I guess I'm just not really sure.
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1427.4,1429.93,"Justice Kagan, we are saying --"
2015.14-232,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1429.93,1430.82,It's a policy.
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1433.535,1437.85,"I guess, you know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
2015.14-232,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1450.25,1457.31,"Even though it just, say, takes you from 4 to 5 percent, or from 7 to 8 percent. You're not crossing the 10 percent threshold."
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1461.88,1462.265,Yes.
2015.14-232,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1462.265,1467.335,"-- in the sense of we have a policy to maintain county lines, that's impermissible?"
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1467.335,1468.905,"Yes, Justice Kagan."
2015.14-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.845,1492.95,"General Brnovich, just as a matter of curiosity, how do you end up being on this side of the case? You -- you were defended in the district court, weren't you?"
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1492.95,1505.19,"The -- the Secretary in the State thought the principle of one-person, one-vote and upholding that principle was very, very important, and that's why we felt compelled to be involved in this -- this case."
2015.14-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1505.19,1509.305,"Well, but only on appeal. You didn't argue this side in the district court, did you?"
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1509.305,1512.12,"That -- that's is correct, Your -- Justice Scalia."
2015.14-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.12,1517.36,What happened? Was there an election in between or something? (Laughter.)
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1517.36,1519.85,"Yes, and I won overwhelmingly."
2015.14-232,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1519.85,1522.87,I knew it.
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1522.87,1523.42,Thanks.
2015.14-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1529.52,1545.445,"Do you -- do you agree with your colleague that it doesn't make any difference; that in the end result, the -- the legislature -- that the Republicans were disproportionately advantaged, had a disproportionate share of the seats?"
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1545.445,1546.34,"Yes, Justice."
2015.14-232,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1554.45,1562.34,"Whether it would have ended up, if you're right, an even greater disproportion -- a greater disproportion of Republican representatives."
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1562.34,1569.2,And so ultimately the number -- this is not a line drawing case; this is an overpopulation/under-population case.
2015.14-232,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.27,1596.48,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.14-232,1,62627,mark_brnovich,,1596.48,1605.93,Thank you.
2015.14-232,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.93,1610.68,Mr. Smith.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1610.68,1621.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is no basis for concluding that the minor, modest population variances among the districts in the Arizona map violate the Equal Protection Clause. That's because --"
2015.14-232,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.92,1632.42,"Do you -- do you accept the -- the fact -- speaking of accepting fact-finding, do you accept the fact-finding that at least part of the motive was partisan?"
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1632.42,1635.89,"I don't think that's a fair consideration of what the district court found, Your Honor."
2015.14-232,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.89,1636.74,"Oh, really? Why?"
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1636.74,1640.04,The district court found that the predominant motive for the under -- for the population --
2015.14-232,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.04,1640.85,Predominant motive.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1641.31,1674.03,"It said that -- that there may have been two of the five commissioners who, as to one district, District 8, had some mixed motives in -- in urging that that district be made more competitive, but did not find that the Commission as a whole acted, even in that one instance, with partisan motivations, and it -- that district is not one of the ones that's significantly underpopulated. The decision to move population around and make that district somewhat more competitive, even if it was motivated by partisanship, has nothing to do with what we're talking about here, which is the 8.8 deviation."
2015.14-232,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1674.03,1689.75,"Well, you know, I would be very upset if -- if it -- there were any motivation of partisanship because -- I wish this case had come up before the case we had last term, which -- which approved your commission, despite the -- the text of the Constitution -- (Laughter.)"
2015.14-232,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.75,1696.04,"-- because this commission was going to end partisanship, get politics out of redistricting."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1703.705,1704.43,With respect --
2015.14-232,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1704.43,1706.345,-- supposedly divine commission.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1706.345,1711.7,"Not a fair characterization of what happened, and not a fair consideration of what the district court found after a full trial."
2015.14-232,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1734.88,1755.22,"Well, the district court found -- and this is on 79a of the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement -- ""partisanship played some role."" So do you want us to interpret that to mean that if there was no partisanship, everything would have come out exactly the same way? It had no affect whatsoever on the districting?"
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1755.22,1776.37,"What the court said was with respect to the changes to District 8, which by the way, remained a largely Republican-leaning competitive district, that two of the commissioners may have had mixed motives, both thinking about aiding the preclearance arguments and also thinking about bringing the Democratic party up closer to parity, it still didn't get to parity. And I think that to say --"
2015.14-232,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1776.37,1778.3,"Well, that's a -- that's a red herring."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1812.62,1817.455,"Your Honor, partisanship by itself cannot violate the Constitution."
2015.14-232,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1833.96,1839.15,This is what -- this is what interests me about the case.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1900.325,1901.19,"Well, that's --"
2015.14-232,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1901.19,1904.3,It seems to me it -- it turns on the choice between the two.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1904.3,1905.45,"Well, this accepting a lot of --"
2015.14-232,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1905.45,1905.95,Is that a wrong?
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1905.95,1921.49,"Accepting a lot of the premises of the question, which I think are counterfactual, about the opinion and -- and what was found here and all of that, it does seem to me that even if you're going to make partisanship something illegitimate and redistricting, which seems kind of like a fool's error, frankly, it ought to at least have to be predominate."
2015.14-232,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1928.63,1946.97,"Well, aren't you saying that it's permissible to use, as one factor, an illegal standard if there are some other factors that are also in play? That it's permissible to use an illegal standard, in part?"
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1946.97,1947.86,If there were --
2015.14-232,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1947.86,1949.615,Is that what you want us to write in this opinion?
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1949.615,1950.16,"No, your Honor."
2015.14-232,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1952.16,1954.13,"Well, that's one of the issues in the case."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1978.09,1993.69,"For all the same reasons that the Court has many times said we're not going to say any racial consciousness is enough to invalidate it unless it predominates, I would think you would want to follow the same approach, even if you're going to adopt the parity between racial considerations and partisan considerations, which makes no sense."
2015.14-232,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2001.43,2008.23,Can I put in my notes that you're arguing that partisanship is a valid consideration in redistricting? Is that what you want me to say?
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2008.23,2009.38,"You -- you -- you certainly can, Your Honor."
2015.14-232,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.14,2022.89,That's the problem. There -- there is -- I'm suddenly waking up here and following --
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2022.89,2024.84,"That's your opinion, Your Honor. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-232,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2024.84,2037.695,"Well -- well, how -- how do you -- it's a -- how -- how do we write this? There are two areas that are difficult to write. One is, I know there is this 10 percent rule, but it doesn't say we don't look at it at all."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2064.305,2064.825,Vieth.
2015.14-232,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.825,2068.22,"When in fact -- of course, I dissented there."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2087.13,2087.46,Okay.
2015.14-232,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2087.46,2091.13,"Now, those -- those are two questions in the back of my mind, and I'd like to have your position."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2091.13,2092.52,"Can I answer the second question first, Your Honor?"
2015.14-232,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.52,2094.1,Fifty words or less. (Laughter.)
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2094.1,2113.69,"It -- it seems to me like it would be -- like it would be not -- not defensible to adopt a rule that says partisanship in creating minor population deviations is actionable absent some effect in terms of biassing the map, whereas in the -- in the line-drawing area, the Vieth situation, you have always insisted that there not only be a bias effect, but it be very large."
2015.14-232,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2113.69,2115.485,"Well, I didn't ask you what we shouldn't say."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2117.045,2134.62,"What you should say is -- what you should apply is the rule that -- that applied in all of these cases about minor population deviations: Is there a rational, legitimate policy that the State can articulate which is the reason why they arrived at this difference? And here we have, the Voting Rights Act is the rational and legitimate State policy."
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2134.62,2136.505,"Well, let's not -- let's talk about that for a second."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2150.375,2151.42,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2158.23,2164.75,"No, my -- my question is if the action that is taken would otherwise constitute illegitimate racial discrimination."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2187.72,2187.87,Right.
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2187.87,2190.225,-- for discrimination on the basis of effects.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2190.225,2190.53,Right.
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2190.53,2192.01,And I'm wondering if it's somehow different.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2202.19,2208.99,"Well, Your Honor, the one thing that is clear, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the Voting Rights Act does require people drawing lines to consider race."
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2213.54,2214.21,I understand that.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2214.21,2214.32,So --
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2214.32,2216.405,But it doesn't say that all bets are off.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2216.405,2217.2,"No, your Honor."
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2233.68,2235.52,"Well, it seems to me you're avoiding my question."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2235.52,2235.64,Sorry.
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2235.64,2241.015,"What if the requirements that the Justice Department asks for, for preclearance go too far?"
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2241.015,2251.82,"Well, I think if the -- the Justice Department reads the Voting Rights Act in a manner that requires them to do something that would go too far in the predominant sense, there might be a constitutional problem."
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2254.52,2254.64,Right.
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2262.07,2266.91,"It -- it could be, Your Honor. There's -- but there's no indication of anything of -- like that here."
2015.14-232,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.98,2293.01,"Look at the finding to support what the -- the Chief Justice is drawing there. While partisanship played a role in the increased population deviation associated with changing District 8, so, too, did the preclearance goal play a role in motivating the change."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2324.09,2379.03,"I would say two things, Your Honor. First of all, it's a tiny role in this case. But second of all, even if it were the only reason why you had a -- population deviations under 10 percent, I think it would be not defensible for this Court to say that, by itself, is unconstitutional. There is so -- de minimis effect on any interest in terms of representation from this difference of population, absent some bias in the way that the districts elect candidates, that it's simply not a constitutional problem that you ought to recognize where the -- even if the pure motive was -- was partisanship, it's simply not something that ought to be taken seriously as a constitutional problem. But here, where the predominant motive is to try to make sure these districts will pass preclearance, and less than 50 -- 50 percent of the commissioners may have had, for one district, where they increased the deviation slightly, like .2 percent, may have had some partisanship as well as the Voting Rights Act in mind for District 8."
2015.14-232,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2389.75,2398.36,"Well, what if there were? What if there were a case where the -- the commissioner or whoever was responsible for producing the plan produced -- chose between two plans."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2418.76,2425.32,"I think if -- if that's the only thing that they -- that -- that was problematic about the map, you might well say that's constitutional."
2015.14-232,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2427.15,2428.4,"No, it's not this case, but it --"
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2428.4,2430.24,"And it -- it -- you know, you've gone as far as Larios."
2015.14-232,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.41,2453.08,"Well, that's because there's no constitutional criterion for where you draw the district lines."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2463.95,2464.44,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-232,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.44,2471.035,"One-person, one-vote. There's -- there's no -- no such criterion for where the location of a district line has to be."
2015.14-232,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2471.035,2481.02,"But this Court has said, over and over again, we want to give States leeway in this area, because representation is often better if you give them some chance to make districts within the 10 percent band."
2015.14-232,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2676.035,2689.06,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2689.06,2697.39,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is not whether Section 5 can compel deviations from a perfect population standard."
2015.14-232,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2744.195,2753.13,"Is -- is 10 percent really de minimis? I mean, I think you can say it's minor, but de minimis strikes me as misleading when you're talking about 10 percent."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2753.13,2755.73,"Well, I certainly don't mean to be misleading about this term that this Court has used --"
2015.14-232,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2755.73,2759.04,"I know it has, yes. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2759.04,2760.69,I would never accuse the Court of being misleading.
2015.14-232,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.84,2774.77,Does anybody contest that? I don't think that's contested here.
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2789.5,2790.15,That's true.
2015.14-232,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.12,2804.75,I don't understand that.
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2816.4,2821.705,"Well, if you haven't made the prima facie case, it means that the State doesn't have to justify its reasons for the deviations."
2015.14-232,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2854.99,2873.035,"Well, let -- let's assume that the -- the opinion of the district court found that partisanship was a consideration. So are you saying that that finding can't be sustained because it wasn't based on sufficient evidence brought forward by the plaintiffs?"
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2873.035,2875.365,"Well, first, just a point of clarification."
2015.14-232,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2896.4,2904.85,"Well, was it a factor or not? Was partisanship just irrelevant, that it played no role, everything would have come out the same way --"
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2904.85,2905.54,The district court found --
2015.14-232,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2905.54,2907.66,-- without partisanship according the district court's finding?
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2907.66,2931.0,"The district court found that with respect to one district, two of the five commissioners were motivated in part by -- by partisanship motives. But, again, our -- our first position is that this Court doesn't need to get to what the actual findings were as to the motives because what the plaintiffs needed to do was come in and demonstrate at the front end that the lines on the map couldn't be explained as an effort to comply with legitimate districting criteria."
2015.14-232,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2931.0,2931.15,If the --
2015.14-232,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2931.15,2933.065,The district of --
2015.14-232,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2933.065,2946.83,What is the position of the United States on the question of whether it's permissible to intentionally take partisanship -- to use partisanship as a guiding principle in redistricting? Is that permissible or not?
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2946.83,2948.2,We haven't taken a position on that that --
2015.14-232,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2948.2,2950.89,I know you haven't. It seems very unfortunate.
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2954.88,2959.46,"Well, the United States has never participated in the political gerrymandering cases."
2015.14-232,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2983.655,2991.355,So you're -- you're unwilling to tell me whether intentional use of partisanship in redistricting is acceptable or not?
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2991.355,2995.18,"Well, I think this Court's decision in Gaffney indicates that it can be permissible."
2015.14-232,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.36,3018.36,"I took it that the position of the United States is at least, since many commissions are nonpartisan because they have two people who are more partisan on one side, two people on the other side and one neutral."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3033.36,3033.92,That --
2015.14-232,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.92,3044.435,-- for some members of the commission to take partisan considerations into account where they're not a majority and where the result is under 10 percent.
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3044.435,3046.98,I think that was the district court's conclusion.
2015.14-232,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3047.43,3049.86,Is your conclusion as representing the United States.
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3049.86,3057.38,"Well, again, we haven't taken a position on how one would analyze a partisanship -- if there was a finding that you get there, about a partisanship -- partisanship motive."
2015.14-232,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3057.38,3057.68,Ms. --
2015.14-232,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.68,3066.74,"I read the finding as saying, well, two members of the commission out of five did have a partisan motive, in part."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3066.74,3067.12,Yes.
2015.14-232,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3067.12,3074.02,"So I have to -- you have to -- I think have to say whether you think that is -- that situation, is constitutional or not."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3074.02,3074.34,"Well, no."
2015.14-232,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3104.29,3105.76,I don't understand this two out of five.
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3130.25,3133.805,"Well, again, I think, you know, we don't have a position on how one would analyze that --"
2015.14-232,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3133.805,3143.03,"Well, not -- what I think -- one, this isn't racist. Number two, it's not this Court. Number three, I don't know any court like that. And number five, if you're -- (Laughter.)"
2015.14-232,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3143.03,3145.72,-- if you're going to say -- if you're going to say.
2015.14-232,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3157.115,3175.175,"I mean that -- that is -- that many of these commissions, I would think, would balance people who know about districting and who are also Republicans with people who know about it and are also Democrats, and then you have someone of undoubted neutral --"
2015.14-232,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.175,3190.98,"Which is not the case here. That places a lot of weight on selecting the fifth person who is lily -- lily-white pure, right? And if that person, deep down, is partisanship one side or the other, the whole -- the whole thing goes."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3190.98,3191.46,"Well, this Court --"
2015.14-232,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.46,3193.58,"And that is the allegation here, by the way."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3193.58,3198.19,I'm sorry to interrupt. This Court has repeatedly said that politics is always going to be a part of redistricting.
2015.14-232,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3199.475,3199.97,Right.
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3199.97,3200.65,-- you can't -- you can't --
2015.14-232,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.65,3201.51,I agree with that.
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3202.64,3202.925,Okay.
2015.14-232,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3203.26,3206.26,"I mean, you don't have a position on whether that's acceptable or not."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3206.26,3206.545,"Well, I can --"
2015.14-232,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3206.545,3210.535,There's a difference between something's a necessary evil and saying it's evil. (Laughter.)
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3210.535,3218.22,"Well, I think this Court's decisions have told us that it's -- that it's fine to have partisanship play some role in redistricting. That's the -- that's the lesson of Gaffney."
2015.14-232,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3218.22,3222.41,"Well, I'm really surprised with the way you -- the way you read the district court's opinion."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3226.76,3227.925,"Can you give me the page, please?"
2015.14-232,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3227.925,3234.375,"It's on 62 -- I'm sorry -- 63a, running over into 64a."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3263.5,3266.03,"They say that on 79a, which is where you were reading from earlier --"
2015.14-232,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3266.03,3266.18,"No, no."
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3266.18,3277.66,"-- I think it's clear that what they're talking about, that partisan -- that partisanship played a role only with respect to District 8. But let me just say, if -- if this Court allows the plaintiffs to come in and just point to -- to deviations in districts --"
2015.14-232,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3277.66,3278.28,I'm sorry.
2015.14-232,3,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3283.205,3283.64,Yes.
2015.14-232,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3299.015,3306.945,"Thank you, Ms. Harrington. General Hearne, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-232,4,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,3306.945,3310.2,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.14-232,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.2,3315.645,What about footnote 10? Do you agree with -- with the characterization that the other side has made?
2015.14-232,4,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,3315.645,3322.15,"Well, footnote 10, no, I do not. And the portion I would quote was not limited just to District 8."
2015.14-232,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3336.2,3337.06,I want a finding.
2015.14-232,4,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,3339.84,3340.08,Well --
2015.14-232,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3340.08,3347.21,-- to make my own factual determination. What factual finding other than footnote 10 is there?
2015.14-232,4,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,3347.21,3374.085,"Then I would quote from the Appendix at 107a, which is where the statement's made, ""Judge Clifton correctly finds that the IRC was actually motivated by both partisan advantage and hope for voting rights preclearance."" So we have a majority for that finding of fact. So that is two members of the court specifically found that partisanship was one of the two motives to explain these deviations from one-person, one-vote."
2015.14-232,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3380.2,3387.375,"Yeah, but to what extent? I mean, the other side's going to say, yeah, that's true, but it's only true as to that one district discussed in footnote 10."
2015.14-232,4,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,3387.375,3397.61,"Well, if that's so, then they would have stopped and adopted the initial map and not continued to deviate from 4 percent to 8 percent for the final map."
2015.14-232,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3430.44,3435.08,I thought it was because they wanted to make super sure that they complied with the Voting Act.
2015.14-232,4,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,3438.945,3452.875,"The explanation that was made is that they were, quote, ""strengthening"" these districts by continuing to under-populate districts because their consultant said, oh, that does help us get Voting Rights Act preclearance approval."
2015.14-232,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3501.64,3508.015,But where -- where is the district in which -- or the State in which partisanship does not play a role in redistricting?
2015.14-232,4,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,3508.015,3510.53,"Well, we think partisanship is always going to play a role."
2015.14-232,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3544.99,3549.4,"If I could ask the -- the question that Ms. Harrington left with, was that -- I'm sorry."
2015.14-232,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3549.4,3550.705,"No, please."
2015.14-232,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3551.515,3567.965,"Even -- if -- if you're saying that even within the 10 percent, you know, to go from 1 percent to 2 percent, or from 2 percent to 3 percent, and then somebody can come in and say that's partisanship, it means that every single plan will be up for grabs in every single place, doesn't it?"
2015.14-232,4,62625,mark_f_hearne_ii,,3567.965,3569.185,I don't think it does.
2015.14-232,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3590.39,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
