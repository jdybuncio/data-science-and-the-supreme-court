2011.09-958,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.039,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-958, Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California and the consolidated cases."
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,12.641,15.943,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.09-958,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,80.016,87.737,"Ms. Schwartz, the government doesn't have the injunctive power."
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,106.651,109.685,"No, Your Honor, it -- it is not."
2011.09-958,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.391,125.112,"Yes, but that's a very drastic remedy that's going to hurt the people that Medicaid was meant to benefit."
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,132.885,138.337,"--Well, its only remedy provided by statute is to terminate funds."
2011.09-958,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,142.574,143.341,How often has it happened?
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,143.341,144.693,How often does it happen?
2011.09-958,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.693,147.645,How -- how often has in the Medicaid context--
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,147.645,162.285,"Very rarely, and the reason for that is because the way that most State plan amendments operate is that these issues are resolved on a consensual basis, generally within the 90 days provided by regulation."
2011.09-958,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,165.237,192.737,"Well, Ms. Schwartz, isn't it the exception because in fact you end-run -- end-ran the administrative process, that you put your regulations, your new rate schedules, into effect even before you submitted them to HHS, and continued them in effect while HHS was considering them, and continued them in effect to the extent that you were allowed to do so by injunction, even after HSS disapproved them?"
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,192.737,214.051,"There is no end run here because HHS's own regulations provide that our time for submitting the State -- State plan amendment is within the 90 days that the amendment will take effect, and HHS will confirm that -- it's the position of the Federal Government that the State may implement its rate reductions while the State plan amendment is pending."
2011.09-958,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.641,236.583,Could a State in its own courts provide for procedures whereby adversely affected parties could test the regulation?
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,236.583,238.399,I don't believe so.
2011.09-958,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.815,241.082,It seems to me you have to say that.
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,251.223,262.68,"--Well, and I think what's very important to focus on here is that this is not just any Federal statute that is being enforced, but it is a Spending Clause provision that is vague and ambiguous in its terms."
2011.09-958,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,267.549,270.953,"Well, when you say -- that brings me to a slightly different point."
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,306.358,308.393,"I have two answers, Your Honor."
2011.09-958,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,317.998,318.882,"Well, Ms. Schwartz, the agency--"
2011.09-958,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.882,322.55,"Well, I mean, that's 7 -- 700 judges."
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,346.935,378.121,"But California is now subject to standards that don't apply anywhere else in the country, and I believe the Court acknowledged exactly this problem just last term in Astra v. Santa Clara when it declined to allow private parties to use a contract provision to do an end run around Gonzaga, Sandoval versus -- Sandoval v. Alexander; I think I have that reversed -- and the other cases that, based on separation of powers of principles, based on Spending Clause principles, limit the -- the circumstances in which private parties can sue."
2011.09-958,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,378.121,382.406,Are you asking us to adopt a rule that is good for this one case only?
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,382.406,383.606,Yes.
2011.09-958,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,383.606,390.262,You gave -- or is there -- could you state the rule in broader terms or more neutral terms?
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,437.243,445.913,"All of those arguments are sufficient, as is the fact that, as we briefed, the Supremacy Cause itself is an implied cause of action."
2011.09-958,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,525.014,525.514,Excuse me.
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,532.418,533.704,I don't know the answer to that question.
2011.09-958,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,552.499,553.482,That's where I'm a little bit confused.
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,569.877,572.495,"--No, I don't believe the injunctions were that limited."
2011.09-958,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.285,589.439,That's a separate question about whether the courts are required to give deference to an HHS finding.
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,596.444,599.062,"No, the injunctions were not so conditional."
2011.09-958,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,619.56,632.701,"Well, the courts I take it have the prerogative, perhaps even the obligation, under the primary jurisdiction rational to simply withhold adjudication until the agency acts."
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,632.701,636.736,We requested that in some of these cases and the courts ignored that argument.
2011.09-958,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,640.556,643.425,"But that's an abuse of discretion, not an absence of power."
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,644.775,647.043,"--There is no cause of action, that's correct, Your Honor."
2011.09-958,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,649.829,654.983,--Can I go back to the question that Justice Alito asked you about why there's no cause of action.
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,661.303,663.587,"For several reasons, Your Honor."
2011.09-958,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,672.493,674.961,The Supremacy Clause is part of the Constitution--
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,674.961,675.647,--It is.
2011.09-958,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,675.647,678.297,--And the Petitioners here -- excuse me.
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,702.012,703.047,"Two points, Your Honor."
2011.09-958,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,723.81,732.066,"In a -- in a cause of -- in a suit that's brought under a statute directly, a person could be claiming damages."
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,742.422,747.259,First just one point: In Independent Living they did claim damages and they obtained damages.
2011.09-958,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,771.875,776.077,"Well, suppose the plaintiffs here were facing an imminent State enforcement action."
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,778.112,783.231,"--Well, if -- if the plaintiffs fell within -- yes."
2011.09-958,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,798.525,805.762,"But how does that square with the argument that you made relying on separation of powers, Spending Clause and the language of 30(A)?"
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,807.095,807.828,--For a couple--
2011.09-958,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,807.828,808.797,--in that situation.
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,808.797,810.464,"--Well, for a couple of different reasons."
2011.09-958,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,844.637,864.265,"--But what about the providers who say, but under -- under the State law, if we charge more than the hospitals -- if we charge more than the State ceiling, we are subject to sanctions, so this does fit into the category of anticipatory defenses?"
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,864.265,867.967,"No it does not, because we have not threatened to enforce that statute."
2011.09-958,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,873.537,876.823,But wouldn't they be -- the rates go into effect.
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,892.748,905.473,"--And that would be a different case and it would be a closer case, although even in that context, because in the Spending Clause context in which the case arises I don't believe that they would be able to challenge that under the Supremacy Clause."
2011.09-958,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.242,932.959,Excuse me.
2011.09-958,0,33984,karin_s_schwartz,,951.537,956.608,"--Of course we would, and they would have a decision about whether to stay in the Medicaid program or not."
2011.09-958,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,979.39,980.623,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,998.352,1000.785,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.09-958,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1028.868,1033.672,"Mr. Kneedler, is your argument in this case limited to Spending Clause legislation?"
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1033.672,1034.322,Yes.
2011.09-958,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1036.056,1040.174,"And if it's not, could you please -- you said yes, it is."
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1040.174,1040.741,--Yes.
2011.09-958,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1040.741,1044.643,But give me the theoretical foundation?
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1054.851,1055.351,Yes.
2011.09-958,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1055.351,1056.218,Is that your position?
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1056.218,1056.885,Yes.
2011.09-958,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1056.885,1067.824,Then what gets all of the cases that we've had since 1824 into this Court that have granted injunctive relief on supremacy arguments?
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1067.824,1080.583,I think that the great majority of those cases are ones in which the plaintiff in the suit in equity is bringing an action anticipating an action at law.
2011.09-958,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1080.583,1085.885,"Well, but we have plenty that don't -- King, Townsend, Carlson."
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1089.004,1100.878,"I think though that they do not reflect a general assumption that there is a cause of action directly under the Supremacy Clause, because as this Court said, the Supremacy Clause is not itself a source of rights--"
2011.09-958,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1100.878,1106.216,"So go back and explain to me how all of those cases, what's the theoretical."
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1106.216,1120.976,"--I think there is -- I think one has to look to an equitable cause of action, which I think is the way ex parte Young describes what is going on in that way is anticipating a defense, and to--"
2011.09-958,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1120.976,1137.151,"So go to your Petitioner's response to one of my colleague's -- to Justice Scalia, when she said yes, if these providers decide to charge the old rate to their patients, the State will go after them."
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1158.165,1160.331,--That has not been plaintiff's theory of this case.
2011.09-958,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1179.328,1183.78,But you haven't explained how that's theoretically different than the example I just gave you.
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1183.78,1186.482,"--Yes, I think it is, and if I could explain--"
2011.09-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.482,1192.034,"So all they have to do as far as the government is concerned is amend their complaint to say,"
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1199.956,1201.106,--I'm not sure.
2011.09-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.085,1222.437,"Well, gee, we're not deciding a whole lot here, then."
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1225.071,1242.267,"That's why I'm saying there might be a further question in -- in what you're describing as to whether that would be a valid defense in the State prosecution, because I could certainly imagine the State saying, we don't want our rates tested in individual criminal prosecutions any more than we would want them tested in an affirmative--"
2011.09-958,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1242.267,1249.754,"Mr. Kneedler, why should this even matter so much whether there is a defense available in a regulation that's brought against a person or not."
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1272.036,1274.654,"--Yes, unexamined."
2011.09-958,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1290.545,1291.431,So you think--
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1291.431,1292.281,--Under the Spending Clause.
2011.09-958,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1292.281,1297.149,--So you think there may well be implied rights of action outside the Spending Clause context.
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1297.149,1310.04,"I think probably the best way to explain it is equitable cause of action drawing on the Court's traditional equitable jurisdiction; you can call that an implied cause of action under the Supremacy Clause, but I think historically, it's been described as an--"
2011.09-958,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1310.04,1310.557,So--
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1310.557,1312.575,--Exercise of the Court's equitable authority.
2011.09-958,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1319.978,1324.316,--So your answer to my earlier question was that you were not arguing about that in this case?
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1324.316,1327.918,--Right -- we are focusing on--
2011.09-958,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1327.918,1334.338,"So the government -- the government, we don't have a position from the government on whether or not there is an implied right of action under other constitutional provisions--"
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1334.338,1335.338,--Under--
2011.09-958,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1335.338,1337.624,--I mean outside the Spending Clause context.
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1337.624,1342.444,--We are certainly not challenging the existence of a cause of action in equity.
2011.09-958,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.354,1360.722,You do not even exclude all Spending Clause cases.
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1374.149,1382.755,"--Well -- I don't think there is any categorical rule because, for example, under Spending Clause cases, you can have rights enforceable under 1983."
2011.09-958,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1402.816,1403.366,But Mr. Kneedler--
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1403.366,1406.151,--The third-party can sue only if the parties intending them to be.
2011.09-958,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1406.151,1409.655,"--Mr. Kneedler, this is what you said in your cert stance brief: You said"
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1426.748,1451.815,"Yes, and the circumstances in which the Court has made that point and we agree with are often in situations where you have Title 6, Title 9 instances of individual discrimination that are arising under federal programs, or where you have a right under 1983 where -- whether as an enforceable right that a party has and is going into court and is supplementing the agency's oversight."
2011.09-958,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1461.171,1463.123,Can that really be the difference?
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1481.418,1496.678,"--Well, I don't think it's just a merits question, I think it also goes to the question whether the parties to the contract intended third-party beneficiary-type rights to be able to sue under what is really analogous to a contract."
2011.09-958,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1519.174,1526.161,"Then Mr. Kneedler, before you sit down, could you please enlighten us on two fact points."
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1540.788,1548.492,"I am informed that it may slip past December, that there's been a lot of interaction with comments on it."
2011.09-958,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1552.36,1558.181,--How about the status of the hearing on California's compliance?
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1558.181,1559.298,That is still pending.
2011.09-958,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1590.152,1591.785,"Under a preemption, would it be a preemption argument."
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1591.785,1596.67,No it would be enforcing the terms of its agreement with the United States.
2011.09-958,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1599.436,1611.846,Do you agree with the Petitioner that if the state shows to allow its courts to issue an injunction on Supremacy Clause grounds in the state courts that that would be impermissible?
2011.09-958,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1611.846,1621.785,"We think it's a harder question, but probably so, because we believe paragraph 38 does not confer private rights and that would be true in the state court as well as the federal court."
2011.09-958,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.785,1622.668,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1629.657,1637.961,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I've would like to focus on two points that came out of the questioning in the first part of the oral argument today.
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1692.679,1700.951,Why isn't -- Why doesn't your position constitute a complete end run around all of our implied right of action jurisprudence?
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1709.272,1721.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, there is a very fundamental difference between an implied right of action or an action under section 1983 and a very simple and straightforward Ex parte Young remedy that is otherwise available."
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1734.756,1742.795,"How can they have much broader -- broader -- First of all, all of those cases -- I don't know if all of them did, but certainly a lot of them did -- included claims for injunctive relief."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1751.051,1760.756,"--Well, Ex parte Young has been pretty consistently evaluated as saying simply you cannot do what the Constitution immediately prohibits you from doing."
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.291,1764.975,But your position--
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1764.975,1767.643,--not to violate -- not to violate the Supremacy Clause.
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1767.643,1773.714,--Your position is that the Constitution prohibits you from doing anything where the State law is preempted by the Federal law.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1776.266,1792.378,"Well, but if you go back and look at the cases in which 1983 relief has been involved, a case like Blessing -- in Blessing, the complaint there sought essentially to take over the entire State law function of providing support for children."
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.07,1821.212,"What if -- what if the law that Congress passes sets forth certain Federal standards, it's a cooperative Federal-State law like this one, and it says: And there is no private right of action for any individual to enforce this."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1822.73,1830.218,"In that -- in that situation, there is obviously no authority to bring a private right of action under the statute."
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1836.205,1837.621,So Congress can say--
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1837.621,1838.755,--when there is a conflict between Federal and State law.
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1838.755,1848.179,--Congress can say in the same statute that confers the allegedly preemptive Federal standards that we do not want individuals bringing actions in Court to enforce this.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1861.82,1863.022,Right.
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1863.022,1865.472,The same Federal law that says you can't bring a claim of action.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1865.472,1889.423,"No, I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice, but you still have the problem that even under those circumstances a regime can arise in which there is a square and, in this case I think undeniable, conflict between Federal and State law, and the question is -- and that that conflict imposes not only injury in fact to an individual, but also imposes irreparable harm."
2011.09-958,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1889.423,1900.961,"But you are saying then, if Congress loud and clear says, we want HHS to be the sole enforcer of this law, You're saying--"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1900.961,1901.747,Of the Federal statute.
2011.09-958,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1901.747,1909.067,--You are saying that that would be ineffective because there could still be a Supremacy Clause claim.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1909.067,1910.086,Yes.
2011.09-958,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1914.371,1918.257,"That's on the merits, but Congress says we don't want anybody coming into the court."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1919.709,1929.898,--I don't think Congress has the authority to essentially say there are some conflicts between Federal and State law that we will simply ignore even though it causes irreparable harm--
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1929.898,1930.698,"Is that necessary to your position, Mr. Phillips?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1930.698,1931.517,--Absolutely not.
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1932.417,1941.773,"Because you could take the view, right, that if Congress speaks to cut off a claim, that's one thing, and a very different thing, than if Congress has not spoken at all."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1941.773,1942.323,--Right.
2011.09-958,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1947.86,1950.212,--Then it's a question of what would be the default rule.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1951.779,1952.495,--Of course.
2011.09-958,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1952.495,1960.15,Is the default rule that there is a Supremacy Clause action or that Congress must expressly allow it?
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1960.15,1974.494,And the reason why the default rule would almost certainly be that in fact you can bring the Ex parte Young cause of action is because the effect -- the spending clause has been subject to the -- to preemption claims since 1968.
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.423,1996.957,Why?
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2052.01,2052.577,Right.
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.577,2054.529,So I see three possibilities.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2092.487,2093.221,Can I just--
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2093.221,2095.856,There is a long line of cases -- I have one more thing and then you'll get all three.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2095.856,2097.406,--Can I deal with that one immediately?
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.406,2098.225,Yes.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2098.225,2100.575,Because I think it's important in the context of this case to recognize it.
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2118.888,2124.708,"If I want your view, I want your view on whether the right approach -- you are saying what is the status quo pending."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2144.586,2145.636,That's what I just wanted to be clear on.
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.636,2145.955,Yes.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2178.124,2178.443,Right.
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2178.443,2180.476,And what I wanted you to do is address them.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2180.476,2205.243,"The third possibility it seems to me, Justice Breyer, is not different from a lot of the other cases that this Court has already decided, Crosby and like Engine Manufacturers, where there's this vague standard out here and they're not asserting a right not to have an enforcement action brought against them, and this Court has routinely held in that circumstance that there is in fact a Supremacy Clause action available."
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.209,2231.725,You think primary jurisdiction is the way to do it.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2231.725,2232.192,Yes.
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.192,2246.885,"I see a practical problem and the practical problem is millions of rates all judged by the term ""sufficient"" and instead of the agency in charge deciding what's sufficient, we do have a lot of judges."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2246.885,2275.321,"But Justice Breyer, the agency always has the ultimate authority to step in and take action and the real question is to think that Congress meant to place this in an agency to circumstances where the agency isn't going to receive notice of the implementation of the change before it gets implemented, where the state is permitted to take no -- to make no response to a request for information and allow the unlawful rates to go into effect for years on end."
2011.09-958,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2275.321,2280.023,Can I ask -- why are you fighting Justice Breyer so much?
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2280.023,2281.392,I didn't think I was.
2011.09-958,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2281.392,2284.76,It sounds like you are and that's why I am having some difficulty.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2302.805,2303.621,Doctrine.
2011.09-958,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2303.621,2304.757,"--doctrine, okay?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2348.369,2348.869,Justice Sotomayor--
2011.09-958,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2348.869,2349.219,What's wrong with that?
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2349.219,2350.419,--There is nothing wrong with that.
2011.09-958,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2358.058,2359.325,"No, no; they are saying you can't have any."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2359.325,2359.808,--Right.
2011.09-958,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2360.427,2368.414,"But -- but Justice Breyer's question I think was slightly different, which is, what's the limit on the court's power?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2368.947,2382.173,"--We did have an alternative argument that the injunction should stay into effect at least until HHS acts, and the -- the district court granted a broader preliminary injunction and didn't consider the alternative argument that was -- that was there."
2011.09-958,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2399.385,2412.025,"--But you engaged the question that -- the approach that the Solicitor General has been making, which is don't find a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause; find it in the court's -- an implied cause of action."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2412.025,2415.311,I am not perfectly comfortable with that rationale.
2011.09-958,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2433.539,2447.283,"Well, I might, if you continue in your earlier position that a Supremacy Clause cause of action would stop Congress from having a -- a voice in enforcement and cutting it off clearly."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2461.458,2462.124,"Well, I--"
2011.09-958,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2462.124,2463.641,If this were an equitable--
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2463.641,2493.56,"--It will depend on the -- on the circumstances of the case, but I do think there is some gap between the full extent of Congress's power in this area and -- and the protections of the Supremacy Clause, if for no other reason -- and because the Executive Branch certainly has the authority, and certainly acting within its own exclusive authority could -- could preempt State law or could create a situation where State law would be preempted, and I don't think Congress would have the authority to -- to take away the Ex parte Young remedy under -- under those particular circumstances."
2011.09-958,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2493.56,2512.474,"What is your response to the argument that the equitable power exercised in Ex parte Young and similar cases is limited to certain specific situations such as where there is an imminent threat of the State enforcement action, and a few others where there is a trespass, where there's a clearly defined Federal right."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2526.131,2532.304,"The -- I mean, to be sure, the Court in Ex parte Young was dealing with a specific situation in trying to prevent enforcement."
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2572.762,2573.362,Right.
2011.09-958,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2573.362,2597.663,"What is the best authority in our cases other than Ex parte Young or in a treatise or in recognized statements of the difference in law and equity, for the proposition that in this area we can make a distinction between law and equity after centuries in which we have tried to say that that distinction ought to be blurred?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2597.663,2600.365,--Well--
2011.09-958,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2600.365,2605.251,"I mean, do you want us -- do you want us to write an opinion and say oh, there is a difference in damages and equity?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2605.251,2606.768,"--Well, all--"
2011.09-958,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2606.768,2609.637,"What do I -- other than Ex parte Young, what do I site for that?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2609.637,2618.593,"--Well, any of the cases in which the Court has recognized that obviously in order to get -- in order to get injunctive relief you have to demonstrate that there -- that there is no adequate remedy at law."
2011.09-958,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.945,2624.98,That -- that's not--
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2624.98,2625.83,--in the earlier part of the -- century.
2011.09-958,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.83,2630.051,--That's not the theory on which we've said you can't get damages under Ex parte Young.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2649.695,2654.833,"No, but I'm -- I'm not asking for -- for -- I mean, we are not asking for damages here, Justice Scalia."
2011.09-958,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.035,2662.272,"I know, but see -- but that -- but that wouldn't explain the case like Gonzaga where there was no State entity."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2664.355,2666.724,Right.
2011.09-958,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2667.324,2669.259,So I'm -- I'm wondering.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2671.461,2672.011,--Right.
2011.09-958,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2672.011,2675.847,--as Justice Scalia pointed out was the whole driving force of -- of Ex parte Young.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2689.172,2701.314,"No, but I -- I mean all of the cases that come out of the Ex parte Young line of authority seem to base -- you know, they all tee up, obviously, the problem that exists in this context which is -- which is the one Justice Scalia identified."
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2701.314,2701.997,There must be a limit.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2787.17,2788.62,"Justice Breyer, can I -- two points here."
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2799.244,2800.128,"No, no."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2804.113,2807.481,"--But my people have a life and death problem, Justice Breyer."
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2816.404,2821.975,"The doctors want to be paid more money or at least not paid as much as they were, I understand that."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2821.975,2823.009,--But the beneficiaries--
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.009,2823.809,Yes.
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2823.809,2825.894,--The patients are the one whose lose access to--
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2825.894,2826.978,So is there a medical exception?
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2826.978,2827.678,--I'm sorry.
2011.09-958,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2827.678,2829.013,Is there a medical exception?
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2833.115,2836.234,"No, to be sure, Justice Breyer."
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2852.629,2854.012,Mr. Phillips--
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2854.012,2856.814,--and in a circumstance where you cannot get damages and you cannot get attorneys' fees.
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2856.814,2861.052,"--Mr. Phillips, can I ask you a little bit more about how this interacts with the agency process?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2880.446,2882.898,If they had just discussed the matter?
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2882.898,2885.0,"You know, they did not impose them unilaterally."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2891.571,2893.121,We wouldn't be here.
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2894.823,2896.975,"--Well, if HHS approved, maybe somebody does sue."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2900.093,2901.293,That's -- that's exactly right.
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2901.293,2904.379,"And if HHS doesn't approve, then what's there to talk about?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2905.163,2906.13,Right.
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2907.063,2908.615,"So either way, the agency wins; right?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2908.615,2909.382,Right.
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2913.084,2917.036,"Why is there no suit -- why is there no suit if the agency doesn't approve,--"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2917.036,2920.754,"Well, if -- I mean -- I mean, if the agency--"
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2920.754,2923.19,--You're saying Congress can't say there's no implied right of action--
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2923.19,2923.673,--Right.
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2923.673,2925.058,--But the agency can?
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2925.058,2929.677,"Well, it's the -- I was just saying if the agency didn't approve, your clients don't have anything to complain about."
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2929.677,2930.527,"Right, because--"
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2930.527,2931.462,Do you have the same answer or--
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2931.462,2939.917,"--Well, it also depends on whether they go ahead and -- if California, in the face of disapproval, continues to violate the law -- and I would -- I assume you meant that California complied."
2011.09-958,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2939.917,2940.384,Correct.

2011.09-958,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2956.577,2958.261,"--Well, how do you know they're going to lose the litigation?"
2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2965.517,2981.942,"--Well, ultimately, they have to demonstrate that there's -- that there is a -- by clear and convincing evidence a conflict between Federal and State law, and the agency that has made -- that evaluates the standards of Federal law will have said in a very authoritative way that there is not a violation under those--"

2011.09-958,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3068.03,3068.598,--Because Congress--
2011.09-958,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3068.598,3071.8,"--Congress says it its statute no implied right of action, that that doesn't control."
