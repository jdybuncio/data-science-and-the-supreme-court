1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.029,"We will hear arguments next in 74-850, Mathews against Weber."
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,34.396,37.679,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-850,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,301.957,303.929,Then you are raising your constitutional issue?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,303.929,306.84,That is correct your Honor.
1975.74-850,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,306.84,313.136,And it made me a little bit -- I am interested is why is the Government so concerned about this?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,320.643,321.414,No.
1975.74-850,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,346.069,349.244,The Government’s interest is entirely pure rather --?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,349.244,353.026,"That could be one way of putting it, yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-850,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,353.647,356.713,What is other one?[Laughter]
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,356.713,362.083,That the statutes should be complied with by District Courts basically.
1975.74-850,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,364.011,373.225,"I know, but I gather the question would be -- can we just -- just as a purest idea on the part of the Secretary?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,373.225,374.967,"Well, perhaps in the future --"
1975.74-850,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,374.967,376.959,(Inaudible)
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,376.959,380.948,I think that there may be a possibility if the practice grows.
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,397.323,413.867,"Let us assume that the Department of Justice has a certain minimal interest at least in finality and that if the procedure is not authorized, then there maybe some doubts at some stage raised about the finality of the determination?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,413.867,420.838,There would be a question about -- a question of the validity of judgments which are obtained under this type of procedure.
1975.74-850,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,511.377,516.168,"Mr. Kimmel, I am going to interrupt you again."
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,525.307,527.453,"yes sir, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1975.74-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,568.933,577.359,"Mr. Kimmel, you press yourself in this language I assume such additional duties as a mat -- inconsistent with the constitution and law?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,577.359,577.962,Yes sir.
1975.74-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,609.916,618.749,"But it also says little later when they outline and they all said, but not restricted to, I do not see any limitation in there, it looks like wide open?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,618.749,627.231,"Well, the language itself thus say that it cannot be inconsistent with the constitution or the statutes."
1975.74-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.323,813.442,What is that really mean when you try to boil it down in terms of what goes on in a courtroom?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,817.511,836.361,"All the procedural -- I would not say ministerial I admit, but routine and not dispositive litigation be all the preliminary procedural type motions and the Housekeeping kind of thing in regard to progress of civil litigations through the courts, but not the actual decision of civil litigation."
1975.74-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.361,843.633,How much time do judges spend before the Magistrates Bill on the Housekeeping attention to progress of litigation to the courts?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,843.633,850.803,"Well, I believe that all procedural motions have to be decided by a District Judge completely, but the Fourth Amendment --"
1975.74-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.803,859.413,"You mean then when you say Housekeeping you mean discovery motions for a more definite statement, that type of thing?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,859.413,860.603,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.065,896.485,My question was basically a response to your quotation of Congressman Poff's explanation.
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,908.788,917.024,"Well, I believe that this listing of duties which eliminate from the judge’s burdens of a significant amount on the number."
1975.74-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.773,931.019,"Yes, but I would dispute whether those can be called either ministerial or routine."
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,933.934,949.057,"Well, I agree with that and the point here is even when the Magistrate does make an initial ruling these are again recommendations which are subject to review by a judge, but particularly in the event of an objection, but this will eliminate --"
1975.74-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,949.057,953.521,"Well, that is true of the challenge review of the social security?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,953.521,973.822,"But there the distinction would be the other part of what Representative Poff said that the judge, the point of relieving judges of the minor burdens would be so that judges would have more time to devote to the actual substance of litigation -- to the actual of decision of cases and I think that that was the thrust to make this distinction."
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1241.427,1259.389,There are obvious differences between a pretrial conference and the trial that -- what would you focus on is the distinction between this initial exploration by the magistrate and the pretrial procedure?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1259.389,1259.983,Mr. Chief Justice --
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1259.983,1262.865,He is one of the final to begin with?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1262.865,1268.314,Typically the -- our problem certainly is not final and in the pretrial it is very definitely not final.
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1294.773,1297.558,What if a pretrial examiner did?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1297.558,1302.623,"Well, I think that the -- it would be subject to reversal by the District judge."
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1304.749,1312.468,Is the Initial step here subject to reversal issue put it to the District Judge?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1312.468,1315.627,Mr. Chief Justice if it is a pretrial conference I believe that the --
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1315.627,1318.37,I am speaking of the procedure involved here that is your challenge?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1318.37,1319.438,Yes.
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1319.438,1321.373,"That subject to review by the District Judge, right?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1321.373,1329.612,It definitely is subject to review and the District Judge does have the option where he would recognize to not accept the magistrate's decision.
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1331.543,1336.163,Is it an option or is it part of his inherent power?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1336.163,1350.415,"Well, he has the power both under the rule itself and inherently as a Judge to decide the case, but we think that whether or not a magistrate actually is acting as a special master and comes under the restrictions there."
1975.74-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1369.544,1373.994,This is -- if the Judge has to pass on?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1373.994,1376.035,Very definitely.
1975.74-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1376.303,1378.09,He has to have oral argument on that?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1378.09,1378.346,No.
1975.74-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1380.006,1388.044,"But when the suit is filed the judge will calendar the matter for oral argument before him, if he deems it necessary or appropriate?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1388.044,1389.261,That is correct in most cases.
1975.74-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1389.261,1392.143,"So who has the final say on this, the magistrate or the judge?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1392.143,1400.578,"The Judge, we recognized from the beginning, has the option to decide the case and to include a complete new adversary proceeding before him."
1975.74-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1407.576,1410.023,Is the practice before us?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1410.023,1410.193,Your Honor?
1975.74-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1410.193,1411.794,You said it does not happen in practice.
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1414.493,1414.88,In our --
1975.74-850,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1414.88,1416.375,In this record?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1416.375,1428.455,"Well, in our petition we did introduce some statistics which intended to show what the actual practice was and I admit that they were not very widely based statistics."
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1497.496,1515.301,Do you think the magistrate in the situation before us now is exercising more or less power if you can make the comparison than a bankruptcy referee as traditionally exercised?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1515.301,1525.641,"Probably be about the same amount, I would think Your Honor, although it is true that I believe under the bankruptcy statutes the referee’s decision is clothed with finality unless a party objects to the District judge."
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1541.467,1544.35,How is that very much different from the bankruptcy then?
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1544.35,1547.677,"Well, it is not really, but our point here your Honor is that where Congress intend it --"
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.677,1554.677,"Qualitative, I am speaking in a qualitative sense, the quality of the function?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1554.677,1571.489,"The quality of the function is probably about the same, but the point I was trying to make with example of referees in bankruptcy is that where Congress intends such a major role, I think in the official in question, it is spells it out and it has with referees in bankruptcy."
1975.74-850,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1576.784,1596.036,"But the referee in bankruptcy is dealing with a precise kind of function that is much easier definition, would you not agree than a broad range of authority that Congress appears to have at least contemplated for magistrates?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1596.036,1608.33,"Well, I think Your Honor that whether it is just bankruptcy or whether it all civil cases, both require that there be some definition by Congress to whether its intent -- the official in fact more."
1975.74-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.15,1678.462,"Well, your position has to be that the statute does not authorize what the District Court did here, is it?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1678.462,1683.72,"Should not be construed or authorized it, yes or should not authorize it."
1975.74-850,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.72,1689.054,"You cannot really say that perhaps it authorized it, but it is not wise to do it?"
1975.74-850,0,36153,michael_kimmel,,1689.054,1697.383,Well I think the wisdom enters into it in this way that it is a matter where a policy question is involved.
1975.74-850,1,37877,peter_d_ehrenhaft,,1956.516,1959.73,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.949,2105.537,"Do you think prior to that Magistrates Act, there could have been rule of the Court that every social security review case will be assigned to a special master?"
1975.74-850,1,37877,peter_d_ehrenhaft,,2105.537,2114.863,I do not think so because the rules with regard to special masters is a different rule than the creation of the magistrate under the Magistrates Act.
1975.74-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.087,2150.048,Even if so a District Court said refer every social security case to a magistrate even though it could not refer every social security to a special master?
1975.74-850,1,37877,peter_d_ehrenhaft,,2150.048,2154.619,That is right because --
1975.74-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.619,2164.075,Even though the Magistrates Act says that a magistrate may act as a special master where it is appropriate for a special master to act?
1975.74-850,1,37877,peter_d_ehrenhaft,,2164.075,2164.631,That is right.
1975.74-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.328,2224.647,I think there is some inference from the -- maybe you do not -- apparently you do not that there are some inference in the Magistrates Act that the magistrates' role in civil cases should be no greater than would be allowed to special master?
1975.74-850,1,37877,peter_d_ehrenhaft,,2224.647,2230.907,I do not believe that either the text or the legislative history support such a construction and I hope to address that in a moment sir.
1975.74-850,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.907,2231.961,Alright.
