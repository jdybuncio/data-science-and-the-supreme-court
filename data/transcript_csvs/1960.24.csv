1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,15.07,17.332,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,167.883,170.868,What was each act in this case?
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,170.868,179.06,The Court held that the -- the only accessible acts were the applications for the priority certificates.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,179.06,179.935,What?
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,179.935,183.806,"The fraudulent applications, not as we claimed each purchase."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,183.806,185.043,How many applications were --
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,185.043,187.501,There were only four applications producing a -- a judgment.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,187.501,188.995,Four documents that is.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,188.995,189.683,Four --
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,189.683,190.697,Four documents.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,190.697,191.765,"Yes, yes."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,196.061,197.247,And you claim what?
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,197.247,202.006,"Well, we -- they argued it that each purchase was an accessible act."
1960.24,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,218.214,220.925,How much was involved in the deal?
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,220.925,229.176,"The -- the purchases were for $79 -- $79,500."
1960.24,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,232.502,233.995,A what?
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,233.995,240.601,"Trucks and trailers, I think mostly trucks, a total of 150 items."
1960.24,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,240.601,242.266,"Involving $79,000?"
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,242.266,245.443,"Yes, that was the purchase price, price of which facility."
1960.24,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,246.76,249.332,Yes.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,249.332,265.447,"Now, in its original complaint, the Government asked for $2,000 assessments under the first option on the basis of the 150 items purchased as we asked it initially for $2,000 on 150 purchases."
1960.24,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,318.551,324.85,"Now, then, as I understand it Mr. Barnett, the Second Amended Complaint did pray for the $ 2,000 --"
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,324.85,325.422,"Yes, sir."
1960.24,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,325.422,325.992,-- per debt -- for --
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,325.992,326.153,Yes.
1960.24,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,326.153,327.658,-- the transaction.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,327.658,330.999,And we had withdrawn the First Amended Complaint and we do not rely on it.
1960.24,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,330.999,333.354,Is that the one you want to trial on now?
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,333.354,336.786,"Well, we say we went to trial on the pretrial order."
1960.24,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,337.641,337.95,Oh.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,337.95,348.865,"What then happened was after further pretrial proceedings, the District Court entered a formal pretrial order under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,384.772,391.847,Did you -- did I hear you say that you withdrew the amended complaint which the judge disallowed?
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,391.847,395.889,"The First Amended Complaint, we never got to a formal ruling."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,395.889,396.212,So (Voice Overlap) --
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,396.212,399.246,We filed it and it's been an informal conferences.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,403.447,407.723,"Well, let me be at -- let me understand it very explicitly."
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,417.593,417.617,Yes
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,417.617,418.552,-- the Government's elective.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,418.552,420.235,"Yes, yes but --"
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,420.235,425.825,And -- and if you were told that that amended would be disallowed?
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,425.825,426.246,"Yes, sir."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,426.246,426.795,Is that right?
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,426.795,427.279,"Yes, sir."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,427.279,432.238,"Now what state very accurately had you do, just what happened?"
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,434.528,439.102,"It was withdrawn by the Government, without being -- any -- any ruling being in and on record."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,439.102,440.412,But it was withdrawn.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,440.412,441.132,It was withdrawn and --
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,441.132,445.495,You didn't stand your ground and say you are entitled to file it and you --
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,445.495,445.726,We did not.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,445.726,448.455,-- entered the exception on the adverse ruling.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,448.455,451.783,"We did not do that, and we do not -- we do not here rely on this."
1960.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,451.783,455.105,"You mean withdrawn, meaning this is not filed (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,455.105,460.642,We withdrew the motion and so the motion to file was never acted on -- of record.
1960.24,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,460.642,462.082,"Actually, it was never filed."
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,463.016,463.411,We've got the motion to life.
1960.24,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,463.411,464.653,-- for leave to file --
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,464.653,464.849,Yes.
1960.24,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,464.849,468.084,"And then before action, you withdrew the motion for leave."
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,468.084,469.369,That's precisely right Mr. Justice.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,469.369,473.208,You -- you asked that you -- you make that your complaint.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,476.432,477.069,That's right.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,477.069,480.768,"-- to make that the basis of the litigation, is that right?"
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,480.768,483.809,We did not stand on that and we do not stand on it here.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,485.719,486.884,I understand.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,486.884,496.652,-- which does expressly state our election and in itself states as the Federal Rules provide that it governs the issues to be litigated in the course of the trial.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,496.652,505.468,And then I -- jumping ahead of the -- this game if I asked or that when this gets done to a -- to the issue of procedure or pleading --
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,505.468,506.912,"Well, the reason that --"
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,506.912,515.264,-- rather than the subsequent matter whether if by initially appropriate make explicit complaint in allegation.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,527.2,538.454,"Well, I have spelled out the -- these procedures not because we think they're important but because respondents do make the argument that we weigh our claim to double consideration damages."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,538.454,540.524,But my question is a different one.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,554.76,560.663,We have a ruling by the District Court that we are bound by the first election.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,576.218,577.44,"You mean, in this case or --"
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,577.44,577.526,In this case.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,577.526,582.674,"-- or in general proposition that if the Government initially, I'd like you to answer my question."
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,582.674,583.344,"Yes, sir."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,583.344,595.474,"Whether if the Government initially had said in appropriate procedural language having three -- three choices for reliefs, we choose number 2."
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,603.325,604.853,I'm not sure I -- I understand.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,608.248,610.737,"Well, alright if it ruled, but then it didn't rule that."
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,610.737,611.481,It ruled that --
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,611.481,612.099,It didn't.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,612.099,617.151,"Our election, even though properly made wasn't buying it."
1960.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,619.044,622.182,"Well, is not in effect to say that no matter what the Government is --"
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,622.182,622.609,"Yes, that's what the Court --"
1960.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,622.609,625.95,-- desired nor how it may have evidence its choice --
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,625.95,626.686,Yes.
1960.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,626.686,631.283,-- that the choice was not to be made by the Government but by the trial judges as a matter of discretion.
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,631.283,631.836,Yes.
1960.24,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,631.836,633.507,"That's the issue we have, isn't it?"
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,633.507,640.513,"That -- that is what I understand to be the Court of Appeals holding, though, I must say, it is not entirely clear what the Court of Appeals is saying."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,643.675,650.098,"What was important to me what is says there, or it's all tangled up with the kind of procedure that follower --"
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,650.098,650.256,No.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,650.256,653.891,"-- here before you started out with the choice that you have, would reject it."
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,653.891,666.828,"No, the reason I've gone into this is the respondents assert various other ground in support of their judgment which they're entitled to do and I'm attempting to answer all of those, as well as the Court of Appeal's ground."
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,666.828,681.737,"To me, there were great deals of difference, whether we've got here a confuse (Inaudible) Court of Appeals would taken, which probably arrests on the procedure and development in this case, all under the issue is unclear whether it doesn't quite when you put it."
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,681.737,686.094,The Court of Appeals does not rely upon these procedural myths.
1960.24,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,686.094,687.984,"Yet, you stated isn't clear or did decide it."
1960.24,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,687.984,694.142,"No, it does decide that the District Court is not bound by the Government's election."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1582.911,1589.606,"May it please the Court, counsel for the Government."
1960.24,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1746.779,1749.762,Didn't they get a back on the track again through the pretrial order or --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1749.762,1751.711,"I don't think they did, Your Honor."
1960.24,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1810.157,1812.614,Did he asked (Inaudible) to a -- a pretrial (Voice Overlap) --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1812.614,1815.692,"No, Your Honor, no request was ever asked."
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1843.04,1849.732,I'm a little troubled by what you've just said because our attention was called to page 101.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1861.2,1868.513,"It certainly is Your Honor, but it was inserted there not as a result of whatever was taken in that course of the pretrial."
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1871.057,1872.306,"Well, but it's the judge's order."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1872.306,1872.586,It's the judge's --
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1872.586,1872.914,The court --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1872.914,1873.206,-- order.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1874.533,1874.864,The court said --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1874.864,1878.176,"And it's asserted in there, but I say it's asserted improperly."
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1878.176,1881.677,"But you -- you would approve it yourself Mr. Conron, as to form and context."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1881.677,1885.951,"Well, I wasn't aware that -- of that or the significance at the time I did it."
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1885.951,1887.893,"Well, isn't that 105 and is that your signature?"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1887.893,1888.901,That certainly is.
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1890.03,1892.714,And proved that the form and context can certainly --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1892.714,1901.252,"Well, and I'll answer that the -- that I have no particular objection to the context of the order, but I claim it does not raise the issue."
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1901.252,1904.527,I don't what context is a context.
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1904.527,1905.984,It says context.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1905.984,1907.186,"Yes, it does."
1960.24,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1918.623,1928.101,"Yes, but any time, they came down (Inaudible), you said that this question on what the Government has the right -- or likely, it doesn't depend upon what you planned in your complaint?"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1928.101,1929.855,I'm -- I'm coming to that and --
1960.24,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1929.855,1934.495,Subsequent complaints that all turns on what the Government wants to claim at the time of judgement.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1935.934,1937.272,"Alright, alright."
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1937.272,1944.679,"And in addition Conron, look at paragraph 9 at page 104, the pretrial order."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1968.514,1974.121,"I have to be bound by that, but I -- I hadn't finished discussing that pretrial order."
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1974.121,1974.301,"Well, I gather you said (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1974.301,1976.045,The pretrial order itself --
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1976.045,1988.899,"-- maybe I misunderstood you but I thought that your argument was that, what appears at 101 in relation to this issue is meaningless because it was not followed by some motion to amend the pleadings."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1988.899,1990.299,That's what your pretrial ruling required (Voice Overlap) --
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1990.299,1992.342,I mean but that's what -- that's your argument.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,1992.342,1993.733,"That's right, that's right."
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1993.733,2002.15,And yet you said that in paragraph 9 and you signed it that this order supplements the pleadings and governs the course of trial.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2003.263,2005.381,"Alright, then let's -- let us supplement the pleadings."
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2207.926,2216.816,"Mr. Conron, when did the -- these proceedings, was that they filed itself -- it was narrowed down to the four acts?"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2216.816,2217.425,Yes.
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2217.425,2218.804,That happened after the trial not --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2218.804,2218.947,Yes.
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2218.947,2219.506,-- before the trial?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2219.506,2223.537,"Yes, the case was argued on based on $2,000 per act."
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2232.269,2235.995,"Well, was that at the end of the trial when all the evidence was in that you have the arguments?"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2240.413,2245.717,"Well, we contended all the way down the line and the trial court at the end and I quote that in my brief."
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2245.717,2248.009,But you -- but that the ruling was not until the end of the trial?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2248.009,2251.796,The end of the trial after all the evidence was in.
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2251.796,2282.116,"Well Mr. Conron, to get back to the pretrial motion and the procedure during the trial, and the actions of the Court and its conclusions of law didn't -- on page 116, the last paragraph on that page, doesn't it -- it says there, ""This Court allowed the filing of said Second Amended Complaint in paragraph 75 of the pretrial conference order."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2330.553,2332.36,"Now, Your Honor."
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2341.273,2341.859,I see.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2341.859,2344.899,But I contend that there never was a proper pretrial order.
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2379.859,2384.563,"That's the one -- that's the one I'm reading from, 3."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2384.563,2384.977,"No, I don' think so --"
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2384.977,2385.366,The conclusions --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2385.366,2386.242,-- Your Honor.
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2386.242,2388.76,-- or -- oh that's from the conclusions law.

1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2388.8,2389.813,"Number 3, yes."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2389.813,2393.984,"Now, I have in mind page 107 of the transcript."
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2393.984,2394.576,"Oh, yes."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2394.576,2411.927,"And there, the Court finds that the sum of $2,000 per act is not appropriate not because the Government had made an election but because the evidence wouldn't support that there have ever been any money as agreed to be paid."
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2469.89,2472.288,Could you satisfy my curiosity by telling me --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2472.288,2473.433,"Yes, I'm trying."
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2473.433,2478.446,-- Mr. Conron who addressed at the pretrial conference order.

1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2483.839,2484.75,Yes.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2484.75,2496.516,"Because whatever it may be, there's certainly of a flat contradiction between orders set forth on --"

1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2499.008,2499.967,That's right.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2499.967,2505.561,That action flat contradiction as they did to (Inaudible) should be it and then you have -- of this also.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2505.561,2507.69,That's right.
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2509.585,2515.111,"Well, Mr. Conron, (Inaudible) before whom was this trial, Judge Jertberg?"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2515.111,2516.795,"Judge Gilbert Jertberg, yes in the --"
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2516.795,2519.91,"And he allows the counsel of that, the pretrial."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2519.91,2523.209,He ordered this -- this one to be grant by counsel.
1960.24,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2523.209,2525.673,Is it not together but by Government counsel?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2525.673,2530.095,By the Government counsel.
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2530.095,2531.079,"Well, (Inaudible)"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2531.079,2532.178,It's unusual.
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2533.901,2540.283,What do you mean he was not given any chance to go over and makes suggestions?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2540.283,2541.658,"No, I was not Your Honor."
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2541.658,2542.772,Did you object to that?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2544.666,2548.292,"Frankly, I did not raise a timely objection to the form of the findings."
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2551.476,2557.747,Did you object -- did you object to not being allowed to participate in it?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2557.747,2565.314,"Well, I was allowed to participate to -- in this -- to this extent that -- and I cited it in my brief."
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2572.55,2573.968,Did you sign it yourself?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2573.968,2575.378,That's right.
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2630.327,2655.41,"Well, the last paragraph of the pretrial order says that foregoing admissions having been made by the parties, and the parties having specified the foregoing issues of fact and law remaining to be litigated, this order shall supplement the pleadings and govern the course of the trial of this cause unless modified to prevent manifest injustice."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2655.41,2661.471,That's the provision in Section 16 of the rules as well as the -- the part of the actual order.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2688.992,2689.5,Well the -- the --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2689.5,2694.748,Hiding the two skinny winds and from the game ordain and taking the fat one home.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2694.748,2708.434,"Well, now, the Government's Second Complaint which the Court indicated it was the -- no Government's First Amended Complaint which the Court indicated it would not grant."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2717.248,2720.354,By six months.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2722.266,2725.64,Is that -- that answers of yours goes against you.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2725.64,2742.808,"Yes, I'll have to take -- yes, that's -- that's there it is but I -- I argue for what it's worth at the pretrial order and the -- incidentally, there are -- there are two cases are in that point that --"
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2742.808,2758.426,"Well, it's better not take too much time because you still have to go down to assuming your right about this, you still have to meet the question that -- that this doesn't bar the Government asking if the matter of relief, whatever it can ask some of the statute apart from the pleading."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2758.426,2758.706,If I can find --
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2758.706,2759.413,Is that true?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2759.542,2760.104,That's right.
1960.24,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2767.027,2771.417,You're also going to argue the satisfaction going?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2771.417,2785.144,I think I haven't rather fully covered in my brief Your Honor and I agree with all of you have expressed here I think the Government conclusively has accepted the form of release specified by the Act which says it has to elect warrant.
1960.24,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2785.144,2787.484,"Did you relied on that, anything else abusive, isn't it?"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2787.484,2788.496,That's right.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2798.266,2805.632,The problem is if -- if -- if you're right about that and we order dismiss this case is in improper to be granted.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2805.632,2808.481,I have no doubt on what that should be in proper --
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2808.481,2810.793,And there's no issue on -- on the statute.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2810.793,2812.797,That's right.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2812.797,2815.17,Or rather the -- the statute have been fulfilled.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2815.17,2817.334,It has been fulfilled.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2820.919,2822.146,I said if you're right.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2822.146,2824.985,"That's right, if I'm right."
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2834.798,2837.296,You mean accepted the payment?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2837.296,2837.853,That's right.
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2837.853,2840.523,Why do you say that accepted the remedy?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2840.523,2851.053,"Because the remedy have the trial court was, that there were four acts and the law says $2,000 per act and they have accepted the money."
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2851.053,2864.956,"It did asked for judgment, the great deal was be more than that and not deceive this, and the cases and -- as a read them is fully upheld that that was -- you can't say that will stop the man --"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2864.956,2865.315,"Oh, I --"
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2865.315,2867.898,I'm claiming the reversal of the judgment.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2867.898,2872.588,I quite agree with you Justice Black up to this point.
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2902.212,2909.332,The Government does challenge one of the judgments on the ground that entitled about a 100 and how much more?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2909.332,2915.792,"Well, the Government asked for two -- for doubly consideration agreed to be paid."
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2918.91,2927.444,"It took the case up on the ground that has not enough and while there in ordinary cases, this maybe an exception in ordinary cases."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2936.722,2937.984,"Well, they accepted that under circumstances --"
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2937.984,2939.05,On the appeal?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2939.05,2944.318,They accepted that the -- your statement is correct as a matter of law.
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2947.454,2948.016,Well if you can (Voice Overlap) --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2948.016,2948.491,The Government --
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2948.491,2956.598,If can show that they said we're going to accept this payment of all and we're going to stand in our appeal.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2957.391,2965.966,"No, they never said that but they took the notes and they took the money and I can't say that they said that they would abandon their appeal."
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2965.966,2966.232,Can you say --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2966.232,2967.024,"Well, I say as matter of law --"
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2967.024,2969.386,"Well, you said it will imply if they were."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2969.386,2978.078,After they take the $8000 at a time when the judgment itself was not final and being appealed by both lawyers.
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2981.498,2982.588,(Voice Overlap) you paid.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2982.588,2983.671,Then we owe the 8000 when they --
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2983.671,2984.675,You said when you paid it.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,2984.675,2993.389,"Well, we tendered it and they took and the rule as I understand is if you accept the benefits of a judgment, you waive your right to challenge it."
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2993.389,2993.53,(Voice Overlap)
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2993.53,2994.771,If you have accepted.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3009.249,3010.468,"There the agreement, no."
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3014.285,3016.899,But this is -- this isn't the ordinary case of a man --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3016.899,3017.172,No.
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3017.172,3026.805,"-- owing a $100,000 and it takes $8000 on account because the $8000 represented one theory of recovery."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3027.728,3036.23,It represented a full satisfaction of one theory of recovery and now the -- the Government can't accept the benefit if one theory of recovery and challenge it.
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3036.23,3042.569,"Well, that's a -- that maybe that the Court will hold that but do you have any cases that upheld, that are indicated, (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3042.569,3050.141,Well all -- all of the cases that the Government collected in its brief I think recognized that statute to the general rule of guess.
1960.24,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3072.44,3081.237,"Well, are we talking -- if I may suggest, are we talking about compromise, settlement or are we talking about satisfaction in the judgment?"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3081.237,3083.544,I'm talking about satisfaction I think.
1960.24,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3083.544,3084.16,Well --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3084.16,3084.774,Well --
1960.24,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3084.774,3097.05,"Well, when -- when one has a judgment for Y dollars and he receives Y dollars, are there any legal implications as to intentions to satisfy?"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3099.918,3108.499,Well I think -- I think the Government by taking the money is -- is obligated as a matter of law to satisfy the judgment that's -- that's the import of the judgment.
1960.24,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3108.499,3110.757,How many satisfactions can't there be?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3110.757,3113.635,I say only one.
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3113.635,3130.151,"But what you do you do with cases like Erwin against Lowry which is you said, it's precisely a different rule, that the payment of the judgment when it's less to the man's claim and in then appeal not to be taken as abandoned by him or his rights and you get a reversal?"
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3130.151,3142.32,As I understand that case -- as I understand that case in the other cases in the group and the payment of an amount admittedly owing can we at -- at that time in this payment admitted only nothing.
1960.24,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3142.32,3146.634,I assume you wouldn't pay it if you didn't admit owing as I suggest that's right.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3146.634,3148.767,"Well, we were still appealing and --"
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3148.767,3150.25,Did you cross appeal?
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3150.25,3150.948,Yes.
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3155.359,3156.721,Yes.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3156.721,3156.891,I see --
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3156.891,3158.851,Everybody was dissatisfied with everything.
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3158.851,3159.761,Everybody was.
1960.24,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3162.673,3163.856,Still are --
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3163.856,3185.341,"My -- [Laughter] my final point I see the white light is on me and I'll have to be rather rapid, is that I don't agree with the Government's contention as to the proper and meaning of the Surplus Act."
1960.24,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3256.648,3275.129,"What you're saying is that when the statute pass these three choices shall pay or shall pay the Government elect and shall pay the United States so -- so elect, the Government had these modes of seeking relief but it's still left for the Court to decide whether they elected properly."
1960.24,1,18720,calvin_h_conron,,3275.129,3277.283,I don't exactly go that far.
