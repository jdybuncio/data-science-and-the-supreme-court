2002.01-188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.279,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-188, The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America v. Kevin Concannon, et al.--"
2002.01-188,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,74.062,77.422,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,111.759,115.624,Was this statute... was the statute discussed in the First Circuit opinion?
2002.01-188,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,115.624,117.234,The Medicaid statute?
2002.01-188,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.234,119.346,The... the provision you just read.
2002.01-188,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,119.346,121.1,"Oh, absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,121.1,135.848,"Mr. Phillips, that... that provision is... is in the portion of the statute dealing with the approval of the State plan, a State plan has to have that consequence."
2002.01-188,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,138.57,140.209,"That's true, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-188,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.209,150.172,It doesn't say that each... each... each feature enacted by a State has to be judged individually under that standard.
2002.01-188,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,178.586,187.0,"Well, the way this operates is that this is not adopted as a part of the State's plan that's subjected to review by the Secretary of HHS."
2002.01-188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.061,199.976,"Yes, but do you--"
2002.01-188,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,199.976,200.486,--but it's not a part of the plan.
2002.01-188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.486,232.657,"--but is it... is it the case, if we were to, let's suppose, affirm here, that the Health & Human Services head could nonetheless call a halt to it and say, you no longer conform with our understanding of what's required, you're holding hostage our Medicaid recipients and it's having a negative effect on them because of the prior approval requirements of drugs that otherwise wouldn't be required?"
2002.01-188,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,236.159,242.354,"I believe the Secretary might have that power, although I would ask you to ask Mr. Kneedler when... when he's arguing."
2002.01-188,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.354,244.01,"Well, I probably will."
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1411.414,1420.41,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-188,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1441.057,1445.977,"Well, does that lead to a conclusion as to its view as to this program that we're considering?"
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1446.987,1449.269,--If I could... there are two problems--
2002.01-188,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.269,1450.336,As far as the Secretary is concerned.
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1450.336,1458.321,--There are two problems with the... with the State program under this Medicaid director's letter that the Secretary sent out.
2002.01-188,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1497.521,1499.134,"I see that, but I... I mean, I'm a little bit at sea."
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1530.378,1543.59,"Well, it's... the... the... we have cited this regulation in our brief, and the... and under Allens v. Robbins the Secretary's, or the... the Secretary's interpretation's set forth in the brief."
2002.01-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.338,1548.12,"Why hasn't the Secretary acted under it, then?"
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1567.746,1567.882,Well--
2002.01-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.882,1568.912,--do we have to get involved?
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1568.912,1581.14,"--Well, if I could just answer that and then move to the second question, because I think it's related, the regulation identifies what... that material changes in the plan have to be submitted for an amendment."
2002.01-188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1598.319,1599.947,"Well then, why doesn't the Secretary do it?"
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1599.947,1615.022,"--I think it was... it's entirely reasonable... first of all, that's a matter of enforcement discretion under Heckler v. Cheney, and at least for the time being, why this... while this case is under... is under submission, the Secretary has not... has not proceeded."
2002.01-188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1615.022,1620.666,"Well, but I think the Secretary is ignoring one serious problem, and I suspect it's behind Justice Scalia's question."
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1689.145,1697.054,"Well, in going forward, I mean, the Secretary issued this Medicaid director's letter in September, after the Court had granted review--"
2002.01-188,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1697.054,1697.257,Ah.
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1697.257,1699.967,--because this was an area that required attention.
2002.01-188,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1708.394,1708.926,"Well, is there some--"
2002.01-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.926,1709.048,--And if--
2002.01-188,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1709.048,1724.485,--Is there some mechanism by... or authority by which we could somehow refer this back to the district court to seek some kind of information from the Secretary?
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1724.485,1725.975,"--Well, here's the way I think that it could proceed."
2002.01-188,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1725.975,1727.461,How... how could we do it?
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1729.377,1733.807,"I... I think the procedural posture of this case would allow that, and let me explain why."
2002.01-188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1782.734,1789.036,"--But as I understand it, Mr. Kneedler, it is... it is at least theoretically possible that the Secretary could approve this very plan."
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1789.036,1791.487,If... on the proper showing.
2002.01-188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1792.994,1793.483,"Right, of course."
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1794.378,1795.397,--Yes.
2002.01-188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1800.076,1800.231,Yes.
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1804.173,1810.056,--That's... but we believe that the purpose that has been advanced does not save this statute.
2002.01-188,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1829.806,1831.316,So is the procedure--
2002.01-188,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1831.316,1833.891,--Would you... would you finish your response to me--
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1833.891,1834.167,Yes.
2002.01-188,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1834.456,1835.04,--to tell me--
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1835.04,1835.387,--Yes.
2002.01-188,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1835.387,1838.282,--what it is that you think we could do?
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1838.282,1849.76,"If the Court reversed the court of appeals decision, in effect affirmed the district court's injunction, which was entered on the basis that the plan serves no Medicaid-related purpose, the State program would be enjoined."
2002.01-188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.611,1879.249,"Why couldn't that procedure be followed by affirming, and saying there should be a hearing in the district court on these very issues that you're raising, and both sides would present the facts?"
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1879.249,1880.917,We don't think it would be a hearing in the district court.
2002.01-188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1898.755,1904.815,Do you read the statutory authorization for prior approval to mean prior approval only if there's a Medicaid-related benefit?
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1904.815,1905.395,We... we do.
2002.01-188,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.777,1909.82,You rely entirely on legislative history for that?
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1909.82,1932.696,"--No, and also there are two other provisions of the act which we think are relevant, on the one hand, a19, which talks about the best interests of the patients, but on the other hand, a(30)... this is 1396a(30)(A), which says that a State plan must provide for methods of payment that advance efficiency and economy in the Medicaid program."
2002.01-188,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1970.932,1993.061,"Mr. Kneedler, it... it was the Government's first position that this Court ought to let the case ripen, and now you... you are necessarily taking a position in this lawsuit because we granted cert, but the Government made a pretty good argument essentially that this case wasn't ripe."
2002.01-188,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1993.061,2019.302,"--Well, ripe for this Court's review, but we now... we now believe that, given that the director's letter that was sent out in September, that there is a basis, there's an articulation of the Secretary's position both on plan amendments and the requirement of a Medicaid-related purpose that... that this Court could properly dispose of this case in the narrow... in the narrow way I suggested which, of course, would also obviate any requirement to consider the Commerce Clause question."
2002.01-188,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.563,2031.679,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2035.874,2043.132,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.835,2083.322,And you think that's one of the valid uses of the authorization provision?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2092.094,2101.935,I concede that... that Congress never thought that Maine might use prior authorization in the way that Maine Rx anticipates it.
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.536,2106.212,You can use it for anything at all?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2118.379,2135.775,"--As you get further and further for the purposes of... of providing health care, you approach uses a... of prior authorization that might offend Congress and this Court, but preemption is a question for Congress."
2002.01-188,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.775,2153.692,"Well, did Maine offer in the district court, in the hearings on whether a preliminary injunction should issue, a justification for how the Maine Rx program benefits Medicaid patients?"
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2153.692,2156.493,We did not so argue in the district court.
2002.01-188,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2156.493,2156.633,Okay.
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.633,2158.406,When you say... who does it apply to?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2174.63,2177.039,"Well, it's... it's those without insurance."
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2177.039,2178.759,So that's a fairly small group.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2181.297,2183.581,If... we anticipate 22 percent.
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.301,2185.531,"Okay, so 15, 22 percent."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2192.376,2193.153,--And you don't know--
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.153,2199.061,"It sounds like a case, to me, that has to go to the Secretary, whose job it is to approve it, rather than having us fly blind."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2199.061,2207.684,"--Well, here's the difference between what the Secretary approved and what the Maine... and... and what he's proposing with respect to Maine Rx and the plan amendments."
2002.01-188,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2219.186,2221.446,That has been approved for Maine?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2221.446,2225.272,Approved and struck down by the D.C. Circuit on Christmas Eve.
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.868,2251.438,That isn't an answer to my question.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2272.197,2297.384,"Well, the Secretary is suggesting that the State of Maine seek a plan amendment, but by definition, a plan amendment allows... a plan amendment is something that, if we sought a plan amendment to run Maine Rx it would necessarily be allowed by the Medicaid statute."
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.03,2303.679,I'm not following you.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2304.652,2305.19,--We don't--
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.19,2310.654,"--even if the Secretary disapproved this, were it a plan, we still could do it?"
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2317.686,2320.488,"--Well, if the Secretary were to--"
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2320.488,2324.608,"Now, you can explain why it shouldn't be no, but I want to know if that's what I'm supposed to decide."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2324.608,2327.001,--It's not what you're supposed to decide.
2002.01-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.803,2358.271,"Well, but is this actually a... the... the State... the State of Maine running its Medicaid program, it... it's a freestanding statute, isn't it?"
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2358.271,2361.545,"--It's an entirely different... correct, it's an entirely different statute."
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2367.764,2367.918,That's fine.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2383.527,2385.728,But you should not decide that now.
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2385.728,2386.938,Is that what you think we should decide now?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2390.32,2391.088,Not precisely.
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2391.088,2398.118,--I can decide the question if the Sec... you're saying... suppose the Secretary's approval makes no difference.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2401.23,2402.02,Okay.
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2402.02,2405.789,"There would... a legal question, can you have this statute anyway?"
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2405.789,2407.485,Yes.
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.485,2408.201,Okay.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2409.587,2412.467,I believe that's what I--
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2412.467,2412.704,All right.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2433.374,2434.061,--Well--
2002.01-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.061,2438.787,--that is so clearly contrary to the Medicaid program using the Medicaid device.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2438.787,2454.489,"--The question that this... the first question that this Court certified was, as described in the Secretary's brief, is whether the Federal Medicaid statute allows the use of that authority under the statute to compel... the prior authorization authority--"
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.489,2455.931,And I assume it--
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2455.931,2456.933,--And he says yes.
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.933,2475.658,"--And it would be a waste of time and money for us to send it back to the Secretary, at least if we are convinced on the basis of the briefs submitted here, that even if the Secretary did approve it, that approval would be invalid."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2478.521,2478.809,If the--
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.809,2482.814,--that whatever primary jurisdiction is involved here--
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2482.814,2483.479,--If the--
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.479,2492.24,"--it certainly makes no sense to send it back to the Secretary if, when the Secretary approves it, there is then a lawsuit and we say, oh, by the way, he couldn't approve this."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2492.24,2492.372,--Right.
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.372,2493.27,This goes too far.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2495.026,2504.049,"You can decide the preemption question now, and I think that the Court should, and the preemption question is whether Congress intended to prohibit what Maine has here done."
2002.01-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2531.144,2544.102,"Doesn't the Secretary have some discretion in this area as to whether to say it's good or bad, the... the Maine plan, or are you saying it's simply not his business?"
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2544.102,2546.917,--It's Congress' business--
2002.01-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2546.917,2547.189,"Well, right."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2547.189,2548.531,--to set the line--
2002.01-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2548.531,2555.976,But did Congress in what it enacted leave any room for the Secretary to have some discretion here?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2555.976,2578.071,"--What Congress enacted was the opportunity for the Secretary to tell the State that when it's begun a program or is operating its Medicaid program out of compliance with the Medicaid statute, that it believes that that's the case, and the provision provides for a fair hearing for the State, we get together with the Secretary, we try to work it out."
2002.01-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2593.477,2605.198,"But if... if it's a freestanding pro... if it's a freestanding statute, not part of Maine's Medicaid, how can the Secretary disapprove a freestanding statute?"
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2605.198,2614.868,"--What he can do is look to the effect of what happens once Maine Rx is implemented, and look to the effect on the Medicaid beneficiaries as to whether or not they'll be harmed."
2002.01-188,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2614.868,2639.405,"Well, the Secretary theoretically could conclude already that to require prior approval for every prescription drug will have negative effects on Medicaid recipients who otherwise would not have to seek prior approval, because there's quite a bit in the record about the difficulty when prior approval must be obtained."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2639.405,2645.089,"Oh, I submit there... that there's... I disagree with respect to the record."
2002.01-188,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2701.785,2705.944,"Well, I question whether this is correctly described as a facial challenge."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2726.627,2744.108,"--No, and... and what the First Circuit didn't know was how the program would actually be implemented, and there are many ways of implementing the program that not only will not cause harm to Medicaid beneficiaries, but which will affirmatively advance the purposes of Medicaid."
2002.01-188,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2744.108,2746.69,Is the program now in a... being operated?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2746.69,2749.226,"It is not, and the reason that it's not is because the--"
2002.01-188,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2749.226,2753.292,"The way you spoke, I thought you had some current experience."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2753.292,2758.583,--We do have current experience with the use of prior authorization to save Medicaid money.
2002.01-188,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2758.583,2760.775,"For Medicaid, for Medicaid patients."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2760.775,2770.6,"For Medicaid, correct, and as a result of that experience we know much more about our abilities and would be able to describe to the district court much more about our abilities should the First Circuit--"
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2770.6,2773.755,Why wasn't the plan put into effect if the injunction was lifted?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2773.755,2776.708,--The mandate was stayed pending--
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.708,2776.904,"Oh, I see."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2776.904,2781.75,"--for a writ of certiorari, so we've... we've not had an opportunity to implement the program."
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2781.75,2793.242,"But the Federal Government, with reference to Medicaid, certainly thinks prior authorization is an important enforcement mechanism and now you're saying oh, don't worry about it, it doesn't make much difference."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2793.242,2793.957,Well--
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2793.957,2795.501,That's hard for me to accept.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2795.501,2805.505,"--Well, the Federal Government agrees that prior authorization... prior authorization is undeniably a cost-saving measure."
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2835.932,2842.621,But the very reason you put that on the bargaining table is because you know it's going to... it's going to slow down the sales of some of these drugs.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2860.702,2861.59,I believe that you're wrong.
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2864.957,2867.402,"I read the Government's brief to the contrary, but I'll take a look at it."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2867.402,2868.216,"--Yeah, I believe--"
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2868.216,2881.288,"You're representing that it's drug-by-drug, so a company can agree with you as to nine of the drugs, and those will not be subject to prior authorization, but only the tenth drug, as to which you can't agree, will be subject to prior authorization?"
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2881.288,2882.009,--I believe--
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2882.009,2882.831,That's your representation?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2882.831,2902.726,"--As to the... I believe that our administrative rules demonstrate, proposed administrative rules that the Department hasn't enacted because the injunction has been imposed allow the Department of Human Services of the State of Maine to look on a drug-by-drug basis as to whether any particular drug ought to be subjected to prior--"
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2902.726,2908.117,"Does it allow it, if it uses, to look on a company-by-company basis, as I'd first described?"
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2910.583,2912.847,"--What will happen is, if--"
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2912.847,2914.444,--to discretion of the State.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2914.444,2925.107,"--In other words, if Pfizer were to agree to provide a rebate for some of its drugs but not all of its drugs, must we look to the other drugs--"
2002.01-188,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.107,2925.525,Yes.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2925.525,2927.185,--and determine prior authorization?
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.874,2936.465,I take that to be a yes?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2936.465,2937.329,--The answer is yes.
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.329,2943.879,You can keep all of their drugs off unless they give you what you want for some of them?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2943.879,2947.782,"We could, but the statute also allows us not to."
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.782,2947.913,Yeah.
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2947.913,2948.917,The purpose of that--
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2948.917,2956.789,"You could, that's... and... and you say it... that the statute envisions using this authorization as a cost-saving measure."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2963.25,2966.642,--To the Medicare?
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.642,2967.886,To... to the Medicaid--
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2967.886,2979.782,"Oh, the Medicaid recipients, the Medicaid recipients themselves pay nothing, but it can save money in, and it's probable that it will save money in the Medicaid program, and the reason for that--"
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.782,2984.398,"--I understand, because some people won't come into the program who otherwise would come in."
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,2984.398,2999.849,"--Well, that's what the First Circuit picked up on, but the other reason and the other method in which it would save Medicaid money is, it would result in shifting prescribing behavior from more expensive drugs to less expensive drugs."
2002.01-188,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3002.299,3003.549,But doesn't that depend on who you make the deals with?
2002.01-188,2,16248,andrew_s_hagler,,3012.375,3038.573,"--Subsection 13 of the Maine Rx statute gives to the Commissioner the discretion to run the Medicaid program and the maine Rx program in a coordinated manner so as to enhance efficiencies in both, and so I believe that the Commissioner would never impose prior authorization on the cheapest drug in a therapeutic class even if that manufacturer didn't provide a Maine Rx rebate, because it would be silly to do so."
2002.01-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.804,3041.843,I've known some silly administrators.
2002.01-188,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3565.953,3571.854,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-188,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3651.387,3664.391,"A brief question, I don't... I'm worried about your time, but is it inconceivable to say that there was no showing at the time of the preliminary injunction hearing but now they... Maine says they can make the showing that they should have made before."
2002.01-188,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3665.853,3678.731,"Well, I think when you get past the preliminary injunction and you move on to the permanent injunction, if they think that they can show no burden whatsoever, or if they think they can show that there are greater purposes to be served, that's certainly available to them."
2002.01-188,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3688.942,3689.67,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
