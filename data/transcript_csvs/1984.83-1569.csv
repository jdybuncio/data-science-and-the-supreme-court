1984.83-1569,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,78.413,"Mr. Cross, I think you may proceed now whenever you are ready."
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,78.413,82.005,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1569,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.168,248.123,"Is there any issue about the arbitrability under the agreement, I mean, that reach?"
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,248.123,264.174,"No, Your Honor, the Respondent has raised that issue in their brief in response to our brief, but the fact is that the district court and the circuit court have both reviewed the scope of the agreement and rendered findings."
1984.83-1569,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,264.174,271.059,"That unless there is some policy against it, the arbitration would have gone forward under the agreement."
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,271.059,271.628,That's right.
1984.83-1569,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.535,282.767,At least that is the way the case comes to us.
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,282.767,294.885,"--That's right, and the way the case comes to you is, as the circuit court put it, a question of initial impression, may antitrust cases be arbitrated as a matter of public policy."
1984.83-1569,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.797,300.548,I don't really understand that.
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,309.885,314.015,"Oh, no, I'm saying I believe the only issue before you is may it be arbitrated."
1984.83-1569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,321.142,324.812,But they also maintain that it is not within the scope of the agreement.
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,324.812,326.184,--They maintain that.
1984.83-1569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,326.635,328.115,You just think there is no merit to their argument.
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,328.115,332.719,"--What I am saying is I don't think there's any merit, but the circuit court and the district court also didn't think there was any merit."
1984.83-1569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,335.08,337.762,"Well, I understand, but at least the issue is before us, I think, under their briefs."
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,338.423,338.993,"Well, I--"
1984.83-1569,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,338.993,341.054,"--There are two cases here, aren't there?"
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,341.054,341.465,"--Yes, there are."
1984.83-1569,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.465,342.036,And that's the--
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,342.036,344.657,The question presented on the cross-petition does not raise that issue.
1984.83-1569,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.998,372.323,"--Well, but I suppose you would agree that the Respondent in the case you are arguing could support affirmance on a ground that is within the reach of the record."
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,387.643,388.965,"--I suppose that's right, Your Honor."
1984.83-1569,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.965,390.816,"Well, then, that's the first point of his brief."
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,392.438,399.521,He presented to the court below not the issue that I believe is presented in this court.
1984.83-1569,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.386,407.646,"I understand, I understand."
1984.83-1569,0,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,410.668,425.499,"No, he's not argue... I don't think he's arguing that here I think what he is arguing here, my recollection of what his brief argues before you is that in a general arbitration clause which says disputes between the parties may be arbitrated cannot as a matter of law be broad enough to encompass statutory claims--"
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,1720.423,1723.845,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.831,1848.035,You say the quota was 1900 and they sold... the quota was 1900--
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,1848.035,1848.485,"--1992, sir."
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.485,1849.827,--And they sold 4000?
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,1849.827,1850.766,"Over 4000, yes."
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.611,2121.395,"Now, Mr. Rodriguez-Ramon, both the district court and the Court of Appeals decided this question against you, didn't they?"
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2121.395,2122.717,"Yes, that's correct."
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.717,2126.08,So you have a fairly hard row to hoe here I would say--
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2126.08,2127.239,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2127.239,2127.98,--in getting us to change that.
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2127.98,2129.462,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2258.227,2265.452,Is it your contention that none of the disputes between Mitsubishi and Soler were subject to arbitration?
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2265.452,2266.821,That is correct.
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.784,2289.708,But are there other disputes than those you have just mentioned in the case?
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2289.708,2290.317,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.317,2294.16,And are those subject... are those covered by the arbitration?
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2294.16,2294.661,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.661,2299.503,Then wouldn't Soler have to go to Japan anyway to arbitrate those?
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2299.503,2325.912,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, not necessarily, because we believe that the facts are so intertwined... and I know I am going to be faced with Dean-Witter, but the problem that we have with the nonapplicability of Dean-Witter is that Dean-Witter s an action solely under the Securities Act in regard to a claim under common law principles."
1984.83-1569,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.741,2424.637,"What do you say to your opponent's argument that if it is a... you had a take it or leave it situation, why did they write an arbitration clause that wasn't as broad as they contended?"
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2426.859,2432.711,"I believe they wrote a very narrow arbitration clause, Your Honor, intendedly."
1984.83-1569,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2475.819,2485.686,"It would seem to me that if arbitration in Japan is a great advantage to them, that they would have insisted on having all statutory claims arbitrated, too, if they were dictating the terms."
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2485.686,2487.136,"--I agree, sir, but they did not."
1984.83-1569,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2488.197,2488.838,I see.
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2488.838,2496.104,"They probably did not have that in mind, and they probably could never imagine that two courts in the United States could decide in their favor."
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2684.411,2688.635,"Well, why is that right that you say the litigant has in this proceeding any different than the claim made in."
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2692.237,2699.181,"--Well, in this case, Your Honor, in this case, this claim is of the constitutional rank."
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2700.132,2704.176,An antitrust claim is of constitutional rank?
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2704.176,2720.485,"--No, no, litigation of an antitrust claim before a district court, U.S. District Court, and before a Jury, the mere fact that the complainant has a right to be heard by a jury and to adjudication through a remedy by a jury has constitutional rank?"
1984.83-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.485,2726.228,"But the plaintiff in Alberto-Culver I think could have made that same claim, couldn't he?"
1984.83-1569,1,17981,benjamin_rodriguezramon,,2726.228,2727.36,"Yes, yes."
1984.83-1569,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.516,2921.086,Mr. Ganzfried:
1984.83-1569,2,30659,jerrold_joseph_ganzfried,,2921.086,2923.389,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1569,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3048.8,3075.088,"Suppose an arbitration agreement were drafted that all claims including any possible claims under antitrust theories would be submitted to final binding arbitration, and went on to provide that the arbitrators shall be three senior United States judges or three senior state Supreme Court justices?"
1984.83-1569,2,30659,jerrold_joseph_ganzfried,,3075.088,3082.393,"We would take the same position, that that would not be an enforceable agreement."
1984.83-1569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3118.965,3121.367,What is so bad about having no appellate review?
1984.83-1569,2,30659,jerrold_joseph_ganzfried,,3121.367,3138.91,"--The problem is that if there is an error in the application of the antitrust laws, and we are assuming now that the arbitration panel decides to apply the American antitrust laws, which is not at all certain in this case, there is always the possibility of error."
1984.83-1569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3138.91,3141.301,"Yes, but that's what people bargain for in an arbitration."
1984.83-1569,2,30659,jerrold_joseph_ganzfried,,3148.555,3173.502,"We say that when the parties are resolving a dispute that is essentially just between the two of them, they are perfectly free to do that, but when it comes to the antitrust laws and what they are talking about is an impact on competition, the public interest does require that the parties not discard that remedy, not discard the public interest in advance on a blanket basis."
1984.83-1569,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3180.345,3193.405,"I suppose that even if the antitrust claims are arbitrable, that it isn't binding on customers, it isn't binding on the government antitrust enforcement people as well."
1984.83-1569,2,30659,jerrold_joseph_ganzfried,,3193.405,3194.316,"--That's right, but it--"
1984.83-1569,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3194.316,3197.939,So there still are mechanisms in place--
1984.83-1569,2,30659,jerrold_joseph_ganzfried,,3197.939,3198.858,--Not necessarily.
1984.83-1569,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3225.325,3228.207,"--That wouldn't restrain the Department of Justice, would it?"
1984.83-1569,2,30659,jerrold_joseph_ganzfried,,3228.207,3232.461,If the conduct was--
1984.83-1569,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3232.461,3234.441,Just because the parties were bound by the agreement--
1984.83-1569,2,30659,jerrold_joseph_ganzfried,,3234.441,3244.068,"--But if the arbitrators had incorrectly concluded that conduct was permissible under the antitrust laws, the Department of Justice could bring an action."
1984.83-1569,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3340.76,3344.974,"--Well, Congress certainly never said so expressly, did it?"
1984.83-1569,2,30659,jerrold_joseph_ganzfried,,3361.725,3364.717,There is no express statement to that effect.
1984.83-1569,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3525.851,3529.173,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Cross?"
1984.83-1569,3,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,3529.173,3535.898,"Would you comment at some point on that last point, the absence of the oath taking?"
1984.83-1569,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3554.001,3558.512,"Well, then, the arbitrators have got to pass on the credibility of the people."
1984.83-1569,3,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,3558.512,3559.934,"--I think the arbitrators do, Your Honor."
1984.83-1569,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3593.217,3595.838,"May I ask you on the procedure, what about discovery in an arbitration?"
1984.83-1569,3,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,3599.281,3613.048,"--The discovery in our arbitration proceedings before the various arbitration associations is left largely to the discretion of the arbitrators themselves, and in practice, that means largely to the discretion of the parties."
1984.83-1569,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3692.982,3695.502,"Thank you, gentlemen."
