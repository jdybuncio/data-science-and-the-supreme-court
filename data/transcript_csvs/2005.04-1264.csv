2005.04-1264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.633,We'll hear argument next in Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna.
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,6.308,9.276,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,97.613,107.472,"You... you concede, though, that if... if the challenge to the underlying contract implicates the arbitration clause as well, that that is for the court and not the arbitrator."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,107.472,108.515,"Your Honor, we--"
2005.04-1264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,108.515,113.188,"In other words, you know, you put a gun to the person's head and say, sign this contract, and the person does."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,117.954,147.441,"--Your Honor, we concede that there is an asterisk, as we put it in our brief, to the otherwise bright line rule set down in Prima Paint, that rule being if you're challenging the arbitration clause, you can stay in court, but if you're challenging the underlying contract, you have to go to arbitration, precisely along the lines that Your Honor identified where the challenge to the underlying contract involves the parties' assents to the underlying contract, that challenge necessarily challenges your assent to arbitration."
2005.04-1264,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.963,167.804,Does... does that include a quarrel over offer and acceptance?
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,167.804,170.913,"Your Honor, I think--"
2005.04-1264,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,170.913,175.436,I'm... we're trying to explore the... the meaning of... of this... of this assent.
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,182.879,185.246,"--You're absolutely right, Your Honor, that there are going to be hard cases."
2005.04-1264,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.697,194.191,What about offer and acceptance?
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,194.191,224.223,"--I think generally when you're not saying I didn't agree to the underlying contract, in other words, where you're not saying that's a forgery or the... the person who signed that didn't have authority, where you' re... where you're really... where you're not challenging factual agreement to the underlying contract, then it's fair game to send you to... to arbitration because when... you factually agreed to... to arbitrate."
2005.04-1264,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.223,225.565,You misinterpreted my letter.
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,226.669,229.829,You misinterpreted my letter.
2005.04-1264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.326,260.973,"Well, Prima Paint did, though, involve what we would characterize as a voidable contract."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,260.973,263.047,"Your Honor, that is not--"
2005.04-1264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.047,276.048,And I think it is conceivable that the Florida court was correct that you could draw the line some way and say contracts that are void should be handled differently.
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,276.048,278.085,"--Your Honor, two responses to that."
2005.04-1264,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,294.664,298.276,"Yes, but voidness is a question of public policy."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,313.491,323.922,"--Your Honor, you're entirely correct, and I think again the... the insight of Prima Paint is that you are perfectly able to present your challenge to the underlying contract."
2005.04-1264,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.78,391.112,It's... it's a little odd that--
2005.04-1264,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,391.112,391.284,Mr. Landau--
2005.04-1264,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.284,401.764,"--the way our... it's a little odd that the way our cases have... have worked out is that we assume there's two contracts, one for arbitration and the other for the rest of the contracts."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,406.428,426.329,"Well, Your Honor, again, I think the... the Federal Arbitration Act, both section 4 and section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, certainly permits that... that way of looking at it because section 4, as Prima Paint emphasized, says, you know, once the making of the arbitration agreement is clear, it must go to arbitration."
2005.04-1264,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,454.815,459.758,"--Mr. Landau, maybe this... this is a point your... the respondent makes."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,486.119,515.386,"--Your Honor, it is certainly true that Prima Paint itself arose from Federal court and that the decision is, I think, rather carefully written to talk about Federal courts as a... in fact, Justice Harlan concurred in Prima Paint to say he would have affirmed the Second Circuit in that case on the basis of the Lawrence case, which said that this rule applies in Federal and State court, the FAA."
2005.04-1264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,580.622,592.488,"What... what's wrong with the argument that when you're dealing with a void contract, as opposed to a voidable one, that the State policy is that you don' t enforce any aspect of it?"
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,607.565,616.25,"Not really, Your Honor, in the sense that the... the insight of Prima Paint, again, is that you treat the arbitration clause as separate from the underlying contract."
2005.04-1264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,617.053,620.423,But we don't do that with other provisions of void contracts.
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,641.214,646.863,"--Your Honor, that is certainly one plausible world view that one could have taken as an initial matter when confronting this issue."
2005.04-1264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.975,667.475,"Of course, you could say the same thing about a voidable contract."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,671.065,672.267,"Well, in fact--"
2005.04-1264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.267,677.955,"I mean, in... in that respect, a contract that's void is no different from a contract that's voidable."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,677.955,678.889,--In fact... exactly.
2005.04-1264,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,704.456,713.745,You also run into a problem with the... some States classify a contract as voidable and other States for that same ground make it void.
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,720.041,727.805,"You are absolutely right, Your Honor, and I don't think this Court should lose sight of the bright line importance of the Prima Paint rule."
2005.04-1264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,741.315,749.36,Do we usually... do we usually ask arbitrators to enforce broader notions of public policy as opposed to the specific agreements of the party?
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,767.333,768.447,"Oh, sure, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,860.935,863.722,What would be the issues for the arbitrator in this case?
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,878.226,879.589,"That is the key issue, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.213,943.944,Did the arbitrator--
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,943.944,944.928,--looking to Florida--
2005.04-1264,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,944.928,949.601,--Could the arbitrator decide that I'm... I'm going to apply the new statute rather than the old one?
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,949.601,954.826,"--Well, I think the arbitrator will say, you know... first of all, if I could just make one point clear for the record."
2005.04-1264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1091.81,1092.651,"Oh, no, that's not true."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1110.826,1115.609,"--Well, Your Honor, I... I guess maybe it depends on how you look at the word threshold."
2005.04-1264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.259,1197.539,"If the case was one in which the merits issue you claim is basically the same as the legality issue under the contract... but would your argument be as strong if it were different, if you had a different reason for claiming that the contract was void or voidable?"
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1197.539,1199.343,"The... I think the argument, Your Honor, would be the same."
2005.04-1264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1256.611,1261.577,What about the possibility that you always want a neutral decision maker in cases like this?
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1270.665,1278.299,"--Your Honor, you... I think it's important to keep in mind that in this case, they have not challenged the arbitrator."
2005.04-1264,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.769,1279.22,No.
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1285.089,1295.819,"--Your Honor, I don't... I think that's... again, that... if you were to have a presumption that the arbitrator is always in favor of upholding a contract, that would seem somewhat in tension at the very--"
2005.04-1264,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1295.819,1296.012,"No, no."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1306.423,1306.864,"--Oh, yes."
2005.04-1264,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1306.864,1307.925,--he decides one way or the other?
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1307.925,1308.028,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2005.04-1264,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1308.268,1313.894,So he has no particular interest in getting paid in upholding the contract or not.
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1313.894,1315.469,"You're absolutely right, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.856,1437.796,"Well, Prima Paint certainly displaced the States and State law from this area in a very substantial... to a very substantial extent."
2005.04-1264,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1442.962,1444.445,"I'm not aware of any, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.652,1548.629,"Thank you, Mr. Landau."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1549.491,1554.175,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1264,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1613.422,1627.684,"I guess what they would say is that there... they insist only that the agreement be to arbitrate, and to the extent there is an agreement to arbitrate, they can enforce section 2, and the arbitrator can decide whether the broader agreement is enforceable."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1627.684,1628.697,--That's an argument.
2005.04-1264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1723.473,1733.702,"When I was working on the first options in those cases, I thought there was from Southland a pretty clear distinction between whether the person is attacking the arbitration clause itself."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1762.841,1768.878,"We... we do not in any way urge this Court to overturn... the Court does not need to overturn Southland, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.523,1772.107,"I mean, logically you're right."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1829.741,1832.699,"Well, Your Honor, let... before I go on with the statutory arguments--"
2005.04-1264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.699,1833.19,I'm putting it dramatically because I want to get your--
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1833.19,1841.034,"--let me... before I talk about the statutory arguments, then let me go to the policy arguments and this idea that we're going to open the flood gates and undermine the Federal Arbitration Act."
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.443,1899.848,"Every usury case, for example."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1902.597,1906.962,"After the National Banking Act, Your Honor, there are actually very few usury cases left."
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.327,1936.951,What about fraud in the inducement?
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1936.951,1942.558,Fraud in the inducement does not go to rendering the contract void ab initio.
2005.04-1264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1952.074,1952.504,Mr. Bland.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1952.504,1952.685,--Your Honor--
2005.04-1264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1952.685,1956.506,"Mr. Bland, some State may say fraud in the inducement is void."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,1986.255,1995.854,"--Well, the... the... Your Honor, first, the Congress drew the line when it said that you had to have a contract first as to whether or not a contract came into existence."
2005.04-1264,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2049.373,2049.954,But almost every State--
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2049.954,2050.134,--of the party.
2005.04-1264,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.134,2055.54,--almost ever State will... has an exception for contracts that are void against public policy.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2072.25,2079.232,"I think you will find, Your Honor, if you look at the... at the law that's developed around void ab initio contracts, that it's fairly rare."
2005.04-1264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2093.303,2098.749,But if you open the door... if you open the door... public policy has been called an unruly horse.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2110.596,2122.021,"But, Your Honor, there are already a host of circumstances in which litigants would like to be able to get out of contracts that do not involve arbitration clauses, where they would like to be able to argue that no contract came into existence in the first place."
2005.04-1264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2148.49,2149.974,You're giving the end result.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2161.318,2179.222,"Well, I think there's no reason to suspect that there's going to be abuse in which parties are going to come in and make frivolous arguments that an entire line of business is illegal and then... and that that's going to cause a flood gate of cases into courts because courts have, with rule 11 and other similar rules, a lot of ways of getting rid of those."
2005.04-1264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.222,2179.863,"--Well, what about--"
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2179.863,2180.085,It's very hard--
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.085,2186.695,"You get rid of them after frustrating the arbitration provision, the whole purpose of which is to keep you out of courts."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2190.975,2191.048,--Please.
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.048,2193.445,--appears at page 3 of the petitioner' s brief.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2230.926,2232.863,"Exactly, and that's the language--"
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.863,2233.924,So Southland was wrong.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2233.924,2234.217,--No.
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.698,2255.542,Why?
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2255.542,2256.143,That--
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.143,2258.159,Why would you make that... that weird distinction--
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2258.159,2259.05,--Because that--
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.05,2267.598,"--and treat the first part of it as though it applies across the board to the entire contract, but the last part of it, reading it differently?"
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2268.922,2276.986,--The first part of it is the way you... the way you trigger the existing forceability option at all is that it has to be in a contract in interstate commerce.
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.017,2313.415,"It seems to me even if you separate it, you still have the language, save upon such grounds that exist in law or in equity for the revocation of any contract."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2331.97,2347.927,"With all respect, Your Honor, I think that the way that it makes sense is that the... you get the threshold issue of getting through the limitation, as this Court described it in Southland on pages 10 and 11, of the limitation on the enforceability of arbitration clauses of is it in a contract in the first place."
2005.04-1264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.946,2412.391,"--It's not... the workability of it depends on how many challenges you get to people saying this contract is void, you know."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2438.939,2440.573,"No, I'm afraid I do not, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2440.573,2441.695,It's arbitration generally.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2490.01,2491.898,"I... I think two things, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2521.103,2521.856,--If we take--
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2521.856,2522.216,And I think that that language is--
2005.04-1264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2522.216,2532.145,"--if we take, Mr. Bland, what you said so... the words transaction involving commerce, but a contract... okay."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2541.976,2545.424,--Those are issues that we believe also are issues that a court would resolve.
2005.04-1264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2547.632,2550.921,--So we're going far... far beyond a void subject matter like usury.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2560.477,2564.761,"--I think that when Your Honor used the word far, that that... that that is not really fair."
2005.04-1264,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2749.155,2754.672,But there's no... but... but why do you assume that that underlying illegality taints the arbitration clause?
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2770.43,2774.843,"Because... because the language of the statute is what draws the key link difference to me, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2808.413,2827.03,"Are you saying then if this case, the case that was brought in Florida, had been brought or removed in... more likely removed because there was diversity, removed to the Federal court, the Federal court should do just what the Florida Supreme Court did?"
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2836.989,2844.212,"Your Honor, in this case I believe that the answer is that you would have the same result in State court or in Federal court."
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2852.776,2869.969,"Doesn't it... doesn't it follow from... from that theory of yours that in every case you are entitled to a judicial determination, not an arbitrator's determination, but a judicial determination that this was a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce?"
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2869.969,2871.483,"Yes, we do believe that, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.483,2872.276,Wow.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2886.167,2888.513,"And of course, in the Efabco case--"
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.513,2888.546,"Well, I mean, that's--"
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2888.546,2900.599,"--Well, that... this Court 2 years ago in 2003 in the Efabco case, the Alabama Supreme Court had developed a practice of finding that lots of contracts didn't involve interstate commerce and interstate commerce didn't reach to a lot of things."
2005.04-1264,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2911.572,2913.256,You said this was an issue for the court.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2917.178,2925.524,"--This was an arbitration case, and the Alabama Supreme Court had said that we're not going to enforce the Federal Arbitration Act, and Alabama is one of the three States that has... that has a State statute that bars it."
2005.04-1264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2925.524,2930.942,I had thought that the interstate commerce question was like Crowell v. Benson.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2958.523,2960.781,"But it... but it is also a statutory fact, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2960.781,2961.632,"Yes, it is."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2962.233,2962.986,It's a fact that the statute says both.
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.006,2971.13,--The question isn't whether the court can... can determine that fact.
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,2989.978,2993.348,"Your Honor, it's... it would not throw a monkey wrench because it's exactly what happened in Prima Paint."
2005.04-1264,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.051,3038.803,"Once the case is in the court, of course, the court has to decide that question."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3052.896,3062.122,"Well, where these cases come up again and again, Your Honor, is someone brings a lawsuit in court and then there is a motion to compel arbitration and there is a challenge to that motion."
2005.04-1264,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.273,3112.102,"Mr. Bland, I'm curious to know if you agree with your opponent that whoever decides it, an arbitrator or a judge, it's really going to be decided by the Florida Supreme Court in the next couple of months."
2005.04-1264,1,23603,f_paul_bland_jr,,3112.102,3126.898,"I think that the question of whether or not this is illegal will be something that's decided by the Florida Supreme Court, but that question... first of all, if this case is sent back to arbitration, the arbitration clause, of course, is on an individual basis and this case could never be pursued on an individual basis."
2005.04-1264,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3304.532,3305.937,"Thank you, Mr. Bland."
2005.04-1264,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3308.765,3310.178,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1264,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.679,3312.967,"Mr. Landau, I'd like to know how you read section 2."
2005.04-1264,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3317.099,3338.031,"--Your Honor, I think the word contract is not a precondition in the sense that respondents talk about in the sense that the court has to look into whether it's a valid contract with all the bells and whistles of State contract law because I think that is entirely inconsistent with Prima Paint."
2005.04-1264,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.667,3347.982,"But State law... the supposition is that State law provides that in this case, the usury context, whatever, you do not have a contract."
2005.04-1264,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3351.0,3368.533,"--Your Honor, I think the point is that it... the key part there is... I think Justice Breyer was getting to this... that it has to be a... a contract that evidences interstate commerce to have the hook of commerce power for the FAA to apply in the first place."
2005.04-1264,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3432.166,3441.724,I... I guess that respondent uses the language in the way it... he says it should be used when he refers to a contract that is void ab initio.
2005.04-1264,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3446.237,3446.758,No.
2005.04-1264,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3446.758,3449.598,If you take the meaning of contract that he takes in section 2.
2005.04-1264,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3449.598,3450.459,"I... I think you're... you're right, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3470.82,3481.963,"But I... his answer would be, well, you only get to do that if you're under the Federal Arbitration Act in the first place, and if you don't have a contract, then you're not under the Federal Arbitration Act under State law."
2005.04-1264,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3481.963,3482.476,"--You're right, Your Honor."
2005.04-1264,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3516.88,3527.812,"They can logically because they say the arbitration clause, when embedded in a contract that is voidable... i.e., A and B enter into a contract."
2005.04-1264,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3547.883,3551.835,"And you're absolutely right, Your Honor, and that was the lines that were drawn in Prima Paint."
2005.04-1264,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3576.018,3576.939,"Thank you, Mr. Landau."
2005.04-1264,2,19410,christopher_landau,,3576.939,3577.209,Thank you.
2005.04-1264,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3577.209,3578.131,The case is submitted.
