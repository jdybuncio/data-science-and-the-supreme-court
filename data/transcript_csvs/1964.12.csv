1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,454.622,456.717,Had it been checked before?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,456.717,473.901,"The year 1945 had been checked and the report filed in 1948, none of the other years apparently had ever been examined."

1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1461.581,1462.485,How do you raise it?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1466.089,1479.275,The -- a practical result of the Government is not getting these books would be that they would not -- if they wanted the books they'll probably have to have a hearing to reveal some --
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1479.275,1480.525,A judicial hearing?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1480.525,1482.129,A judicial hearing.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1494.431,1495.71,It's in the District Court?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1495.71,1497.179,Would be in the District Court Your Honor.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1497.179,1499.499,Then that could go to the Court of Appeals.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1499.499,1500.282,Yes Your Honor.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1500.282,1503.578,And that each one could come up here if they could get them.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1503.578,1505.012,"Yes, if they could get -- yes Your Honor."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1505.012,1507.058,How long has this one been pending?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1507.058,1527.059,"The examination -- there is one examination began in 1960 and the years 1948 or 1954 to 1958 were examined first, and then after that examination was finished then a ten-day letter was issued by the agent."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1550.606,1553.129,"In that, you mean -- you say barred?"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1553.129,1557.461,For the -- barred for the statute of limitations and open only by fraud.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1557.461,1559.777,But they're not barred if there's fraud.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1559.777,1561.072,"They're not barred, that's --"
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1561.072,1571.853,You agree that the Government has the right to -- if there's -- it can show fraud to assess the taxes --
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1571.853,1571.992,You're right Your Honor.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1571.992,1573.649,-- the taxes.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1573.649,1574.929,The Government can go back to --
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1574.929,1593.511,Your argument is that although the Government has the right to assess the taxes that's barred by fraud that the general autho -- its general authority to investigate the books could not be had until you have a judicial hearing and determine finally once and for all that there's a ground for the Government to do it.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1593.511,1594.009,Precisely Your Honor.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1594.009,1596.6,Then after that it has to go back through that.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1596.6,1597.395,Precisely.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1597.395,1600.89,And that would be -- then they could go to Court again --
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1600.89,1601.441,The --
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1601.441,1603.563,"-- in each case, couldn't it?"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1603.563,1604.795,"Yes Your Honor, they could."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1604.795,1616.182,"And it would take -- I'm just looking at the practical effect as it -- that doesn't govern it, but it might have some bearing as to what Congress intended to do."
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1616.182,1629.727,"Of course if they had some seeds of thought, some reasonable basis, some fact in the Courts which have been hearing these cases are not been very demanding in their requirements as to how much proof there should be."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1633.818,1639.182,"Well, the defendant -- the defendant who is worried about his tax wouldn't like to leave it up to the District Court, would he?"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1639.182,1640.216,"No sir, Your Honor, but --"
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1640.216,1642.596,He would delay it as long as he could.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1642.596,1642.957,Well --
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1642.957,1645.23,Quite actually more -- in most instances.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1645.23,1645.676,He would.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1654.686,1657.474,Because he wouldn't want to be examined if he had been honest?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1657.474,1663.033,"He should be free, that's under this inter -- (Inaudible) interpretation of the statute."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1668.503,1669.355,That's right.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1677.23,1681.314,"Indeed they have, and Your Honor, this one's a further factor I might add."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1701.745,1710.556,"Oh, do you mean -- you mean that the Government just by following that course would get the right which you say it cannot get under the other statute."
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1710.556,1712.5,They'd have the right to subpoena the books and --
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1712.5,1713.349,And get them.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1713.349,1713.926,-- and get the books.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1713.926,1718.383,Without regard to -- without requiring that it be proven they had reasonable ground to believe there's fraud.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1718.383,1720.125,Precisely.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1720.125,1725.052,So what's the practical benefit then if you get out of this -- if you win this?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1725.052,1725.599,They --
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1725.599,1727.004,Except a delay in this case?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1727.004,1730.417,The Government has to have some reasonable basis.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1738.597,1743.15,"-- not at all, as I understand it, you say they can go into the tax court to get them --"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1743.15,1743.248,Well that --
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1743.248,1745.831,-- without going to this prior trial if you --
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1745.831,1753.28,"Well, presuming that they had some basis and the Court didn't recognize it, then they, thereupon send out a statutory notice."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1770.553,1772.48,It has the burden of proof to establish --
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1772.48,1773.345,The fraud.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1773.345,1773.869,The fraud.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1773.869,1774.569,In order to get --
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1774.569,1774.931,But you're not saying --
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1774.931,1775.208,-- the tax.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1775.208,1779.36,-- it would have the burden of proof to establish that the Government had reasonable grounds to think --
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1779.36,1779.732,-- to make --
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1779.732,1780.294,-- there was fraud?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1780.294,1781.748,"No Your Honor, I wouldn't."
1964.12,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1781.748,1786.768,Then it has to start (Inaudible).
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1786.768,1788.328,Unless they have some basis sir.
1964.12,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1788.328,1796.079,"What about the -- what -- supposing the Government decided to take the case before the grand jury, subpoena and argue the books?"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1808.168,1813.033,You probably would have a privilege of a pleading of the Fifth Amendment but --
1964.12,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1813.033,1815.038,(Inaudible)
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1815.038,1819.228,"You have that here, that's right, but you wouldn't have it before the grand jury if they were --"
1964.12,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1819.228,1837.664,"So the Government could, if under your view, you felt the delay whereas in filed too long on the hearings and appeals, whatnot, just as to United States couldn't bring the case before the grand jury, that your books without anymore ado?"
1964.12,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1837.664,1844.519,I gather that the trouble is that without your books they don't have enough evidence to determine the case before the grand jury.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1844.519,1846.046,In some instance that's true.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1876.152,1888.009,Are you entitled to protect (Inaudible) as lawyer before the Commissioner for this -- of this kind of a -- ask him to bring into court -- (Inaudible) this question?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1888.009,1888.523,No.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1906.323,1909.858,"That's when the agent gets the man, gets his books."
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1920.538,1923.109,"He has the right to counsel, the Commissioner --"
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1923.109,1924.612,"Yes, before the grand jury."
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1924.612,1933.185,"The Commissioner in those -- well, recognized agents will say, ""You have the right to counsel particularly in a case of a fraud case""."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1950.584,1959.657,Does that -- does he also have the right to require a open hearing before the Commission or can they take him in private?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1959.657,1961.083,"Well, they can take him in private."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1966.781,1968.419,Are you sure about that?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1968.419,1987.255,"The only way he'd have a right to an open hearing would be to refuse his -- to give the tax -- the agent his books, and then the process is that the agent goes in, files a complaint asking the District Court for an order to require the taxpayer to bring in his books."
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1987.255,1988.503,That would be an open hearing?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1988.503,1990.17,That would be an open hearing.
1964.12,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1990.17,1994.641,"So, if you do get an open hearing then, you would not be able to get one before the grand jury."
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,1994.641,1997.546,He would not.
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.546,2010.762,"Counsel, you say that to get the post-statute examination there must have been an investigation in some suspicion of fraud."
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2031.665,2036.529,I believe that the Courts have not required the Government to prove fraud but to --
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.529,2037.085,I understand.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2037.085,2037.64,-- to prove some (Voice Overlap) --
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.64,2046.822,"I understand that, but you say that the mere assertion by the agent that -- well we have investigated, we do suspect fraud therefore we want the books."
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2049.525,2050.339,You're right Your Honor.
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.032,2071.789,"But it's clear from this record that the agent or someone had investigated it and that they did suspect fraud, and that one of his superiors had ordered him to get the books."
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2071.789,2072.058,I would say --
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.058,2073.016,"That much is clear, isn't it?"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2073.016,2091.838,I would say that's right that they had -- someone had the opinion that there was a possibility of finding fraud and that I won't say that they had a reasonable basis because there we never -- I never had the opportunity to ask the agent any questions that would lead the Court to --
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.838,2101.698,And what made you to believe that the (Inaudible) statute requires anymore than this assertion that we have investigated and we do suspect fraud?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2101.698,2115.228,Congress in 7605 having passed it after 7602 had its run for two or three years and they said that no tax -- this was entitled restrictions upon examination.
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.228,2117.738,"I understand that, but that -- but the --"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2117.738,2118.262,Well --
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2118.262,2129.923,It would be perfectly -- it requires something other than what is required before the statute has run if you require the agent to assert that he's investigated and he suspect fraud?
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2129.923,2131.233,"Well, the --"
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.233,2139.416,"I mean what ground is there to -- in 7605, to show that something beyond that assertion is required?"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2141.533,2149.082,I think the -- that combined that you must put that in the whole sphere of the income tax law.
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.952,2172.208,I think -- my -- I would assume that it does.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2189.14,2195.43,"Well that's merely an expression, an opinion of the agent without any basis of facts for it."
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.43,2195.632,That's right.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2195.632,2196.24,And the --
1964.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.24,2197.309,(Inaudible)
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2197.309,2205.568,We feel that the statute of limitations and the -- these other factors the Govt -- the Congress ordering the destruction of the income tax returns.
1964.12,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,2297.002,2307.717,"(Inaudible) is that right, to try out the issue of good faith of determination (Inaudible)?"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2307.717,2309.847,To that extent Your Honor that's correct that if --
1964.12,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,2309.847,2311.69,"At a trial, wouldn't?"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2311.69,2312.332,Sir?
1964.12,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,2312.332,2313.985,It would be quite a trial.
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2313.985,2323.174,"Well, the limiting -- the trial solely to the fact of -- that there's no reasonable basis to make the examination."
1964.12,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2327.287,2334.22,"Tell me again, can these revenue agents issue the subpoenas as -- just at their own (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.12,0,43895,william_r_bagby,,2334.22,2338.699,At their -- all they had to do is take the form and sign their name.
1964.12,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,2338.699,2338.832,And they won't have to check --
1964.12,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2821.033,2824.209,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.12,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2856.201,2859.488,Who had the authority to issue the screening?
1964.12,1,18113,bruce_j_terris,,2859.488,2879.208,The order -- a summons may be issued by ordinary agents and the purpose of Section 7605 (b) was that the Congress thought that ordinary agent shouldn't have the authority to issue summonses when there'd already been a prior inspection of the records.
1964.12,2,43895,william_r_bagby,,4760.214,4763.591,"Your Honor, I'd like to add a word or two."
1964.12,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4827.513,4841.894,"Is the only basis for charging it in an unreasonable investigation or examination, the one you have stated that they did not show sufficiently that there was reasonable cause to believe he was guilty of fraud?"
1964.12,2,43895,william_r_bagby,,4841.894,4866.05,"Not only that Your Honor but the fact that the interpretation of -- under -- of this clause, 7605 (b) requires that the Government reveal at the hearing in the District Court some facts revealing a reasonable basis, and the opinion of the District Court that there is a suspicion of fraud."
1964.12,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4866.091,4867.991,Was the only attack?
1964.12,2,43895,william_r_bagby,,4867.991,4868.744,Sir?
1964.12,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4868.744,4874.046,"Those are the only grounds upon which you attack, the reasonableness of the procedure."
1964.12,2,43895,william_r_bagby,,4874.046,4877.301,I would say that fairly well covers it Your Honor.
1964.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4877.301,4886.482,"How about this suggestion or may be less than a suggestion, innuendo of bad faith."
1964.12,2,43895,william_r_bagby,,4890.05,4902.138,"Yes, during the trial we were Your Honor, because the Court believed that all the agent need to do is to show that he was making an examination for these years."
1964.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4932.668,4934.628,"Well, now the Court of Appeals didn't agree with that though."
1964.12,2,43895,william_r_bagby,,4957.151,4960.209,"That is one of our positions, it's correct."
