2000.99-1687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.48,"We'll hear argument next in Number 99-1687, Gloria Bartnicki and Anthony Kane v. Frederick Vopper."
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,20.336,23.458,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2000.99-1687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,55.779,71.33,"Well, let me stop you right there and ask you why should the question of whether private information about someone is published turn on how the information was obtained?"
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,82.449,110.677,"Because I think Justice O'Connor what Congress and the state legislatures and in some respects the common law have recognized that separate and apart from the question about whether there is certain information that is so private that it should or shouldn't be revealed which raises content discrimination problems among other things, there is a vital interest in people having private places in their lives where a stealthy intruder cannot come in whether or not the individual--"
2000.99-1687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.677,134.184,"Well... well, it ought to turn on the public significance perhaps of the information and presumably the state can prevent unlawful tapping of wires directly and get at the bad actor, but why should it extend to the subsequent user who didn't do anything wrong?"
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,134.184,188.561,"--Because Your Honor, as Congress and some forty states have reasoned, if there is intrusion into an individual's private communications, a tap, a bug, a scanner, whatever, and then what is obtained is broadcast to all the world or under these statutes exploited in any other way, the same interests that are harmed by the initial intrusion are harmed again and all the more severely because in essence, you have invited in this instance a hundred thousand people to eavesdrop, and as petitioner Bartnicki stated in her deposition, when she, having no idea that anyone had intruded into her communication with Mr. Kane, when she heard on the radio it being broadcast she felt that she had been violated in front of a hundred thousand people and that is true I believe independent of the content."
2000.99-1687,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,202.678,207.844,But you want to say that if I also hear that and tell my wife that I'm committing a crime.
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,210.876,213.167,--If you--
2000.99-1687,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,213.167,216.119,Because the statute goes downstream without end.
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,222.504,227.527,"--Well, the far downstream uses are not at issue--"
2000.99-1687,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.527,239.545,"Oh, but it seems to me with all respect that they are because the respondents can raise those issues on an overly broad statute under the Thornhill doctrine even if this does not apply to them."
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,239.545,268.225,"--Well they... I think Your Honor, first of all they can't raise it when they they've brought explicitly an as applied challenge and at no point in the litigation until this Court have they started raising the other applications that they now posit, and secondly this Court in The Florida Star and all the preceding case emphasize that in the very difficult area and it is difficult of conflicts between privacy type interests and First Amendment interests the Court should decide only as much as it needs to decide in a particular case."
2000.99-1687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.225,277.039,"I suppose it's very difficult, is it not, to enforce the prohibition against wire tapping against the person who actually... who actually does the tapping."
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,287.478,289.74,That is certainly true in this very case--
2000.99-1687,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.74,291.142,"Which is what happened here, right?"
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,291.142,292.741,--That's what happened in this case.
2000.99-1687,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.741,297.346,An anonymous tape was sent to the radio station which is almost always the way it will happen.
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,297.346,304.618,And Congress... that is what happened in this case and Congress was told in both 1968 and '86 that it happens very frequently.
2000.99-1687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.209,306.992,"Well, let's change the facts just a little bit."
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,342.695,348.318,"--Your Honor, I believe the same... I think there are two responses to that."
2000.99-1687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,348.318,354.102,"Oh, I actually had that very situation as a trial court judge in a murder case."
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,362.43,365.031,"I think there are two responses to the question, Your Honor."
2000.99-1687,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,443.872,457.161,"Well, but in Seattle Times and Rhinehart and in the Aguilar case, we were controlling the people who received the information under a court order."
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,466.778,484.829,"--But in both instances, though, Justice Kennedy, we are saying that a person has information, it is of public importance, and because of interest bound up in the way in which they received it, we will not allow them to distribute."
2000.99-1687,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,545.4,548.191,But merely because it's content neutral does not mean you can regulate it.
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,560.052,583.196,"--Your Honor, I don't know of any case in which this Court has struck down a statute which is content neutral in the full sense that this one is except in some rare circumstances where the Court in essence has determined that too much speech is going to be supressed."
2000.99-1687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,669.992,674.316,Is this an as applied challenge in this suit--
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,674.316,675.037,Absolutely.
2000.99-1687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,675.037,676.747,--or is it attacking it facially?
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,676.747,678.359,"It's as applied, Your Honor."
2000.99-1687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,685.665,700.783,"Well, would there be a difference on an as applied challenge if the person you're talking about is the person who made the wrongful tapping as opposed to the person who just passes it on?"
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,700.783,714.994,"--Well, certainly, the question in this case is properly presented as to whether the statute can apply to those who are not involved in the interception."
2000.99-1687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,714.994,725.23,Well would it matter if it's a newspaper at the end of the day commenting on the information that's been disclosed?
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,727.06,730.043,We submit that it does not for two reasons.
2000.99-1687,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,768.727,782.668,"Although this had to do with negotiations, did it not with a public school board in a a labor union context, you don't think that's sufficiently important to warrant newspaper discussion of it?"
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,782.668,785.83,--We don't deny that matters of public concern are involved.
2000.99-1687,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,830.41,838.517,"Well, the difference is in one case they're acting unlawfully and in the other case they have information that they just came across because someone else acted unlawfully and that'd be a big difference?"
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,838.517,857.267,"--I think in the final analysis, no, Your Honor, because as I understand Florida Star and this Court's jurisprudence, the question here is whether there are sufficient Government interests to justify a content neutral application of these laws in this manner."
2000.99-1687,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.913,922.141,"Mr. Collins, may I ask you if I understand your First Amendment boundaries theory correctly, that Pentagon Papers which was a prior restraint case, if Congress so provided, the Times or anybody else who published the materials could after the publication be held responsible in money damages."
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,922.141,928.874,"Possibly, Your Honor, but Pentagon Papers would be different not only for the reason you gave but because it's arguably content based."
2000.99-1687,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,932.878,934.047,A general statute.
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,934.047,941.824,--Well if it applied to... but it wouldn't be general because it's by definition talking only about Government information which is arguably a content base.
2000.99-1687,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,941.824,942.034,Yes.
2000.99-1687,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,942.034,946.386,And it runs... there you do get into of the risk of shaping debate.
2000.99-1687,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,946.386,947.578,"Thank you, Mr. Collins."
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,949.43,956.065,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2000.99-1687,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,962.799,965.53,So you don't want anymore.
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,966.041,972.076,--I would welcome any and all questions as always.
2000.99-1687,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1033.195,1051.108,"General, isn't the problem with the easy analogy to the other intermediate scrutiny cases that here there in effect is a complete suppression of speech, whereas in the paradigmatic intermediate scrutiny cases, somebody can speak somewhere, sometime."
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1061.205,1069.41,"--Well, I think that is so here, and I also think that that is not an accurate characterization of all the intermediate scrutiny cases."
2000.99-1687,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1078.637,1085.742,But you also and I think you're right there but you also had a very different kind of general statute in Cohen and Cowles--
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1085.742,1087.093,That's exactly right and that's--
2000.99-1687,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1087.093,1088.474,--In contract law and not speech law.
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1088.474,1088.764,--Right.
2000.99-1687,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.24,1140.919,"Well, it may be it, it may not be depending on other circumstances, but, I mean, there is no question that if we didn't have the neutrality that you emphasize this would be a much easier case."
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1174.371,1177.723,--That is absolutely true and that is why heightened scrutiny applies.
2000.99-1687,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1206.614,1212.849,"Yeah, yeah, but... to say that we've, as your colleague did, it's very rare to strike down statutes that are content neutral."
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1231.089,1237.574,"--Justice Kennedy, I'm not suggesting that we win because intermediate level scrutiny applies."
2000.99-1687,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1353.72,1367.669,"My problem is that in order to make this... no one questions, we can assume that, that you can punish the interceptor, but what you're doing is you're taking a class of speech and saying this is now tainted speech and it can't be repeated by anybody."
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1371.492,1382.689,"--Well, I don't think... I do understand your point Justice Kennedy, I would quarrel with your characterization of this as tainted speech that you can't do anything about."
2000.99-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.394,1433.222,May I ask you a question?
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1433.222,1434.034,--and employees may or may not say.
2000.99-1687,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.034,1449.153,"Mr. Solicitor General, the strongest argument that I think Judge Pollack made in his dissent is that you want to dry up the market for this sort of thing so you get... just sort of like child pornography and the majority said, well, there's really no evidence that this will accomplish that goal."
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1473.352,1540.435,"Well, I think that that's wrong; that is the scarcity of cases shows it because if you look at the cases, for example, that are reprinted in the appendix to our reply brief and in respondent Vopper's brief, a very large number of those cases involved use... at least if you take out the marital cases... involved use by third persons, and the deterrence or disincentive point which is one of the three points that we make support the importance of the use and disclosure provisions as a means of protecting conversational privacy, I think, depends just by the way just as the statute's exclusionary rule in 2515 does, it depends on the... the common sense point that if you prohibit all means of exploiting stolen information, whether they are expressive means or not, you will lessen the incentive materially for many people to engage in the interception."
2000.99-1687,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1549.502,1555.696,"General Waxman, what about the situation, this is broadcast over a radio station in Wilkes Barre, as I understand it."
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1565.774,1581.514,"--Well, we think, as we indicate in our brief that both the meaning of the word disclose which is in the statute and the legislative history demonstrates that the statute no longer applies once it is public information or common knowledge."
2000.99-1687,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1594.462,1595.093,I can't tell my next door neighbor?
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1595.093,1595.884,--Excuse me?
2000.99-1687,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1595.884,1605.491,"If I innocently hear this tape, and I'm the second one to hear it, but I just hear it at Yocum's house, then I can't tell my neighbor?"
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1605.491,1608.413,That's the... the statute precludes that use of it.
2000.99-1687,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.608,1614.417,I wouldn't think of doing--
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1614.417,1614.788,"--Now, if there was--"
2000.99-1687,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1614.788,1623.622,"--I wouldn't think of doing that, of course, if somebody sent me a tape that I knew had been illegally taken, I certainly wouldn't run around talking to people about it."
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1625.325,1628.716,"--Well I... there has never been a case, a reported case which is--"
2000.99-1687,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1628.716,1630.458,"And Justice Kennedy lives in my neighborhood, too."
2000.99-1687,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1630.458,1643.508,"--There has never been a reported case in which there was either a prosecution or a civil suit brought here, and of course the plaintiffs in this case did not sue the school board members that were told about it."
2000.99-1687,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.091,1667.602,You may.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1669.074,1673.867,"Mr. Levine, Your Honor."
2000.99-1687,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1673.867,1681.263,"Mr. Levine, I'm sorry."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1681.263,1683.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1687,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.574,1720.932,"Well, I think... I think that the other side would have acknowledged that if it was indeed it was a clear threat to blow off somebody's porches there might have been an exception to the statute."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1746.429,1746.919,So long as--
2000.99-1687,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.919,1747.21,Okay.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1749.351,1750.683,"--Your Honor, I--"
2000.99-1687,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1750.683,1758.958,"Well, I think your argument is that blowing off... the willingness to blow off porches is a matter of some public concern in viewing the labor crisis."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1758.958,1768.774,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and that is why I gave the context to explain why this speech that was disseminated by the respondents here was truthful and involved a matter of public concern."
2000.99-1687,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1768.774,1774.588,"Now, I don't understand there to be any exception in the statute for speech that threatens to blow off somebody's porch."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1774.588,1776.13,That is correct Justice Stevens.
2000.99-1687,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.959,1798.126,And you would be content for a holding that says that a statute that does not contain such an exception is unconstitutional; is that what you're asking us for?
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1798.126,1802.427,I'm asking Your Honors to apply the principle.
2000.99-1687,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.427,1809.553,You want us to decide this case on the basis that this statute does not have any exception for threatened criminal action?
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1809.553,1810.762,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-1687,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.762,1811.693,I didn't think so.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1811.693,1819.641,"The except... what it doesn't have an exception for, Your Honor, is the dissemination of truthful speech about a matter of public concern."
2000.99-1687,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.641,1825.414,"You really don't care whether you win or not, you just want to win on the right grounds, is that what you want?"
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1825.414,1830.117,"Your Honor, I'll take it any way I can get it."
2000.99-1687,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1830.117,1830.597,I'm sure.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1834.0,1843.436,But the principle that we're advocating because it derives from this Court's case law is the Daily Mail principle.
2000.99-1687,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.136,1870.033,Why isn't my ability to speak over the phone with some assurance of confidentiality an interest of the highest order.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1898.702,1899.062,Cordless.
2000.99-1687,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.062,1904.537,"--whenever I talk to anything involving the court, because, you know, I don't know, I don't know who is picking it up."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1917.545,1920.577,"Your Honor, let me make clear it is not perfectly okay to pick it up."
2000.99-1687,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.069,1932.616,"No, it is perfectly okay to give the person who picked it up exactly what that person wanted, that is, dissemination of my private conversations."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1938.52,1948.257,"And Your Honor, if there was any act of collaboration between the criminal and the fence, as has been called in some amicus briefs, then that person may be held liable for his own conduct."
2000.99-1687,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.257,1955.061,There is no collaboration but this is an essential instrument for the criminal's achieving what he wanted to achieve.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,1987.333,2001.501,"Justice Scalia, I'm not suggesting that it's not unreasonable, but that's not the standard when you're talking about prohibition on the dissemination of truthful speech about a matter of public concern."
2000.99-1687,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2001.501,2006.746,"--Well, Mr. Levine, you agree that there is an exception for matters of the highest priority."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2019.994,2029.481,"Your Honor, Hill versus Colorado was a time, place or manner restriction, and the court, because of that properly analyzed the case under intermediate scrutiny."
2000.99-1687,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2043.89,2049.493,"Well, it may nonetheless deserve intermediate scrutiny because of its content neutrality."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2049.493,2057.059,"--Your Honor, I don't believe that content neutrality is a factor when you're talking about application of the Daily Mail principle."
2000.99-1687,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2057.059,2060.09,Do you lose if intermediate scrutiny is applied?
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2060.09,2061.302,"No, your Honor, we do not."
2000.99-1687,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.355,2115.779,"Well, something like that happened here, didn't it?"
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2119.179,2126.344,"--But Your Honor, there is no evidence that the identity of the interceptor in this case could not have been uncovered."
2000.99-1687,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2126.344,2136.772,"Well, I presume that the Government ought to have some presumption."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2147.458,2151.933,"Your Honor, that is, with all due respect to the Government, purely conjecture."
2000.99-1687,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2166.532,2171.494,"Well, shouldn't the Government at least have a chance to... I mean, the Government here was cut off."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2191.489,2206.548,"Your Honor, in light of the ample evidence that is contained in the record and available to the Court, that at least when you're talking about matters of public concern as you are here, where money doesn't drive the market to the interception, that that is not the case."
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2247.735,2269.338,"In... in... suppose that a stranger goes into your house, trespassing, puts his ear to the bedroom door and hears your private conversation or goes in and steals your diary and turns it over to a newspaper, knowing all this publishes it, is it constitutional not to forbid the publication, but to collect damages from the newspaper?"
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2269.338,2274.493,"Your Honor, if the information did not involve a matter of public concern--"
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.493,2274.773,No.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2274.934,2277.465,--If it involves a matter of public concern--
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.465,2277.666,Yes.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2277.666,2282.427,--and there is no unlawful conduct of any kind by the person who publishes the information--
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.427,2282.668,All right.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2303.031,2304.763,"--Your Honor, I think I misunderstood your question."
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2308.176,2309.576,Is not a... is not a reporter.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2309.576,2309.937,--Right.
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2309.937,2312.758,It's just someone... it's a stranger.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2312.758,2315.001,That person can be prosecuted.
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.001,2321.534,"No, I'm asking if you can get damages from the newspaper and I think your answer straightforwardly is no."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2321.534,2322.555,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.555,2324.946,Then I don't see how you're going to have privacy left.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2335.184,2335.574,Your Honor--
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2335.574,2339.305,"It goes with trade secrets, copyrighted books and your most private information."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2339.305,2342.307,"--Your Honor, you can go after the person who intercepted."
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.307,2344.358,"Yeah, but we don't know who that person is, you know."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2366.613,2367.444,Justice Breyer--
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2367.444,2369.114,If I disagree with that you lose--
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2369.114,2374.83,"--Justice Breyer, if I understand your latest iteration of the hypothetical, you included a payment in there."
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2378.791,2378.992,--No.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2379.773,2391.029,"Your Honors, in the last analysis, this statute simply prohibits too much speech."
2000.99-1687,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2397.045,2402.88,Are you permitted to raise an overbreadth challenge in this posture of the case?
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2402.88,2414.934,"The answer is yes, Justice Kennedy, because if an intermediate scrutiny does apply, one of the prongs of the intermediate scrutiny test is that the statute at issue must not prohibit more speech than is necessary."
2000.99-1687,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.942,2436.951,"If the rationale of the statute is to dry up the market, it doesn't prohibit too much speech, it prohibits precisely the amount of speech that is the product of what the statute is aimed at."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2436.951,2444.677,"--But if you focus on the speech itself, Justice Stevens, and it is truthful and it involves a matter of public concern, that speech has value."
2000.99-1687,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.237,2447.278,"No, but you're arguing about the quantity."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2456.482,2467.491,"Not when... not when the Congress was focused on other kinds of interceptions and disclosures involving things like industrial espionage, insider trading, contested divorce."
2000.99-1687,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.59,2480.801,"No, the problem is illegal intercepts."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2500.575,2503.587,I think it's fairest to say that I'm talking about quantity and quality.
2000.99-1687,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2517.946,2519.215,"Well, given that, then why is it worse?"
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2530.334,2538.1,"I see your point and this may be a fine distinction in response, but I think it's an important one, Justice Breyer, the physical diary is property."
2000.99-1687,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2562.435,2572.993,"I guess the case points up that chattel analogies are difficult in a modern age of digitized speech, et cetera."
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2576.165,2577.515,That's right.
2000.99-1687,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2577.515,2581.499,And what the Government is trying to do is to recognize that in this statute.
2000.99-1687,2,34750,lee_levine,,2581.499,2582.31,That's correct.
2000.99-1687,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2582.31,2584.13,"Thank you, Mr. Levine."
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2586.043,2597.17,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2635.264,2642.811,"Well, what you then presumably have other ideas as to how the Government might get at this problem, less drastic, perhaps?"
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2643.301,2668.857,"Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the solution adopted by the Third Circuit, the narrow approach it took is the one that is appropriate under intermediate scrutiny and that is it left in place by and large the redisclosure prohibition but recognized that when the final disclosure is on a question of public significance, and is by a person completely uninvolved in the illegal interception, then the speech rights outweigh."
2000.99-1687,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2694.433,2694.964,So is it a fact--
2000.99-1687,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.964,2699.147,--The newspaper's not going to publish it unless it has public interest?
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2718.311,2719.753,It is a matter of public interest.
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.323,2730.339,"Well, now what's the difference if we... do our cases articulate any difference between public significance and public interest."
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2730.339,2731.06,--The Court has--
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.06,2732.86,Can you answer the question yes or no?
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2732.86,2737.124,"--No, because it hasn't been presented, Mr. Chief Justice and I would--"
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2737.124,2738.464,And you're presenting it now.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2738.464,2739.906,--Yes.
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2841.114,2841.864,"Well, it's no longer--"
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2852.18,2854.473,That argument is not inconsistent with what I have just said.
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2855.713,2856.184,I hope you will.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2856.184,2869.294,"The radio station here played the tape in this area of northeastern Pennsylvania, Mr. Chief Justice, the New York Times comes along and listens and says oh, my goodness, look what happened here."
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.278,2883.392,Is that expressed in the Government's brief or is this just something that you're adding to the Government's brief?
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2883.392,2890.918,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm in the difficult position that this argument is made in one sentence in the Government's reply brief and so this is my understanding."
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2890.918,2903.234,"Well, so your feeling is that if it's just disclosed in northeastern Pennsylvania, then someone who discloses it perhaps in northwestern Pennsylvania is disclosing it anew?"
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2903.234,2904.386,Exactly.
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2905.996,2906.467,It sure does.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2906.467,2917.516,--And I... I agree with you that it's ridiculous but it is what the statute says and it's completely consonant with what Congress was apparently attempting to do here.
2000.99-1687,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2926.001,2928.802,You don't have to read statutes unreasonably.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2938.312,2950.36,The plain text of the statute uses a much broader term than is suggested by the Solicitor General and let me continue with the other four problems with tailoring.
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3053.597,3059.382,Well wouldn't a reporter or a news station ordinarily want to check out a story?
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3063.927,3069.169,"--Mr. Chief Justice, if that's the case then I don't think that we have a problem."
2000.99-1687,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.722,3104.512,"Well, I don't understand that."
2000.99-1687,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3104.512,3104.933,That might be quite difficult.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3151.796,3156.51,Let me begin by stepping back to the variant on that question that you asked my colleague.
2000.99-1687,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3216.177,3217.689,He knows it was illegally obtained.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3226.114,3231.418,It was an obviously... it was obviously recorded and very likely recorded by someone who wasn't a party to it.
2000.99-1687,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3231.418,3231.638,Okay.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3232.99,3239.085,Because he is not engaged in anything that anyone believes is wrong.
2000.99-1687,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3252.174,3258.047,"But isn't it the case that by the time the publication which is the subject of this action occurred, the threat was over?"
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3262.428,3264.931,"--With respect, that is not correct, particularly as to my client."
2000.99-1687,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3274.416,3278.34,--Why didn't he just notify the people who were the subjects of the threat?
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3278.34,3278.781,He did.
2000.99-1687,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3278.781,3287.366,Once it goes to the radio station you're not talking about an exception for people who are performing the public service of warning victims.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3287.366,3292.231,I think that there is something to be said of warning the public.
2000.99-1687,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3292.592,3300.795,"Well, the public's porches weren't going to be blown off, the school committee's porches were going to be blown off, and they were notified."
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3307.351,3310.062,"--When he gave it to the radio station, yes, we were."
2000.99-1687,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3310.062,3324.492,"And at the same time, he was making it known, I forget how, but he was making it known to the victims so that the radio station was not necessary to make it known to the victims and the people who learn through the radio station weren't potential victims."
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3325.443,3326.234,That is correct.
2000.99-1687,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3357.035,3363.259,But who knows that someone upon whom he is depending acted illegally.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3363.259,3365.23,Has reason to know.
2000.99-1687,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3365.23,3368.152,Has reason to know and certainly there is reason to know here.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3368.152,3369.912,That's correct.
2000.99-1687,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3369.912,3376.417,"All right, and... and Congress certainly did intend to stop that, it seems to me, contrary to what you said."
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3393.029,3397.401,"Justice Souter, if I said this wasn't what Congress was trying to do, I misspoke."
2000.99-1687,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3397.401,3398.713,I thought you did say that.
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3398.713,3401.023,We agreed that that was Congress' goal.
2000.99-1687,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3411.372,3416.324,"Then they should have time to do it under the procedure as it has gone so far, they haven't."
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3416.995,3431.425,"--Justice Ginsburg, they had the opportunity to develop a record in this case and the other two cases that have come before you, that are the Peavey case and the Baynor case have gone through the courts and no one has suggested that they are going to develop any kind of record."
2000.99-1687,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3431.425,3434.436,"--Then, but tell me if I'm wrong."
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3448.865,3454.871,They did not attempt in this case to put forward any record regarding the efficacy of the statute.
2000.99-1687,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3454.871,3467.038,"If they knew they were required to do something beyond the intuitive judgment that people make that of course nobody is going to do this if nobody is going to touch it, if it's going to be treated like a hot potato."
2000.99-1687,3,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3467.038,3471.162,"I think maybe you and I, Justice Ginsburg, are speaking about two slightly different things."
2000.99-1687,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3492.025,3492.505,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
2000.99-1687,4,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3497.248,3498.66,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-1687,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3681.255,3682.377,"Thank you, General Waxman."
