1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,33.89,38.75,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,495.668,498.779,What is the relevance of this to the issues in this case?
1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,498.779,499.637,What?
1968.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,499.637,502.824,What is the relevance of these figures about students to the issues in this case?
1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,502.824,516.102,The relevance Mr. Justice is to show the slowness of the progress which had occurred over four years and the background for the order of the judge which is under review here.
1968.798,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,516.102,518.278,Which has only to do with faculty as I understand it?
1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,518.278,525.072,The -- I'm turning now to faculty which is the issue here.
1968.798,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,536.426,554.705,"Before you get there Mr. Solicitor General, could you tell me whether the distribution of Negro population is pretty general throughout the area covered by the school system or whether it is more or less separated?"
1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,554.705,555.616,"No, Mr. Justice."
1968.798,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,555.674,556.38,Or concentrated in the --
1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,556.38,557.479,I cannot.
1968.798,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,567.859,571.256,Thank you.
1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,571.256,578.34,"The complaint in this case, as I have said, was filed on May 11, 1964."
1968.798,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1695.851,1706.685,"Well, it's also the requirement of approximately five to one vote for the first school year and I suppose the Court of Appeals prove that, didn't it?"
1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1706.685,1712.703,The Court of Appeals in the District Court's order was that it be five to one.
1968.798,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1712.703,1713.669,I understand.
1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1713.669,1717.119,The Court of Appeals put in substantially or approximately five.
1968.798,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1717.119,1725.791,"And that would require some shifting, some major shifting, would it not, in the faculty and the school?"
1968.798,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1725.791,1726.018,Oh!
1968.798,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2135.914,2140.226,Mr. Greenberg.
1968.798,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2140.226,2143.609,May it please the Court.
1968.798,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2247.488,2251.015,"As to what date were those record, do you recall, Mr. Greenberg?"
1968.798,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2251.015,2255.008,It was roughly contemporaneous with the opinion below.
1968.798,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2256.331,2256.96,1966.
1968.798,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2834.508,2837.799,Mr. Phelps.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,2837.799,2841.372,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2901.115,2902.841,Has that been done?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,2902.841,2913.117,"It's in the process now, Your Honor of being done and we are making we believe sir extensive numerical progress is where this qualitative process."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2913.117,2928.952,"What is the -- what is the effect of that policy of the state government that Mr. Greenberg just read a moment ago, if the policy of the state government being against doing this very thing?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,2928.952,2941.048,"Well, if the Court please Mr. Chief Justice, the data he read was in 1966 in the Macon County, Lee versus Macon County, a case about three years ago."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2951.638,2952.692,Has there been a change?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,2952.692,2953.11,"Yes, sir."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2953.11,2956.21,Has there been a change in the state policy?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,2956.21,2956.665,"Yes, sir."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2958.077,2960.085,Has it been announced?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,2960.085,2964.11,I would say very definitely and I can give the Court some examples.
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2964.11,2967.298,I'd like to hear you tell us how it's been announced.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,2967.298,2968.846,"Alright, so right now."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2968.846,2969.593,I beg your pardon?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,2969.593,3004.128,"Right today, or this week in the State of Alabama, the Alabama legislature's meeting on a called special session that was called by a new governor to consider an extensive program for education that was presented to the Alabama legislature by a biracial committee and here's the Alabama legislature meeting considering recommendations for education throughout the system that were presented to the governor and presented to the legislature by a fully desegregated or by a fully integrated committee."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3006.391,3016.124,But whereas the governor of the state announced in many way that it has changed its policy in this regard?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3016.124,3019.344,I believe that that is an announcement in and of itself.
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3022.418,3035.136,You mean a statement that it's going to consider education in Alabama as announcement and abandon all its segregation policies.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3035.136,3037.987,I think that Mr. Chief Justice is one example.
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3092.196,3104.288,"Well, I thought you said 15 years ago almost to the day that the climate wasn't to be considered."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3104.288,3105.751,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand it."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3105.751,3122.564,"I say, my recollection is that 15 years ago almost to the day that Brown versus Board of Education, you said that climate was not one of the things that should be considered in desegregation was to made."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3122.564,3136.035,"Well, sir, you ask me, I thought what changes the governor had made in the problem, I was attempting sir to point out I think the changes that have been made."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3200.697,3212.641,"Assuming all that to be true and it could be increased in the future, about when do you expect to get desegregation in Montgomery County, about when?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3212.641,3217.48,"Mr. Justice Marshall, we are working diligently at that now."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3238.767,3242.294,Will it be after these children have graduated?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3242.294,3244.504,I should hope not Mr. Justice Marshall.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3244.504,3248.485,Don't you think it will be later than that.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3248.485,3252.931,"I should hope not and I don't think that it will, no sir."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3253.511,3258.541,"Well, how long did it take you to reach this place since 1954?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3258.541,3259.309,True.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3274.32,3277.931,You didn't volunteer to that program that Judge Johnson put it on you?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3277.931,3278.919,That's correct sir.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3279.319,3282.377,"And if you were left alone, you wouldn't move it all the way."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3282.377,3289.363,We can't argue with the fact that we had to do desegregation in Montgomery County prior to that.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3298.917,3304.514,What if we change in time to do these petitioners any good?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3304.514,3316.66,"I believe that these petitioners Mr. Justice Marshall must (Inaudible) has probably already graduated from school so it couldn't -- it did in good, yes sir."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3324.827,3334.378,"Well, when you get these faculties desegregated before the present elementary school students graduated."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3334.378,3336.424,"Yes, sir."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3336.424,3338.055,On what basis?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3338.055,3345.268,On the basis of making assignments in the future years as we've done between 1967 and today.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3345.268,3351.178,Did you tell Judge Johnson that?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3354.744,3355.221,"No, sir."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3357.034,3360.665,You should ask Judge Johnson to change his order?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3360.665,3365.88,We asked Judge Johnson sir to stay his order pending appeal.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3365.88,3370.988,But did you asked him to modify and give you some more time?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3370.988,3379.935,"In essence, yes sir because he gave us some more time in fact in substitute teachers and that was -- it's not formally by a motion, no sir, but informal yes."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3379.935,3386.69,"Mr. Phelps, what I'm trying to say is you're -- if this Court asked you for more time and all."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3392.619,3397.181,We are asking this Court Mr. Justice Marshall for more than more time.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3411.752,3414.048,How long will that take?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3414.048,3420.739,"In answer to the Justice's prior question, it would accomplished before the children that the Justice mentioned --"
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3420.739,3429.422,"You mean before these children graduate, there will be no faculty in Montgomery County that will be racially identifiable."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3429.422,3430.814,"That's right, sir."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3430.814,3432.671,To what percentage?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3432.671,3441.7,"Well, in representing the Board, I have to talk to the educators on that question and I'm told that professional educator --"
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3441.7,3444.564,You're not talking to educators about race.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3444.564,3445.055,Sir?
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3445.055,3447.09,You're not talking to educators about race.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3452.924,3463.565,"Well, as far percentages are concerned, it's often difficult from what standpoint or quality education to answer that."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3524.611,3534.058,I assume -- I assume that the all of the white teachers and all of the Negro teachers of Montgomery County are equally qualified.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3534.058,3537.162,"Well, that's true Justice Marshall but --"
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3537.162,3540.288,"When talk about qualified now, I thought they won't qualify."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3540.288,3541.481,"Well, that's true."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3544.094,3548.42,Do you mean that some teachers are unqualified to teach children of another race?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3548.42,3556.848,"Well, high school science teacher Mr. Marshall -- Justice Marshall is certainly not qualified to teach an elementary child how to read."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3557.514,3565.199,I doubt that a science teacher teaching the junior high school isn't capable to teach in kindergarten.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3589.343,3590.645,Right.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3641.276,3646.611,-- Judge Johnson to all that it should be shifted from one level of education to the other.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3647.187,3649.085,I think that would be a --
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3649.085,3659.081,"He says if you got a hundred teachers in the seventh grade elementary school, you divide them up, period."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3661.901,3667.805,"Well, the government and the plaintiffs, if the Court please, have asked for a random redistribution."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3688.012,3692.432,I thought what anybody said except Judge Johnson.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3692.432,3693.071,Alright sir.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3693.071,3695.144,His words weren't.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3695.144,3696.759,"Well, let me say --"
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3696.759,3703.653,Why is that you shuffle your elementary teachers as between white and black schools?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3715.231,3716.552,"Right now for example, --"
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3716.552,3717.614,I beg your pardon.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3717.614,3723.765,"I'm saying, we've got different quotas or different actual percentages in our various schools."
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3751.936,3755.058,But why you have one part racial.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3758.819,3766.443,"Well, I think if the Court will look at the exhibit to our brief, we are meeting a one to five, approximately a substantial one to five."
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3804.317,3826.54,"Well, does the record show -- does the record show how many teachers there are in the various levels for example as the record show how many teachers there are in the elementary schools and the ratio of breakdown and in the junior high, in the ratio of breakdown and then in the high school."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3826.54,3834.892,"Mr. Justice Fortas, I believe we would have to be further in order for the record to show that someone would have to be familiar with the individual schools."
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3834.892,3838.056,"Well, does the record show that or it doesn't?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3839.531,3841.049,I don't believe sir that it doesn't.
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3841.049,3866.285,"Is it your point that in order to comply with Judge Johnson's decree, there would have to be some shifting of teachers as among the different levels, that is to say that some elementary teachers for example in the junior high and high school teachers or high school teachers in the elementary levels?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3867.772,3868.444,Yes sir.
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3874.558,3877.155,"Well, is there any proof of that in the record?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3893.415,3894.093,"Yes, sir."
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3913.151,3914.131,That's not what I meant.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3914.131,3914.68,Well no sir.
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3915.425,3917.579,Tell me about the printed record before us.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3917.579,3943.781,"I can't state to the Court that it's specifically in the printed record because we had no way of knowing that we are going to be faced with this racial requirement and it was not as I said a moment ago when neither the plaintiffs nor the government's motion for further relief and the first time, we were faced with a racial ratio was in the suggested order as prepared by the government."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3943.781,3970.371,"Well, if teacher Jones, a white person, is teaching first year history in the high school, a white high school, and teacher Smith, a black person is teaching the same subject in the first year class in a black school, why couldn't -- why could you just change those two teachers?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,3970.371,3986.037,"If it was just those two Mr. Justice Warren involved here but if you got a racial requirement that you're having to meet, you got to have 60-40 in your black school, 60% white and 40% black."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4000.224,4012.797,But as I -- I thought that Judge Johnson held that you need not do that school by school.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4017.285,4018.1,"No, sir."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4018.1,4020.379,It has to be done by every school?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4020.379,4028.131,Yes sir and that's something that the government and the plaintiff stated differently in their petition for certiorari than it did in their briefs on the merits.
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4048.48,4062.164,Would you be satisfied with his decree if it provided for doing it on the basis of your overall school population as distinguished from each individual school?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4062.164,4070.735,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that composed from mathematical ratios are certainly an innovation in public education."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4100.224,4103.919,You have just 15 years --
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4103.919,4109.761,"Well, I think and I will get to the progress that we made in fact of the desegregation if the Court please."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4120.084,4127.822,Would you take the position that you are not supposed to do anything until you have a court order compelling you to do it?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4127.822,4128.508,"No, sir."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4128.508,4131.06,Then why do you start with 1964?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4133.091,4134.294,Alright.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4152.903,4161.281,"Those weren't very meaningful figures that set a time, where teachers are teaching by the color of the student."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4170.912,4172.372,I think that Mr. Justice is right.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4190.837,4203.832,Is there anything in this record that would indicate what the distribution in the various grades is of white and Negro teachers?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4216.207,4217.365,I don't believe so.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4217.919,4229.928,Is there anything that indicates the distribution is substantially different to three to two as between the first grade and the twelfth grade for example or between the ninth grade and the sixth grade?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4229.928,4234.071,"Mr. Justice White, I can't say it specifically --"
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4234.071,4236.308,"Well, unless you can."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4258.241,4258.858,Well --
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4258.858,4280.603,"I can see that if all -- if it just so happened that all the teachers in high schools and all the high schools were white and all the teachers of all the grade schools were Negro, then a requirement is really two in each school would obviously require some shifting between high school and grade school."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4292.658,4293.506,Not Mr. Justice White --
1968.798,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4293.506,4316.184,"I think your appendix Mr. Phelps on page 36 of your brief, I think that would furnish the ingredients of the information in which Mr. Justice Fortas have manifested in interest if we knew which of those schools were high schools and which are elementary schools."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4325.151,4327.029,"Well, this is an --"
1968.798,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4327.029,4330.407,Others are identified as high schools or elementary schools.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4330.407,4350.82,If -- this is an example of an area that the District Court had no opportunity to get into because neither the plaintiffs nor the government asked for a racial ratio ahead of this hearing and we had no opportunity to present these factors to the Court.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4350.82,4362.649,"Well, I know but your objection, one of you objections here, I agree that's only one of them is that it may require shifting teachers into jobs for which they are not qualified."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4362.649,4364.156,That's right sir.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4364.156,4376.636,"But -- and if that would, I would suppose that in that objection, wasn't obvious in the District Court when this provision supposes it is there."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4381.835,4389.824,"We had no idea that a ratio, a faculty ratio quota was going to come out of this."
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4389.824,4394.649,"Well, do you had a -- did you file for a petition for rehearing in the District Court?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4394.649,4400.785,"As I see it in answer to Mr. Justice Marshall's question, we did not formally, no sir."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4405.649,4409.406,Filed a petition to stay after you filed an appeal.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4409.406,4410.395,Yes sir.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4410.959,4415.942,So you made no effort to bring any of this before Judge Johnson?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4415.942,4418.808,"Of course, this is an example --"
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4418.808,4421.536,Didn't Judge Johnson modify his order for some respect?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4421.536,4422.748,Yes.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4422.748,4424.209,At your request?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4424.209,4429.241,After we had an informal discussion and pointed out the problems that was --
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4429.241,4431.295,Did you point out this particular problem?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4431.295,4432.985,"Well, we didn't pointed out in the --"
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4432.985,4434.152,"Well, you wouldn't have to."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4434.152,4437.449,In detail that we're pointing it out to this Court.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4445.732,4458.6,"Well, I take it if Judge Johnson, I don't see anything in here to indicate that he would expect you to reassign high school students, high school or grade school teachers to high school."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4458.6,4460.576,"Well, if we think that's a --"
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4460.576,4472.594,"Suppose the order on its face requires that, I would firstly be surprised in such a place I gather if you could stick to that."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4472.594,4481.478,We think that mathematical ratios are dangerous in public education and that is one of the examples.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4601.243,4606.954,"What if they integrated all of the students of all of the schools, they wouldn't have any of the problems?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4606.954,4611.888,"No, sir and that's hopefully what all of the schools are headed for."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4614.476,4619.313,"1954 to date, it made 6% progress."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4619.313,4624.351,"Well, we feel that it is more than that on the current statistics."
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4657.967,4662.499,(Inaudible)
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4662.499,4663.539,"No, sir."
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4664.266,4670.581,(Inaudible)
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4670.581,4679.356,Yes sir and the Fifth Circuit made that clear that the majority opinion emphatically said that you had to compulsory assign but we say alright.
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4699.242,4711.806,Why should there be any difference between a high school history teacher in a black school and a white school so far as qualifications are concerned?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4711.806,4725.422,I don't think there is but I think when you have to assign a teacher on the basis of meeting a quota instead of assigning a teacher on the basis of qualification and after careful consideration of what she was teaching.
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4784.875,4801.724,"Well, are your black teachers and your white teachers respectively recruited from different universities in normal schools, teachers colleges and whatever they call these days?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4801.724,4803.792,Not as much narrow as it has been.
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4809.303,4813.027,"Well, you got a lot of people there who were recruited in the past, I assume."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4813.027,4814.183,"Yes sir, that's true."
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4814.183,4822.97,"And most of those were -- most of the blacks were recruited from segregated Negro teachers colleges, I suppose."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4822.97,4824.223,Yes.
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4824.223,4830.055,And most of the whites were recruited from segregated white colleges.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4830.055,4831.214,Yes.
1968.798,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4831.214,4842.516,"And would you say that the white colleges generally had better facilities, better staff and so on?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4842.516,4848.499,I think it would be Your Honor unrealistic not to say that would be true.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4848.499,4859.519,"Mr. Phelps, do you have the exact same books, regular subject matter, equipment in both schools?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4859.519,4861.943,"I would say substantially so, yes."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4861.943,4879.734,"Well, what's the problem with transferring the general science teacher in a predominantly white school to the general science teacher in the Negro school, since they have everything exactly the same?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4879.734,4882.292,"Alright sir, yes."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4888.358,4890.572,We have to start some place.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4890.572,4890.973,Alright sir.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4890.973,4895.745,"So I'm starting with the general science teacher, that's the one you like to talk about."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4908.899,4919.595,What about this sir if the a teacher at one school that it shows him to take physics and not (Inaudible) then the general science teacher would be in the position of teaching --
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4919.595,4928.731,"Well, in mind, I assume that in both schools, since they're all the same people, they all chose to take general science."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4930.947,4940.326,"As far as one teacher is concerned, there wouldn't be but if we got a three to two ratio overall and we've got to make it in the high school, elementary --"
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4940.326,4944.536,Where is there that much difference between these schools?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4944.536,4945.384,Well --
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4945.384,4950.853,You seem to always find a problem here like there's a difference in these schools.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4950.853,4971.28,"Well, I'll say this to the Court that mathematical ratios are inherently problematic in public education and I've tried to point out some of them and there are many, many more and I think Judge Skelly Wright in Hobson versus Hansen recognized it when after discussing Dowell and Kier and other cases cited."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4971.28,4974.324,Do you think that case is on here sir?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4974.324,4979.798,I think it is Mr. Justice Marshall in so far as --
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4979.798,4982.983,Are you sure (Inaudible)?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,4982.983,4987.043,"After discussing Dowell and Kier, Justice Wright said this."
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5001.981,5004.303,There is a problem.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5006.3,5006.925,Yes.
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5006.925,5009.53,Any school system is a problem.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5009.53,5010.197,I think that --
1968.798,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5010.197,5014.269,It tends to be you can solve every problem but race.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5014.269,5025.8,"Well, I think in the school system in Montgomery County, Alabama, we are striving to cope with the problem and to solve it and we state to the court that we will solve it."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5272.478,5276.011,Did you argue this way before in the lower courts?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5276.011,5280.48,"I did if the Court please, before the Court of Appeals but again, I didn't have an opportunity --"
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5280.48,5285.917,Did you or let me read from the Court of Appeals.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5361.474,5362.142,Yes sir and I argued --
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5362.142,5364.914,How is that consistent with what you're arguing now?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5364.914,5385.626,"I think it is in the context Mr. Justice of what we're arguing at the footnote on the record at page 757, the Court of Appeals says this, “Although appellants consistently argued a voluntary assignment of teachers and staff and contend that sound and quality school administration favored voluntary assignment, the following statement has found from the brief of appellant.”"
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5418.992,5425.326,You are not reaching up here to the (Inaudible).
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5425.326,5426.077,No sir.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5427.348,5429.651,Here you are talkinga about the (Inaudible)?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5429.651,5446.544,No sir and the Court of Appeals emphatically said that we must assign teachers and what we will continue to do though we'll continue to have them volunteer if we can do it inconsistently without mandate of complete faculty desegregation.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5518.076,5529.698,"May I ask you, you've got you say 212 teachers teaching in schools where their races are minority."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5530.685,5531.912,Yes.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5531.912,5546.7,"Now, I take it that you feel that those 212 are capable of teaching students of the opposite race."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5546.7,5553.278,They were placed if the Court please to the best of our ability in accord with quality criteria.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5553.278,5562.709,You just don't deny -- you just don't assert the court warrants that the teachers of one race can't teach students of another race?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5562.709,5564.03,"No sir, I certainly do not."
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5564.03,5573.08,Well the relationships are bound to be such between a student of one race and teacher for another that you can't have a decent educational --
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5573.08,5603.462,"No sir, as I say it to the Court, -- as I say it to Court early, I believe that if we are allowed to make these assignments based on individual quality, based on individual consideration, it wouldn't be long before that teacher is looked upon as not black or not white but it looked upon and respected as a professional educator and that might -- so I might say that's optimistic but I think it already happened in the black athlete that's going to the University of Alabama in a grant scholarship."
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5603.462,5611.248,Why do you object them to the District Court at least consisting that you tried on a three to two basis?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5611.248,5611.612,If the Court please --
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5611.612,5640.28,"How did you know that some of these -- you must be making a judgment that -- it's part of your judgment -- it's part of your objection to this decree that you are not permitted, not permitted to make a judgment that this particular black teacher in this particular teacher will be unsuccessful teaching students of the opposite race."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5641.316,5643.41,I would say that it's certainly that's part of it.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5645.854,5648.399,How can you tell that?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5648.399,5653.847,Because the judge as I said overall and I tried to point out specifics.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5672.236,5676.661,(Inaudible)
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5676.661,5678.765,"Well, I've tried --"
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5678.765,5684.071,(Inauidlbe)
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5707.145,5707.348,I'm not --
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5707.348,5713.358,Or you wanted that kind of “flexibility”?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5713.358,5719.357,I'm not sure I understand Mr. Justice White's question.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5728.156,5732.117,"Well, I know -- I'm asking about a specific aspect of that."
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5737.106,5737.944,"No, sir."
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5737.944,5746.965,You don't want to say -- you do want to be able to say that well this particular white teacher wouldn't be successful in teaching in that school.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5746.965,5750.745,In that particular white school or black school.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5750.745,5755.114,Or this particular black because of the racial situation.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5755.114,5762.296,I don't believe that the racial consideration is controlling.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5811.179,5814.091,Could I ask you this?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5835.107,5835.584,Yes.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5837.161,5838.853,Based right on that reason.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5838.853,5846.734,I would think so particularly in the summer of 1967 and not as much in the summer of 1968.
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5846.734,5857.65,"Well, have you been able to keep up your complement of teachers or have you been able to replace those teachers who are willing put up a compulsory assignment?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5857.65,5862.097,"Well, not as whether we would like to."
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5862.097,5863.933,"Well, yes but you've been able to get them?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5863.933,5880.384,"We've been able to get them to the standpoint that we will accomplish what we have here but if they wouldn't for resignations, if there wasn't for just saying I won't teach in your system, I'll go to Birmingham where there's not that much, so I'll go to Mountain Brook, Alabama where there's none."
1968.798,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5887.031,5892.097,Would you anticipate more of the spaces as a result of this decree?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5892.097,5894.191,"More resignations, yes."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5900.367,5924.521,"I thought I read some place in the record that you no longer have any problem of replacing teachers that used to be, that you'd have to have I don't know how many, 70 or something like that every year but that now, you don't have to do that because you have enough teachers that stay in the schools?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5924.521,5942.651,"I think now, Mr. Justice Warren, the record shows that there's probably a little less than 10% faculty turnover a year and that would be new ones coming in and I think the surge of students firing the old ones is not the problem that it was some years ago."
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5942.651,5963.284,"Mr. Phelps, in this question of assignment, do you reason from the premise that any teacher who is qualified to teach black students in this county is equally qualified to teach white students?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5963.284,5964.681,They're teaching the same thing.
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5965.485,5967.225,Teaching the same thing.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,5971.049,5973.906,I would say in answer to that yes.
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6374.391,6376.725,May I ask you.
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6386.061,6411.478,The particular objection Judge is that we have to have a ratio in faculty assignment and we say when teachers are assigned to meet a ratio instead of to meet quality education and instead to remedy identifiableness of the schools that you lose quality education for whites and blacks alike.
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6417.506,6420.558,I understood that's what you're moving toward?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6420.558,6421.365,"No, sir."
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6434.241,6436.081,How can you do that?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6436.081,6459.253,"We can do that Judge the same way that we've done in the last year by assigning blacks to white schools consistently with quality education and white students, blacks to whites and whites black, not to meet the quota but to remove the identifiableness of either a black or white school in so far as the children are concerned."
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6483.701,6494.878,"What school in the City of Montgomery do you have colored teachers teaching the most, white pupils?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6494.878,6498.236,Probably the Jefferson Davis High School.
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6498.236,6499.774,Where is it situated?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6499.774,6504.749,"It's situated on Carter Hill Road in Montgomery, Alabama."
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6504.749,6511.968,"What are their number there, the white pupils, students in that school and the number of colored teachers?"
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6511.968,6521.118,"Another school, Mr. Robinson just called my attention to was the Harrison School on the Southern (Inaudible) in Montgomery."
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6575.285,6578.241,Are you among the Board of Education or just an attorney?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6578.241,6580.525,I'm just an attorney sir.
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6598.448,6612.689,What has been your experience so far as you understood in having these white pupils under the colored teachers in those schools?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6612.689,6613.4,It's been favorable.
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6613.4,6614.259,Favorable?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6614.259,6640.919,"Yes, I think they tend to communicate well and I think a reason Justice Black that it has been favorable is that we made these assignments based on considerations of what the teacher had been teaching and what she was assigned to and she's qualified for what she's doing and those white children are going to look at that black teacher not as a black or white but as a good teacher and likely they will respect her as a good teacher."
1968.798,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6642.775,6645.879,You think you've moved that far in Montgomery?
1968.798,2,32333,joseph_d_phelps,,6645.879,6647.45,I do so.
1968.798,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6654.338,6658.067,"Mr. Solicitor, any response?"
1968.798,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,6658.067,6658.744,No response.
1968.798,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6658.744,6659.753,Very well.
