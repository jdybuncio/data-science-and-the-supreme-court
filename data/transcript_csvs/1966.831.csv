1966.831,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.299,"Number 831, Francis Eddie Specht, Petitioner, versus Wayne T. Patterson, Warden, et al."
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,35.407,39.108,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,174.889,177.336,I think I misunderstood then.
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,181.271,181.402,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.402,183.454,-- that were all some kind of sex offense that vary.
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,183.454,185.38,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.38,190.985,Then the trial judge has discretion.
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,191.081,191.225,What?
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,191.225,201.251,He can -- he could in this case and he can under the laws if we go ahead and sentence him to whatever sentence the law says shall be -- may be imposed for each one --
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,201.251,201.284,To this case?
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,201.284,202.459,-- for each specified offenses.
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,202.459,202.873,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,202.873,205.934,But if he'd -- and he has the discretion do that.
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,210.752,211.061,Yes.
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,224.458,224.473,Yes.
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,224.473,228.959,-- but that doesn't commit him to giving this sentence under this Act.
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.258,271.217,"So -- and then -- so this -- before he can sentence the man under this Act, he has to have that kind of a psychiatric report?"
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,271.217,271.578,Yes.
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.578,280.045,"But on the other hand, even after getting that kind of report, he can decide to sentence him under the original criminal statute, is that right?"
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,280.045,280.671,That's the way I read --
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.671,280.898,Or is the facts so clear --
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,280.898,281.801,"-- the Act, Your Honor."
1966.831,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,281.801,283.129,-- under the law?
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,283.129,293.401,I don't think that there's a Supreme Court case in Colorado saying that because I don't think there's a case that's exactly raised that.
1966.831,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,348.508,351.606,"But, let me see if I understand it."
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,361.81,363.166,That's correct.
1966.831,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,444.805,447.259,Are these separate statutes?
1966.831,0,36912,michael_a_williams,,447.259,451.158,"The criminal statute in this case, indecent liberties is -- yes."
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1473.716,1478.691,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.226,1587.739,"Excuse me Mr. Bush, what kind of the hearing do you have in Colorado when the person has not been convicted at the time that someone wants to put him in an institution."
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1591.656,1594.374,"Mr. Justice White, are you referring to the --"
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1594.374,1596.388,"Well, any kind of commitment proceeding."
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1596.388,1601.28,A civil commitment for insanity to the mental health statutes?
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.034,1629.57,But why shouldn't we look at this case as a -- just enough for the State to commit a person and wholly divorce it from the prior criminal conviction?
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1629.57,1635.228,"Well, Your Honor, I think we must make immediately the distinction."
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.974,1657.754,You're committing him for this particular reason because he is a danger to the community.
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1657.754,1669.28,"We are determining, Your Honor, the nature of the sentence based upon his past record and his behavioral characteristics which are the standard guides for determining sentence."
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.28,1673.897,You wouldn't commit him for this period or under these circumstances.
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1680.788,1682.147,"This is correct, Your Honor."
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.285,1699.892,"Would (Inaudible) proceed to find another fact and they based their commitment on other considerations before you may put him in the hands of -- of the -- well, before you could commit him for this purpose."
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1699.892,1702.116,"This is correct, Your Honor."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.072,1747.744,"Mr. Bush, General Bush, upon conviction of -- upon the charge here of -- what was it indecent liberties?"
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1747.744,1748.457,Indecent liberties.
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1750.544,1760.623,"The judge, absent this Colorado Sex Offender Sentencing Act, could have, in his discretion, sentence the petitioner to anything up to 10 years."
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1760.623,1761.917,"Yes, Your Honor, as --"
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1761.917,1766.482,Could he have under Colorado law impose an indeterminate sentence of one to ten years?
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1766.482,1771.586,"Your Honor, the sentence provided in the indecent liberty law is an indeterminate sentence."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1782.393,1784.094,"And that was in the sentence of the Court, correct?"
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1784.094,1784.72,This is correct.
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.72,1788.628,Rather than a fix term of five years for instance?
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1788.628,1789.133,Oh!
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1792.919,1797.89,"Well, but I'm familiar with that in Ohio and I'm asking you here."
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1805.865,1809.152,"Well, Your Honor, I can't say because it would have been discretionary decision."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1820.63,1824.866,"So, it could have been five years period?"
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1824.866,1826.024,"Yes, sir."
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.563,1836.529,It could have been a minimum of five and a minimum maximum of five and one day.
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1836.529,1839.403,"This is correct, Your Honor, any combination."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1839.403,1845.318,The sentencing judge is required to set a minimum and maximum within the one to ten years back spectrum.
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1845.355,1846.33,That's correct.
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1849.13,1850.567,Of the statutory spectrum?
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1850.567,1852.591,"This is correct, Your Honor."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1852.591,1863.213,"And the issues, of course, upon the -- and which were decided in the matter he's convicted was whether he did it and did he have any validly the defenses."
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1870.762,1874.318,"Well, but, Your Honor, let's go back if I may please."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1894.932,1899.19,Which the minimum of one day and a maximum of its natural life.
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1907.144,1908.089,That's correct.
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1908.089,1908.574,Wasn't it?
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1908.687,1909.576,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1909.576,1912.556,He couldn't have under the Sex Offenders Act said.
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1917.045,1917.813,Precisely.
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.813,1918.655,Am I right about that?
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1918.655,1921.606,Precisely.
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1921.606,1936.279,"And in order for us to sentence him at all under the Sex Offenders Act, he had to make additional factual findings that is additional to what was necessary to be found to support his guilt on the indecent liberties charge."
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1936.357,1937.439,This is correct.
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.535,1974.776,Does the Colorado Appellate Courts have found or advise sentences?
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,1974.776,1978.345,"They do not, Your Honor."
1966.831,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2014.483,2015.554,But if the Court --
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2015.554,2027.502,This I don't want to worry this no respondent that -- but if the Court does in its discretion decide to proceed under the Sex Offenders Act.
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,2036.089,2038.76,"This is incorrect, Your Honor."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2092.368,2099.431,"And if he does the latter, the third alternative, what may or must his sentence be?"
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,2099.431,2104.759,"His sentence must be one day, a minimum of one day and a maximum of one life."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.446,2109.04,But that's not my question.
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,2109.04,2109.259,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.831,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2109.259,2114.776,"If he does choose the third alternative, he has no discretion as to what sentence to impose?"
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,2114.776,2116.243,"This is correct, Your Honor."
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.522,2345.878,Do you know how widespread the sex psychopaths that you just mentioned?
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,2345.878,2354.76,"Your Honor, this volume which I did not cite, and I apologize for not citing, by the American Bar Foundation."
1966.831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.351,2383.288,Either it was sex psychopath law or your type of law.
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,2383.288,2383.991,Our type of law.
1966.831,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2383.991,2386.497,How many -- do you know how many have your type of law?
1966.831,1,28907,john_e_bush,,2386.497,2396.104,"In looking at the chart, it appears there are four Utah, Oregon, Colorado, and Pennsylvania."
1966.831,2,36912,michael_a_williams,,3637.629,3640.252,"May I respond to that, Your Honor?"
1966.831,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3787.938,3790.477,Would you leave that record with the Court?
1966.831,2,36912,michael_a_williams,,3790.477,3795.349,"Yes, Your Honor."
