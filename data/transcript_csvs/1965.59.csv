1965.59,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,10.887,15.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.59,1,28296,h_c_mike_watkins,,1475.707,1482.215,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Honorable Court."
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4363.728,4368.281,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.59,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4401.923,4405.573,When was it repealed?
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4405.573,4409.222,1894.
1965.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4409.222,4411.83,But it limits a little bit.
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4411.83,4412.155,They tried --
1965.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4412.155,4414.11,-- (Inaudible) in the -- in my hypothetical (Voice Overlap) --
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4414.11,4415.408,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1965.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4416.543,4418.605,(Inaudible)
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4418.605,4447.481,"The other question about the “aider and abettor” I think should point out that in 60, and each one of the substantive counts second, third and fourth, it is alleged that all 18, including the private individuals, “While acting under color of the laws of the State of Mississippi is alleged in each one of those counts.”"
1965.59,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4454.262,4469.519,"But what, Mr. Solicitor General, about Mr. Watkins' point that even if nothing more than this is required to invoke the aider and abettor statute, nevertheless as a matter of our jurisdiction, we can't say that."
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4473.752,4489.306,Well (Voice Overlap) -- we have set out in footnotes on page 9 and 33 of the Government's brief cases I thought was perfectly clear that you didn't have to allege specifically under the aid and abettor statute.
1965.59,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4489.306,4491.78,"Yes, I know but I don't -- I don't think that's his argument."
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4493.637,4494.13,"Well, I --"
1965.59,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4494.13,4515.654,"-- but his argument, as I understand Mr. Watkins, his argument is that whether or not the indictment was sufficient to embrace the aider and abettor statute, it's something we can't decide here because that's the question of interpretation of the indictment and therefore not an interpretation of construction of the statute."
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4519.202,4519.485,I --
1965.59,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4519.485,4520.035,-- on appeal.
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4520.035,4536.163,"And I understand his argument to be that when the District Judge says that since you don't allege that one of the men flash the badge, then the factual basis is lacking."
1965.59,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4549.809,4551.213,(Voice Overlap) -- statute
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4551.213,4555.46,That's a legal determination of -- and the construction of the statute.
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4616.966,4620.447,What effect does Cruikshank you have on this case?
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4620.447,4634.458,"I take position Mr. Justice Clark that Cruikshank went off on that one little point as I remember -- I mean, so far as I'm concerned, on the question about the race not being involved and that is always (Inaudible)."
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4655.637,4657.559,We wouldn't have to overrule the Cruikshank?
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4657.559,4658.569,No sir.
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4670.909,4675.702,"The written opinion in Williams, in the court opinion."
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4675.702,4677.578,It was a four to four.
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4677.578,4678.061,You mean --
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4678.061,4679.706,For intensive purposes.
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4679.706,4681.234,You mean Justice Douglas' opinion.
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4681.234,4683.127,Justice Douglas' opinion.
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4687.354,4692.616,What all you do is you linked Screws and Justice Douglas' opinion in Williams together?
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4692.616,4693.363,Yes sir.
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4693.363,4694.084,In your position?
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4694.084,4695.039,Yes sir.
1965.59,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4700.674,4702.686,But you have to put the two together.
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4706.137,4709.773,I think we have to put the two together.
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4737.639,4744.452,"Now Screws -- I mean, in Screws, was it under 242?"
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4744.452,4747.077,The Screws was on 241-- or 242.
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4752.591,4757.797,Do you see any difference -- did you file that same reason in 241?
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4757.797,4783.896,"Well, I think that when you take the two together, the reasoning that oppose 242 which was that you have to put some limitation on this in order for it to be constitutional, the limitation is that you must allege intent to deprive the victim of his rights guaranteed."
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4783.896,4784.843,Specifically?
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4784.843,4787.126,"Specifically, specifically."
1965.59,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4799.296,4805.396,"Now of course, you'd have to have a majority opinion in Williams."
1965.59,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4808.756,4811.886,"Yes sir, yes sir."
