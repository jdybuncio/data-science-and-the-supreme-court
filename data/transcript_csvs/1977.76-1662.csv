1977.76-1662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.884,"Mr. Days, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,8.884,11.784,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,207.58,222.391,"When the Attorney General responds to the Section 5, at the request from Mr. Drew(ph) , does he ordinarily, categorically affirm or disapprove or approve or does he --"
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,222.391,222.734,He doesn't.
1977.76-1662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,222.734,226.474,Or does he sometimes say there are just no objections.
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,226.474,244.599,"In some cases he says there are just no objections, in other cases request is made for additional information, in other cases, we indicate acting on behalf of the Attorney General that there is not adequate information upon which the Attorney General can exercise his responsibilities under the Voting Rights Act."
1977.76-1662,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.2,484.787,"You concede, I take it, Mr. Days that Sheffield, Alabama does not fall under that statutory definition of political subdivision."
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,484.787,489.796,"We do concede, it is not a political subdivision under the Act."
1977.76-1662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.251,697.512,"Is it clear, Mr. Days, form that colloque that the part of the Legislative History you are relying on that Congress focused on whether or not the particular subdivision conducted registration for voting."
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,697.512,711.537,It is not clear that Congress focused on that particular issue to determine whether the reach was going to be down below the County or Parish level but we think that the environment does indicate that Congress understood what the reach would be.
1977.76-1662,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.943,768.143,Mr. Days what do you -- what is a local subdivision which is not a political subdivision as defined by the Act.
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,781.781,782.231,Yes.
1977.76-1662,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.231,788.93,"Now, if it is neither one of those well why is it required to submit or how does it even get to the Attorney General?"
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,788.93,795.725,"Well, the interpretation that we urge upon the Court is that once a state is covered then all political units --"
1977.76-1662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,795.725,795.952,I know --
1977.76-1662,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.952,796.869,-- once covered --
1977.76-1662,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.869,809.532,"I know it could be that it is covered for the purposes of earlier -- because of Section 4, but it might not -- there might be a clearance procedure there going to court."
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,816.512,818.554,Well I think it says that --
1977.76-1662,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.554,822.529,"Well, you do not say the subdivision as a state do you?"
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,822.529,825.662,I do not but the interpretation --
1977.76-1662,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.662,834.931,"Well, what do you ? How does Section 5 apply to non-political subdivision, unless it is the state."
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,834.931,844.133,"Well, I think that the interpretation of the term state as reaching to all governmental units that are creatures of the state is how that should be interpreted."
1977.76-1662,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.991,856.561,"Well, for purposes of Section 5 then the political subdivision is just irrelevant I think."
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,856.561,857.858,If a state is --
1977.76-1662,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.858,859.729,If a state has been covered.
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,859.729,862.696,That is exactly a correct term.
1977.76-1662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,862.696,870.674,Then what meaning does language of political subdivision have then Mr. Days?
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,870.674,875.373,I think its meaning is tied to the triggering mechanism under 4(b)(2).
1977.76-1662,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.735,943.33,"I take it a political subdivision can be covered even of the state in which it exists, it is not."
1977.76-1662,0,20471,days,,943.33,946.618,That is correct.
1977.76-1662,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1123.908,1127.723,Very well Mr Days.
1977.76-1662,1,43645,vincent_mcalister,,1131.848,1137.354,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.76-1662,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.751,1395.138,"At the time you wrote to the Attorney General, you certainly must have thought that Sheffield was covered."
1977.76-1662,1,43645,vincent_mcalister,,1395.138,1397.682,"Well, the Mayor wrote that letter."
1977.76-1662,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1397.682,1399.34,"Well, he thought Sheffield --"
1977.76-1662,1,43645,vincent_mcalister,,1399.34,1403.709,"Well, he thought that possibly it was covered."
1977.76-1662,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1403.709,1406.316,Was there any doubt expressed in his communication?
1977.76-1662,1,43645,vincent_mcalister,,1406.316,1411.622,"In his communication, he expressed, he said, ?I don't think that we are covered."
1977.76-1662,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1449.394,1451.719,Now you are directing your argument now to the second issue.
1977.76-1662,1,43645,vincent_mcalister,,1451.719,1453.379,"Yes Sir, I am."
1977.76-1662,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1453.379,1455.282,"Which we do not reach, if you are right on the first issue."
1977.76-1662,1,43645,vincent_mcalister,,1455.282,1459.615,That is correct.
1977.76-1662,2,20471,days,,2153.407,2155.013,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1977.76-1662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2191.955,2207.42,"How about the second paragraph of that letter on Page 14, General Days, where it says, of the Appendix, it is doubtful that this proposition is to change the forms of Municipal government is covered by the 1965 Voting Rights Act."
1977.76-1662,2,20471,days,,2214.94,2229.813,"Well, I would concede that there is some intimation but I think that read more exactly, it refers to not whether the city itself is covered but whether this particular change is coveted under Section 5 and requires pre-clearance."
1977.76-1662,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2229.813,2231.92,That is what it says.
1977.76-1662,2,20471,days,,2231.92,2248.75,"Now, in so far as the force of Alabama law is concerned, once a referendum of this kind takes place, I submit that the record reflects that there was a great deal of confusion as to exactly how Alabama law would come in to play in this case."
1977.76-1662,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2359.296,2360.38,Thank you gentleman.
