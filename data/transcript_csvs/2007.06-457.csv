2007.06-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.544,"We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-457, Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Association."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,9.902,21.366,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress has left to the States and encouraged them to deal with the significant public health problem of youth access to tobacco."
2007.06-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,83.841,89.324,"Well, certainly that may be true, but it certainly relates to the service of a carrier."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,92.213,93.76,Exactly--
2007.06-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,93.76,100.726,"It talks about what carriers have to do, so... in connection with delivery, so it relates to the service of the motor carrier."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,100.726,107.941,"--Well, Your Honor, section 1555-C (3)(C) does not dictate at all what a carrier has to do."
2007.06-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,118.374,121.748,It doesn't dictate what they have to do.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,122.998,128.058,"--They can get out of the business or compete for the business, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,160.575,172.915,"Well, we also considered it in Morales, and I thought this law was enacted in the immediate wake of Morales, which adopted a much broader reading of ERISA cases."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,172.915,195.858,We don't agree that it adopted such a broad view because in Morales the Court was very careful in the opinion to make clear that it was not drawing a line which would bring potentially such laws dealing with gambling or prostitution within the preemptive ambit of the ADA.
2007.06-457,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,214.102,216.006,But isn't that answering the wrong question?
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,280.621,303.018,"Your Honor, looking at the objectives of Congress as explained by Congress in the legislative record, it's very clear that Congress was concerned, the committee was concerned with, the proponents such as the Federal Department of Transportation, were concerned with the effects of the particular category of regulation, State economic regulation."
2007.06-457,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,306.845,312.218,"That's because most regulation, you know, has an economic purpose involved."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,352.327,363.821,"--Well, Your Honor, we suggest that the Court looks at the FAA Act and its legislative history, as well as what immediately preceded it, which was the Synar Amendment."
2007.06-457,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,369.413,386.797,"But the Synar... I don't have it in front of me, but the Synar Amendment refers to... to a number of objects of State legislation that would be required, but it doesn't say anything about regulating transportation."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,386.797,404.508,--It states quite clearly that the intent is to encourage the States to prohibit... or to enforce/enact laws that prohibit retailers and distributors from getting tobacco to children.
2007.06-457,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,404.508,405.007,Right.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,435.23,443.304,"Well, a sale consists of several components, Your Honor: Order, payment, and delivery."
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.422,489.067,"Mr. Stern, at the time that the motor carrier deregulation came into effect, were there any products where Maine told the retailer, if you want to sell not face-to-face, you must choose a carrier that will provide X, Y, and Z services?"
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,494.518,527.614,"Interestingly, there... Maine being a hunting State, there was a law on the books which required the common carrier... it specifically referred to the common carrier... to verify that the person shipping it was the hunter with the appropriate license, required the common carrier to affix identification tags to the hunting... the hunting reward, so to speak, and also to make a return or provide notice to the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife."
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,537.361,548.778,"Does the Postal Service adhere to... or I don't know if the Postal Service is used to ship cigarettes, tobacco products."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,558.68,560.352,"Two points, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.581,573.206,Why does the Post Office have immunity from Maine laws?
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,573.861,575.595,I believe there--
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.595,577.141,You could kill people and all sorts of stuff.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,579.296,580.624,"--I hope not, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,591.729,603.052,"But it does... you say the Postal Service provides something that conforms, that they have the... you must deliver it to the person, to the addressee herself?"
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,603.052,605.021,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.785,648.503,But why aren't you just driving all this business to the Postal Service?
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,662.731,667.277,"There have been efforts to deal with the Postal Service loophole, Your Honor, and--"
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.277,668.401,You can't do it.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,672.962,675.648,"--I think I heard somebody mention that, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,713.226,726.424,But what if every... what if every State enacted a slightly different law relating to this and a slightly different law relating to every other product that they might want to restrict for health or safety reasons?
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,736.701,741.418,"Well, Your Honor, the Respondent's arguments do not guarantee uniform regulation."
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,775.343,776.31,I thought that wasn't clear from their brief.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,783.199,796.881,--I believe if one looks at... it's either page 24 or 44 of the brief... they concede that Maine and other States can ban the furnishing of tobacco.
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.881,797.756,"Well, they--"
2007.06-457,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,797.756,808.768,"They concede that they can do it beyond the requirement, beyond the force of the statute that precludes the knowing distribution."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,822.73,824.605,"I believe they do, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.274,847.204,"--Yes, but I think that the reason they make that concession is that they say you must prove knowledge, and they're... they're not concerned about the... about intentionally transgressing Maine's law."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,860.465,865.259,"Well, there is a knowledge requirement in the first part of section 1555-D."
2007.06-457,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,881.394,884.112,"Well, you prove it without a presumption to start with."
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.079,893.484,"And that's why they're not worried about it, because it's hard to prove."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,893.484,906.164,"Without the evidentiary assumption, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to prove, which essentially makes the first part of the court's decision with respect to 1555--"
2007.06-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,906.164,910.194,"The answer to that is it may be a very good idea, so convince Congress to pass a law."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,948.773,951.788,--A Commerce Clause problem?
2007.06-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.788,952.256,Yes.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,952.256,955.255,It depends upon how the statute is written.
2007.06-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,956.474,970.359,"Well, that's why I'm just not certain about bans that forbid people to ship things inside from outside the State, while allowing people to buy those things produced by people inside the State."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,973.138,977.512,--Well--
2007.06-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,977.512,980.04,"I mean, what is this New York law that does this?"
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,980.04,990.85,--The New York law banned the delivery and sale of tobacco... delivery and sales of cigarettes to B(2)--
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,990.85,992.786,But isn't that the result of a settlement?
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,992.786,1007.374,"--The... the law was... existed before the settlement, and the settlement which we have referred to is a situation where UPS and a number of other carriers have agreed to conform with it, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1007.374,1010.451,"And nationwide, not just in New York; isn't that so?"
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1010.451,1011.341,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.539,1027.287,"So, then, practically, you don't have a problem with cigarettes because the New York settlement takes care of it."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1029.678,1036.674,"--Well, there are other tobacco products, but in the New York settlement... we can't enforce the New York settlement, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1040.782,1050.326,"But I thought, as a result of the New York settlement, carriers are no longer shipping directly to consumers anyplace cigarettes."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1050.326,1053.638,"--That is the intent of that, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1064.96,1069.505,But the thing I'm concerned about is... is assume it's perfectly legal to do what you said.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1094.043,1097.698,That would seem to clearly run afoul of the--
2007.06-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1097.698,1097.948,All right.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1097.948,1098.604,--Commerce Clause.
2007.06-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.604,1098.885,All right.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1113.692,1115.441,I don't think--
2007.06-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1115.441,1116.285,No.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1116.753,1117.674,"--they necessarily could, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.674,1138.447,"If they cannot say either of those things because of the statute, why can they say: What you have to do is you have to ship it in a way that makes certain that the person who receives it, the addressee, is the person who bought it?"
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1138.447,1150.21,"The reason, Your Honor, is the difference between the hypothetical you proposed at the beginning of your question and what's going on in Maine with respect to 1555-C(3)(C), which is a mouthful."
2007.06-457,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.136,1221.726,"Mr. Stern, can I ask you this question: To what extent are we dealing with a tobacco problem or a broader problem?"
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1234.362,1241.046,--There are no... I'm not aware of any that we... we regulate in the same way.
2007.06-457,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.374,1247.981,"You allow shippers to ship firearms and poisonous substances without having this kind of restriction on it, do you?"
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1247.981,1252.386,--There are not exactly the same restrictions.
2007.06-457,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1276.126,1287.84,But I don't really see why the States have... have a different interest in regulating shipment of tobacco to minors than they would a variety of other substances that could be harmful to minors or contraband in general.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1290.683,1292.994,"Well, Your Honor, we do try to regulate those."
2007.06-457,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.571,1297.773,"By... by regulating how they may be shipped, I mean."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1297.773,1307.223,There is no law exactly like this one with respect to the other types of... of dangerous substances.
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1308.629,1321.748,"Mr. Stern, you told me in... in response to my question earlier, you mentioned only, I think, game; and you said that those prohibitions were directly on the carrier--"
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1321.748,1322.545,--That's correct.
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1322.545,1328.167,"--that is, prohibitions and instructions for how you can ship game."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1340.787,1349.659,"The Federal Government has a role with respect to the shipment of explosives, but it has no role with respect to the shipment of tobacco."
2007.06-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1349.659,1370.588,"But is there... in addition to the Federal regulation, which I take it would cover various dangerous substances, does Maine add to what the Federal regulation is, say, for sending fireworks, firearms?"
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1370.588,1391.033,"With respect to fireworks, Maine in its discretion has adopted the Federal role... the Federal view, which, I think, emphasizes and... and highlights the different situation we have here."
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.49,1419.818,"Well, maybe because Congress wanted the regulatory void."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1437.827,1442.838,"In their policies, they have indicated that they do not carry game, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.838,1443.495,It's too onerous.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1443.495,1443.995,Well--
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.995,1446.4,So you've sort of driven them out of the business.
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1446.4,1446.9,--No.
2007.06-457,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.101,1498.926,"Well, as long as the buyer is not an interstate carrier, there is really no... no problem of conflicting with Federal law."
2007.06-457,0,38367,paul_stern,,1498.926,1515.951,"--Well, there is no conflict with Federal law under our reading of the FAAA Act and the Synar Amendment because the... the intent of Congress has to be one which does not end up in an absurd result."
2007.06-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1527.274,1528.086,"Thank you, Mr. Stern."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1544.72,1554.512,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If Maine's tobacco delivery law is not preempted, Congress's core purpose for the FAAAA will be defeated."
2007.06-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1579.862,1596.621,"Before you do that, Ms. Brinkmann, would you tell us how alcohol is handled, because that is, as I understand it, that's by virtue of the 24th Amendment State regulation."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1602.057,1606.804,"Yes, alcohol is, of course, governed by a different legal regime because of the 21st Amendment."
2007.06-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1633.574,1651.067,"But I asked the question only in response to your impossibility argument that you couldn't cope with such State regulations with respect to tobacco, when it seems you are with respect to alcohol."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1651.067,1656.472,"I think it would be useful to give the quantification, I think, about the impact of these provisions."
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1677.261,1682.149,"Before you leave the alcohol point, I don't quite understand the relevance of the 21st Amendment."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1692.66,1697.784,--I think it involves much more complicated constitutional issues that reach the 21st Amendment.
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.812,1710.544,"Why isn't it still a State regulation of shipping, even if it's a law that's authorized by the 21st Amendment?"
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1711.528,1713.573,"--Well, it may be not be, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1752.34,1760.867,"What if a new carrier said, well, I'd like to get into the business of shipping tobacco products, none of the other companies want to do it, I want to form... I'll form my own company."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1764.99,1771.05,--If the State was dictating a service that made--
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1771.05,1775.736,"Well, they're saying the retailer must use a service that fulfills these qualifications."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1779.735,1782.608,--It would depend on the effect on the carriers.
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.124,1804.428,"I assume that the purpose of the Federal law was not to enable services which would not otherwise be provided at all, but rather to enable services to be provided more economically, to reduce the cost, the cost of interstate transportation."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1804.428,1805.928,"--Driven by market competition, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.739,1806.974,Sure.
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1811.363,1824.497,"--Your Honor, in this case the evidence demonstrates... in the court of appeals appendix there's the deposition by Ms. Meisel, which explains on pages 163 and 189 that it's not flipping a switch to create a new service like this."
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1842.522,1845.208,But that's the effect on UPS; is that not right?
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1845.208,1846.895,--On the carrier services.
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.895,1853.439,"Does that foreclose the possibility that somebody else might just specialize in delivering tobacco products, for example?"
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1853.439,1866.872,"Your Honor, if there were a requirement or Maine law, for example, for a widely already established adult signature requirement, that may have a different preemption analysis."
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.743,1873.415,Why wouldn't there would be a problem?

2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.753,1881.912,Do you think if Maine did it for all products it would be okay?
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1884.364,1885.036,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1885.036,1886.566,I didn't think so.
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1886.566,1892.314,That cost that I just described has to be multiplied for 50 States and many commodities.
2007.06-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1938.561,1942.403,How did they deal with under the New York settlement?
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1965.846,1975.374,"Under the New York settlement there's a very complex structure that the carriers have agreed to, first of all forbidding all delivery of cigarettes to consumers."
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1975.374,1977.092,Where does that appear in the materials?
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1978.561,1982.06,"There is a citation to it in the Petitioner's brief, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.06,1983.138,"But there's no text, though?"
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1983.138,1986.214,"It's available, I believe, on the attorney general of New York's web site."
2007.06-457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2019.466,2021.513,"Ms. Brinkmann, I'm interested in two things."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2063.137,2070.429,"--To your first question, just to complete it, Your Honor, at JA-96 there's an admission that it's a two-dollar cost to research a package."
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.864,2162.628,"Ms. Brinkmann, I'm fascinated by this New York settlement."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2184.806,2185.962,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.069,2192.209,"Well, I mean you're speaking about the New York settlement as though that's hunky-dory."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2192.209,2193.13,"--No, it isn't."
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.521,2203.704,"I'm not sure that if this... if this Federal act means what it says, that that kind of settlement isn't the kind of thing the act did not want to happen."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2203.704,2206.75,"--Well, it's a voluntary agreement in which--"
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.75,2208.219,Voluntary under threat of criminal penalty.
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2208.219,2213.606,--in which the carriers adopted a uniform approach.
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.606,2214.543,"Well, that's... that's nice."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2233.551,2243.423,"No, the assurances of discontinuance... specifically, I know that Federal Express and UPS have reserved the right and do not concede that the New York law is not preempted under FAAAA."
2007.06-457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2251.372,2253.2,"Just on the knowledge point, I'm still not sure."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2268.444,2270.491,"--I think, though, if I could--"
2007.06-457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2270.491,2274.331,"It's a little bit hard to write the opinion your way with that, with that concession."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2276.815,2282.017,"--I think if you understand what the First Circuit was saying, this is a total ban on knowing delivery."
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.058,2302.416,"No, but they are presumed to have read the label, the stamp on the label; isn't that correct?"
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2302.416,2307.085,"--You go to the end of the system, is where the knowledge would come into place."
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.663,2311.944,Would you answer my question?
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2319.049,2321.86,"--I wouldn't necessarily say a presumption, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.008,2350.366,"When they pick up the package, they don't look at the labels?"
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2350.366,2350.663,--and the driver.
2007.06-457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2377.964,2391.864,"Well, but the way... I'm telling you I assume the way it works is that the UPS truck goes out to the tobacco warehouse and picks up 4,000 boxes, all registered tobacco."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2394.004,2395.645,That's not my understanding.
2007.06-457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.972,2436.815,"May I ask you this question, which is where I'm having a little trouble on your side."
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2456.136,2456.589,Yes.
2007.06-457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.589,2463.805,"Can California say, anybody who ships lettuces into our State has to use refrigerated equipment?"
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2469.738,2473.206,"Your Honor, that would be for Congress, and it would have--"
2007.06-457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.206,2475.112,So you'd say that would also be preempted?
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2475.112,2477.814,--I think you have to look at the specific statute.
2007.06-457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2497.368,2502.07,Why is it that knowledge requirements have a different preemption analysis?
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2505.193,2538.43,"Because the way in which the First Circuit construed the first sentence is just to be a ban on knowing transportation delivery, and said it can't require... on pages 26 and 27, it says it different ways... that if a liability standard of a State is preempted, if, for example, it required modification of the delivery methods, other than declining the package; if in the normal course of the services that are already provided, if there is knowledge that is evidence--"
2007.06-457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2538.43,2540.46,Then that's clear preemption in Justice Breyer's example.
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2547.864,2551.816,--If there is no Federal regulatory... yes.
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.816,2554.392,That statute is definitely preemptive.
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2562.249,2565.185,There are many Federal regulations about the transportation--
2007.06-457,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.185,2567.326,Could the State do it beyond the Federal requirement?
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2567.326,2570.465,"--No, Your Honor, it would have to be uniform, and I think that's a great example."
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2591.549,2602.265,"Before you get into that, do we have to hold... assuming we agree with you... do we have to hold that the knowing requirement of the first sentence is okay?"
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2602.265,2603.077,"--No, I don't--"
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.077,2605.794,--even though the other provisions are not okay?
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2605.794,2606.669,--We did not--
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.669,2607.107,: Okay.
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2610.261,2611.729,--We do not cross-petition on that--
2007.06-457,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.729,2617.807,Fifty different States having a knowing requirement for a hundred different products... I don't know that that complies with the Federal law.
2007.06-457,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2617.807,2622.726,--What we are responding to is the cert petition from the State here.
2007.06-457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2751.205,2751.782,"Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann."
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2769.493,2795.047,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I think there's no question that the State of Maine could not require carriers to obtain a license to deliver tobacco products and condition that upon the carrier's service complying with the mandates of State law, that that would be a law that relates to the carrier's service."
2007.06-457,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2824.05,2825.441,You're talking about the Federal act or the Maine act?
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2825.441,2825.816,--The Federal act.
2007.06-457,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2945.159,2954.279,"If one of the big carriers decides for its own business purposes to offer a service that complied with the Maine law, would that have the effect of ""un-pre-empting"" the Maine law?"
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2954.279,2963.838,"Well, what Congress... what Congress had in mind in the Act was that carriers would respond to the marketplace, not State regulation."
2007.06-457,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3010.321,3011.212,Even if the law--
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3011.212,3011.321,"In fact, the Federal law--"
2007.06-457,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3011.321,3022.584,"--Even if they all now decided they wanted to go into this business, that would have no effect because they would have done that to comply with the Maine law rather than as... in response to the marketplace?"
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3022.584,3023.38,--That's right.
2007.06-457,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3035.702,3039.795,It seems to me rather odd that major carriers can determine the scope of pre-emption.
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3056.553,3079.513,"--I think with respect to this particular example about the adult signature required, the Court probably would need to go no farther than the fact that the Federal government has itself recognized the existence of that service and required it in a law that relates to the shipping of wine when one is prohibited by safety regulations from taking it on the airplane with them."
2007.06-457,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3085.136,3095.991,"Could I follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, though, and specifically, do you think the New York settlement, if the carriers did not agree to it, that they would nonetheless prevail because the terms of it are pre-emptive?"
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3095.991,3106.268,"I have not studied the New York statute sufficiently to speak to that, and I don't think the government has a position about that."
2007.06-457,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3130.354,3133.133,"Well, see, you are... you are pretty familiar with the New York settlement then."
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3133.415,3136.085,--I have some familiarity with it.
2007.06-457,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3136.085,3142.114,"Well, then I think you ought to be able to tell me whether you think it's pre-empted by the Federal law under your theory or not."
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3142.114,3158.638,"Well, I... Your Honor, we have not taken a position on whether the settlement is and, with respect... although I have familiarity with the settlement, I have less familiarity with the underlying New York statute that it was agreed to, in response to--"
2007.06-457,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3158.638,3161.981,"Well, you have familiarity with the knowing delivery requirement here."
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3161.981,3162.699,--Yes.
2007.06-457,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3162.699,3164.605,Is that pre-emptive under your view?
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3164.605,3187.218,"In our view, where, as construed by the First Circuit... and we sort of accept that view... the First Circuit, on page 26 of the Pet. App., construed the first sentence of D as requiring that carriers do not act as knowing accomplices in the illegal sale of tobacco products."
2007.06-457,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3201.965,3203.402,You mean it's akin to the health exception.
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3203.402,3204.51,Excuse me.
2007.06-457,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.51,3206.979,You say it's akin to a health exception.
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3206.979,3207.635,No.

2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3297.739,3299.972,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-457,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3312.124,3319.541,It can't be... Ms. Brinkmann told us that they've got these... so many packages and it's going to cost millions.
2007.06-457,2,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,3324.166,3336.083,"--Well, as I understand it, the... the uniformity of the symbol for hazardous substance is something that the handlers are trained to scan for."

2007.06-457,3,38367,paul_stern,,3506.951,3522.022,"According to the testimony of Mr. Butler, who provided a document on this, it is looking at the label and determining whether it appears to be from a tobacco retailer."

2007.06-457,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3635.836,3636.086,Okay.
