1964.6,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,50.61,"Number 6, Aaron Henry, petitioner, versus Mississippi."
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,55.688,58.356,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1964.6,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,63.243,66.534,You may do that.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,66.534,103.181,"This petition for certiorari before this Court results from another instance of the use and abuse of criminal process by a state to acquire any cause for conviction of the defendant or an alleged criminal charge, a Negro, defendant then whose engagement in Civil Rights activities and whose associational -- and whose associations are not here related to this case."
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,167.867,169.355,You mean the affidavits?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,169.355,171.258,"No, I am not talking about the affidavits sir."
1964.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,172.96,174.925,Because on the arguendo -- the arguendo of the State's plea.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,174.925,176.473,I am indeed --
1964.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,176.473,189.782,"On the other hand, Mrs Morris is there anything in the record to show that -- to support your preliminary statements here to the Court that this is a persecution of this person because of this affidavit?"
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,189.782,190.612,I think there is.
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,485.169,495.008,[Inaudible] along the lines of NACP Alabama that something was done in this case which had not been done in other cases?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,495.008,497.068,It is indeed.
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,497.068,498.976,That's an equal protection argument.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,502.332,504.344,The other one is somewhat complicated because of references to statutes.
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,504.344,509.011,The Mississippi Supreme Court has said that indeed this lower court did have jurisdiction?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,509.011,516.784,The Mississippi Supreme Court has said that there was an amended affidavit in this case upon which it rested.
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,535.24,537.69,But that's again an equal protection argument.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,537.69,553.475,"Moreover, the statutes themselves, requiring these original papers to go to the county Court, that in itself is conclusive of the fact that Court lacked jurisdiction, so it is on two basis."
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,553.475,559.066,"The Supreme Court held the amended affidavit was sufficient, is that right?"
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,559.066,565.95,It held that an amended affidavit did exist and that this was sufficient to support the proceedings in the county court.
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,565.95,570.996,"They must have interpreted their law as permitting that, could that be true?"
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,570.996,573.074,"I think in fact they did, yes."
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,577.999,581.485,Mississippi law and there's no cases to the contrary.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,581.485,582.414,Other than this one?
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,582.414,582.741,Yeah.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,582.741,585.917,"Yes, there are cases to the contrary as far as amendments are concerned."
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,585.917,587.564,Or you couldn't make an amendment?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,587.564,593.502,"There are cases -- all cases wherever amendments have been allowed, it required original affidavits."
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,608.666,611.018,Now are those Mississippi Supreme Court decisions?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,611.018,611.678,"Yes, they are."
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.678,611.999,And they are cited in the brief.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,611.999,613.502,They are cited in the brief.
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,613.502,619.529,"And you say that wasn't true, if they imposed in other cases, they departed from in this case."
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,621.278,625.547,"Yes, it is."
1964.6,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,745.298,750.977,Are you saying that perceives an unreasonable rule?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,750.977,760.418,"No, it wouldn't be an unreasonable, well I say it is unreasonable in application here and if the rule moreover does not exist."
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,760.418,761.232,[Inaudible]
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,761.232,763.367,"Yes, there are."
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,766.065,772.187,"If they didn't have a rule in Mississippi, didn't you had to make your motion at the time the evidence was submitted?"
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,772.187,823.05,"The difference in the cases in Mississippi, and they differ from those that are cited in the opinion below, is that where they have adjudicated fundamental right to constitutional questions they have applied the same rule and it would be consistent with rule applied in the Federal Court that where there was plain error or where the conviction is supported by the illegal evidence, where the constitutional and infirmity is the basis the whole basis for the conviction then it has reversed in instances where the objection was made at the end of the case, where the objection was made -- where no objection was raised at all, and where --"
1964.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,823.05,831.731,"But then again are you arguing that -- once more, things which they had done in other cases and indeed did in the first opinion in this case."
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,831.731,836.971,"I'm trying to argue -- the question that put me actually ahead of myself, I'm arguing this on two basis."
1964.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,857.551,858.691,I'm sorry.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,885.403,889.823,"I have, and they are referred to in our brief at length."
1964.6,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,904.147,905.055,I wouldn't want you to do that.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,906.287,909.838,"Yeah, generally, I can say that they are distinguishable on three basis."
1964.6,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,952.161,957.177,"Miss Morris, you may continue your argument."
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,957.177,960.296,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Court."
1964.6,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1085.375,1088.68,[Inaudible]
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1088.68,1092.996,Yes sir.
1964.6,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1100.43,1105.847,Why would asking for a directed verdict [Inaudible]
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1105.847,1106.566,It's not that --
1964.6,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1106.566,1111.628,Is it the argument that without it there was no evidence at all to convict?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1111.628,1115.338,"Without this there was not sufficient evidence to convict, yes."
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1115.338,1117.726,And that was it.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1117.726,1126.114,There was identification but we have the opinion of the Court below itself that there wasn't sufficient evidence to convict without this evidence.
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1126.114,1127.24,But that's in the first opinion?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1127.24,1128.069,Yes.
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1128.069,1130.1,Second opinion they said it was --
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1130.1,1131.723,"No, they did not say it was."
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1139.592,1152.036,Tell me on the motion for direction was an argument specifically addressed to the incompetency of [Inaudible] record to the evidence?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1152.036,1153.63,In petitioner's --
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1153.63,1157.418,"On the argument, on the motion for direction."
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1157.418,1163.942,"In arguments for motion of -- no, direction as such as I have read it to you, as it appears here."
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1171.202,1173.437,You mean the motion was made and denied not at the end of it.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1173.437,1174.462,"Immediately, yes it was."
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1181.313,1186.381,But the argument was not offered in support of the motion?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1186.381,1196.714,"There was argument in support of it and when it reached the point where they said we move for a directed verdict, the next colloquy is motion overruled, bring the jury back."
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1196.714,1201.054,"Well, then the motion for direction there was no argument offered?"
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1201.054,1201.211,No.
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1214.323,1224.351,[Inaudible]
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1224.351,1234.64,"This is my argument that implicit in this part where I just read to the Court which is on page 113 of the record, is the unlawfulness and the inadmissibility of the evidence."
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1249.788,1253.637,Its all depends on [Inaudible] is that right?
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1253.637,1255.961,This particular portion of it appears on 113.
1964.6,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1256.82,1260.738,"Yes, there's no other argument in here about on this motion to --"
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1260.738,1262.142,On this specific motion?
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1266.214,1267.657,Well just about just estimates.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1286.799,1287.753,"Yes, it was."
1964.6,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1287.753,1300.371,That is what I'm trying to get at.
1964.6,0,17870,barbara_a_morris,,1300.371,1306.539,Now to return to the Mississippi point which I would like to clarify.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1643.505,1648.691,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1829.9,1834.309,What's your rule Mississippi rule on that direct corroboration?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1834.309,1836.164,It's not necessary Mr. Justice.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1836.164,1837.182,Not necessary at all?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1837.182,1839.007,"No sir, not in the case of this kind."
1964.6,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1839.007,1841.907,[Inaudible]
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1841.907,1843.723,I don't know if that's reflected.
1964.6,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1843.723,1849.928,"Well, I'm just looking at page 225, what you said I gathered it's yours."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1859.256,1865.12,I had completely forgotten that -- sir?
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1865.12,1869.862,What did judge [Inaudible] say about that [Inaudible]
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1869.862,1880.014,"Judge hadn't looked it, along with that question in mind because it wasn't necessarily involved [Inaudible] except indirectly, I don't recall that they said anything about it in the opinion."
1964.6,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1880.014,1886.906,[Inaudible]
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1886.906,1888.028,That's right.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1890.926,1892.023,"Yeah, neither rule for me --"
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,1892.023,1901.997,"The Supreme Court just observed that the trail court made a concession to the appellant to which he was not entitled, I had forgotten that."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2097.892,2113.836,"Mr. Lyell, while you were justifying that portion of your brief, I would like to ask you what justification do you have for the very last sentence in your brief?"
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2115.006,2129.954,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have a feeling of apology but have in the brief filed by the opposition and in the argument made this is indictment of the State of Mississippi."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2129.954,2130.391,Do you think there is --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2130.391,2136.513,"Charges -- this is another instance, in other words, this is a trumped up case."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2142.359,2142.868,Do you mean --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2142.868,2147.426,"That statement was prompted by some information that I received recently, Mr. Chief Justice."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2147.426,2148.142,Yes.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2149.374,2155.115,The trail made -- made through that I had the other -- that he didn't do things like this.
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2155.115,2181.727,"Well, you think that the fact that he may have stepped over legal bounds in presenting his case justifies the State of Mississippi in bringing the matter to the attention of this Court for the purpose of poisoning the mind of this Court then -- and the public against this man when there is nothing in the record, nothing in the record to support it."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2185.832,2202.317,"Mr. Chief Justice, it occurred to me if that's your reaction I'm most humbly apologize because I didn't mean such a thing except to try to answer the indictment that this pleadings they have filed against the State of Mississippi, that this was a framed case Your Honor."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2202.317,2207.884,Did that have anything do to with what you suggest here about this --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2207.884,2208.795,Yes sir.
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2215.99,2226.125,You want us to believe that these acts are true in order to help your case?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2226.125,2232.565,I was merely trying to negate the charges that the other side had made Your Honor.
1964.6,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2232.565,2235.702,[Inaudible]
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2235.702,2238.715,I'm not certain Mr. Justice Clark.
1964.6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.715,2246.075,But wasn't there an issue [Inaudible]
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2246.075,2248.832,"I think he had some character witnesses, Mr. Justice White, I believe."
1964.6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.832,2256.395,Along with the testimony that [Inaudible] was there not?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2256.395,2257.3,"As I recall, there were."
1964.6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.3,2260.707,They had the state put on new evidence at that time.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2260.707,2269.648,"Oh, then and rather previous, actually this time you know, but silent on that, but as I recall he did have some routine character witnesses."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2272.802,2274.559,[Inaudible] he had half a dozen witnesses.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2276.957,2277.499,"Yes, sir."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2277.499,2286.266,If there was anything against his character it couldn't -- or reputation couldn't you then thought at the end if you had wanted to do it?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2286.266,2289.255,"Of course, I have nothing to do with the trial there Your Honor."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2290.565,2329.778,"Now what I'm getting at is the vice that you use to poison this Court in this case by making it appear that this man had -- was guilty of prior acts of perversion when there is absolutely nothing in this record to show that such is the case and you know that there is nothing in the case and you had an opportunity, if there had been any such acts in his -- on his part to establish it at least in accordance with his reputation."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2329.778,2358.451,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe I or anybody else did poison the minds of this Honorable Court, but there have been many efforts to do so and I actually feel justified in that innuendo as Mr. Justice Stewart referred to earlier, when by this there are much greater innuendos and outright charges of fraud on the part of State of Mississippi and trumping up a case against this man because of his civil rights activities."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2358.451,2371.291,"In other words, if the State of Mississippi -- if the defendant practices a fraud on the Court, do you feel justified in perpetrating a bigger one?"
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2371.291,2381.837,"No, sir, but I feel that anybody is entitled to try to answer a charge and in effect to try relive, to some extent relieve the mind of the Court."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2381.837,2386.995,Does this answer anything that they have alleged?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2386.995,2394.637,"About my word, I think its not it's a -- if that's the Court reaction to it, I appear."
1964.6,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2398.68,2400.462,Very well.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2400.462,2406.582,"For a second, I don't want to be in the Court to [Inaudible] I wouldn't try to poison the mind of this Court because it can't be done."
1964.6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.582,2408.397,I don't think you --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2408.397,2409.368,"No, sir."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2409.368,2418.054,May I ask you [Inaudible] about the rule with reference to the corroboration.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2431.52,2432.467,"Yes, sir."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2432.467,2433.566,That is the rule.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2433.566,2434.443,That's the rule.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2435.841,2438.354,Is that still in effect?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2438.354,2439.043,"Yes, sir."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2443.013,2456.315,"I do not understand, the reason I ask is that it seems to me that it was raised at the close of the evidence by his motion for a directed verdict."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2456.315,2457.532,That's not timely.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2512.608,2519.921,Does that mean that a discretion in the Court where it can waive if it sees fit under the particular --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2519.921,2529.687,It did so in that case I'm talking about where it was just in several respects the defendant's rights were just completely transferred.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2529.687,2534.847,"It seems that it's not an absolutely written, unbreakable, irrevocable rule."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2534.847,2535.731,That's right Your Honor.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2535.731,2540.622,"And that the Court can waive it, if the circumstances in its judgment justify it."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2540.622,2544.324,That's correct.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2544.73,2555.689,It would seem to me that in a constitutional matter at this time that this was -- this might come under special circumstances.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2555.689,2565.875,"Well, Your Honor, here the special circumstances of this case and it's undeniable and I say I've given counsel an opportunity three times to deny it, if something that doesn't appear in the record."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2571.893,2573.73,Did you say that does not appear in the record?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2573.73,2576.695,"Of course, it wouldn't appear in the record."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2596.783,2608.218,"Do you think the Court should be bound to accept as a rule, a purpose of its position of this Court of a constitutional question."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2623.128,2627.6,I sincerely hope so in the case of this kind where it was obviously a conscious waiver.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2627.6,2645.023,"Well, I'm not talking about how you are -- the claim is that we should accept this as an adequate state ground, but the rule is not an irrevocable rule, not intended to be, somebody has to weigh the circumstances."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2652.383,2652.718,"No, sir."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2656.405,2656.669,You are arguing --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2656.669,2659.903,But where you find that there was a conscious waiver for the right --
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2659.903,2669.411,Your argument is that we would find -- we should find from the record itself that they was a conscious waiver.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2669.411,2675.025,"Well, you can't find it from the record Your Honor, where there is no objection made into the record."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2675.025,2675.232,Are you --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2675.232,2676.975,There's nothing to find from.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2676.975,2680.167,"You wouldn't want us to go beyond the record to find it, would you?"
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2680.167,2690.546,"I would say this, if no objection is noted in the record, how would you ever know?"
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2690.546,2692.78,But there is an objection.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2707.002,2708.603,That's correct sir.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2708.603,2710.424,But it saw fit not to do so.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2710.424,2720.23,"Well, if it saw fit not to do so after the evidence were delivered and let in, they adopted that trial strategy backed by it and it's too late."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2720.23,2723.432,Have you looked up our cases on that point as to what we --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2723.432,2723.799,"Yes, sir."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2723.799,2728.214,That's just a state ground where it is the discretionary with the State Court?

1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2728.734,2729.657,Appellate Court?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2729.657,2736.102,That -- the position of this very Court and of the Ninth Circuit and I believe one other very thing.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2745.626,2745.999,Escobedo --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2745.999,2750.231,A conscious waiver by a counsel of a -- the right to raise a constitutional question.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2750.231,2758.099,"I understand a conscious waiver by counsel, but I have a weak [Inaudible] because that's weighing the circumstances."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2772.337,2772.595,"No, sir."
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2773.08,2773.514,You haven't?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2773.514,2774.092,"No, sir."
1964.6,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2774.092,2798.609,[Inaudible]
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2798.609,2801.831,Thought I didn't think though.
1964.6,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2801.831,2803.335,Turning back [Inaudible]
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2803.335,2805.013,"Yes, sir."
1964.6,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2805.013,2820.724,"Going back to Justice Black's question, the Court didn't in the second opinion say that they would have stopped a [Inaudible] and they have a theory to stop."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2820.724,2823.503,In addition to the failure to object.
1964.6,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2823.503,2823.902,On the grounds --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2823.902,2831.08,When the testimony was out -- we have and that I think it's pretty well by putting a general rule around the country.
1964.6,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2831.46,2831.815,The idea --
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2831.815,2859.797,"It should be the rule of the Federal Court that where one side introduces it as evidence either in a civil or criminal case which is incompetent and inadmissible for some reason, but no objections made and then the other side, when they put on their case going to the same matter as were done in this case, this inadmissible evidence was a testimony of the Chief of Police as to what he found in the car, the inoperable cigarette lighter and the chewing gum wrappers."
1964.6,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2887.656,2889.237,This was all before the motion?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2889.237,2889.987,"Yes, sir."
1964.6,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2899.895,2905.116,That answer in your basis on rule of estoppel in your state?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2905.116,2907.743,"Not this type of estoppel, not that I know of Your Honor."
1964.6,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2907.743,2914.185,These cases that are cited by the Court on page 245 have not been watered down in any way?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2914.185,2914.911,"No sir, no sir."
1964.6,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2915.729,2949.828,"Well, Mr. Lyell, on that same subject, What -- 244 and 245 the Supreme Court said about that, this -- that he, that is the defendant, also introduced the same evidence, that this kind of a -- by his own witnesses including photographs of the interior of the car, we are therefore of the further opinion, the admission of such evidence unlawfully obtained of error was secured by the introduction of the same testimony by the defendant and he is estopped to complain that such evidence was erroneously admitted on trial for consideration of the jury."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2962.827,2963.22,Right.
1964.6,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2963.534,2971.336,And that was after he had made the motion for direction which included the objection expressly to the admission of the illegally obtained.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2971.336,2977.411,I would have to check back in the record but I believe the first motion for directed verdict was made at the conclusion on the state's case.
1964.6,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2977.411,2978.259,"Yeah, that's what I mean."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,2978.259,2981.925,And that ground I don't believe was set out in the motion.
1964.6,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2981.925,2983.427,Well it's -- but that's what I read.
1964.6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.427,2990.962,[Inaudible] he did make the -- he didn't object to the introduction.

1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,3034.446,3046.766,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I think what they're trying to say is that regardless of where the motion might have been made, as long as it wasn't conceivably objected to when offered that you would still be estopped to complain if you went on and put same --"
1964.6,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3046.766,3049.373,"Well, really what I'm getting at Mr. Lyell is this."
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,3077.844,3081.871,Except there is a matter of strategy on a trial strategy.
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3081.871,3083.33,There's one other thing.
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,3083.33,3085.302,Sir?
1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3085.302,3098.982,I thought in my judgments along the way that Mississippi had a rule that it could always notice plain error that could cause an injury justified?

1964.6,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3118.659,3120.171,That is the rule in Mississippi?
1964.6,1,25627,g_garland_lyell_jr,,3120.171,3127.537,"Yes, sir."

1964.6,2,17870,barbara_a_morris,,3225.991,3231.02,"No, there is nothing that disagree, no [Inaudible] in one of them, there is something which agrees with it."
