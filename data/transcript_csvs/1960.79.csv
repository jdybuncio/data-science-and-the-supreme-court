1960.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.771,"Mike Milanovich et al., Petitioners, versus United States."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,11.679,18.341,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1960.79,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,431.911,436.403,Didn't the Court of the Appeals set aside the sentence on the receiving counts?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,436.403,441.161,"The majority of the Fourth Circuit did set aside the receiving charge, yes."
1960.79,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,441.161,445.475,How does that correct in the error then?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,445.475,449.428,Because Virginia Milanovich asked for a jury trial.
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,511.627,521.816,"But the guilt of larceny in turn, on the ruling of the law, whether an aider or an abettor scam the principals, doesn't it?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,521.816,522.126,"Yes, sir."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,522.126,524.032,Is that a matter for the jury?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,524.032,525.704,"No, sir."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,525.704,530.368,"Presumably, if the jury instructed it, you find that they in fact did aide and abet."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,542.977,556.466,"Well, we say that this case falls in the ruling of this Court in the Heflin case, where it was set forth, very clearly that one cannot be guilty of robbing a bank and possession of the stolen goods."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,563.903,567.591,"Well, it is that they couldn't be guilty or -- but you can't impose two punishments --"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,567.591,568.09,You cannot --
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,568.09,575.703,"-- or what is -- or what had you argued a minute ago, it's only offense in -- in its -- in its sequence."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,575.703,576.195,That's right.
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,576.195,605.441,"Suppose -- suppose, appellee Milanovichs -- Milanovichs -- I beg your pardon, had left as they did and the money has been -- the loot has been accomplished by the so-called three thieves and the money had been dissipated by them so that (Inaudible) come to the couple, would they be tried for larceny?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,605.441,608.028,"Yes, sir."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,617.904,619.927,"In fact, they will give them money."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,628.151,629.308,"Right, sir."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,629.308,633.392,And then the Court of the Appeals set aside one of them.
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,633.392,634.065,They vacated --
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,634.065,641.304,"I -- I don't get the course of your answer to Justice Douglas' question, other than to take care of the situation."
1960.79,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,641.304,646.357,It wouldn't take care of the situation if the jury had to determine the sentence.
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,646.357,656.247,But we feel that had the jury been so instructed that they could only find the defendants guilty as a principal or as a receiver.
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,680.08,691.462,"What we said is they can't be punished, because it's only one offense, but they can grip more because there had been no receipt subsequently in aiding and abetting making them principals wouldn't have evaporated."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,714.427,731.668,"Well, we think that the jury should have -- should have been so instructed that they could bring in only one verdict that a person cannot be found guilty of both as a principal and as a receiver."
1960.79,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,785.61,789.518,Do you object that the charge as given by the Court?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,789.518,792.186,"Yes, sir."
1960.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,794.55,795.989,315.
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,795.989,812.067,"315, where it was by Mr. Kutulakis who is one of the attorneys in a District Court, ""I feel they were not fully instructed on the law of larceny and receiving."""
1960.79,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,816.879,818.455,"Where, it's on?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,818.455,822.364,At the middle of the page.
1960.79,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,822.364,824.39,So that as after the charge you've been given?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,824.39,825.755,That's after the charge it been given.
1960.79,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,825.755,831.991,"But at the time the charge was given, did he make any objection or request its amplification?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,831.991,835.679,"At that time, no, sir."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,893.393,909.756,"When they -- when their car left, when their car left and assuming as of that time, the -- the three accomplices had rifled the safe, part of the situation with reference that they had him."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,921.175,928.352,"They could be properly indicted and charged under -- a larceny count as a principal, as being an aider and abettor."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,928.352,950.168,"But you say, if two weeks later, they received some money, they can no longer be charged for larceny, as well as considering the intervening time also for receiving goods and having the proper charges to each on which the jury could find either or both, leaving the question of what punishment should be involved is a very different problem."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,950.168,955.083,"As Judge Sobeloff said in his dissenting opinion, that the intervening time made no difference --"
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,955.083,962.813,"I know he says it, but I'm trying to test it whether what he says is so."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,962.813,973.23,"Well, we feel that it was just a matter of circumstances that the money was not divided as of the actual time of taking."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,973.279,980.938,"But it's a matter of circumstances that some people don't carry out a planned crime and therefore, the result is a very different thing."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,980.938,1006.812,"But had they been there at the time the loot was carried out, they would've probably and could have been charged similar manner, since they did not actually go into the building, did not touch the contents of the safes, could be probably found under this charge as given to the jury, would have been found guilty by this jury of both as a principal and as a receiver."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1024.817,1027.769,Do you mean it's charged and referred to the intervening time?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1027.769,1028.506,"No, sir."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1030.263,1033.406,"But that was before the jury, the whole -- the evidences."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1036.483,1041.933,The evidence was before the jury that there was an intervening time.
1960.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1041.933,1058.111,"If we leave out a consideration for the moment, the conviction for larceny, is there any infirmity in the evidence, so far as -- as knowing you're receiving stolen property is concerned?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1058.111,1064.742,It is affirmed and the evidence is there that the stolen property was found in the Milanovich's home.
1960.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1064.742,1066.983,You know in fact the sufficiency of that evidence (Voice Overlap) --
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1066.983,1069.344,"We do not attack the sufficiency of that evidence, but we sit --"
1960.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1069.344,1077.146,"Nor on the evidence -- yes, nor on the other hand, do you attack the sufficiency of the evidence on the larceny charge?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1077.146,1080.033,"Not as presented to the jury in this case, as it now stands."
1960.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1080.033,1101.18,"Now, is there -- is there any interweaving of -- of the testimony which would compel him to which -- to which the jury would consider some of the testimony on the larceny in order to convict on the knowing or receiving stolen property or vice versa?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1101.18,1102.15,"Yes, sir."
1960.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1102.15,1103.326,What would you point that out?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1103.326,1118.801,"But we didn't say that it is more creditable that they would be found guilty of receiving, rather than as a principal, because the testimony that makes them a principal in this crime is based entirely on that of the three accomplices, the three thieves."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1138.11,1149.663,"Are you saying that the jury of layman can understand the people get the money, a thousand dollars, they received and those thousand dollars that were stolen."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1170.332,1171.218,Yes.
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1187.969,1197.418,"Not because the evidence was lacking for them to solve a crime, but because it's this metaphysical notion that the person who aides and abets in the law, is a principal."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1197.418,1199.104,"Yes, sir."
1960.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1199.104,1218.793,"Why do you think it's more likely that they would find her guilty of receiving than -- than of -- of the larceny, because they did find her husband been guilty of the larceny and -- and his conduct was almost precisely the same as her, wasn't it?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1218.793,1220.578,"At the time, yes, sir."
1960.79,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1227.669,1231.721,"Then so the -- so the judge held and took it away from the jury, didn't he?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1231.721,1233.782,"Yes, sir."
1960.79,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1259.907,1261.409,What makes you think that?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1264.703,1266.152,Same as the principal and yet --
1960.79,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1266.152,1270.539,Would you like to think the judge wouldn't have given him ten years on the receiving?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1270.539,1272.425,"It's very possible that he would've, but he didn't."
1960.79,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1272.425,1274.481,"The jury wouldn't have to anything to do with that, wasn't he?"
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1274.481,1274.84,"No, sir."
1960.79,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1277.497,1280.838,The judge had all the facts the jury has.
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1287.366,1290.623,But we say that it was error to allow it to go to the jury.
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1370.021,1377.621,How do you ask for a new trial rather than a modification of a sentence?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1377.621,1386.263,Because we feel that the defendants were deprived of the proper rights in the court by not having the jury so instructed.
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1400.988,1416.747,My question is why don't you ask this Court the lighter sentence -- that the sentence be modified there'd a direction or remission for the District Court or a modification of the sentence to the lighter one?
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1427.7,1432.548,Because we feel they'd be up to the jury to decide rather than for the Court.
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1440.941,1442.67,"No, I understand your argument."
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1475.798,1479.597,"The Court could so do that and that's exactly -- well, the Fourth Circuit --"
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1479.597,1483.149,That's why you're asking -- you're asking for a new trial.
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1483.149,1494.376,"Because we feel that possibly -- that in a new trial, I would say that there's other evidence, which could be presented, which may or may not offer the verdict of the jury."
1960.79,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1494.376,1497.09,It might get off on a new trial.
1960.79,0,30063,j_hubbard_davis,,1497.09,1498.343,"Yes, sir."
1960.79,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1498.343,1499.056,"Yes, but --"
1960.79,1,38694,raymond_w_bergan,,1892.946,1894.619,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.79,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2136.926,2140.807,Mr. Bishop.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2140.807,2143.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2371.058,2371.599,Mr. Bishop --
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2371.599,2371.793,"Yes, sir."
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2371.793,2379.736,-- may I ask you to address yourself to this question?
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2422.652,2424.836,Accepting the assumptions which upon a --
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2424.836,2426.336,"Yes, yes."
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2426.809,2427.052,Yes.
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2428.512,2429.492,"Yes, yes."
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2429.492,2435.077,"In other words, the judge had here two, shall we say separate --"
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2435.077,2435.906,Yes.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2435.906,2439.014,"-- things, separate counts, separate verdicts."
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2455.274,2456.615,Yes.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2456.615,2460.419,"-- there were reasons, substantial ones, as to her participation and the like."
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2460.419,2461.13,Yes.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2461.13,2466.77,"But when -- if you -- if the assumption is made by the Chief Justice which I must accept, --"
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2466.77,2467.148,Sure.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2467.148,2493.271,"-- that -- that if this jury instead of finding guilt of aiding and abetting larceny, had found only receiving, I am not sure that we're permitted to assume that he would have given only five years, simply because his evaluation of the total of what she should receive seem to have been ten years, on the offense that she was found guilty of."
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2536.94,2537.072,Yes.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2537.072,2538.335,-- to 1951.
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2545.161,2548.984,"Well, I -- I agree with you."
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2584.947,2587.091,I couldn't speculate on that at all.
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2587.091,2587.438,"Well, then --"
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2587.438,2595.217,We haven't -- we do have the assurance that -- that he felt that her offenses and her record had been --
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2595.217,2595.81,Yes.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2595.81,2608.231,"-- so great that he -- I -- I -- if -- if you wish to my speculation, I would've say he would have given her ten years on that because he gave his five years on receiving in the full knowledge that there would be a ten-year sentence."
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2608.231,2608.955,Yes.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2608.955,2619.398,"And if -- if the Chief Justice wishes me to speculate, I would say from the -- from considerable delving into this record, from the feeling of the judge's comments throughout, --"
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2619.398,2619.815,Yes.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2619.815,2624.812,"-- that if he had had only one sentence to give, he would have given ten years, on receiving."
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2624.812,2639.912,"Well, do you think it would've made any difference whether the jury found her guilty of both larceny and receiving or whether the jury had found her not guilty of larceny, but had only found her guilty of -- of receiving?"
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2639.912,2640.761,I do not.
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2640.761,2641.522,You do not.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2642.649,2655.497,"That is an impression from extensive reading in the record, but I submit to the Court will cover the same conclusion when they see how she was entangled in this matter and the laboring when she took it --"
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2655.497,2656.761,What was it -- excuse me.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2656.761,2657.538,I'm sorry.
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2657.538,2667.612,"I just tried to ask you, what was the source for the Court of Appeals' power to choose one of these, rather than the other to leave an effect?"
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2668.552,2669.018,The source of --
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2669.018,2671.286,"Either one could have been left, could it not?"
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2671.286,2678.83,I -- the -- the source of the -- the Court's power was the only one of these was invalid.
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2678.83,2684.002,But there had to be a choice made that made a difference of five years to the defendant.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2690.419,2693.202,"Well, I -- I still must dissent from that word, choose."

1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2695.88,2696.067,Well --
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2696.067,2697.798,The Court wiped out one count and one verdict that was invalid.

1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2708.037,2711.664,Because the five was on the invalid count on verdict and pretend --
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2711.664,2712.764,Invalid?
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2712.764,2713.622,Yes.

1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2754.611,2755.442,That is -- you were asked --

1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2760.358,2761.701,"That's right, that's right."
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2761.701,2764.974,It had no choice as the jury would have had.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2764.974,2765.638,That is correct.
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2770.415,2776.655,"But what about the District Court, was there any choice for him if he had reached the conclusion that he was wrong in his charge?"

1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2841.881,2849.92,"It's your position that the Court of Appeals didn't have any discretion that it had to if it's accepted one, except the larceny?"

1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2852.632,2860.831,"Well, he had to accept the one that was used -- it's your position that he had to accept the larceny, because the larceny was the one that is invalid."
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2860.831,2860.846,That's right.
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2860.846,2865.21,And he could not have accepted the -- the receiving count conviction because that was not valid.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2865.21,2866.071,That's right.

1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2938.312,2939.326,That's opposite.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,2939.326,2940.373,That's right.

1960.79,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3021.603,3022.79,Alright.

1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3297.464,3298.546,I'm just going to ask though --
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,3298.546,3298.562,"Yes, sir."

1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,3329.347,3331.266,My answer to that question is yes.

1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3951.442,3956.362,But that wouldn't be absolute because he might do differently now than what he would have done then.
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,3956.362,3956.704,There is --
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3956.704,3969.737,"But I assume if -- if that's the test that we should follow, that's the nearest we could come to it rather than to just indulge in speculation or what some other courts had speculated in some other cases about what a judge would or might have done."
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,3969.737,3970.885,No.
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3987.533,3988.192,"Well, if the --"
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,3988.192,3989.554,-- that that has been done.
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3989.554,3999.452,"-- if the defendant is entitled to be (Inaudible) according to the judge who has the initial power to sentence him, what's the harm if -- when the --"
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,3999.452,3999.76,The harm --
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3999.76,4007.655,"-- new situation comes up, he's given a right to sentence him according to his belief, if that's his right and has found."
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,4010.767,4015.897,"I can only say that here, at least, the judge evaluated the sentence that did the --"
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4015.897,4018.11,Under the circumstances then before it.
1960.79,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4018.11,4018.512,"Well, it isn't only --"
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,4018.512,4018.9,Correct.
1960.79,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4018.9,4020.096,"-- that, it isn't only that."
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,4026.432,4027.354,That is my point.
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4027.354,4032.997,Then he's imposed the sentence of five years on one which it might have been the one or might not.
1960.79,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4032.997,4036.804,"And therefore, you set aside the one in which he's invalidly imposed a sentence."
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4036.804,4049.214,Should we assume that he's a -- it's his desire to give here the heavier sentence -- sentence possible under all circumstance and traditions because he gave out one sentence and then added five years concurrently --
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,4049.214,4049.603,My answer is --
1960.79,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4049.603,4051.643,-- which might have been imposed on him maybe?
1960.79,2,28966,j_f_bishop,,4051.643,4069.074,"My answer is that we don't necessarily assume that as an invariable rule, but that we have considerable authority for the judge finishing -- for the Court finishing the job, where there is an indication of the trial judge's intent."
1960.79,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4069.074,4073.457,We'll recess now.
