1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.549,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-68, Eddie S. Ylst v. Owen Duane Nunnemaker."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,40.498,44.82,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,50.483,53.135,"Would you speak up a little, Mr. Thompson?"
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,53.135,54.407,--I'm sorry.
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.498,119.74,These were petitions for habeas corpus?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,119.74,120.441,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.036,241.359,"Mr. Thompson, as I understand the ruling of the court of appeal, it was based on the proposition that the Supreme Court of California, which denied a writ of habeas corpus without opinion in this case, does on occasion grant review of otherwise defaulted claims where there's an original petition for habeas corpus."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,247.244,260.904,"--Well, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit's opinion quotes your opinion and says that the Supreme Court in Harris discussed the issue now before us."
1990.90-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.087,332.94,You take the position that the Ninth Circuit probably relied on that footnote in Harris--
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,332.94,333.661,"--I do, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.502,340.475,"--and that footnote, I suppose, in Harris may be dicta, in any event."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,340.475,341.976,"--Oh, it's unquestionably dicta, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.159,425.091,Must be what?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,425.091,425.912,"Mandatory, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,425.912,429.441,I didn't read the Ninth Circuit opinion that way.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,447.203,450.666,"I don't understand the opinion that way, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.659,469.74,These are summary denials of habeas?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,469.74,470.571,Summary denial.
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,536.873,541.227,What do you mean by saying that jurisdiction in mandatory?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,541.227,547.559,"--What I mean, Your Honor, is that the California Supreme Court's denial represents its view of the merits of a habeas petition."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,573.217,573.968,Misinterpreted California law.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,573.968,575.138,"I'm sorry, yes."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.284,594.221,I take it you don't... you certainly agree that the... that the... on an original habeas petition the California Supreme Court can decide the merits if it wants to?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,594.221,595.921,"If it wants to, Your Honor, but--"
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.921,602.336,"But you say if they, if they just automatically just say petition denied--"
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,602.336,604.136,--That's a decision not to decide the case.
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.136,608.81,--They won't... if they decide the merits you think there will be an opinion?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,608.81,613.893,Under California procedure if they are going to decide the merits they will first issue an order to show cause.
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.36,624.539,So you say--
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,638.109,644.333,"No more, Your Honor, than an order from this Court saying that certiorari is denied."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,644.333,646.324,Your answer is yes to the question?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,646.324,650.038,"Yeah, I mean, they look at everything, but the criteria go far beyond the merits."
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,650.038,653.968,But what's the answer to my question?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,653.968,656.842,"I think that the answer is, Your Honor, it is not a decision on the merits."
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,662.566,665.168,Including possible lack of merit?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,670.501,682.128,"--I think, Your Honor, no, because in that case they would, what they would say is they would deny the writ and then cite to In re Swain saying... which is a State case, saying that you don't state a prima facie case."
1990.90-68,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,683.369,687.992,Where do we look first for a concise statement of California law on this?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,708.646,713.568,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, as the Ninth Circuit has recognized, it turns on the nature of the State jurisdiction."
1990.90-68,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.486,736.772,"As I understand it, the jurisdiction is not discretionary in the sense that they must in effect entertain the case at length and come down with a discursive opinion."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,758.106,769.574,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, where I find it is in the California Supreme Court's manual of practices and procedures, where at page 13 the court describes its own--"
1990.90-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,769.574,772.516,Where do we find that in the papers here?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,772.516,775.007,"--Your Honor, it's not in the record in this case."
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,847.536,854.14,It's substantially like a denial of hearing on a petition for hearing from the court of appeals?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,854.14,855.09,It is exactly--
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.09,856.322,Exactly?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,856.322,858.042,"--like that in our view, Your Honor, yes."
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,858.753,860.917,May I ask this question on it?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,888.463,891.885,"--Well, Your Honor, you would have jurisdiction to take it, but under--"
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.885,893.978,Under the theory that it is the final judgment?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,893.978,894.577,--Yes.
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.1,901.702,What... just a minute.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,910.739,911.78,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.752,915.3,"Right, I understand."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,915.3,916.532,--could not claim a procedural default.
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.532,923.256,"But now my other hypothetical, the case like this one, where it's an original petition for habeas, then would not our review be of the California Supreme Court's action?"
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,923.256,926.339,"I think not, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.382,935.563,"Well, we only have jurisdiction if it's a final judgment."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,935.563,936.384,"I understand, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.384,937.606,That's why we couldn't review the discretionary one.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,937.606,938.016,I understand.
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.016,940.468,But you think we would have jurisdiction over the original habeas?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,940.468,947.173,"No, I think what you would have jurisdiction to review is their exercise of discretion, which could be challenged--"
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.173,951.465,"Well, we review judgments, not opinions and so forth, and it's a particular order that would give us jurisdiction."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,955.618,961.622,"--Well, I think what would happen is you would have to conclude that you should deny cert. because there was no judgment on the merits."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1053.105,1060.228,"You're just saying that in this case we should just treat this case as never having been in the California Supreme Court, as it never really was."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1060.228,1063.02,"--I am saying, Your Honor, I--"
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.02,1070.035,And that therefore the last court to have addressed the question is the intermediate appellate court--
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1070.035,1071.265,--The last State court.
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.265,1072.637,--and it relies on procedural default.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1072.637,1073.578,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1073.578,1074.537,Expressly.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1074.537,1075.158,Yes.
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.431,1086.405,You're really saying the petition for habeas corpus in the California Supreme Court was really... the case was never entertained there.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1088.017,1089.316,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1105.408,1117.847,"Well, now, to make... to make that decision the Federal court has to look to California law to determine that in California that's the effect of the order, right?"
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1117.847,1118.255,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1118.255,1123.62,"And that, of course, is not what the footnote in Harris against Reed suggests."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1126.93,1132.916,"Your Honor, I would have the Court honor the principle that the State court is the ultimate arbiter of its own law."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.044,1184.129,Do you think that... do you think that we have to... if we agree with you we have to say that the court of appeals misunderstood California law?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1192.644,1195.055,--We didn't... Your Honor--
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.055,1205.933,"This very argument that you're making, that you should treat this habeas corpus petition when it's dismissed with just a blind order as never having really been in the court... in the supreme court?"
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1206.813,1208.285,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1212.586,1213.157,All right.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1213.838,1217.521,"Briefing was completed in this case, Your Honor, before you decided Harris v. Reed."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.521,1218.582,Well--
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1218.582,1219.782,We were at a bit of a disadvantage.
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.172,1231.131,"--Well, it looks to me like the court of appeals just relied on Harris against Reed without any real close analysis of the State law such as you are now presented to us."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1231.131,1233.062,"--That's unclear, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1237.326,1242.94,I would hesitate to say that California... that the court of appeals miss... made a mistake about State law--
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1242.94,1244.011,"--Well, they have."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.011,1245.063,--unless it's clear that they did.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1245.063,1246.281,"Well, I think it is clear, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.281,1249.744,"Well they didn't say, they didn't talk about State law like you're talking about it."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1249.744,1262.841,"Well, that depends on the meaning one attributes to their reference in the opinion below to the fact that this is a petition invoking the California Supreme Court's original jurisdiction."
1990.90-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1274.481,1293.061,"Well, Mr. Thompson, now, the order of the California Supreme Court, the last order denying the original State habeas, was decided... handed down before our decision in Harris against Reed?"
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1294.223,1295.502,"That's true, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1295.502,1301.006,And the Ninth Circuit opinion came down after we had decided Harris against Reed?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1301.006,1301.276,Yes.
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1477.766,1478.125,No.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1513.898,1521.124,"--Because, Your Honor, when the Federal district court looks through these summary denials and hits that State court opinion, it'll apply the Harris v. Reed plain statement rule."
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.196,1526.317,"Well, but if it's plain."
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1531.569,1536.074,"--Well, the question then is that they're going to have to decide whether there was cause or prejudice."
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.009,1547.09,Well--
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1547.09,1548.82,It's enormous.
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.075,1565.373,"--Well, why is there... if their basis is there was a procedural default and they're going to rely on that ground in the same kind of order they use now, why can't they just add the words for grounds of procedural default?"
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1565.373,1574.479,"Because then, Your Honor, to do that they would have to review both the record to determine whether in fact it was, the trial record, and they don't do that in a habeas case."
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.397,1592.911,"They would look at the same documents that the district judge will look at later on, don't they?"
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1592.911,1595.833,"--Well, I guess they have them available, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.251,1612.072,Let me just ask you to be sure I... are you telling us that they do or do not read the court of appeals' opinion before them?
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1612.072,1612.803,"--I believe that they do, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.803,1613.745,Okay.
1990.90-68,0,20219,clifford_k_thompson_jr,,1613.745,1617.986,"But it's not easy to tell everything that they do, because these are basically ex parte proceedings."
1990.90-68,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.987,1696.967,"Very well, Mr. Thompson."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,1699.23,1705.503,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.262,1723.125,"The part about habeas was dicta, was it not?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,1739.576,1745.15,I have two responses to that.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.201,1763.672,Are you answering the question whether that was dicta or not?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,1763.672,1764.461,--Yes.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1786.596,1793.843,"So you say it may be dicta, but if it was dicta it was... it was good dicta and it ought to be adhered to?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,1793.843,1794.461,Absolutely.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.435,1820.417,"Ms. Drous, I think it's easy to underestimate that burden."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,1841.562,1850.618,"Well, first of all... the question here should be what kind of discretion is exercised by the California Supreme Court."
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.443,1939.496,Do you think it's likely that the chief justice would put out a book about procedures that the other members of the court didn't agree with?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,1939.496,1967.956,"--Well, let me... the passage relied on here as to the different cases that the California Supreme Court deals with, it's true that in death penalty cases and in a few other situations the court must render a written opinion, and it's true that there is discretion to be exercised regarding a petition for writ of habeas corpus and a petition for review."
1990.90-68,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2006.381,2013.174,Does Griggs... does Griggs hold that a decision following that review is necessarily a decision on the merits?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2013.174,2015.535,"It does not, but there's a reason for that."
1990.90-68,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2027.514,2035.689,"It sounds then as though this pamphlet, whatever its status may be, probably is the closest thing we're going to get to a definitive statement of California law."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2035.689,2038.641,"Well, let me get back to that."
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2086.793,2091.588,"Well, isn't that dealing with the petition for hearing in the normal course of direct review?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2091.588,2092.547,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2107.598,2108.629,That was really my point.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2116.813,2117.354,--Correct.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2119.094,2119.965,--Petition for review?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2119.965,2120.456,But that's correct.
1990.90-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.176,2161.242,The court of appeals said it was limiting its decision to original petitions for... for habeas.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2161.242,2162.253,That's correct.
1990.90-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2162.253,2176.783,"And I suppose if there's... if there's an original petition for habeas corpus in the California Supreme Court and that court just enters that blind order, dismissed or denied... what was it?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2177.402,2179.224,In California it's never dismissed.
1990.90-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.825,2181.326,"All right, denied."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2199.868,2201.127,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.75,2211.646,And although we usually say that we don't... we only take cases from a State court that has decided an issue that has been presented to us.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2211.646,2213.526,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.077,2217.149,"So we could, we could theoretically and actually we could reverse--"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2217.149,2218.749,--Absolutely.
1990.90-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.749,2220.091,--the California Supreme Court.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2220.091,2221.173,Absolutely.
1990.90-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.279,2247.001,When they have just denied review?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2247.001,2248.761,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.093,2255.886,"Certainly you acknowledge, don't you, a matter of California law?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2255.886,2257.096,Yes.
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.928,2269.365,"And so what we have to do is take our best shot at figuring out whether California, the California Supreme Court itself regards its habeas petitions as mandatory or discretionary."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2272.527,2276.988,"--That's correct, but you have... there's another... what discretion is exercised."
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.536,2320.107,"No, the discretion we're talking about here, to make it clearer, is discretion not to consider the case."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2320.107,2321.848,The California--
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2321.848,2330.133,"To look at the case and say it doesn't seem to us important enough, or the probability of error below does not seem to us enough, without really looking into it."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2335.969,2345.353,--The California Supreme Court does not have that absolute discretion to ignore a petition for habeas corpus filed in its office.
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.353,2346.255,Um-hum.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2346.255,2347.376,The--
1990.90-68,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2347.376,2353.081,"And your authority for saying that are the cases, as I understand it, from which you were quoting the verbs a few moments ago?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2353.081,2353.759,--Correct.
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.619,2403.583,"And it doesn't have two different formulations, denied or declined?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2411.057,2411.597,--It uses the same word.
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2412.777,2416.751,I suppose this would differ from State to State?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2416.751,2417.622,That's correct.
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.82,2454.765,So Harris v. Reed requires us to look in a very searching way at the procedural law of all of these different States in order to understand the consequences of these orders?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2454.765,2457.159,I don't think in a very searching way.
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2458.898,2462.621,You don't think we've given a searching examination into California law here this morning?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2462.621,2466.463,"--I believe that you have, and I know the Ninth Circuit has."
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2466.463,2469.344,I thought the whole point of Harris v. Reed was to avoid having to do that.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2469.344,2473.318,"And it will, and it does."
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2473.318,2474.26,After we do 50 States?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2474.26,2479.342,"Well, the... the courts--"
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.342,2487.736,"50 times isn't so many, I suppose, compared to the alternative."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2487.736,2489.118,"--Well, I don't think that the... that it--"
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2489.118,2495.461,"Do you think this is easier than our having to just look to see whether or not there was a procedural default on the merits, something we're familiar with?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2495.461,2498.684,"--No, because that's only the first step."
1990.90-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.188,2518.689,"I thought you agreed that Harris... that there just ought to be the simple rule, either the last court that deals with the case says procedural default or that's the end of it."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2518.689,2519.688,--I believe that.
1990.90-68,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.688,2525.121,And you don't... and you say... so that saves you from examining all sorts of--
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2525.121,2525.702,That's correct.
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.199,2568.37,"--I suppose there would be no problem if the California constitution were amended not to eliminate the original habeas jurisdiction of the California Supreme Court, but simply to make it clear that that jurisdiction is discretionary."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2569.96,2571.052,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.052,2572.123,And then we'd have no problem here.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2573.573,2574.404,That's correct.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.832,2607.035,"Your... I would think your answer would be, in the case of the amendment that Justice Scalia talked to you about, that even though it were completely discretionary, so long as the California Supreme Court could possibly consider a default and claim on the merits, Harris against Reed wouldn't be satisfied."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2607.035,2608.425,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.999,2623.245,What... do you think Harris against Reed applies to the direct review procedure?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2623.245,2628.538,It does reply... apply to the direct review procedure.
1990.90-68,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.527,2644.359,"Well, then you're saying it really doesn't apply in the same way it applies in the... in the original habeas."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2660.091,2672.857,"I would answer that by saying well, it would make no sense in looking at California law to go to any prior proceeding in determining what the State court meant in its denial of an original petition."
1990.90-68,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.409,2675.03,"Well, I understand."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2675.99,2678.414,"--No, it makes more sense to do that--"
1990.90-68,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.414,2679.863,"I know it makes more sense, but what's your position on that?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2686.137,2694.262,--I think the Ninth Circuit did clearly state... made a distinction between the petition for review procedure and the original petition procedure.
1990.90-68,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.651,2709.162,Okay.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2709.162,2711.943,But when you have a denial of original habeas corpus--
1990.90-68,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.943,2713.135,So you do draw a distinction between the two?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2713.135,2713.846,"--Yes, I would."
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.099,2742.894,"What about when the Supreme Court of California denies review but directs depublication, or whatever the phrase is in California?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2742.894,2750.191,That... denying... that doesn't make any difference in the petition for review procedure to that instant case.
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.22,2770.294,Can other people rely on it for determining what the basis of the decision was?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2777.987,2780.478,Not in that individual case.
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.478,2780.909,Okay.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2780.909,2785.654,But in an unrelated case you cannot cite back to it because it is no longer law.
1990.90-68,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2904.151,2919.89,"Well, do you think, looking at the record of multiple proceedings in this case, that reasonable people would differ over the meaning of the denial here, absent Harris against Reed's presumption?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2919.89,2921.573,This is an interesting case.
1990.90-68,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.083,2960.729,"But the reason for that was the fact he had another claim, an ineffective assistance claim as well as the Miranda claim, isn't it?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,2962.922,2967.614,That might have had an effect.
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.333,3014.856,Of course there may not be any single intent.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3030.578,3034.179,"And if that's the case, Your Honor, there has been no reliance."
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3043.555,3043.956,I guess that's an interesting question.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3048.628,3049.469,That's correct.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3049.469,3061.978,What would be the hardship to your client of having a rule that would say in a case like this there the last court in the... California to pass on the merits of this claim said it was procedurally defaulted.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3069.273,3071.645,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3071.645,3074.336,Did you get any of it?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3074.336,3076.807,I got lost somewhere along the way.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.378,3077.708,Okay.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3107.897,3115.794,"If the... if the Federal courts decided that that was the rule to be imposed here, or if, if the State court decided?"
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3115.794,3116.195,"Well, no--"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3116.195,3117.134,There would be a difference.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3117.134,3125.969,--Presumably... what would be the hardship to your client in this Court adopting a rule such as that?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3125.969,3139.288,The hardship on my client would be that in fact perhaps the procedural default was excused and he should have been allowed to go into Federal court to litigate his Federal constitutional claim.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3144.592,3149.584,Because one of the blind denials from the California appellate courts might have been on the merits?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3149.584,3155.128,"The problem is is that, exactly that, that it might have been and you do not know that."
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3156.54,3159.381,Do you say that there's a probability that that would have been the case?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3159.381,3160.203,--There's a--
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3160.203,3168.728,Do you base your answer to the Chief Justice on the mathematical possibilities of this happening?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3168.728,3172.451,"--I couldn't state what the mathematical possibilities are, but--"
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3172.451,3174.221,Not even a mathematical possibility?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3174.221,3175.743,"--Well, there is a possibility."
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3175.743,3176.622,How about a probability?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3176.622,3178.745,It's possible.
1990.90-68,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3180.666,3181.617,"It's possible, but not probable, is it?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3181.617,3184.349,"--The problem is, is that you do not know."
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.721,3196.417,"Does... the California Supreme Court gets what, 700 petitions for habeas corpus a year?"
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3196.417,3199.86,I would... that would sound--
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.86,3205.243,Some... oh... that order of... in how many of those does it grant relief typically in a year?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3205.243,3206.132,--Very few.
1990.90-68,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3206.833,3208.684,Can you give me some order of magnitude?
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3209.495,3210.597,--Probably.
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.426,3260.017,"Oh, I don't know."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3267.682,3268.923,"That's exactly my point, Your Honor."
1990.90-68,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3274.367,3274.988,But sometimes you can't.
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3279.339,3285.984,"--In that case I would say, as I said earlier, the procedural default was not relied upon."
1990.90-68,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3285.984,3304.326,"May I ask you... maybe this is off the wall, but supposing the district judge was persuaded there was... that they may well have acted on the merits in this case, adopted your position, but looked at the record in the trial court and thought well, by golly, this defendant certainly should have objected to this evidence and didn't do so."
1990.90-68,1,30059,juliana_drous,,3309.489,3315.403,"Yeah, the... this rule is not jurisdictional."
1990.90-68,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3319.467,3320.409,It's really not jurisdictional either way.
