2011.10-507,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.606,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-507, Pacific Operators Offshore v. Valladolid."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,12.391,15.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-507,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,50.849,57.67,"When you say on land, do you -- where do you put the 3-mile State offshore limit?"
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,59.872,63.323,"No, it wouldn't count as land, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-507,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,102.246,112.904,"Mr. Clement, just to follow up on the Chief Justice's question, if there is a helicopter crash in the water, let's say it occurs 2.5 miles from the shore, is that covered?"
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,117.339,132.282,"Well, Justice Kagan, I think the best answer is both of those crashes would be covered directly by the Longshore Act because the Longshore Act by its own terms, not extended by OCSLA, covers the navigable waters, and both of those would be accidents occurring in the navigable waters."
2011.10-507,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,150.762,159.368,The curious thing about this case is that the statutory language seems to me to speak quite clearly to some theory of causation.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,186.185,190.904,"Well, Justice Alito, let me talk first about the causation and then about the smuggling if I can."
2011.10-507,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.455,223.791,Give -- give me an example of a -- of an injury that occurs on the shelf that is not a consequence of operations conducted.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,226.143,235.749,"--Well, I think the best example would be, Your Honor, is somebody who's on the shelf but they are not employed in the relevant production purposes."
2011.10-507,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.035,238.601,What are they doing out there?
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,238.601,240.57,"--Well, you might have an accountant out there."
2011.10-507,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,243.872,246.907,How many accountants go to platforms?
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,246.907,251.961,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think it's worth recognizing -- I mean, I don't know how many go."
2011.10-507,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,275.576,284.699,"But if that -- if that's what Congress meant, then the emphasis should be on is this person one who regularly works on the outer continental shelf."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,294.122,295.157,--Sure.
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,313.701,314.201,But Mr.--
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.201,325.759,"But -- but if you had said status or situs, then it seems to me it would have made more sense, given the language of the statute."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,359.63,361.365,"No coverage, Your Honor, and I think that's--"
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.365,368.836,"I think that's quite difficult to square with the ""as a result"" language, because this is a result of the operation."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,375.34,383.695,"--No, I disagree, Your Honor, respectfully, and I think your way of looking at that hypothetical doesn't give sufficient import to the phrase ""conducted on the shelf""."
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,418.434,429.409,"Well the government -- the government and the Ninth Circuit take care of that by saying that the person has to have -- the injured employee has to have spent substantial amount of time on the -- on the offshore operations, so you could add that."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,429.409,439.782,"Well, you can't add that, Your Honor, because if there's one thing that is absolutely clear about this statute it's that it doesn't include a status test that looks for the predominant place you spend your time."
2011.10-507,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,440.717,445.852,"I thought your brief, your reply brief, said you -- you superimpose a status test."
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.977,457.56,I agree.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,459.428,459.928,--Well--
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,459.928,461.428,--in your -- in your reply brief.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,461.428,461.963,--Sure.
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,497.969,505.39,"Would you call status -- if the test is where you spend a substantial amount of time working, is that what you call status?"
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,505.39,507.409,"--That's their status test, exactly."
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,507.409,508.825,You -- but you call that status?
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,508.825,514.313,"I call that their pure status test, which they themselves cite to Chandris, which is a Jones Act case."
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,673.383,673.783,--Sorry.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,679.804,694.38,"--I don't -- with respect, Justice Sotomayor, I think you get that without OCSLA, which is to say I think that there is a remedy under the Longshore Act directly under the adjacent waters because the adjacent waters are navigable waters."
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,694.38,696.599,"I see, so you are saying you don't even -- you're not going--"
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,696.599,706.437,"You don't need those, and that just underscores that Congress in the statute is really dealing with a very particular problem with the shelf and the artificial islands and platforms attached to them."
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,706.437,708.389,--How do you get to the water above the shelf?
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,708.389,711.758,"Same way, Your Honor, which is saying they are navigable waters."
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,711.758,713.127,Instead of saying they are part of the shelf?
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,713.127,714.193,"Exactly, and they're not."
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,717.728,729.703,I think the issue that Justice Kennedy was alluding to was the example the Ninth Circuit used: A pitcher on the mound throws a baseball and hits the batter.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,746.478,747.414,--I'm--
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,747.414,754.668,And that's the part of your -- of your definition that gives no credence to that possibility.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,754.668,755.168,--Well--
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,755.168,762.007,You may be arguing that as a factual matter what this man was doing on land was not a substantial nexus.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,770.78,774.148,"--And if I could take that, there's a couple of pieces to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,813.503,816.724,"Well, you're not -- you don't want a but-for test."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,816.724,817.557,--Certainly not.
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,817.557,817.974,All right.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,820.093,826.247,I could live with a proximate cause test as long as it is a proximate cause test that is tailored to the statute.
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,852.314,853.614,Does this meet your definition of causation now?
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,853.614,854.48,What's that?
2011.10-507,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,854.48,856.516,This is a new version of proximate cause.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,856.516,868.157,"Well, you know, it's funny because this Court has on more than one occasion sort of remarked that ""proximate cause"" itself is a weird formulation because ""proximate"" sounds like it has a location aspect to it."
2011.10-507,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.882,894.724,"Mr. Clement, I don't really understand proximate cause as applied to a -- a statute that provides for automatic liability rather than liability for negligence."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,927.629,930.48,"Well, Justice Scalia, I would say two things."
2011.10-507,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,975.576,995.173,"Mr. Clement, if your position is right then we have a worker who most of the time is doing work on a platform and he will be covered or not depending on whether the injury occurred on the shelf or on the land."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1034.732,1037.167,"--Well, two responses, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1066.936,1073.44,That brings me -- I am looking at petition appendix 96 -- 903(a) that you referred us to.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1079.194,1080.896,"Yes, and it's the Longshore Act."
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.896,1093.187,"But since Congress didn't follow this model in the -- in subsection (b) that we are looking for and used ""as a result"", why doesn't that show that Congress meant something different?"
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1095.372,1096.122,"Well, my argument--"
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1096.122,1099.407,"I don't see, in other words, how 903 doesn't hurt you more than it helps you."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1099.407,1103.728,--It helps me because 1333(b) doesn't apply a different model.
2011.10-507,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1112.167,1117.369,"But it doesn't; it talks about where the injury occurs, and that's not what -- and that's not what (b) says."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1117.369,1123.54,"--No, it talks about that as part of extending the Longshore Workers' Act to the shelf."
2011.10-507,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.994,1199.373,"Mr. Clement, may I go back to -- you referred to Herb's Welding, but that was a case -- it was a claim under the Longshore Act, not an OCSLA claim, and the Court said it was expressing no opinion on whether 1332(b) covered the injury."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1199.373,1200.475,That's right.
2011.10-507,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1280.677,1291.133,"But Congress also did not adopt the proposal, the specific proposal to confine OCSLA to situations in which State workers' compensation was unavailable."
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1291.133,1299.972,"And I think that's -- they rejected that with good reason, Your Honor, because you have to remember that at this point they are living with the experience that this Court ultimately resolved."
2011.10-507,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.956,1340.816,"What reason did they have to use the -- the terminology ""as a result of"" instead of simply saying that this act applies only with regard to injuries on the platform, which is what other statutes did say?"
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1349.487,1352.023,"Justice Scalia, I don't know which other statutes you are talking about."
2011.10-507,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1366.264,1370.818,"But, Mr. Clement, you are asking us to just ignore six words in this statute, right?"
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1403.622,1406.658,"--Justice Kagan, first of all, it's interesting."
2011.10-507,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1448.485,1450.52,This goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question.
2011.10-507,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1464.697,1466.814,"Justice Kagan, I would beg to differ."
2011.10-507,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1537.043,1538.411,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1544.815,1547.951,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-507,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1638.158,1638.958,Mr. Palmore--
2011.10-507,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1638.958,1647.097,"Well, but it's a little -- it's a little different when you are talking about a labor practice and an activity that results in an injury."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1661.44,1675.116,"--Well, I think that, Mr. Chief Justice that, I think there is a contrast between 1333(b) and 1333(c) in terms of the specificity with which Congress provided for where a particular event would happen."
2011.10-507,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1715.175,1735.322,"Suppose the facts of this case were changed a little bit so that the Respondent, instead of spending 98 percent of his time on an oil rig doing things that he did there, actually spent only 20 percent of his time there and he spent 80 percent of his time on land doing what he was supposed to be doing at the time of the accident."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1744.444,1747.213,"We don't think so, Your Honor."
2011.10-507,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1747.213,1758.77,"Then how does that -- I don't see how you get this result out of the statutory language, because the causal connection between the operations on the shelf and the accident are precisely the same in the two situations."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1768.726,1776.915,Because we think it's a mistake in the context of a workers' compensation scheme to look at this as kind of a snapshot in time.
2011.10-507,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.728,1798.895,The trouble with that is it's not what it says.
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1801.68,1802.799,And we think that--
2011.10-507,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.799,1807.668,"I don't -- you know, I would think he doesn't even have to be an employee, does he?"
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1807.668,1809.536,--He does have to be an employee.
2011.10-507,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1837.821,1847.876,"--Mr. Palmore, you are asking us to look at the relationship between the employment and the shelf activities, and the statute asks us to look at the relationship between the injury and the shelf activities."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1854.482,1862.319,--And the Ninth Circuit viewed -- viewed injury in the way that Your Honor and Justice Alito are suggesting.
2011.10-507,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1867.373,1870.675,"The back-up positions may be better than the primary positions in this case, you know?"
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1870.675,1876.146,"--I think the back-up positions really also differ with each other only in a matter of degree, not--"
2011.10-507,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.146,1879.015,What is the back-up position that is so much better here?
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1879.581,1882.049,"--Well, I don't -- to be clear, we don't think it's better."
2011.10-507,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1903.13,1905.38,"Well, the trouble is that I have no idea what that means."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1923.708,1932.03,"Well, that's the -- that would be an expansive but-for test of the kind that at least some language in the Third Circuit's opinion in Curtis would support."
2011.10-507,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1943.671,1945.54,So substantial nexus is just right?
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1945.54,1949.425,"--We think substantial, substantial nexus, substantial connection."
2011.10-507,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1958.598,1966.37,"Do you accept your adversary's position that whatever causal -- you have to, given your status test."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1974.226,1984.348,"--Well, I think I would submit that it is from the language, Justice Sotomayor, because we think that the language has to be understood in the context of workers' compensation."
2011.10-507,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2009.297,2024.742,"You're not -- I would have just thought you would have taken it out of (b) subdivision (2), the term ""employer"", almost the obverse, means an employer -- means an employer any of whose employees are employed in such operations."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2024.742,2026.175,"Thank you, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-507,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2038.217,2041.752,What if -- But what if that exposure is not pertinent to what they are doing?
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2060.546,2066.384,We think he is because that is a worker who is uniquely exposed to those hazards offshore and he shouldn't--
2011.10-507,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2066.384,2071.919,"Well, so he is -- he is injured by a hazard on the road to Reno."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2077.49,2088.463,"--Yes, Your Honor, because we think that -- and here the contrast with the underlying Longshore Act is important and Justice Kennedy's questions of Justice -- of Mr. Clement highlighted this."
2011.10-507,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.676,2148.752,"Yes, but Mr. Clement says that -- and we can argue about whether the language does it or not, but the system he comes up with he says creates a very sensible division."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2159.394,2162.596,"Yes, in some situations."
2011.10-507,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.596,2164.481,"Well, why does that make any sense?"
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2164.481,2170.367,Because the kind of certainty -- We think our test is actually much easier to administer and provides greater predictability in this sense.
2011.10-507,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.367,2173.403,Which one prevails when they both apply?
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2175.855,2187.746,"Well, there's -- Congress contemplated, expressly contemplated, that there would be overlapping coverage and adopted a provision in 903(e) of the Longshore Act to provide for offsetting payments when there is overlap."
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2189.813,2193.4,"I think the question is, is there any difference between the two."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2193.4,2197.685,"Well, in this case the Federal benefits were more generous than the State benefits."
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2197.685,2216.413,"Well, why wouldn't they have been -- I mean, as I understand it, if a person of a certain set -- it's the same set in both, virtually, the same set of people -- where they are injured on navigable waters or piers and docks and so forth, it's the Longshore Act."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2221.917,2222.836,Correct.
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2222.836,2223.236,Okay.
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2240.096,2240.881,Would not.
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.881,2241.264,No.
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2245.933,2246.785,Correct.
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.785,2247.635,Okay.
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2251.653,2267.698,"Because we thought that Congress intended this to function in the way that other workers' compensation schemes function, both at the time that OCSLA was adopted and today, which is that the coverage provides comprehensive benefits from the start of the work day to the end of the work day."
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.698,2267.965,Let me give you an example.
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2286.91,2287.779,"Under the Longshore Act, correct."
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.779,2289.212,"Yes, that's right."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2290.012,2290.479,Correct.
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.479,2297.385,"But if the same thing happens on the platform, under your theory he is covered."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2312.644,2321.083,"Because in that situation, Justice Breyer, the Longshore Act's strict situs-of-injury requirement is the exception, not the rule."
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.08,2351.435,"Your answer is basically there are many statutes like this, they all have some kind of OCSLA type requirement, it's the Longshore Act that was rather stingy, and we don't know why."
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2351.435,2352.804,"--No, we do know why."
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.804,2353.187,Why?
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2353.187,2354.421,It was stingy for historical reasons--
2011.10-507,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.421,2355.923,Because of the workmen's compensation?
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2355.923,2362.16,"--It was based on this Court's decision in Jensen, and there is a whole long and tortured history there, and that explains why Congress did that."
2011.10-507,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2371.516,2376.753,Would the worker who went to the factory be covered by State workmen's comp?
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2376.753,2393.179,"--Yes, just like the worker on a fixed platform on the outer Continental Shelf would also be covered by State workers' comp. Private Respondent cites the Bobbitt case from California that says California workers' comp doesn't have a -- location requirement--"
2011.10-507,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2393.179,2394.631,I'm sorry; I don't understand the answer.
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2395.714,2396.464,--Yes.
2011.10-507,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2396.464,2397.083,Oh.
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2397.083,2400.368,Overlap -- a certain degree of overlap is a fact of life in this area.
2011.10-507,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.87,2434.689,"When -- when you are covered by both the Longshore Act and State workmens' comp, can you provide under either one?"
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2434.689,2441.279,"You -- you might proceed under either one if you are covered by either one, but what is quite, Justice Scalia, is you can't collect--"
2011.10-507,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.279,2442.362,You can't get over--
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2442.362,2444.397,"--under either one, or if you do, you -- there are going to be contingent offsets."
2011.10-507,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.397,2446.197,--But you think you could proceed under the State law if you choose.
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2446.197,2447.031,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-507,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.031,2451.385,Do we -- do the courts give some deference to the director's position?
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2451.385,2453.337,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2011.10-507,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2453.337,2453.687,Please.
2011.10-507,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2453.687,2454.437,Yes.
2011.10-507,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2459.907,2461.274,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2472.548,2475.1,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.625,2514.625,I don't think that's an anomaly.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2531.103,2532.553,"Your question, Justice Scalia--"
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.553,2533.722,That doesn't seem to me like an anomaly at all.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2533.722,2535.991,"--Well, let me answer your question this way, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.991,2537.107,"How many floating platforms are there, anyway?"
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2537.107,2540.859,There are a number of floating platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.68,2545.513,And they're covered by the Jones Act?
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2545.513,2545.963,--Yes.
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.43,2547.33,They should be; they're vessels.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2547.33,2553.184,But the point is that they get a Jones Act remedy if they happen to be injured on land.
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.926,2571.164,You're -- you are not proposing to eliminate that anomaly?
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2571.164,2573.064,"No, what I'm saying is that the--"
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.064,2578.651,"You are saying wherever you are injured, so long as you are on a -- a platform you are -- I don't think so."
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2578.651,2588.876,"--If the work is substantially related and the causal connection goes to the employment relationship to the operations, the worker is covered under OCSLA."
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.876,2590.009,So you still have an anomaly.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2590.009,2590.576,There is--
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.576,2592.494,Sometimes it will be covered; sometimes it won't be.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2592.494,2606.301,--It is to be sure a more comfortable fit to the actual language of the statute than imposing and superimposing a situs-of-injury requirement which is nowhere to be found in section 1333(a).
2011.10-507,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2606.301,2630.286,"Is there any injury on land in the course of employment that would not be covered by OCSLA where we have a worker of this kind who spends 98 percent of his time on the Outer Continental Shelf -- the injury, however, is on land?"
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2641.658,2657.603,"Well, if the work is arising out of the course and scope of employment, which is the natural way that these workers' compensation regimes work, and it is related to the shelf operations, our submission is yes, he is covered under OCSLA."
2011.10-507,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2657.603,2672.213,"So then what you are really saying is -- it's not your test but maybe the government saying we look to see, is this person dominantly working on the outer continental shelf?"
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2672.213,2673.713,"That -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2700.697,2717.308,"So if you work only 20 percent of your time for this -- this drilling company on -- on the -- on the platform but it so happens that you are injured on the platform, you know, a bolt comes off and strikes you, you are not covered?"
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2717.308,2723.295,"Well, our submission would be he would be covered because he's directly injured as a result of the operations on the shelf."
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.945,2727.18,"Well, then -- then you are not applying the -- the employment test."
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2728.532,2734.453,"--Well, that person is going to be covered under our submission because it's a two-part inquiry."
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2748.78,2750.08,"Heads I win, tails you lose, right?"
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2764.289,2764.722,I would suggest that the incongruity--
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.722,2765.639,How do you get that out of this statute?
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2765.639,2783.351,"--It's even greater under their hypothetical with the helicopter worker, because they want to get the person who's riding in the helicopter out to the shelf covered under the Longshore Act, but that flies directly in the face of this Court's holding in Herb's Welding that when he is on the fixed platform, he doesn't get longshore benefits."
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2786.469,2787.171,Was it the Longshore Act?
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2791.207,2791.623,--No.
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2805.466,2806.282,"Well, I mean, both positions--"
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2806.282,2807.734,If they were in State territorial waters.
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2807.734,2811.87,"--Both positions, Mr. Frederick, are vulnerable to particular hypotheticals."
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2834.552,2843.074,"The way this Court handled that under in seaman context under Chandris was to look at the totality of the circumstances of the worker's employment, and that seems to be--"
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2843.074,2844.674,I have given you all the totality.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2853.263,2854.113,--He would be covered.
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2854.113,2854.579,Why?
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2854.579,2861.167,"Because he's the kind of person that Congress would want to provide coverage to under Federal worker -- mind -- remember, in--"
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2861.167,2863.719,How do you know it's the kind of person?
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2869.939,2871.955,--That is actually substantial work.
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2890.001,2891.251,30 percent is the line.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2891.251,2898.754,"--That's what the -- the government -- I have no brief to defend, Mr. Chief Justice, in terms of where that line is, because my client's husband--"
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2898.754,2905.343,"I know, but we would like to have a test that we apply to your situation, and it's nice to know, you know, maybe 30 percent I guess is as good as any."
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2905.343,2939.831,"--The point that Congress is trying to get at -- and these are platforms that were covered by State workers' compensation in 1953 -- was to extend the more generous Federal benefits to encourage an industry that was a nascent industry to develop the resources of the outer continental shelf, to provide uniformity, to provide benefits to the workers who were exposed to the perils that were out on the platform, so it makes sense, we submit, that when those workers who are subjected to those circumstances have the same Federal benefits."
2011.10-507,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2969.334,2988.43,"Suppose, Mr. Frederick, that we find that we can't find your status test in the language of the statute, and then what this statute seems to give us is instead a causal test, and that the cause is whether operations on the outer continental shelf caused the injury in question."
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,2995.334,3008.578,"The scrap metal that Mr. Valladolid was charged with moving at the time of his the death was very likely the same scrap metal that he personally had taken off the shelf, or someone in his position would have taken off the shelf."

2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3090.463,3091.148,I don't think so.
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.148,3091.632,Well--
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3091.632,3092.865,You have to be an employee.
2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.865,3096.718,--He would not be carrying the steel had it not been for the -- for the operations on the shelf.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3096.718,3097.985,It has to be an employee.

2011.10-507,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.607,3135.343,Well -- it's just the guy that drives the truck that takes the steel to the place where your client worked on it.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3135.343,3141.997,"Not covered, because that person is not directly substantially working on shelf operations--"
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3141.997,3144.366,Unless he spent 30 percent of his time on the shelf.
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3145.182,3146.249,--Yes.

2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3182.055,3182.857,--Correct.
2011.10-507,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3182.857,3187.793,--And that's a kind of a vague -- what is substantial is the problem we have here?
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3190.745,3193.697,That's correct.
2011.10-507,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3197.332,3199.601,"--Yes, so how have courts worked this out?"
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3204.636,3223.982,"--As I understand the case law, Justice Ginsburg, there are a range of factors that go into the nature of the sea workers' relationship to the vessel, and they go to -- they go to duration, they go to the performance of duties in the completion of the mission of the vessel and the like."
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3232.155,3235.607,"Obviously, it's a real mishmash, and maybe that's what we are -- we are stuck with."
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3242.361,3242.661,Correct.
2011.10-507,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3242.661,3249.165,Who decides -- maybe the insurance company will underwrite how many people spend what percentage of time where?
2011.10-507,2,20869,david_c_frederick,,3249.165,3276.434,"And as a practical matter, Mr. Chief Justice -- and I don't represent the insurance company here -- but the way I understand that it works is that on an annual or on a periodic basis, the company and the insurance company get together through some auditing process where there is verification of the workers who are OCSLA workers and thereby get the longshore benefits, and the company and the insurance company work that out to determine either numbers or particular individuals or the like."
