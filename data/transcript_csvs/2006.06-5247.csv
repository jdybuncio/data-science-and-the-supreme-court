2006.06-5247,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.682,"We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler."
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,8.918,11.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-5247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,85.118,86.729,I suppose he could have come here on direct.
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,86.729,103.457,"--He could have, Your Honor, however, he didn't have the right to counsel to come following his appeal to the State appellate court, and then after the denial of his petition, it would be a discretionary review in the California Supreme Court, he no longer had the right to counsel."
2006.06-5247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.6,164.836,"Well, if we're talking about what... where is the logic in the result that I believe you're position produces, which is that a prisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness grounds, because the State court finds it's harmless, obtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the error actually prejudiced him."
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,202.12,207.056,"--Justice Scalia, that's the point raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief here."
2006.06-5247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,233.261,245.306,"Let's assume another violation, the court erroneously determines... erroneously... that there was no constitutional violation at all."
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,260.909,268.874,"--I don't know that necessarily there has to be one standard of review for the other... for one or the other, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.19,303.016,You could say the same thing when the State court has erroneously determined that there was no violation.
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,314.23,315.104,Well--
2006.06-5247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.104,320.024,I thought the State court didn't find that there was error.
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,326.225,327.348,--That's correct.
2006.06-5247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.348,333.155,It wasn't until we got into the Federal court that there was an error determined.
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,342.67,343.777,That's correct.
2006.06-5247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.197,392.477,And it is that determination that you are objecting to here.
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,395.144,396.162,"I am, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.187,412.248,"But for the former, you are perfectly content with our applying Kotteakos."
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,418.48,429.57,"--Well, first of all, this case, since it has now been determined in the Federal courts that there was an underlying constitutional violation, does not present that question."
2006.06-5247,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,463.352,477.55,"As I read the Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on harmlessness is based on the structural consideration that your under collateral review at that point, rather than under direct review."
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,486.39,498.712,"Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, collateral review, as this Court pointed out in Brecht, can result in a more deferential standard of harmless error inquiry."
2006.06-5247,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,519.485,534.996,"Well, I guess that's where maybe we... is the subject of debate, whether the central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review, and that calls for a different standard, or whether the central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken, and therefore, that calls for a different standard."
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,537.933,543.646,--I agree that it could be... it is a debatable point.
2006.06-5247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.125,566.388,"The dissenters certainly thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in Brecht."
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,574.744,576.479,"That's true, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-5247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.479,579.053,"In other words, never approached the harmlessness thing."
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,580.367,586.069,The dissenters thought that the import of Brecht was that it was going to apply across-the-board in Federal habeas--
2006.06-5247,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,586.069,589.661,And I don't think the majority said the contrary.
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,672.871,692.755,"--Well, I suppose, Your Honor, because of the fact that the State appellate court didn't simply state, we find no error, and leave it at that, but rather, the State appellate court also raised the point that, in a footnote, in a truncated manner, that there is no possible--"
2006.06-5247,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.755,696.612,Was that as a reason for there not being error?
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,705.639,706.2,--Yes.
2006.06-5247,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.2,707.651,What is the footnote number?
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,707.651,708.93,It's footnote 17.
2006.06-5247,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,709.527,710.057,Okay.
2006.06-5247,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,711.446,713.524,Page what?
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,713.524,715.462,"It's 97 in the Joint Appendix,--"
2006.06-5247,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,715.462,716.351,Thank you.
2006.06-5247,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,716.351,717.225,Thank you.
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,782.479,784.946,"--I agree with you, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.824,869.258,"If I could come back to, may I ask this question: Is part of your argument that even under the Brecht standard it was not harmless?"
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,869.258,869.929,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.929,878.223,"This is a case, am I correct, where there were two, two hung juries and then a five-week deliberation in this case?"
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,886.985,887.984,"Correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,887.984,890.074,Where is that in the question presented?
2006.06-5247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,890.074,896.542,"It says that if the Brecht standard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear the burden?"
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,899.292,908.585,"Well, the Respondent has essentially conceded that under O'Neal that they bear the risk of non-persuasion."
2006.06-5247,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,908.585,919.644,"But O'Neal, I thought O'Neal just says that this word ""burden of proof"" is out of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading the record."
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,919.644,931.248,"I think that that was what the holding in the majority opinion was, but I think, as Justice Thomas pointed out in his dissenting opinion, the effect of that is to allocate the risk of non-persuasion to the State."
2006.06-5247,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,971.34,977.087,You're now arguing that under Brecht this should not have been harmless; is that the point you're making?
2006.06-5247,0,43601,victor_s_haltom,,977.087,977.758,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,1650.185,1653.402,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-5247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.62,1746.862,"You said in your brief that the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's going to get Chapman review someplace, then he should have sought cert... direct review from the State court's conviction."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,1748.364,1748.972,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1748.972,1770.68,"But realistically, the likelihood that such a petition would be successful, passing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would grant cert on such a question is very slim."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,1770.68,1783.022,"I agree, the likelihood of the cert grant in that circumstance is slim but it does not change the fact that once you come to court under 2254, you are asking for collateral review."
2006.06-5247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.534,1801.763,"I suppose you could say that of all the questions that go into habeas under 2254, that they could have brought up directly but the chances are their being taken here are negligible?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,1801.763,1803.888,"I, I agree with that, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1803.888,1816.071,"Counsel, if the State court had conducted a Chapman review, erroneously, how would that be reviewed under Federal habeas?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,1820.021,1822.458,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1837.014,1840.59,"That seems awfully refined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,1852.258,1854.039,--I don't disagree.
2006.06-5247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.181,1882.884,Suppose we apply Brecht.
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,1945.795,1950.339,I think that the explanation is as follows.
2006.06-5247,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1997.76,2001.96,Why is it necessary for us to try to reconcile those two statements?
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2021.813,2025.03,We would not object to that.
2006.06-5247,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2038.414,2047.705,"Well, every time evidence is excluded on the grounds that it is cumulative, or is the equivalent of a 403 balancing in Federal Court, there's not a constitutional error under Chambers and related cases, is there?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2047.705,2048.878,Yes.
2006.06-5247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2058.701,2061.259,May I go just back to Justice Breyer's question for a second?
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2061.259,2061.871,Sure.
2006.06-5247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2061.871,2068.072,"And I mean, I think your answer to Justice Breyer was a very good answer as a, as sort of a general statement."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2127.419,2129.793,"No, I would disagree with that."
2006.06-5247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.522,2142.287,"But two or three of those did it on an improper ground, that you agree with now, don't you?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2142.287,2143.944,"--No, I don't agree with that."
2006.06-5247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.944,2144.693,For purposes of argument.
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2144.693,2146.019,For purposes of argument I do.
2006.06-5247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2153.159,2155.69,It was two to one in the Ninth Circuit.
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2155.69,2156.657,--This is true.
2006.06-5247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2156.657,2167.041,"Judge Rawlinson I think said that using the Brecht standard, that there was actual prejudice."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2167.041,2169.182,"Yes, she did."
2006.06-5247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.839,2180.319,Isn't this the... I may have it wrong... but isn't this the case in which the witness was unique not cumulative because she was the only one who was completely disinterested.
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2180.319,2182.335,No.
2006.06-5247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2232.908,2234.328,"Five, five weeks?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2234.328,2240.793,"--Five weeks, 25 court days, 24 of which were taken up with read back."
2006.06-5247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2246.635,2250.557,Do you know of any other case in which the jury deliberated for five weeks?
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2250.557,2252.76,--I haven't attempted to find one.
2006.06-5247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2254.258,2260.24,"I'm sure there's an example somewhere, but I... I practiced law for over 40 years, and I never heard of it."
2006.06-5247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2260.24,2264.427,"At what point, how many weeks had gone by when they said they were hung?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2264.427,2270.425,"I believe that was... I keep, I've been switching back and forth between calendar days and court days."
2006.06-5247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.512,2284.042,So--
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2284.042,2284.76,And after--
2006.06-5247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2284.76,2285.602,--Go ahead.
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2285.602,2292.555,"--After they selected the new foreperson, they asked for 15 read backs, including the crucial evidence in the case."
2006.06-5247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2303.455,2307.092,Did they ask for a read back of Mrs. Maples' testimony?
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2307.092,2310.282,"Well, Mrs. Maples' testimony was not admitted."
2006.06-5247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.093,2311.842,"Oh, that's right."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2312.341,2320.479,"But they did not... significantly they did not ask for read back of the witnesses who testified similarly to, to Ms. Maples."
2006.06-5247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2328.13,2329.99,"Well, maybe, maybe you'd end up--"
2006.06-5247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.99,2333.052,"Well, maybe a critical witness was left out."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2335.08,2340.297,I would encourage the Court to carefully look at what Ms. Maples was going to say.
2006.06-5247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.504,2377.518,"But what she heard was that they were going to kill, this other person was going to kill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was the crime at issue."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2377.518,2379.939,"With respect, that's not what she heard."
2006.06-5247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2379.939,2380.563,What did she hear?
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2380.563,2385.308,What she heard was a statement that he had killed a man and a woman.
2006.06-5247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.819,2395.471,"Do you think... do you think, do you think I should do this?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2411.623,2412.247,Yes.
2006.06-5247,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2412.247,2418.166,"At the same time, I think what counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2442.78,2445.826,"Well, you don't do it very often."
2006.06-5247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2460.257,2469.191,"--The third party perpetrator that Maples was going to talk about according to the prosecution's theory, was Hurtz or Hearst?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2469.191,2469.409,Hurtz.
2006.06-5247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.799,2475.641,"And there... there was a link between Hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship between Hurtz and the victim?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2475.641,2477.373,That's right.
2006.06-5247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2477.373,2482.216,Was that established in other testimony or would that all have come out just only through Maples?
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2482.216,2488.011,"Actually, I'm thinking about my answer because I was thinking about Borelli."
2006.06-5247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2506.751,2510.94,"Otherwise, I mean, they couldn't have found it was cumulative if... if that had not been the case."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2510.94,2514.032,In order to... I need to correct the record on that as well.
2006.06-5247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2523.34,2527.837,"But... on appellate review in California, they found it cumulative, didn't they?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2527.837,2533.49,"--The alternative prejudice holding, the footnote 17, they said it would have been cumulative."
2006.06-5247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2533.49,2533.973,Right.
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2534.367,2534.804,Yes.
2006.06-5247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2534.804,2538.317,"And they... they couldn't have found that if there hadn't been some evidence on Hurtz, apart from Maples?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2538.317,2539.503,"Oh, that's right."
2006.06-5247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2549.407,2552.905,How did Hurtz's name enter into the trial?
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2552.905,2554.231,Well--
2006.06-5247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.231,2555.421,Why did anybody mention him?
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2555.421,2558.778,"--Well, for one thing, he was called to testify and asked if he killed these people."
2006.06-5247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2568.837,2575.208,"And if Maples' testimony had come in, I presume they could have cross-examined him on the basis of Maples' testimony?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2575.208,2579.349,"Well, he stated he never said he killed these people."
2006.06-5247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2587.359,2590.969,"Did he say he'd killed peoples otherwise, or at other times?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2592.295,2594.031,--He also denied doing that.
2006.06-5247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2594.031,2604.945,"Well, but then at that point in time, Maples, Maples' conviction... Maples' testimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation, becomes more relevant."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2604.945,2618.566,"I would disagree, simply because she says she didn't hear the conversation well enough to really give her testimony any true probative value in the case because she was in and out of the room."
2006.06-5247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2626.782,2629.391,That's classic going to the weight of the evidence.
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2632.125,2634.153,--Ordinarily I would agree with that.
2006.06-5247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.802,2661.017,"So we don't assume that he's committed a whole lot of killings, I don't suppose?"
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2661.017,2672.668,"Well, it's... he may have committed other killings, but if did not confess to committing these killings then there's no probative value to her testimony."
2006.06-5247,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2672.668,2678.728,Do you think the question of the application of Brecht is included within the questions presented?
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2678.728,2679.543,No.
2006.06-5247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2726.742,2737.299,"But on the other side, State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht."
2006.06-5247,1,40033,ross_c_moody,,2737.299,2741.472,I don't think we should assume that the State courts are going to do that.
2006.06-5247,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2774.519,2775.799,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2789.575,2815.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The distinction between collateral review and direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what Petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review for harmlessness in collateral review become the same standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct review got Chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it."
2006.06-5247,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.658,2862.154,May I ask two questions and then you can proceed.
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2872.932,2883.507,--If I can adopt Justice Breyer's language from O'Neal and say that this Court eschewed couching this discussion in terms of burden of persuasion.
2006.06-5247,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.597,2894.22,But you do agree if it were in equipoise the State would have the burden?
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2894.22,2896.017,"--The tie would go to the prisoner, yes."
2006.06-5247,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3015.264,3018.201,"I have the same problem Justice Souter does, in all candor."
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3033.896,3035.413,"Well, two answers."
2006.06-5247,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3048.597,3049.549,"No, but an equally divided call goes the other way."
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3049.549,3050.157,I'm sorry?
2006.06-5247,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3050.157,3054.512,"If it's not just a close call, but if it's equal, it goes the other way."
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3054.512,3056.451,"It is, and no one has thought this was equal."
2006.06-5247,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3072.412,3073.099,Neither am I.
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3076.253,3082.515,"--I guess I misunderstand your point, because I think when the court said there's no possible prejudice--"
2006.06-5247,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3082.515,3096.012,"I mean, I cannot accept the State... the conclusion that there was no possible prejudice, on the premises that Justice Stevens a moment ago and I a moment before sort of put out."
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3100.445,3112.69,"--Well, again, even if the Court thinks there may have been some chance, may have been... you know... relevant testimony... this Court can well disagree and can conclude that this was abuse of discretion."
2006.06-5247,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3125.546,3131.7,I thought the AEDPA question was out of it because that hasn't been... there was no cross-appeal on that question.
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3154.036,3160.922,"--Again, the Respondents in this case have not conceded constitutional error, and in their brief they repeat that."
2006.06-5247,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3164.046,3165.247,It's not raised here.
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3167.217,3171.744,"--Well, a Respondent is entitled to defend on any ground supported by the record."
2006.06-5247,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3206.044,3207.81,"That's because there were many, many issues raised."
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3207.81,3211.932,"There's many issues, but also it was being careful and it was being very methodical."
2006.06-5247,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3223.459,3227.831,"I suppose if we're going to apply the Brecht standard ourselves, we would have to do the same thing."
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3227.831,3229.347,--I think that's what this Court has said.
2006.06-5247,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.583,3257.287,"You will concede it was a close case, won't you?"
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3257.287,3260.926,"I will concede it was, I will concede it was a difficult case."
2006.06-5247,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.926,3264.205,If you take five weeks it's pretty clearly a close case.
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3264.205,3264.797,That's right.
2006.06-5247,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3273.322,3280.352,"There's no evidence or inference that it was close on the alternative murderer theory, which is the only thing that Maples' testimony goes to."
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3280.352,3280.914,--That's exactly right.
2006.06-5247,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3288.985,3291.953,It has to be close on an alternative murderer.
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3299.53,3310.382,"No, but as to who did it and whether Hurtz did it or whether... remember, what the defense is trying to show is not who did it; it's that this person didn't do it, and whether it was them or someone else is what we don't know."
2006.06-5247,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3357.695,3361.676,"Yes, but we don't know what they would have done if they had this evidence that was excluded."
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3362.628,3365.283,--One never knows that in habeas corpus.
2006.06-5247,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3374.81,3394.724,But the reason they may have been doing that is that they may very well have thought that the evidence indicating third party guilt was close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to know was whether the evidence going specifically to this defendant was strong enough to overcome it.
2006.06-5247,2,38150,patricia_a_millett,,3394.724,3396.085,May I answer?
2006.06-5247,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3415.326,3416.496,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-5247,3,43601,victor_s_haltom,,3419.401,3420.278,Thank you.
2006.06-5247,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3421.167,3428.384,"Mr. Haltom, before you go drifting, counsel, into the evidentiary questions in the case, I have one question."
2006.06-5247,3,43601,victor_s_haltom,,3449.344,3454.574,--I think that possibly the foundation with Hurtz there could be increased.
2006.06-5247,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3457.838,3459.465,"Oh, you mean, oh, you mean more?"
2006.06-5247,3,43601,victor_s_haltom,,3464.276,3467.774,"Well, I was just thinking that his presence there would be relevant."
2006.06-5247,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3490.407,3498.042,"But there were all kinds of infirmities in that truck driver's testimony, including the time, the timing of the murder."
2006.06-5247,3,43601,victor_s_haltom,,3498.042,3500.245,"--There were infirmities in his testimony, Your Honor."
2006.06-5247,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3519.657,3522.406,"That was all presented to the jury, right?"
2006.06-5247,3,43601,victor_s_haltom,,3522.406,3523.595,--That was all presented to the jury.
2006.06-5247,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3550.771,3560.859,"Well, how strong is this witness, who didn't even know if it was a serious conversation, didn't hear the beginning of it, and didn't... couldn't tell whether he was talking about something that happened 10 years before or 2 days before?"
2006.06-5247,3,43601,victor_s_haltom,,3560.859,3563.951,"Mr. Chief Justice, she was extremely strong."
2006.06-5247,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3599.23,3600.884,"Thank you, counsel."
