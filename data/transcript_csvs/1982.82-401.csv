1982.82-401,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.699,We'll hear arguments next in Rice against Rehner.
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,102.753,103.018,Thank you.
1982.82-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.583,295.222,"May I clarify one thing, Mr. Meth, at the outset."
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,304.327,305.045,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.045,306.593,"And, why is that?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,306.593,315.136,"Public Law 280, as we read it, is a criminal jurisdictional type of statute."
1982.82-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.806,322.256,"And, also some forms of civil jurisdiction, right?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,322.256,324.787,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.726,331.331,"Then, it is your position that it would not encompass liquor licensing?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,331.331,349.374,"--The criminal and civil jurisdiction which California has under Public Law 280 may come into play somewhere further down the line if Respondent is required to obtain a license and then doesn't act, which is both punishable under the licensing system and the criminal system."
1982.82-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.16,381.841,"Well, in any event, Public Law 280 is applicable in the state of California?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,381.841,382.547,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,384.403,387.886,"It is not just limited to criminal jurisdiction, is it?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,387.886,406.1,"No, civil jurisdiction, as this Court construed Public Law 280 in Bryan that it relates to criminal and civil, but civil jurisdiction was limited by the Court to causes of action cases where a court's services were required, and it excluded--"
1982.82-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.1,413.517,"That was because of the Bryan interpretation that you opted to drop any reliance on 280, is that right?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,413.517,414.235,--That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,547.371,555.881,"May I ask you then, what is California's view about... Assume you prevail, how will you enforce your victory?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,555.881,561.913,California's liquor licensing laws are enforced administratively.
1982.82-401,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,569.688,575.249,"I understand, but supposing your opponent decides just to start selling liquor."
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,576.684,582.666,--The sale of liquor without a license in California is a crime.
1982.82-401,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.666,583.621,I understand.
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,583.621,592.336,I would think that the local district attorney The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control has no criminal--
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,592.336,595.975,"That only applies to California territorial land, doesn't it?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,595.975,598.522,--Pardon me?
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,598.522,603.52,"Well, is the Indian reservation part of the territorial land of California?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,603.52,604.878,"Yes it is, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.878,608.781,News to me.
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,628.899,632.349,There are two ways that California enforces its liquor laws.
1982.82-401,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,669.305,671.333,"You mean the federal attorney, or the California attorney?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,671.333,674.819,--California attorney under Public Law 280.
1982.82-401,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.819,685.001,"Are you... Oh, I see, under Public Law 280 you would enforce even the jurisdiction that is left under the Court of Appeals holding criminally in the state courts?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,685.001,685.94,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,685.94,689.329,It would also be a federal crime?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,689.329,690.655,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,690.655,699.105,You also enforce the laws about obscene dancing in a liquor place on an Indian reservation?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,699.105,706.619,"Off the reservation, those penalties or those prohibitions are contained in the Department's regulations."
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,727.579,729.653,"Without that, you could."
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,731.217,733.121,--The only way that--
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,733.121,744.554,That you could enforce on an Indian reservation the regulation of the California liquor board that you cannot have obscene dancing in a place that sells liquor--
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,744.554,745.072,--That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,746.024,747.147,"--And, you can enforce that?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,747.147,748.617,"--Only administratively, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,776.291,777.496,I did not mention federal.
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,778.62,780.414,It is not a state crime either.
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,781.478,783.023,Obscene dancing--
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,783.023,784.04,--Those are contained--
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,784.04,786.318,--I thought a case came up here from California--
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,786.318,787.725,--California versus LaRue--
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,787.725,788.334,--I thought so.
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,788.334,789.492,--in 1972.
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,790.584,792.362,"And, we upheld it, didn't we?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,792.362,793.926,--The Department's regulations--
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,793.926,795.599,"That was a state rule, not federal."
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,795.599,799.315,--But it was a state regulatory rule--
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,799.315,806.42,All I am saying is the courts will enforce that rule on an Indian reservation.
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,806.42,811.777,--If the Court gives the Department the authority to require licensing.
1982.82-401,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1127.166,1133.554,Can non-Indians purchase liquor at these establishments?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1133.554,1134.615,"Yes, they can, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1191.387,1206.319,"Mr. Meth, wasn't the principle reason that the Court of Appeals found against you, its conclusion that 1161 was not an express grant of legislative jurisdiction to the states to regulate liquor sales on reservations?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1206.319,1208.46,That is eventually what the Court said.
1982.82-401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1208.46,1220.424,"So that any observations it might have had or might have had in the back of its mind about the importance of a California liquor license I would think would probably be secondary to that conclusion, don't you?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1220.424,1230.484,The Court analyzed... I am not sure how the Court analyzed the statute.
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1366.425,1371.233,Would you think that the Department would know what was going on in an Indian reservation?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1371.233,1374.575,"--I do not see why not, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1374.575,1376.262,"Well, where is the Department?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1379.183,1382.042,The Department maintains offices throughout California.
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1382.042,1383.976,Does it have one on the Indian reservation?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1385.212,1386.288,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1386.288,1387.914,"So, how would they know?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1387.914,1391.506,"The Department has investigators, and the Department's investigators--"
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1391.506,1392.286,Indians?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1395.8,1399.785,--There is nothing in the statutes which would prohibit an Indian from being an investigator.
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1399.785,1402.191,"My question was, do they have any Indians?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1402.191,1404.862,I do not know if any of the employees are Indians--
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1404.862,1406.0,"You know they don't, don't you?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1406.0,1406.609,--Pardon me?
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1406.609,1409.062,Don't you know that they don't have any?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1409.062,1410.47,"I do not know that, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1418.37,1422.666,"If you prohibit them, you might be in trouble with somebody else."
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1422.666,1424.367,"That is certainly correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1434.568,1439.112,"Well, for example, do you have a rule in California that says you cannot have one near a church?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1439.112,1440.426,--That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1440.426,1442.847,How many churches do you have on the reservations?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1442.847,1447.733,"Your Honor, there are 75 to 80 reservations in the state of California."
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1450.904,1452.327,"I am sure you don't, and I doubt anybody else does."
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1456.044,1463.557,An investigator can drive up to a reservation and determine if the proposed license is to be--
1982.82-401,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1463.557,1465.975,And decide what is best for the Indians?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1465.975,1470.022,"--For the people of the state of California, not just the Indians."
1982.82-401,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.022,1474.691,"You indicated earlier these stores would sell to non-Indians, I assume."
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1474.691,1476.051,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.051,1478.438,"And there are some checkerboard reservations, aren't there?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1478.438,1482.36,"That is correct, Agua Caliente being a prime example."
1982.82-401,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.36,1490.106,"Well, they are getting their liquor from the same Oklahoma place that the California wholesalers wanted to get it from in that Oklahoma connection case, aren't they?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1490.106,1495.027,I do not know where the Agua Calientes are getting their liquor.
1982.82-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1495.027,1505.601,"California has amended its laws, I take it, to make it possible for wholesalers to sell to unlicensed establishments on the reservation?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1505.601,1506.568,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1515.892,1525.139,"But, California has kept on the books, at least, its requirements that these establishments be licensed so you assert it is not moot?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1525.139,1526.312,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1526.312,1534.26,Does California regulate the price of liquor sold in its liquor stores?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1534.26,1536.151,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1536.151,1540.351,"It does regulate the hours during which they may be sold, I suppose?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1540.351,1541.04,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1543.743,1544.757,Yes.
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1544.757,1567.14,"--And, to just follow that up for a moment, it does not seem to me that it makes much sense to draw a distinction between the hours of operation in which Respondent and the United States seem to say are ones which California may regulate and the location of a liquor store or a bar."
1982.82-401,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.215,1583.833,Do you think they concede that you can regulate it or do they just concede that the store owner must abide by California law?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1583.833,1587.616,"No, they are saying that it is a federal offense--"
1982.82-401,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.616,1592.534,"That is right, but they do not say that California can do anything about it--"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1592.534,1594.549,"--Not in the licensing scheme, that is correct."
1982.82-401,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1594.549,1595.86,"--Well, or any other way?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1595.86,1597.907,"Well, the--"
1982.82-401,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.907,1599.218,They do not concede that?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1599.218,1601.749,--They are conceding that under 1161--
1982.82-401,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.749,1603.156,It would be a federal crime.
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1603.156,1603.952,--A federal crime.
1982.82-401,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.952,1609.98,They do not concede that California can do anything at all about it if the store owner was selling to minors?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1609.98,1611.669,That is correct.
1982.82-401,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1631.61,1635.205,May I ask you one other question before you sit down?
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1635.205,1636.001,--Certainly.
1982.82-401,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1636.001,1642.202,"Am I correct in my impression, the 21st Amendment aspect of the case was not argued below?"
1982.82-401,0,16528,alan_s_meth,,1642.202,1646.888,It was not argued by California in the District Court.
1982.82-401,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1676.221,1682.156,Mr. Quesenberry.
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,1682.156,1684.558,"Thank you, Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1729.418,1735.618,"Mr. Quesenberry, do you basically agree with the Court of Appeals construction of that relevant part of that statute?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,1735.618,1738.414,"Yes, we do, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.045,1850.416,"Mr. Quesenberry, what is the effect, in your view, of the in conformity language insofar as it talks about conformity with the laws of the state in which such act or transaction occurs?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,1850.416,1862.021,Our position is that that language deals with... that that language applies state law to the sale or use of alcohol.
1982.82-401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.517,1868.938,"Well, how was that state law to be enforced?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,1868.938,1878.871,--That state law is to be enforced through the United States Attorney or through some type of action brought by the tribe.
1982.82-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1915.498,1934.879,"But only criminal jurisdiction... You would have to go through the processes of trying to get criminal prosecutions as opposed to some kind of suspension of the license or other disciplinary action as an administrative matter, in your view, and under the view of the CA 9?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,1934.879,1941.942,--There is an additional mechanism here and that is the Federal Indian Traders Laws.
1982.82-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1948.312,1956.151,"Well, provided the state authorities could convince the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs to take some kind of action?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,1956.151,1960.885,"--In that particular situation, yes."
1982.82-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1960.885,1963.946,And that may be quite a difficult task.
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,1973.536,1979.143,"Yes, it was initially designed just to apply to a single state."
1982.82-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1979.143,1995.684,"Right, and later in the process of the congressional hearings it was expanded to encompass other states as well and to remove the disabilities that the federal law had imposed on the use and possession of alcohol on reservations?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,1995.684,1996.76,That is correct.
1982.82-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1996.76,2012.959,"And, during the course of the legislative history there was some indication, at least, by, I think, then Representative John Rhodes and maybe others, it was their understanding that state laws would then apply in the liquor area, right?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2012.959,2017.05,"Yes, the idea of state laws applying."
1982.82-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2017.05,2044.615,"And, the thing that concerns me a little bit about the history, which is far from clear, of course, is that at least in Arizona where all of this emerged many of the reservations are right there in urban areas, in Scottsdale, in the heart of Scottsdale, all along the Colorado River where there are now casinos developing and quite a population area."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2053.534,2063.5,I cannot really respond to that because Congress was very unclear in articulating its overall intent.
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.397,2119.317,"If you say... If you concede what you do that the Indian trader selling liquor would have to comply with the state laws except for licensing, hours and that sort of thing, why couldn't the state, although it would not have any, under your theory, would not have any licensing leverage, why couldn't it go to a state court and enjoin a persistent course of conduct in violation of state law and not just rely on the United States Attorney who would probably tell him to go piddle his papers?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2119.317,2124.66,"If the state... If there is a violation of the state criminal law, particularly--"
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.66,2129.987,"Well, there is a statute that says nobody can sell to minors."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2129.987,2133.531,--That is a state criminal statute.
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.997,2138.292,"Whether it says criminal or not, it is a state law."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2143.997,2150.681,Are we referring here to a non-Indian person or an Indian person?
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.681,2167.847,"I am referring to anybody... The state comes in and alleges in court that this Indian trader, this trader is consistently selling to minors, and Indians, non-Indians, and he openly announces that he is not obeying the state law about minors."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2169.875,2174.81,"Oh, I think, clearly as far as a non-Indian violating they would have jurisdiction--"
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.81,2175.98,What do you mean a non-Indian?
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2176.874,2180.169,"--As far as an Indian, I think that there is a question there."
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.169,2180.777,Why?
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2180.777,2186.915,Becase 1161 was initially part of the body of legislation which was Public Law 280--
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.915,2196.24,"You concede, though, that whether the seller is an Indian or a non-Indian that he must abide by state law except for licensing."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2196.24,2196.692,--Right.
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.378,2202.408,"Exactly, and let's assume that it is true."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2215.857,2219.309,--I cannot answer why or why not.
1982.82-401,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2267.869,2273.302,Didn't we say that you could not enforce a state liquor law on an Army base?
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2274.802,2277.38,"Yes, you did, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2279.564,2281.455,Why didn't you bring it up a minute ago?
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2281.455,2294.997,"Well, the cases that this Court has decided have said that you cannot allow a state to regulate on military reservations."
1982.82-401,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2300.18,2308.693,I frankly don't see where a state gets a right to regulate the liquor drinking on a reservation by Indians.
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2308.693,2310.35,--We are not conceding that.
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.579,2333.062,"But you do concede, if I understand you correctly, that the Indians must obey those state standards that you agree are applicable within the reservation?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2333.062,2334.528,We definitely--
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.528,2338.852,"There are some state standards, and you are not concerned in this case about how they enforce them."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2342.712,2344.147,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.147,2356.473,"What about state standards that are merely implementations of a licensing requirement, such as those things that they say if you do A, B, and C, then your license may be revoked, but there is no criminal state sanctions."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2359.11,2360.954,They would not be binding.
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.992,2394.879,"And that would include, for example, method of operation, for example, the problem Justice Marshall brought up about the obscene dancing which is in one of their administrative regulations but is not a criminal offense."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2398.471,2400.452,If it was part of their administrative regulations--
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.452,2400.909,"Well, it is."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2400.909,2404.11,"--and tied to licensing, we would say that it is not applicable."
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2406.579,2413.403,So that your real position is there is no licensing requirement and no requirement that merely relates to licensing is enforceable within the state.
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2413.403,2414.62,--That is our position.
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.62,2424.367,"So a state statute that says no licensee selling liquor shall sell to minors, that would not be applicable to the Indians?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2424.367,2428.427,"No, that would be applicable."
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.207,2429.519,Why?
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2431.738,2435.563,"--That is governing the sale or use of liquor, Your Honor."
1982.82-401,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2453.665,2461.663,"How about a regulation that liquor may be sold only between the hours of 12 and 6, if that is a state regulation?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2461.663,2465.866,--That liquor can only be sold during the hours of 12 and 6?
1982.82-401,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2465.866,2467.629,"Yes, and may not be sold on Sunday."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2467.629,2472.66,Then that is... The Indian on the reservation is going to have to abide by that.
1982.82-401,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2475.034,2477.892,No food may be sold where liquor is sold.
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2477.892,2485.559,"--That is also, if that is a state standard, that is one that would be applicable."
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.559,2497.633,But what if those that Justice Brennan gave you were not in any state statute but were merely in regulations promulgated by the liquor authority saying that every licensee must do the following or his license will be revoked.
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2501.367,2510.8,I think in that situation you would have to just ask if that is a determination that is leading up to the ultimate grant of the license.
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2510.8,2517.984,"Well, assume it is, that the only source of state law is that if you do not follow these rules your license will be revoked."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2519.391,2520.187,I agree with you.
1982.82-401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2532.089,2536.838,"Well, does your distinction turn on the difference between a regulation and a statute?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2536.838,2540.647,--In this particular situation--
1982.82-401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2540.647,2542.207,What particular situation?
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2542.207,2564.544,"--In the situation presented by Justice Stevens that it would turn on that because the state standard in that particular hypothetical was tied to the administrative regulation, to its civil regulatory structure rather than imposed in the specific statute imposing a criminal penalty."
1982.82-401,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2564.544,2572.947,Do you agree that the Indian reservations are subject to the licensing provisions of California?
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2573.727,2574.87,"No, I do not."
1982.82-401,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2574.87,2576.648,"Well, it sounded like you did a minute ago."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2576.648,2581.054,"Well, I certainly did not mean to indicate that at all."
1982.82-401,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2582.723,2583.866,That is what I thought.
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2583.866,2585.098,--That is what this case is about.
1982.82-401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.938,2644.137,"But, they certainly did decide in 1161 to treat liquor transactions differently than cigarette transactions and that sort of thing, which really are not covered by a specific statute."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2644.137,2649.213,"--That is correct, and that was against the backdrop of total federal preemption of the area of liquor trade."
1982.82-401,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.831,2678.187,But Mazurie was basically an argument between a private individual and the federal government prosecuting as on the basis of an Indian regulation and argue unlawful delegation and that sort of thing.
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2681.825,2693.711,"No, I think they may have participated as a amicus, but there was no real conflict between the state and the tribe because there was a state license that was required by virtue of tribal ordinance, in fact, in that case."
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2720.777,2723.667,May I ask one other question about their trying to gain control?
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2746.284,2755.092,--I think that part of the answer to that is that Indian reservations are beginning to experience economic development.
1982.82-401,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.037,2780.799,Is it correct that prior to 1971 that there was no attempt to get any liquor license within an Indian reservation?
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2780.799,2786.921,I cannot really answer that.
1982.82-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2791.031,2804.118,"Mr. Quesenberry, why couldn't the state of California simply make selling liquor without a license a crime and punish them for a crime?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2804.118,2813.38,"Again, I would say that is a civil regulatory-type act."
1982.82-401,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2813.38,2816.144,"No, they make it a criminal offense."
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2816.144,2820.473,They could absolutely prohibit the sale of liquor.
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2836.324,2838.355,"Not under state law, you say?"
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2838.355,2844.259,--The position that I took before on that was as to criminal violations--
1982.82-401,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2844.259,2847.976,Under Justice O'Connor's example there is a state criminal statute.
1982.82-401,1,41908,stephen_v_quesenberry,,2855.958,2876.169,"--Our contention would be that they could not, that Public Law 280, that 1161 was pulled outside of Public Law 280 and was treated differently, that liquor has been treated differently historically by Congress and that the remedy is through the federal enforcement scheme."
1982.82-401,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2885.617,2893.534,Mr. Schwartz.
1982.82-401,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2893.534,2914.321,"Mr. Schwartz, before you commence, I wish you would try to clarify for me exactly what the federal government thinks that the state may regulate, and I am thinking primarily about matters such as Sunday operation, hours of operation, sales to minors, location of stores."
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2918.4,2923.914,"Mr. Justice Powell, I think it may, but perhaps we better be crystal clear about our terms here."
1982.82-401,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2926.118,2932.272,"Well, determine whether they can operate on Sunday or not, when they must close, et cetera."
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2932.272,2939.236,"State laws on that subject do determine the terms, in our view, as to which--"
1982.82-401,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2939.236,2941.252,"But, only the federal government can enforce them?"
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2941.252,2962.867,"--Well, as we understand it, we would suggest that certain state laws which do not have any licensing related terms that say in the absolute, no person may sell alcohol to a minor, or give alcohol to a minor at certain hours are pure criminal statutes and are not the kind of essentially a subterfuge--"
1982.82-401,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2962.867,2968.552,But the state could revoke the license if these regulations were violated?
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2968.552,2981.811,--Our view is that the state lacks licensing authority so that a pure criminal violation would in California because it is a Public Law 280 state could actually be prosecuted by the state.
1982.82-401,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.811,2982.638,Under state law?
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2982.638,2983.39,Under state law.
1982.82-401,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.39,2984.919,"So, you disagree with your colleague on that?"
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2984.919,2986.919,I may to some extent.
1982.82-401,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2987.496,2990.26,"Well, to some extent he said that the state could not prosecute him."
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2990.26,2992.557,--It is the government's view--
1982.82-401,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.557,2994.944,You say that he may be prosecuted.
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2996.694,2998.429,"--If I may, Mr. Justice White--"
1982.82-401,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.429,2999.319,You may.
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2999.319,3008.409,--There are... Section 1161 and Public Law 280 were passed on the same day by Congress.
1982.82-401,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3058.529,3059.356,Well it is.
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3075.616,3079.223,I would think that it could.
1982.82-401,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3079.223,3080.331,By the state?
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3083.88,3096.717,"Pursuant to Public Law 280, Justice Marshall, because California is a Public Law 280 state and does have some jurisdiction which permeates the reservation, that is not resting on the statute which is the focus of this case."
1982.82-401,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3096.717,3098.812,But that statute could be enforced?
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3098.812,3100.434,That would be our understanding.
1982.82-401,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3100.434,3101.935,How far would you go?
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3105.526,3120.925,"Well, one line that we would clearly draw is that no proscription which is tied by the state in its own scheme to possession of a license may be enforced in that manner because that must be regarded as part of the regulatory scheme."
1982.82-401,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3120.925,3136.122,There is also a regulation by the state liquor board which says that nobody operating a licensee place shall sell to a minor.
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3138.965,3143.652,I am not sure I understand the question.
1982.82-401,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3143.652,3144.807,I do.
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3151.93,3153.428,Mr. Justice Marshall--
1982.82-401,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3153.428,3156.333,"Now, are they both good, or is one good?"
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3156.333,3159.83,--Let me try this and see if this will answer your question.
1982.82-401,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3213.921,3223.963,"Well, I just do not understand how you say that you can do one by merely putting the word criminal on it."
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3228.993,3236.69,"The answer is in part that Public Law 280, which stands outside this case, says that the state shall have certain criminal jurisdiction."
1982.82-401,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.775,3260.618,Does that mean then... You do take a different view.
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3273.568,3282.049,I think we would say not because the sanction is license revocation but the same regulation could be written a different way to accomplish the same effect.
1982.82-401,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.049,3284.891,"Do you find that in the text of 1161, that distinction?"
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3284.891,3288.998,"No, Justice Stevens... In an indirect sense we do."
1982.82-401,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.165,3316.486,"Well, but would you say that a person who runs a liquor establishment in which there is the kind of dancing I described that violates a state regulation, is that liquor being sold in conformity with state law within the meaning of 1161?"
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3320.985,3329.28,"--The answer is whether that plain rule is a rule that says, our licensees may not permit such conduct or whether, on the other hand--"
1982.82-401,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.28,3334.603,"No, the question is whether the person within the meaning of 1161 has been acting in conformity with state law."
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3336.12,3340.57,"--In conformity with state law, we understand to mean--"
1982.82-401,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.57,3342.695,Conforming with some state laws?
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3342.695,3357.672,"--If you will, Justice Stevens, but the point is that licensing is a very different kind of authority to exercise and that the state can accomplish the same objective through enacting general purpose standards."
1982.82-401,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3373.418,3380.367,"Well, the Court of Appeals did not really base its holding on the theory that it was a tax which the government had argued, did it?"
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3380.367,3385.57,I think it is fair to say that the Court of Appeals did not base its holding on it.
1982.82-401,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3449.307,3454.509,"But, suppose those criteria were made specific, such as you cannot get a license if you are convicted of a felony."
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3463.459,3471.41,"Yes, Justice Stevens, and I would draw an analogy here to the Court's decision in the Grendel's Den case."
1982.82-401,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3497.381,3504.08,"Do you find any support for this in either the language of the statute or the legislative history, this rather subtle distinction?"
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3504.08,3515.591,"Justice Stevens, if I may, a one sentence answer... The key thing in our view is that there is no support for the rather remarkably intrusive authority that the state does claim."
1982.82-401,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3522.093,3526.042,But it is equally intrusive as to its own citizens.
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3530.352,3541.628,"Yes, but I think it is common ground here that those who live on Indian reservations may not in general be treated the same way absent federal authority, and that is why we draw that distinction."
1982.82-401,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3541.628,3556.357,"Well, I suppose you could have argued just simply that the federal laws on Indian traders preempted in this area but not make the further distinction that you appear to be trying to make."
1982.82-401,2,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3556.357,3574.805,We think that... An argument that the state has no authority whatsoever because of the federal Indian trader statutes would be difficult to reconcile with the fact that Congress does appear to have recognized some role for the states in Section 1161.
1982.82-401,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3590.517,3597.591,"Mr. Meth, you have about four minutes remaining."
1982.82-401,3,16528,alan_s_meth,,3618.925,3624.266,"Yes, that is California's position, Your Honor, based on the wording of the statute and the legislative history."
1982.82-401,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.266,3627.157,"In other words, Indians are no different from any other person?"
1982.82-401,3,16528,alan_s_meth,,3627.157,3628.377,That is correct.
1982.82-401,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3797.37,3798.165,"Thank you, gentlemen."
