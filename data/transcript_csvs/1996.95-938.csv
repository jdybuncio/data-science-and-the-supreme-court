1996.95-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.04,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-938, Immigration & Naturalization Service v. Yueh-Shaio Yang."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,23.885,25.407,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,75.12,80.493,"I take it under the statute, the Attorney General would have been perfectly free to consider that fraud."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,80.493,84.427,"That's correct, Your Honor, and in fact the Seventh Circuit has expressly recognized that."
1996.95-938,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.836,108.152,"Well, you think, then, that the statute places no outer limits whatever on the discretion of the Attorney General?"
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,130.446,131.187,"Well, Your Honor--"
1996.95-938,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.187,135.1,"I mean, that condition exists in every one of these cases."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,135.1,136.62,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.87,167.771,But for the fraud.
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,167.771,168.242,--Yes.
1996.95-938,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.588,214.632,"Well, could take into account the circumstances of the particular fraudulent entry."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,214.632,215.363,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.363,220.165,"But not the mere fact that there had been a fraudulent entry, I take it?"
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,220.165,242.24,"I'd look to the... for example, the Court in the Rios-Pineda case, when the Court was looking at the Attorney General's authority whether or not to grant suspension of deportation there, I think characterizes looking to the nature and severity of the factor, so I would think that that would clearly be appropriate for the Attorney General to take into account."
1996.95-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.24,256.958,"Well, just because Congress has given the Attorney General the power to waive fraud, certainly you don't concede that the Attorney General couldn't say, I have the power but I decline to waive any kind of fraud."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,256.958,258.51,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,274.501,281.545,"The statute does circumscribe discretion in one respect, does it not, or perhaps not, because the sentence is difficult."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,310.823,312.265,If I under--
1996.95-938,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,312.265,315.377,--it's an interpretation of the discretion once exercised.
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,315.377,348.35,"--I think, if I understand your question correctly, Your Honor, it's clarifying some confusion that had existed under their previous provision, and it makes clear that if the Attorney General grants a waiver of deportation under this provision, that waiver of deportation waived the grounds of inadmissibility for the fraud and also for inadmissibility grounds that directly result from that, that being a fraudulent visa or fraudulent labor certification."
1996.95-938,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.35,354.732,"Would that be relevant in a later application for citizenship, or something like that?"
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,355.944,357.075,"Well, in fact--"
1996.95-938,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.075,361.907,Because it seems to me to just restate that a waiver's a waiver.
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,361.907,364.229,"--Well, Your Honor, I think I can give an example to explain it."
1996.95-938,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.264,416.595,May I--
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,422.87,423.401,No.
1996.95-938,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,438.401,446.057,"Well, it circumscribes the Attorney General to some extent in that it does control the extent of the waiver."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,446.057,448.177,"--The effect of it, yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.025,476.858,I have to confess I'm still a little puzzled about your answer to Justice O'Connor.
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,497.551,499.772,"No, I'm sorry, I misspoke if I--"
1996.95-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,499.772,502.664,"No matter how mild it is, the Attorney General has discretion."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,502.664,503.035,--That's--
1996.95-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,503.035,507.616,"Otherwise, it seems to me a person could commit a fraud and then claim a right to remain."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,507.616,518.615,"--That's right, and in fact, Your Honor, one of the ironies of the Ninth Circuit's ruling in this case is, it really gives the type of open-ended immunity to aliens who enter by fraud."
1996.95-938,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,533.825,545.022,"But are you saying that the Attorney General would be within her discretion to say, I will never exercise my discretion to waive entry fraud?"
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,545.022,552.196,We believe that if that were based on a reasonable exercise of her discretion--
1996.95-938,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.196,554.199,"No, but that begs the question."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,567.987,569.529,"--Yes, Your Honor, we believe it would be."
1996.95-938,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.488,591.763,"No, but my question suggested that that was her across-the-board policy for all cases in which the statute might be applied."
1996.95-938,0,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,607.944,611.107,--You mean waivers under 241(a)(1)(H)?
1996.95-938,1,27222,howard_hom,,1659.823,1661.132,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.733,1729.567,As a matter of... you say part of your argument to that effect is based on statutory construction.
1996.95-938,1,27222,howard_hom,,1731.958,1758.464,"Yes, it's subparagraph (ii) of 241(a)(1)(H), and the petitioner's brief at page 5a and 6a is the section of law, and in subparagraph (ii) on page 6a it states that the alien was in possession of an immigrant visa or equivalent document and was otherwise admissible, and that's the key phrase, otherwise admissible."
1996.95-938,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.464,1759.866,Well--
1996.95-938,1,27222,howard_hom,,1764.799,1768.272,Because the purpose of the waiver was to--
1996.95-938,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.272,1770.393,We're talking about statutory construction now.
1996.95-938,1,27222,howard_hom,,1770.393,1770.994,"--Oh, yes, sir."
1996.95-938,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3364.604,3366.204,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3376.692,3377.551,Let me just interrupt if I may.
1996.95-938,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3380.515,3381.365,"That's right, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3422.041,3427.526,"Some of those would also apply to the original fraud in obtaining entry in the first place, right?"
1996.95-938,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3427.526,3429.076,"--That's Your... correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3429.076,3429.486,So it doesn't prove anything.
1996.95-938,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3432.959,3436.111,But there's certainly factors that can be taken into account by the Attorney General.
1996.95-938,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3447.769,3456.275,"When the Attorney General forgets about this initial fraud as the policy is, he doesn't then prosecute it criminally, I assume."
1996.95-938,2,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,3465.68,3468.172,"I can't speak to that, Your Honor."
1996.95-938,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3508.669,3509.972,"Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann."
