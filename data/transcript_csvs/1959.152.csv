1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,332.958,333.411,"Yes, sir."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,334.683,339.99,You are now arguing as though we had nothing before us except the statute.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,339.99,340.657,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,367.411,367.636,What then --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,367.636,370.523,-- what the statute provides so you know what I'm talking about as I move along.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,370.523,372.005,That enlightened me.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,381.745,382.996,Will you -- will you forgive me then.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,383.817,385.532,You're the lawyer not I.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,385.532,386.149,Pardon me.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,386.149,388.409,I say you're the lawyer who is arguing this case and not I.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,389.998,405.897,"Well, all I want to say at this moment is that the statute in addition to requiring a person to answer before the governmental agency of a State also require an answer -- require the employees to answer questions propounded by Congressional Committee."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,412.784,441.836,"I -- do I gather from what you said that if California had to declare your judgment procedures, I assume it has under which you could have gone before the California Court, assuming you're outstanding there, to get declaration is for the constitutionality of the statute and they had to stay there, if I understand you, you would not be coming here finding any difficulty which the stating the statute in abstract."
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,441.836,442.383,"Please, I --"

1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,442.457,443.709,-- Your Honor understand me correctly --
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,443.709,444.093,All right.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,444.093,445.211,-- completely.
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,507.598,522.472,"And the difference between the statute and the Slochower statute, as I understand it, is that the Slochower statute in terms referred to the Fifth Amendment and this one doesn't on its face."
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,522.472,522.922,That's --
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,522.922,523.666,Is that substantial --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,523.666,525.021,That's substantially correct.
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,532.63,533.36,Correct.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,533.36,535.363,-- but Your Honors substantially correct.
1959.152,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,620.149,624.683,Would it be legally (Inaudible)
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,624.683,625.352,Yes.
1959.152,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,780.291,781.58,Who was the third that you --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,781.58,786.667,"Justice Clark -- I don't quite I say -- Justice Carter, Jesse Carter who is --"
1959.152,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,786.667,787.29,Carter.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,787.29,790.31,Carter who has passed -- no passed away.
1959.152,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,848.747,850.276,May I ask you right this?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,850.276,850.75,"Yes, sir."
1959.152,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,850.75,862.12,"At that hearing, was Mr. Nelson re-asked by his employer with the County three questions he had declined to answer before the Congressional Committee?"
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,862.12,872.908,"At that hearing, he was not re-asked the questions or any question pertaining to or in anyway in -- in -- connected with the question."

1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,874.849,875.112,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.152,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,875.112,888.546,Would you tap then a defense to this discharge proceeding if he had answered -- been asked and answered those questions at that place?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,888.546,889.234,"Oh, yes."
1959.152,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,898.135,921.844,"Well, I thought that the statute said he -- it wouldn't be a defense, really, that he must only explain why he answered as he did to the Congressional Committee and that in fact to answer fully to this Civil Service Commission the very questions he had refused to answer to the House Committee would not be a defense."
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,922.071,925.871,"Well, I think Your Honor is more right than I."
1959.152,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,933.284,937.387,Are you going in circle on the District Court decisions?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,937.387,938.231,"Oh, no."
1959.152,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,938.231,953.86,"I notice meager of the cited decision which is by mean in the case of Davis against the University of Kansas City in 127 F.Supp., it has a good deal to do with this question 129 F.Supp.716."
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,953.86,958.988,"Well, it's just how ignorance not to our -- it's responsible for him."
1959.152,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,960.712,960.95,"No, no."
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,961.697,964.405,-- for decisions of any court.

1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,974.364,974.752,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,974.752,976.298,-- interject one of the remarks you made.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,982.117,984.427,"Yes, I'll discuss it right -- I haven't been -- I know by now."
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,984.427,986.746,I'll tell you exactly to save your trouble.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,988.031,988.998,Certainly.
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,988.998,996.998,The Mass case came down after Slochower and it came down after this client of yours who was discharged under this procedure.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1026.411,1026.862,Well --
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1026.862,1029.112,In other words why we have to reach the question that you're imposing now.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1029.112,1030.412,"Well, yes."
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1058.54,1059.042,Globe is the temporary.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1059.042,1060.943,For Globe is temporary.
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1060.943,1060.998,He (Voice Overlap) --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1060.998,1070.262,And -- and the District Court of Appeal ruled that the hearing accorded to the petitioner Nelson was in accordance with the -- with the Mass case.
1959.152,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1116.632,1117.915,I understand that.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1130.182,1133.588,"Well, we think the District Court of Appeal was in error in two respects."
1959.152,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1134.532,1136.07,"But that's their distinction, was it?"
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1136.07,1138.154,That -- that's one distinction.
1959.152,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1176.08,1176.496,That's was in the --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1176.496,1176.939,-- before the Court.
1959.152,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1176.939,1179.311,-- other ground for the -- their distinction in the Mass case.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1179.311,1180.436,Yes.
1959.152,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1494.152,1497.709,This was before the Un-American Activities (Voice Overlap) --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1497.709,1505.268,"Oh, this was -- this was in 1949, Un-American Activity is -- is 1956, this is years before."
1959.152,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1514.586,1516.756,Is this -- is this when he first got the job or --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1516.756,1518.155,First got the job in 19 --

1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1521.366,1526.254,Well -- he -- he first was hired in 1949.
1959.152,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1634.245,1634.922,What is that page?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1634.922,1639.066,Page 63.
1959.152,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1749.89,1752.658,What is the relevancy of this -- the legal question?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1752.658,1756.098,"Well, the relevancy to the legal question is this."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1789.415,1791.246,Did you take judicial notice of that?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1791.246,1791.499,No.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1792.893,1793.371,What?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1793.371,1795.203,"Oh, no, not at all."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1797.137,1800.808,You mean it was adjudicated that although the truthful statement --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1800.808,1802.302,Well --
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1802.302,1806.922,"-- the mere fact that a man and a questionnaire doesn't need for the answers of the suit, does it?"
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1806.922,1807.642,No.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1825.041,1825.779,But that --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1825.779,1826.231,-- but now --
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1826.231,1829.216,-- that precludes the County from reexamining himself.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1829.216,1830.805,"Oh, not at all."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1831.134,1834.426,Can I ask -- I'd like to echo some (Inaudible)
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1834.426,1834.7,Yes.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1834.7,1835.942,What is the relevance?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1835.942,1837.896,"Well, the relevance of the matter is this."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1870.626,1873.551,But is there -- is that the record solely pure?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1873.551,1875.977,"That's precisely the record, Your Honors."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1876.247,1880.443,So Justice Whittaker put a question to you to which you say give some label.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1884.879,1895.675,"Well, I have said that it is probable, that a fair construction of the California statute is to the effect that even though an employee answered all questions of the employer."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1905.601,1907.946,This is the sequence of events.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1929.338,1930.256,No.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1934.991,1935.332,Well --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1935.332,1936.485,-- made inquiry of him --
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1936.485,1937.071,"No, no, no."
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1952.004,1952.97,"Well, no."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1954.43,1955.477,Read correctly --
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,1955.477,1959.066,"It isn't, I would say this."
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2001.006,2008.066,That means the implication of that answer of yours wherein he --that the County -- that was res judicata and they could make further inquiries.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,2008.066,2008.984,Not at all.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2008.984,2027.146,"They couldn't make further inquiries, to your phrase, the -- the challenge could be taken up by him to explain why, although he made full disclosure according to his -- your view, would satisfy the inquiring of parties when he came down here, he -- he didn't."
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,2027.146,2027.548,"Well, let me --"

1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2029.009,2031.734,Are those -- are those the facts?
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,2031.734,2036.07,I -- I think not quite for this -- with this -- because of this exception.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2075.409,2086.469,"But -- but the difference between you and me your correction is merely saying the County should have done something which, all I know, I might agree with you, would be a more rational method."
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,2099.479,2099.982,Yes.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2099.982,2100.465,All right.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,2100.465,2103.06,But we say that he made the explanation --
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2103.06,2103.502,"Well, he made --"
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,2103.502,2115.094,-- by -- by offering evidence with respect to his loyalty to the County by offering his personnel record which showed that he had answered all these questions to the County before at --
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2115.094,2116.648,I will put to you again.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,2116.648,2116.917,Yes.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2116.917,2131.677,"Your claim then is that that res judicata and the County couldn't go about it in the frank movement, namely, you go before the Civil Service Commission and satisfied them that you have good reason for withholding answers before the Congressional Committee."
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,2132.694,2135.658,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, not quite for this reason."

1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2143.533,2146.361,I'm not using the word but you're claiming it in effect.
1959.152,0,17198,a_l_wirin,,2146.361,2161.756,I am claiming that this case is like Slochower because I am claiming that where an employer has information concerning an employee and has it as -- as recently as January prior to the April when he's discharged.
1959.152,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2178.94,2179.233,He would --
