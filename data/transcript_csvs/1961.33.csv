1961.33,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.336,"Number 33, Charles Dowd Box Company, Incorporated, Petitioner, versus John F. Courtney et al."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,15.976,19.479,May it please the Court.
1961.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,195.015,196.447,The validity of what?
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,196.447,198.093,Of the collective agreement --
1961.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,198.093,198.792,Of the whole agreement.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,198.792,199.949,Of the whole agreement.
1961.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,199.949,203.879,That is it was signed by agents not authorized to act --
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,203.879,215.992,That was one of the defenses raised by the company as to the invalidity of the -- with reference to the validity of the collective agreement.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,988.312,994.83,"Mr. Mason, I take it that we start with the fact that Congress didn't solve this problem for us."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1004.692,1005.351,That's correct.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1005.351,1013.977,"And so we haven't got a federal employer's liability problem and we haven't -- Now, what I want to know is have you -- you just made a generalize statement."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1027.69,1028.887,Correct.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1028.887,1075.349,"Now, as bearing under -- on the resolution of those two contradicted provisions, I myself for instance would be interested to get light on various statutes, various statutes, not only labor statutes -- statutes under the -- it consists of act Taft-Hartley or the Wagner et cetera, the various statutes in which Congress has fermented litigation, not consciously, but inevitably and I wonder if either you have collected all the relevant statutes as guidelines as illumination in finding -- to extracting a purpose either of exclusion or inclusion from the structure of a statute."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1076.425,1077.971,I have not made that survey Your Honor.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1089.167,1090.568,We can toss up a coin.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1109.633,1120.938,I think the fact that Congress had no -- gave no consideration of the problem as never deprive the Court's previous decisions from interpreting the statute --
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1120.938,1122.406,No.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1128.706,1141.811,"Correct and I believe that we have an imprecise statute on that particular question and now I'm looking first at the language of the statute itself, and if you see if that throws -- sheds any light upon the --"
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1141.811,1144.236,(Inaudible) a very part of it?
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1144.236,1156.516,"Well, it takes such a certain distance in this respect Your Honor that for example, I've pointed out Section 303 (b) which specifically says, “The courts may bring a suit in any other court.”"
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1156.516,1163.758,"At some other length, I mean the specific -- the specific statute you have to construe doesn't shed very much light, does it?"
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1163.758,1164.046,Well --
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1164.046,1165.08,I don't mean the specific statute.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1167.059,1167.598,Right.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1167.598,1167.866,(Voice Overlap)
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1167.866,1171.006,I think specific provision -- specific provision does not shed much light.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1171.006,1172.16,All right and you move on --
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1172.16,1179.692,"Then I move on to the general pattern of the act of which this particular clause is applied, which I think is a logical next step --"
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1179.692,1180.628,You have a right.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1180.628,1189.016,"-- pursuing this inquiry and I find 303 (b) which specifically says, “State courts, action may be brought in the state court.”"
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1339.911,1353.095,"Not only that, but the Guss case shows that this Court derived exclusion from policy considerations, consequences of not exclusive."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1353.095,1353.323,Right.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1353.323,1374.88,"Like in a different field in the interstate commerce field, but then it happened in all case, this Court construed or practically chloroformed the provision which said the common law rights survived because if it has to construe it -- if it had to give respect literally to that Section, it would've been notified the purpose of the rest of the act."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1374.88,1389.177,"And I think it's a -- the next consideration that I would come to after analyzing the language of the statute, the clause, the entire statute then the policy behind the entire legislation of which this clause is applied."
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1538.003,1564.448,"Well, that was (Inaudible) Mr. Mason is that -- although a substantive matter as we play with words, substantive procedure, these are essentially -- litigation is to be conducted against whom and Congress would hardly have provided a code of procedural -- a code of procedure for the conduct of litigation in all the 50 states and therefore, sub silencio left all those matters to local jurisdiction."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1569.023,1588.154,"The interesting thing is that in 301 where they want to make a rule of law of general application without applicability only to District Courts in Section (e), they did talk about agency without reference to whether the problem or issue arose in the Federal Court or District Court."
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1638.271,1640.566,I'm not sure I follow you Mr. Mason.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1654.696,1655.672,Well my --
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1655.672,1660.428,I don't -- I mean never occurred to me that Norris-LaGuardia was applicable to courts.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1665.883,1666.766,That's true Your Honor.
1961.33,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1666.766,1677.062,You many answer that after lunch -- continue your argument.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1677.062,1691.886,"At the recess, I think we were discussing the application of Norris-LaGuardia to the state courts and inquire was made as to what this has to do with the case at Bar."
1961.33,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1704.488,1713.33,But do you think -- do you think our decision on this point here necessarily has anything to do with the Norris-LaGuardia Act?
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1713.33,1734.846,I raise the question solely because of the difficulty I found in applying substantive law expressed in Section 301 specifically referable to United State District Courts and saying that would also apply in the state courts.
1961.33,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1797.35,1800.325,That's contrary to what the California Court (Inaudible)?
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1800.325,1801.254,"That's contrary, yes."
1961.33,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1822.346,1830.702,Is that view point stated in another way mean that Taft-Hartley Act amended the Norris-LaGuardia Act?
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1830.702,1841.111,I think there is a case that was brought up with this term of the Court if I am correct which involved the issue as to whether Norris-LaGuardia Act was effective in a 301 action.
1961.33,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1888.518,1893.215,How many cases have there been heretofore?
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1902.638,1912.25,"Well, there have been two adjudications I know by the federal courts in which this question has been raised."
1961.33,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1937.6,1943.09,Have there been enough to know whether the alignment has been the same in all the other cases I suppose.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1943.09,1943.626,No.
1961.33,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1943.626,1943.839,It has nothing to do with --
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1943.839,1944.529,No.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1958.36,1960.717,I like your -- I like your phrase Mr. Mason.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1963.342,1964.798,I stole it from Your Honor.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1964.798,1968.964,You call the initiation of a litigation by a plaintiff an accident?
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1968.964,1971.369,It's an accident as to the position your --
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1971.369,1973.316,Accident for this Court.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1973.316,1981.731,It's an accident perhaps from the standpoint of your own philosophic the concepts as oppose to the interest of your client for which whom you're an advocate.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1986.472,1991.103,"Are clients in the habit of, I think they're a console between either a state or a federal court?"
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,1993.097,2006.259,"I don't believe, so I think they look to counsel for that advice Your Honor normally because we were an unwilling party in this case to litigation instituted in the state court."
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2006.259,2008.975,(Inaudible)
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2008.975,2013.389,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2114.214,2121.944,"But Mr. Mason, I don't think this logical argument of yours will serve as an estoppel to Mr. Feller."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2135.003,2136.822,It wouldn't have estopped him from raising the question.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2143.44,2154.06,"Take your comprehensive organic discussion and not -- they can choose it, but they didn't."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2168.845,2176.216,Conceivably but this does not seem to satisfy my sense of judicial consistency.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2724.985,2727.925,"Mr. Mason, may I ask this question?"
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2729.799,2730.643,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2730.643,2744.846,"And went to a master, but if this jurisdiction is sustained, you may have suits on the law side, I mean you're not -- but you're not under 301."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2744.846,2746.098,If this --
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2746.098,2755.454,"I mean if state courts have jurisdiction under 301, there maybe cases involving jury suit cases, are they not?"
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2755.454,2756.649,Conceivably.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2756.649,2756.743,Alright.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2756.743,2758.156,Juries?
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2758.156,2758.436,Pardon me.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2758.436,2760.609,Did you say Your Honor that juries might be involved?
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2760.609,2761.336,"No, no, no."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2764.975,2765.283,Yes.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2765.283,2767.557,Or is that too fanciful as the --
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2767.557,2770.432,"No, I think this is conceivable even under our equity jurisdiction."
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2770.432,2773.644,"No, even -- I was going to say under your equity (Inaudible)."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2832.787,2843.214,"Frankly Your Honor, I don't quite follow the point because if the suit is one cognizable only in the federal courts namely (Voice Overlap)"
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2843.214,2843.705,"No, no, no."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2843.705,2847.295,If it involves -- if it involves a question of (Voice Overlap).
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2847.295,2849.38,I'm assuming it's cognizable also in the state court.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2849.38,2850.856,State court.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2850.856,2857.181,And what it is in my mind is the considerations that underlay the (Inaudible) cases if you'll probably permit it.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2907.161,2920.641,I think this is a potential -- this is possible I think but perhaps not too likely in an offhand consideration of that question.
1961.33,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2920.641,2924.333,Why would not the same thing apply in the federal court?
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2924.333,2927.186,I think so Your Honor.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2927.186,2941.567,I think it would but there's all the difference in the world between a supervising -- Supreme Court of the United States over a federal court and non-supervising court for the United States for 50 state courts.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,2941.567,2955.992,"Although conceivably reviewable possibly by the Supreme Court even in the adjudication by the state court where it 0involves a federal question, it's conceivable."
1961.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3223.23,3228.05,"You get the reverse side of this coin all the time in the diversity cases, don't you?"
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3228.05,3228.539,Yes Your Honor.
1961.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3228.539,3230.399,I mean the federal courts are faced with that.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3230.399,3231.502,Correct.
1961.33,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3231.502,3234.196,And they seemed to model through one way or another.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3234.196,3234.474,Well --
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3234.474,3247.276,"Not only that Mr. Mason, since we are told that this one is a great stimulus to juristic inventiveness, you'll have 50 energetic inventive jurisdictions instead of just one."
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3247.276,3258.785,Correct and don't -- isn't it fair to assume that the state courts jealous of their legal body of law and their prerogatives?
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3271.066,3273.357,Make an assumption for the state law or universal law.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3273.357,3292.22,"Yes, even to that extent so that we can expect the state courts to perhaps pay little attention to federal law not deliberately, but subconsciously in interpreting problems coming up under 301 which were not passed upon by any federal court."
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3292.22,3296.561,But that's only a temporary even because you can always come up here (Voice Overlap)
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3296.561,3299.415,"Well, that -- that's not entirely a temporary matter Your Honor coming up here."
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3299.415,3300.909,"It may not be (Inaudible), but I'm --"
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3300.909,3301.235,No.
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3301.235,3303.511,-- in the interest of jurisprudence.
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3303.511,3303.799,I --
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3303.799,3305.164,"I heard (Voice Overlap), doesn't it?"
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3305.164,3313.745,I would -- I would go further Your Honor and say that the importance of certainty in the law is really of extreme (Voice Overlap)
1961.33,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3313.745,3315.463,Is that the requirement of the law?
1961.33,0,25801,george_h_mason,,3315.463,3328.197,"Well, Mr. Justice Holmes, I believe he said it was the guess as to what the Supreme Court would do which could hardly -- would do in a given situation and that may not be as certain as you'd like."
1961.33,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3420.953,3424.564,Mr. Feller.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3424.564,3430.369,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3544.752,3546.777,I don't get the removal part if --
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3546.777,3547.328,Well --
1961.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3547.328,3551.661,-- concurrent jurisdiction then why doesn't the plaintiff have an absolute choice?
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3551.661,3561.411,"No, the plaintiff has the choice, but as I understand it, if it's a suit which could have been brought in a federal court, the removal statute gives the defendant the right to remove that case."
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3561.411,3564.431,"We held the opposite, if it's the Federal Employer Liability Act."
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3564.431,3567.089,Because that statute specifically so stated Your Honor.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3567.089,3568.788,If it so specifically stated (Voice Overlap)
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3568.788,3570.625,"Well, this Court read the statute as I would say."
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3570.625,3571.309,It didn't show.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3575.005,3576.427,"Well, I do not read this."
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3598.019,3602.83,"But Mr. Feller, your assurance on that subject doesn't bind that --- this Court."
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3602.83,3603.335,Oh no.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3603.335,3633.931,And we had -- the Court divided closely on the question whether the general removal statute does or doesn't apply in the Federal Employers Liability Act and the consideration that's prevailed now that there may be -- may not be removed where policy consideration is drawn out of the purposes of legislation and nothing that you now say can permanently or effectively or authoratively negated such consideration.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3633.931,3635.159,"Obviously not, Your Honor."
1961.33,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3663.6,3665.565,And the dollar limitations do not apply Mr Feller?
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3665.565,3666.629,Huh?
1961.33,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3666.629,3669.199,Dollar limitations do not apply?
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3669.199,3677.952,Because the suit -- the original jurisdiction was under 301 and it's also a law regulating commerce which has no dollar limitation.
1961.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3701.274,3703.078,In this case there was no effort to remove.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3703.078,3704.451,There was no effort to remove.
1961.33,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3707.502,3709.839,The state court had no jurisdiction.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3709.839,3711.829,That the state court had no jurisdiction.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3718.322,3743.955,"But the case -- the problem is abstractly either as you put it and may -- there are maybe today, 1961, lawyers like Mr. Louis D. Brandeis during his long years of practice in Massachusetts made is possible never to remove a removable case from the state court to the federal court for professional consideration in the wise conduct of a litigation."
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3743.955,3751.92,I perfectly concede that there are many times when parties for many reasons decide not to exercise their right to remove.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3829.992,3832.625,But 301 is preoccupied with the contract.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3832.625,3836.203,And 301 is a contract and that's why we're talking about 301.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3939.951,3940.592,Are you --
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3940.592,3946.829,The Congress made a specific decision to exclude breach of contract matters from that rule.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3946.829,3970.189,"Yes, but Mr. Feller, am I wrong in speaking that in construing such pervasive technical complicated provision as collective bargaining, the interpretation of what the collective bargaining mean does not exclude -- does not -- is not holding without life from what may or may not be unfair labor practice."
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,3970.189,3975.21,The two are unfortunately and separately intertwined I cannot -- I cannot --
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3975.21,3980.989,I'm not talking about legal -- that they're in different legal cubbyholes.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4001.647,4002.746,I have no doubt about that.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4002.746,4004.039,"Alright, that's all I'm saying."
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4004.039,4023.188,That -- my own belief is that the bodies which are customarily endowed with the duty of dealing with collective bargaining make better judges in suits for breach of collective bargaining agreement than judges who don't do that.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4095.528,4102.96,"But presumably, District Court or district judges agree with the opinion, the Courts of Appeals particularly their circuits, I should think."
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4102.96,4112.139,"Well if it relates to a field of litigation which is excluded from their jurisdiction, they may if they're intellectually curios, but I suggest the good state court judges read them too."
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4112.139,4117.899,But they sit in Courts of Appeals again and again district judges.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4117.899,4130.858,"Some do, but again the Federal District Court as a class, are not people given a special place or any place really in the administration of the statute."
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4368.998,4370.191,Well that's -- you mean --
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4370.191,4370.936,That's --
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4370.936,4376.764,-- that's vested with the opinion that Justice (Inaudible) that kind of thing going way back.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4376.764,4380.947,"Well like, it goes way back to -- what's the -- Claflin against Houseman."
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4380.947,4382.641,(Inaudible)
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4382.641,4388.974,-- with a preference in bankruptcy when Congress said that a certain transfer should constitute a preference in bankruptcy.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4396.029,4419.626,What -- but my interest derive from a desire for a closest scrutiny of whether in those cases you had policy consideration which -- whatever or whatsoever you may finally assess them are for me present in this case which are not present but there is one present in the -- in that --
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4419.626,4420.423,"Well, I think the question of --"
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4420.423,4423.106,-- the bankruptcy (Voice Overlap) --
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4423.106,4424.608,-- (Voice Overlap) wasn't bankruptcy and there are very large policy questions.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4424.608,4426.627,-- in the various other cases.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4426.627,4448.207,I think there are large policy questions for example in habeas corpus in one of the cases which we cite deals with the question of whether a state court has the right to enforce the writ of habeas corpus on a federal claim to adjudicate a claim of federal unconstitutionality or improper use of federal process in a state court.
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4471.25,4507.413,"Mr. Feller, if you say -- if you will tell us that our decisions, rarely do our decisions require me to reach the conclusion that state courts in subject to the Constitution of the laws of the United States must enforce federally created right unless Congress explicitly makes enforcing judiciary solely the federal judiciary unless you tell me that I'm -- that the requirement of my reading of the cases (Inaudible), if you don't say that then we are driven -- then I don't get much (Voice Overlap)"
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4507.413,4509.439,"Well, I say almost that and I --"
1961.33,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4509.439,4510.063,Almost.
1961.33,1,20827,david_e_feller,,4510.338,4518.762,"-- I don't say they must because I don't want to get to the test and the question of whether the state courts have to hear these cases, that's another question."
1961.33,2,25801,george_h_mason,,6820.076,6828.224,"I should like to make, if Your Honor please, one comment about prior adjudications on this issue that's here involved."
