1988.87-1160,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,10.278,14.432,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1160,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.844,136.921,"Counsel, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, I take it, remanded this case to the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission for further proceedings."
1988.87-1160,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,136.921,141.455,"Yes, I think that's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.87-1160,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.455,159.484,Is it... is it possible that the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission could increase the risk premium portion of the equity rate to reflect the increased risk on remand?
1988.87-1160,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,166.84,172.334,"Well, Your Honor, we've obviously thought about that, and I'd like to be able to say that the answer to your question is yes."
1988.87-1160,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.888,217.003,"Well, it wasn't altogether clear to me, and it was not clear to me whether this then is a final judgment."
1988.87-1160,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,217.003,220.406,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the--"
1988.87-1160,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,220.406,225.027,"That's the real question at this point in my mind also, whether you have a final judgment here."
1988.87-1160,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,225.027,236.624,"--I think we do have a final judgment, Your Honor, on the point of whether any portion of this $50 million of expenses will be recovered in any way whatsoever."
1988.87-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.291,247.654,You... you're not interested in recovering expenses.
1988.87-1160,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,266.775,268.557,"Oh, I think that's quite correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.557,283.087,"So, what if the state, in light of the fact that they have now exposed you to a... a greater risk than in the past... that is, you... you have to build these plants and you can't get... get that thrown into your rate base unless they're used and useful."
1988.87-1160,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,290.19,293.603,In theory I think the answer to that question is no.
1988.87-1160,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.383,327.807,"Well, the hypothetical I gave you does not include the cost of the plant in the rates charged at all."
1988.87-1160,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,344.058,370.646,"Well, Your Honor, I think it's inescapable that if you accept the proposition that you are suggesting, the $50 million, the prudent expenses that were incurred by Duquesne and Penn Power, would be in some way, whether you call it directly or indirectly, included in the rates charged because there would be a recovery of the sums that were expended."
1988.87-1160,1,28648,irwin_a_popowsky,,1648.582,1661.428,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1160,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1718.516,1729.393,"Mr. Popowsky, what is open to the Utility Commission on remand to do in terms of adjusting the rate of return?"
1988.87-1160,1,28648,irwin_a_popowsky,,1729.393,1737.969,"Your Honor, as you pointed out, this case has not been... this case has been remanded to the Public Utility Commission."
