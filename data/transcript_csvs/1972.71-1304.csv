1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.621,"-- this morning in number 71-1304, Bradley against the United States."
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,11.334,14.76,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,85.167,88.924,"Mr. Homans, I think you can help a little bit."
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,98.661,99.37,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,119.495,126.937,"Well, there’s nothing at Judge Rozanski’s order that would indicate the judgment and commitment doesn’t indicate --"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,126.937,128.815,"No, Your Honor, not one way or the other."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,128.815,135.103,"And ordinarily, a District Judge would not give any indication one way or the other, would he?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,135.103,141.789,"Even though, Your Honor, in the form of judgment in which is prescribed."
1972.71-1304,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.582,865.799,And what about the parole?
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,865.799,868.059,With respect to parole --
1972.71-1304,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.059,879.481,"On existing cases that were filed at the time the act was passed, sentences were being served under the old law, prisoner wouldn’t be subject to parole, is he under the new law?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,879.481,887.744,"This case, may it please the Court, I'm not trying to hedge, it does not reach that because of course we resentence after the repeal of the --"
1972.71-1304,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,887.744,895.758,I know but your argument is that probation is a part of either prosecution or sentence.
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,895.758,896.313,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,924.637,939.309,"Well, when we said that counsel, where we saying any more than day -- night follows day that was merely an observation about the chronological events?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,939.309,940.14,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,940.14,947.854,"But in each case, are probation and parole a sentence as pronounced, does it not?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,947.854,949.078,The sentence has been pronounced.
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,949.078,964.835,"Yes, each under a sentence and the -- perhaps physically a difference is that the release begins immediately on probation and it’s deferred in the parole?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,964.835,976.835,"Yes sir, there are those similarities and of course by saying that the parole is -- the parole issue was strong here and the probation issue, we certainly don’t concede the probation issue."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1101.126,1110.002,"Rather than being an act of grace, wouldn’t it be more accurate to say that it’s a matter of sound judicial discretion?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1110.002,1113.113,"With all respect may it please the Court, parole except --"
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1113.113,1115.693,"No, I'm changing probation now -- probation."
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1115.693,1116.276,Probation?
1972.71-1304,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1230.497,1231.361,Mr. Homans?
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1231.361,1232.081,"Yes, may it please."
1972.71-1304,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1232.081,1260.392,"If you put it in terms of more or less lay understanding rather than strictly legal concepts, wouldn’t it be fair to say that when one says a person is going to be -- can be sentenced to a life imprisonment without possibility of parole that the reference to without possibility of parole is really a modification or an adjective describing the form of sentence?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1260.392,1281.789,"Perhaps, to a lay person not understanding the difference in concepts without possibility of parole, Your Honor would normally as I understand have resulted from authority of a statute such as in this case 7237 (d) for the Court to make that order."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1402.705,1410.547,Do you recognize the difference that probation is judicial and parole as executive?
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1410.547,1418.656,"At least in the federal jurisdiction, Your Honor and certainly in old jurisdiction it’s an administrative decision although in some state jurisdictions --"
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1418.656,1420.316,I am comfortable this is federal.
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1420.316,1421.048,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1422.012,1423.477,Parole is strictly executive.
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1423.477,1425.135,"Strictly executive, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1425.135,1429.686,"And do you also say, the probation is strictly judicial?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1429.686,1432.507,"A judicial exercise of discretion, yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1432.507,1435.694,"Well, why is that not a part of the sentence?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1435.694,1448.999,"The reason, may it please, it’s not part of the sentence is because the judge has already at the time that he makes the decision conceptually."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1468.448,1470.287,Which mean it’s a sentence.
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1470.287,1471.385,It means that it’s a sentence.
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1471.385,1474.95,And the probation is a part of the sentence.
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1474.95,1479.705,"I would not say so, Your Honor for the purposes of the statute here which --"
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1479.705,1485.214,"Well, suppose that judge gives in five years in another type of case it’s not the dealt case."
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1485.214,1486.068,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1486.068,1492.204,"And within the statutory period the court amends it, “I made a mistake, I may cut it to three.”"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1495.167,1500.992,"The second one is reduction, as I understand it under Rule 35, which is quite different."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1500.992,1502.499,Is it a sentence?
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1502.499,1505.33,"Yes sir, that goes into the sentencing process -- the reduction of sentence."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1505.33,1512.662,"Well, isn’t anything the judge does after conviction within the sentencing part?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1512.662,1513.011,"No, sir."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1514.56,1515.142,Why not?
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1515.142,1527.741,"It may be part of the “sentencing process” using the words in the rather broad sentence, but I would suggest that what is the issue here is the meaning of the word prosecution and that --"
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1527.741,1531.657,"Well, do you agree that the prosecution includes sentencing?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1531.657,1532.525,It includes --
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1532.525,1532.96,Do you agree on that?
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1532.96,1534.712,"It includes sentence, yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1534.712,1537.185,"Well, isn’t that the end of your case?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1537.185,1537.919,I --
1972.71-1304,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1537.919,1541.494,I thought you said a minute ago the probation was a part of the sentencing?
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1541.494,1543.12,"No, sir."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1637.991,1649.557,"Suppose, this record showed that at the time of sentencing there have been arguments urging probation with all the usual reasons that puts you advanced --"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1649.557,1650.561,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1650.561,1675.324,"-- and the judge said, I have and this is all on the record and in the record when the case comes on review, I have considered the arguments and the reasons advanced for a probation and I conclude that this is not a proper case for granting probation because of the past history of this defendant, where would you be then?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1675.324,1682.818,"If that had taken place, may it please the Court, I think it is unlikely that we would be here although --"
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1682.818,1685.977,"Now, that all of those events have preceded the sentence, have they not?"
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1685.977,1688.444,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1688.444,1693.936,Enlighten me on how that then is not part of the sentencing process?
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1693.936,1714.76,"Had -- as I say, Mr. Chief Justice using the words sentencing process as imposing all of the matters which the trial judge is considering either at the time he imposes the sentence of the years or during that time including the interval following that."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1740.827,1748.21,"But in my hypothesis, the events had taken place before the sentence and the judgment."
1972.71-1304,0,44906,william_p_homans_jr,,1748.21,1755.073,"The attorneys who’ve made the arguments, may it please the Court, and obviously the judge has considered them."
1972.71-1304,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1813.58,1815.376,Very well.
1972.71-1304,1,34041,lacovara,,1819.267,1822.019,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1304,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1924.498,1927.803,"Well, does this case involve parole?"
1972.71-1304,1,34041,lacovara,,1927.803,1934.234,That while the issues that could be raise Mr. Chief Justice is whether the parole question is right.
1972.71-1304,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2034.973,2041.344,Do have any way of knowing that the District Judge did not consider and reject probation?
1972.71-1304,1,34041,lacovara,,2042.67,2047.366,"The sentencing hearing is not before the court, that transcript is not available."
1972.71-1304,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2534.864,2545.314,"Mr. Lacovara just a matter of curiosity, I know often legislation is made effective in the future, but why -- why so long here or some seven months I think it was almost?"
1972.71-1304,1,34041,lacovara,,2545.314,2548.134,"Well, as I mentioned Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1304,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2596.8,2610.428,Is this kind of statute is rather hard on the individual concerned when May 1 comes down and forms the barriers --
1972.71-1304,1,34041,lacovara,,2610.428,2620.279,"Well, no the -- I think that turns it around up until May 1, 1971 the provisions of the old law were enforced."
1972.71-1304,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2645.187,2661.069,"Well, precisely that’s my point that Congress has made its determination on October, made it effective and that’s May, and this individual and others are caught in that interim period, but that’s neither here today."
1972.71-1304,1,34041,lacovara,,2661.069,2669.871,"Well, I think it is here or there because that is the dilemma that the lower courts have been wrestling with."
1972.71-1304,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.923,2710.97,"The Ninth Circuit view doesn’t avoid the necessity of line drawing, does it?"
1972.71-1304,1,34041,lacovara,,2710.97,2711.606,"No, sir."
1972.71-1304,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3191.476,3193.833,"Very well, thank you Mr. Lacovara."
