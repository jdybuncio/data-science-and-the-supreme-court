1993.92-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.139,"We'll hear argument now in Number 92-1988, the Ticor Title Insurance Company v. Walter Thomas Brown and Jeffrey Dziewit."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,12.08,14.902,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,90.456,121.154,"Mr. Taranto, I hope in your history you will cover whether you think (b)(2) and (b)(3) classifications are interchangeable so that if you have a group where some might prefer the (b)(3) class, that is, making compensatory damages the thing, and others are content with the (b)(2) classification, a court can nonetheless force on the people who might prefer the (b)(3) class the one in which you cannot opt out."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,121.154,158.139,"--I think that as a constitutional matter, it is permissible for the rulemakers or for Congress to decide that once the conditions of numerosity and adequate representation are fully guaranteed, that the interests in having a single mandatory class and therefore denying opt-out rights are constitutionally sufficient, necessarily notwithstanding the desire of certain individuals to pursue their own litigation, and I think, as a constitutional matter, that is in fact consistent with the history of this Court's treatment and the evolution of the rules."
1993.92-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.411,324.553,"May I ask if it's your view that if the district judge here had determined that (b)(3) was the appropriate mode for this, that that would also be all right, that this is totally a matter of discretion for the initial trier?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,343.757,353.864,I think it is a matter of discretion in the sense that courts of appeals review certification decisions under a fairly deferential abuse of discretion standard.
1993.92-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.704,438.052,"Mr. Taranto, can... do you think a State or Congress could establish a system in which you no longer have the choice of your own lawyer to prosecute causes of action, saying, you know, lawyers have gotten too expensive, we're going to establish a career attorney system, and you simply get assigned your lawyer when you want to vindicate some civil right?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,438.052,459.767,"Well, I think that the analysis that would have to be followed would be a Mathews v. Eldridge analysis, and I'm, as I'm standing here, uncertain what kind of weighty State interest there might be in saying that any particular individual has no right to choose an individual's own lawyer."
1993.92-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.767,461.137,"Well, it should just be expense of attorneys."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,474.747,475.449,"Well, I think... no."
1993.92-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.809,481.353,--the elimination of that historic right against... against the utility to the State.
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,481.353,493.751,"--Well, I think that what the Mathews v. Eldridge analysis does provide for is the change from earlier, the traditionally established ways of proceeding."
1993.92-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.751,495.293,So does what you're proposing.
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,510.344,520.751,"Well, the kinds of cases that have been permitted as mandatory class actions under (b)(1) and (b)(2) since 1966 have extended beyond--"
1993.92-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.751,522.013,"Well, I consider--"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,522.013,522.38,--(b)(1) and (b)--
1993.92-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.38,525.242,"--Yes, I'm sorry, I have a warped timeframe."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,537.205,546.412,"--But the history in particular of monetary claims, and it does go back to 1854, it's a little--"
1993.92-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.412,551.708,"It goes back to that date in a very different context, where you have a limited fund."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,572.421,574.273,"--Well, I don' think so, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,574.273,579.527,"How about a mass tort... a plane crash, a railroad disaster?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,587.832,593.506,"Well, if the question is as a constitutional matter, I think that the answer is yes."
1993.92-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,609.878,614.309,"And a mass tort case in fact isn't, so it remains an academic question."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,620.814,625.619,"It is... mass tort cases are commonly treated under (b)(3), not under (b)(2)."
1993.92-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.936,702.501,"Congress could repeal outright any private claim of antitrust for antitrust liability against a defendant, couldn't it?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,702.501,703.232,Yes.
1993.92-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,703.893,709.248,So why couldn't it do this lesser thing of requiring a certain degree of consolidation take place?
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,709.248,723.089,"--I think with respect to a Federal statutory claim, there probably is an additional congressional power to, in effect, condition the kinds of proceedings in which certain kinds of claims created by Congress can be brought."
1993.92-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.669,766.238,"Mr. Taranto, your response to the Chief Justice surely doesn't suggest that simply because Congress can eliminate a claim entirely it can provide for that claim to be tried with any process whatever?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,766.238,767.61,"No, I don't think that's right."
1993.92-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.411,770.223,The one doesn't necessarily include the other.
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,776.147,805.846,"--Yes, I think that's right, but what Congress has done in a number of contexts is to say, in particular when an administrative agency makes a ruling, sets prices, for example, under the price administration regime of World War II, that there shall be one forum at one time in which that can be challenged, and if... I assume there are hundreds of such challenges brought within the 30 days in the D.C. circuit or the Emergency Court of Appeals."
1993.92-1988,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,859.337,869.905,"Mr. Taranto, given the reflection of those interests, if you're right on due process, does a court have any discretion in applying preclusion rules?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,893.791,894.983,I think so.
1993.92-1988,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,965.196,975.993,"But would it make any sense to conclude here that the representation was adequate, again so far as any due process standard might be concerned."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,998.849,1001.122,"Well, let me say two things about that."
1993.92-1988,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1153.005,1201.065,"I suppose it would follow from what you say that it would at least be constitutionally open to provide a trial regime in which a Court could conclude that one were... that a given plaintiff was not subject to a summary judgment motion, and was not subject to a dismissal motion, but on grounds of unlikelihood of success, in effect could suffer a dismissal, because that in effect is the standard by which you are judging, or I think you were judging the reasonableness of the decision that was made about the adequate representation of those who wanted to go all the way for damages, or at least claimed they did."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1201.065,1218.997,"Well, I think it is important to separate the question of adequacy of representation leading to an adjudicated decision and adequacy of representation leading to a settlement, although the two are necessarily, in practical terms, interlinked."
1993.92-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1291.057,1296.601,Wasn't this class originally... wasn't there a question in the complaint originally for (b)(3) certification?
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1296.601,1301.975,"Well, there were a dozen complaints, eventually reduced to, I think, nine."
1993.92-1988,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1361.539,1375.131,"Mr. Taranto, in the chronology of these proceedings, what was the last point at which these respondents or other persons in their position could object to the certification of the class?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1387.659,1397.296,"--Well, I think that if the question of certification is not a constitutional one, then I think the question of certification is not open in a separate collateral suit."
1993.92-1988,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1442.986,1455.104,"Well, under your view of the case, under your submission, when was the last point at which these respondents could have asked the class be recertified or objected to the miscertification of the class?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1458.457,1468.094,"Well, they could have made the argument about certification at any time in the Philadelphia proceeding before there was a final judgment."
1993.92-1988,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1469.876,1471.158,But any time before final judgment.
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1471.158,1508.654,"--Yes, I think so, and indeed, that issue was taken up to the Third Circuit eventually on certiorari, but one reason I think that, aside from the fact that this is a case in which (b)(1) and (b)(2) were found to be present and have not been challenged in this Court, and I think were quite proper because of the need for uniformity in the treatment by defendants of all of their consumers, even aside from that, I think one important reason why the current Rule 23 categories shouldn't be constitutionalized any more than the original 1938 Rule 23 category should be constitutionalized, is that--"
1993.92-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1508.654,1519.783,"Mr. Taranto, are you saying that no one of the other side is claiming that it was wrong to make this a mandatory class as distinguished from a class... from a (b)(3) class in which people can opt out?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1538.889,1548.076,--I agree that the argument the other side is making is that due process requires an opt-out right either for all monetary claimants or for some monetary claimants.
1993.92-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1564.408,1579.248,"Could one take the position, so far, yes, as far as injunctive relief is concerned, the class is delighted with that, but you can't cut out the damage remedy without giving us an opportunity to have notice, an opportunity to be heard on our own."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1586.865,1595.851,"I think that that is a reasonable policy choice, but it's not constitutionally required, because monetary claims have always... some monetary claims have always--"
1993.92-1988,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.851,1600.496,Is it possible to argue that that's the policy choice that a fair reading of the entire rule made?
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1600.496,1606.87,--I think the current rule... I think it is possible to interpret the current rules as making that policy choice.
1993.92-1988,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.933,1618.888,"But if we interpret the current rule as having made that policy choice, we wouldn't... and if we agreed with your opponent, having made that policy choice, then we wouldn't reach the constitutional issue, we would reverse on a construction of the rule, wouldn't we?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1618.888,1623.532,Except that the construction of the rule has not in fact been litigated in this particular case.
1993.92-1988,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.734,1636.03,"Yes, but has it not been disputed that... whether you could recover damages, whether that would foreclose the damage claim?"
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1642.264,1666.069,"--As a constitutional matter they have made an argument that adequate representation is not present, and that due process under Shutts always requires monetary claims to be separated out, which it plainly cannot do in (b)(1), and I don't think it needs to in (b)(2) either, and even if it were... that were true under (b)(2) as a matter of interpreting the rule, I don't think it's true as a constitutional matter."
1993.92-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1666.069,1684.863,"If it follows that for the monetary claims the people who would like to press such claims can't be taken out, then the label that you put on it, then you say well, to that extent it belongs under (b)(3), but the claims don't come into court with some kind of magic label ahead of time."
1993.92-1988,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1700.734,1722.917,"I think that that is an argument that was made in the Philadelphia proceeding, can be made under the rules, but the constitutional question is whether that categories that are laid out in (b)(1) and (b)(2) and (b)(3), highly imprecise as they are, must be present as a constitutional matter."
1993.92-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1722.917,1724.309,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,1728.613,1732.747,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.625,1761.136,Mr.... would you state your nonconstitutional argument again?
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,1761.136,1761.747,--Yes.
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.125,1787.047,So this is the law of judgments and--
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,1787.047,1787.358,Precisely.
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1787.358,1789.931,"--estoppel by judgment, that sort of thing, that you're urging now?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,1789.931,1790.781,Exactly.
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1790.781,1813.947,But why isn't the argument the deal that was made in the MDL cases the group adequately represented decided to surrender its claims for monetary relief in exchange for these 5(c) equitable type remedies?
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,1813.947,1821.093,"Well, the problem is... there's a small procedural problem, but the reality, if I can begin with that... the reality of what occurred is this."
1993.92-1988,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.548,1918.611,"Well, is there an argument, assuming you lose on the constitutional aspect of the case, that the court's ruling is res judicata as to your clients on this point, that you could have objected to the certification, or the miscertification?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,1918.611,1931.507,"We were absent parties in the case, so we never really had an opportunity to object, and frankly, since there was no first class mail notice, merely notice by publication, I think Mullane would bar that kind of an argument."
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.282,1967.584,"Mr. North, the question which we granted certiorari is whether a Federal court may refuse to enforce the judgment in Nationwide class actions certified under Rule 23 on the ground that unnamed class members have a constitutional right to opt out of any class action asserting monetary claims."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,1973.267,1982.964,"It is, although that we do argue that the answer to the certified question is that yes, the district court most certainly can refuse to give preclusive effect, and we believe this Court's decision in Shutts establishes that."
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1982.964,1983.105,Yes.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,1985.388,1988.25,"I will right away, if I may."
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.676,2067.405,"Certainly reasonable people could disagree, I think, about your reading of the Shutts opinion as to whether it's dealing with personal jurisdiction or procedural due process."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2067.405,2097.181,"Reasonable people have disagreed, so the answer must be that they could, but the truth is... the truth is that it doesn't stand analysis, because the due process protections accorded absent class members stems from the Due Process Clause, not from Article 3, so all of the arguments that are made by our opponents about the greater sovereignty of the United States v. that of individual States has nothing to do with the right that is being asserted, which stems from the Due Process Clause, the same clause that appears both in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments."
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2118.486,2128.693,"Well, but Shutts could be about the jurisdictional requirements for State courts dealing with these sort of things as opposed to Federal courts."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2128.693,2138.791,"Well, it could, but it doesn't seem that it is, because the pattern of thinking and the pattern of argument reflected in Shutts is the same as is reflected in Hansberry v. Lee and Mullane."
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2214.344,2226.921,You concede that there are class actions that would fit in the (b)(1) or the (b)(2) category where it is not necessary to give individual notice and an opportunity to opt out.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2226.921,2235.038,"--Well, we concede that the rules so provide, and that this Court has allowed such actions in the past, yes."
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2237.169,2240.482,"For example, for injunctive relief."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2240.482,2252.58,But typically in those cases the individual interest and the value of having an opt-out rate is much less than in cases that would otherwise properly be brought under the (b)(3) label.
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2311.303,2326.413,"Mr. Taranto brought up the limited fund case as a case that you could proceed, where you could force... you could have a mandatory class, force everyone into the forum to get pieces of this very limited pie."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2326.413,2340.171,"Well, the constitutional issues, if there are any, in a (b)(1)(B) class action have perhaps more to do with Article 3 and the interrelationship of sitting Federal judges and bankruptcy judges than any of the issues that have been presented in this case."
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2452.185,2465.524,"Mr. North, assuming you're right about this, that you had to be given a right to opt out, why didn't you have to assert that right in the original litigation?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2471.539,2472.781,Two reasons.
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2529.939,2535.104,"What about the people who did have... from what you say, I gather some people did have actual notice."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2535.104,2535.725,"Yes, and they--"
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2535.725,2536.294,What about them?
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2536.294,2556.997,"--Well, the Attorney General of Arizona sought to opt out, and took that to the Third Circuit, which affirmed the judgment without opinion, and in a subsequent opinion explained that decision as likely reflecting their understanding and the argument that the petitioners here had advanced that collateral attack was the appropriate vehicle to test the right to opt out."
1993.92-1988,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2556.997,2562.21,"If the Attorney General had been recognized as parens patriae, would you still have had a constitutional opt-out right?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2562.21,2566.745,Probably not.
1993.92-1988,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2566.745,2568.975,"Well, why not, under your theory?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2568.975,2569.736,Well--
1993.92-1988,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2569.736,2573.469,Why is the Attorney General in any better stead--
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2573.469,2574.03,--If the Attorney--
1993.92-1988,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2574.03,2579.924,--than someone who is certified as being an adequate representative after an adversary hearing in the court?
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2579.924,2586.216,"--Well, had he been certified as a representative, had the Attorney... perhaps I misunderstood the question."
1993.92-1988,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2607.673,2613.469,"Well, why don't you have a constitutional right to drop out of a suit where the Attorney General is acting parens patriae?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2613.469,2624.807,"Well, we would have that right, but all I'm saying is that had we been in the case as proper parties, that right would have been adjudicated in the Third Circuit and we would no longer be able to challenge it again, but that didn't occur."
1993.92-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.831,2636.396,"Mr. North, you said that the Attorney Generals were not appearing as parens patriae for the citizens of the State at the time."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2640.918,2642.829,"They were, the school boards and so forth."
1993.92-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.852,2653.758,"I see, but they were denied the right to assert damage claims at the time of the class certification decision?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2653.758,2654.596,Yes.
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2666.567,2685.407,"I don't really understand what happens in parens patriae, since you say if the Attorney General of the State suing in that capacity wins, everybody benefits, but if he loses, those who didn't get, what, first class notice so that they can opt out, can nonetheless sue again?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2685.407,2690.43,"Well, no, I don't believe I said that."
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.151,2692.042,"No, I'm asking."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2692.042,2693.474,"--Oh... no, I was not asserting that."
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.474,2698.407,"You asserted that there is a right to opt out in parens patriae cases as well, right?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2699.526,2716.95,"No, I think what I asserted was that had the Attorney General of Arizona been appointed as class counsel for a class representative from Arizona, yes, there would still have been an argument that we had a right to opt out, but that argument would have been adjudicated in the Third Circuit where the Attorney General for the State of Arizona... in fact--"
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2716.95,2720.97,But there was... there were representatives that were designated to represent the entire class.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2720.97,2723.141,--None of them were from Arizona or Wisconsin.
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2723.141,2726.814,But they were... purported representatives.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2728.587,2728.857,"Yes, they were."
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2728.857,2733.972,And you said something about notice.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2746.509,2748.763,"Not everybody, but everybody whose address can be found."
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2752.533,2755.424,Had to get first class mail notice.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2755.424,2756.004,Correct.
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.554,2785.657,"Well, Mullane was dealing with an existing property right and a trust."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2793.443,2811.263,"Well, I think that in all of the cases that have come after Mullane, most class lawyers have thought that Mullane means that first class mail notice is required if it is possible, in an appropriate case."
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2831.699,2834.329,"Well, you say... several times you've said, in many cases."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2843.964,2857.485,"I can't know that, but it must be the case that if the notice by publication which the petitioners here certified they did at the time was done and was done properly, someone must have read it in the newspaper."
1993.92-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2857.485,2868.304,"Mr. North, am I not correct that you argued that the notice was not only inadequate as a constitutional matter, but was inadequate under the rules, because it was the equivalent of a (b)(3) action--"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2868.304,2868.545,Correct.
1993.92-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.545,2873.696,--and the judge responded by saying all the damage claims are dropped so the notice by publication is okay.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2873.696,2873.916,Yes.
1993.92-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.916,2879.09,"So you argued not only constitutional inadequacy of notice, but inadequate under the rules."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2879.09,2880.892,We believe that it was inadequate under the rules.
1993.92-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.892,2881.153,Yes.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2881.153,2891.018,"It depends on how you look at what actually transpired in MDL 633, because technically the complaints never were amended to drop the damage claims, but as a practical matter and by judicial decision, they were."
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2925.896,2931.34,"What would the class... assuming the class loses here, would they have a cause of action against the lawyers who did that to them?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2931.34,2937.363,"Probably barred by the statute of limitations, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2953.633,2955.485,"We're talking about a different settlement now, and maybe--"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2955.485,2959.179,The settlement that's actually in this case.
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2959.179,2959.4,--Yes.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,2975.001,2981.485,"We... it was our side, and what we moved for was a deferral of the briefing and the argument pending final approval in the district court."
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3005.722,3016.771,How... what is the projected timetable for when that settlement agreement will be... final order will be entered in the district court on it?
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3016.771,3018.812,That would be very difficult for me to say.
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3034.9,3039.405,And then because it's a notice of a class settlement you'd have to give notice--
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3039.405,3039.685,Yes.
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3039.685,3041.135,--and opportunity to people.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3041.135,3041.375,Yes.
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3055.086,3063.941,Because it's conceivable that a judgment by this Court might have an effect on those pending settlement--
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3063.941,3065.811,I don't think so.
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3065.811,3066.072,--proposals.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3066.072,3067.171,I don't believe it would.
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3099.686,3101.508,So the opposite result is more likely.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3107.263,3110.275,I think that entirely depends upon the speed with which you--
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.275,3111.176,That's right.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3111.176,3111.807,--dispose of the case.
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3111.807,3142.828,"Mr. North, just so I'm sure about the state of the law, your opponent cannot cite common law cases, by which I mean pre-1966 cases, in which... in which actions of this sort were brought for money damages, but on the other hand, you cannot cite any in which such actions were denied."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3159.559,3165.142,"I can't provide that to you standing here, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3166.093,3169.166,"No, I'm... you can answer that question standing there."
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3170.348,3170.619,"--No, I cannot--"
1993.92-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3170.619,3170.959,Okay.
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3170.959,3191.662,"--give that to you here, but I can point out to you that the traditional, the old and original equity rule under which the permissive joinder cases were allowed as a matter of the rule specified that there would be no binding effect as a result of any judgment entered on absent class members, those who chose not to interplead under the procedures of the day."
1993.92-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3194.536,3202.911,"But you're not questioning that in (b)(1) and (b)(2) actions that the rule framers meant those to be binding on all members of the class, like it or not?"
1993.92-1988,1,25822,gerald_d_w_north,,3202.911,3203.833,--We're not questioning that.
1993.92-1988,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3212.177,3213.489,"Thank you, Mr. North."
