2010.10-235,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.636,"We will hear argument next this morning in case 10-235, CSX Transportation v. McBride."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,8.354,10.869,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-235,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,37.997,43.464,How did it happen that in FELA we have proximate cause light?
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,50.706,56.781,"Well, we -- we -- our submission is that that is not correct, that that is not what FELA provides for at all."
2010.10-235,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,68.666,75.318,Can you read the cases as indicating that more deference is given to juries in FELA cases than in other cases?
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,75.318,79.051,"Well, that -- that's -- is a separate one from the one we have here."
2010.10-235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,106.523,109.334,"But juries usually find against railroads anyway, right?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,109.334,114.486,"--I -- I wouldn't want to commit myself to answering that question affirmatively, Your Honor."
2010.10-235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.952,129.468,It also said that there's a relaxed standard of causation.
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,145.207,149.94,"I think there are two ways to respond to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-235,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,225.065,225.455,Counsel--
2010.10-235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.455,226.703,"Well, we have used that language."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,237.216,256.004,"That -- that comes from, Wsubmit, from sort of a loose description of what was going on in the Rogers case, which involved a multiplicity of causes rather than directness and remoteness of causes, and so the cases in which that language appears, which are the Crane case and the Gottshall case, did not involve causation at all."
2010.10-235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,258.691,269.453,"It has nothing to do with the line of cases I think in the '40s in the FELA cases where the message of this Court seemed to be quite clear, FELA cases go to juries?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,276.839,286.291,"Well, that -- that goes to the question that Justice Kennedy raised at the outset, which is how much evidence, whatever the standard of causation is, how much evidence must there be to go to the jury?"
2010.10-235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.927,313.154,"Well, what -- can you explain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the words of the statute, and they are also the words used in the model Federal instruction: Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's negligence?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,344.733,350.419,"Well, I think there are -- there are two parts to your question, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-235,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,386.969,392.873,"Mr. Rothfeld, could you explain to me how it would have made a difference in this case, that instruction?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,392.873,396.76,It -- it would have made a difference I guess in two respects.
2010.10-235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,412.301,413.518,"Well, maybe explain the difference."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,428.823,438.037,"--The something more is what this Court said in its Brady decision, in which it described -- the decision in Brady, which is cited and discussed in our opening brief in -- in some detail."
2010.10-235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.844,459.512,"Natural, probable, and foreseeable?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,459.512,460.249,And foreseeable.
2010.10-235,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,469.23,488.298,"--Can you tell me -- there is an article that suggests that juries don't actually understand what ""proximate cause"" means; and I think, and Justice Ginsburg can correct me, that what does that mean to a jury -- natural, probable, and foreseeable?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,488.298,488.91,--Well--
2010.10-235,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,488.91,490.439,Are the three phrases different?
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,499.451,505.885,"--Well, that -- that was the second part of Justice Ginsburg's question, and I got distracted, and I'm happy to address it."
2010.10-235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.82,549.053,Apparently only FELA juries cannot understand it; all other juries find it okay.
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,549.053,565.173,"Well, I -- it is our submission that FELA juries would have no more difficulty applying it than do juries under the Sherman Act or RICO or the securities laws or, the other statutes that this Court has said include a proximate cause requirement, or that juries apply every day in courts across the country in court cases."
2010.10-235,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,565.173,575.511,"I just don't -- and maybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from a juror's perspective that it makes terribly much difference the exact formulation of this instruction."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,598.285,601.641,"Well, we have to assume that juries follow jury instructions."
2010.10-235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.558,621.4,"Your client is entitled to have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,623.163,624.945,If the -- if the jury--
2010.10-235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,624.945,629.176,"Juries disregard instructions on probable cause, on proximate cause."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,631.083,631.941,"--Well, I -- I--"
2010.10-235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.941,637.487,"But you're entitled to have them disregard the correct instruction rather than an incorrect instruction, right?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,637.487,639.031,--I will endorse that.
2010.10-235,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,639.031,646.668,My point is that I don't see much practical difference between what you argue is the correct instruction and what your friend argues is the correct instruction.
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,646.668,647.776,"Well, certainly, in terms--"
2010.10-235,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,647.776,655.446,"I mean, law students, professors, and some judges have had trouble defining the concept of proximate cause for centuries."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,660.461,671.86,"--Well, I -- the -- the principle of proximate cause, the idea that there has to be some limitation beyond but-for causation on liability, has been universally recognized."
2010.10-235,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.388,692.461,"Do you think that over the last few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on foreseeability as a component of proximate cause?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,692.461,694.945,There -- there probably has been.
2010.10-235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,715.141,726.964,Could you give some examples of what causes would be proximate and what causes would not so qualify?
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,733.008,742.067,"--A but-for cause in this context would be, there's a defective brake on -- on the locomotive and it comes to a sudden stop."
2010.10-235,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,787.426,790.783,"Mr. Rothfeld, are there any cases like that in the FELA world?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,807.212,814.367,"They did in precisely the case I just described, a case called Richards from the Sixth Circuit, which is cited in the amicus brief submitted by the Association of American Railroads."
2010.10-235,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,836.653,837.624,Is there a case like that?
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,837.624,839.262,"As I said, the Richards case."
2010.10-235,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.262,847.666,"Yes, but I mean somebody might think that having to go off and patrol a thing in a rough area is something that happens with a sudden stop: You run a risk of turning your leg."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,851.1,855.238,"I -- I can't cite you a snake case directly, but--"
2010.10-235,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,855.238,855.476,Okay.
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,864.348,865.596,--Or I'll -- I'll cite you--
2010.10-235,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,865.596,866.189,I don't know.
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,868.048,869.436,"--I'll give you two answers to that, Your Honor."
2010.10-235,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,899.786,908.502,"And do you want -- what instruction would you give that would tell the jury to allow damages in one of those -- the first of the coupling cases, but not in the second?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,908.502,914.468,"The instruction we ask for is the one this Court gave -- said should be given in the Brady case: Natural, foreseeable, and probable."
2010.10-235,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,915.326,920.731,"Are jurors going to sit there and say, one of those is natural, foreseeable, and probable, but the other isn't?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,920.731,922.322,--I would -- I would say that it is--
2010.10-235,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,922.322,925.071,"I don't know what ""natural"" means."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,929.259,931.848,"--Well -- well, I'm just quoting the Court's language to you, Your Honor."
2010.10-235,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.582,942.111,"It's not foreseeable that if you drop a coupling where it's not supposed to be, somebody will come along and try to pick it up and move it?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,942.111,948.687,"--Well, but it's not foreseeable in the sense that it is unrelated to the risk that gave rise to -- to the cause of action in the first place."
2010.10-235,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,981.937,984.062,You could have been bitten by a snake when you're getting out of t car.
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,988.219,992.996,"Or -- or, more likely, you could have been hit -- hit by a car driving across Fifth Avenue too fast."
2010.10-235,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,992.996,996.951,"Mr. Rothfeld, your instruction actually used the term ""probable cause""."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1005.616,1011.913,"Well, I think that it should include the term ""proximate"" simply because that has traditionally been the requirement."
2010.10-235,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1032.23,1033.357,So why use it at all?
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1040.244,1048.647,"I -- again, I don't think that it is essential that it use the word ""proximate"" if it spells out what is meant by ""proximate"" in -- in -- as--"
2010.10-235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1048.647,1052.004,"And the spelling out is natural, probable, and foreseeable?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1052.004,1056.77,"--Again, that is the term that this Court used in Brady, and that is -- is closely related--"
2010.10-235,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1056.77,1058.957,"Although your proposed instruction didn't use the word ""foreseeable""?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1058.957,1060.938,"--It did not use the word ""foreseeable""."
2010.10-235,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1108.044,1113.652,Could you explain how it might have made a difference in this particular case based on the facts of the case?
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1131.379,1133.988,--Well -- that -- that -- that's his explanation of the accident.
2010.10-235,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1205.131,1217.968,You're really suggesting that the defense attorney here wouldn't have argued the concept of proximate cause in saying the negligence had nothing to do with him just deciding to hit the brake?
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1217.968,1219.454,The--
2010.10-235,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1219.454,1233.308,"--I -- I -- I -- it's farfetched, don't you think, that because the judge refused to give a proximate cause charge that the idea of it wasn't argued to the jury: What we did didn't cause this."
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1233.308,1240.413,"--Well, there -- there is no question that what the railroad did caused in the but-for sense."
2010.10-235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.526,1270.213,"So the -- but the question is, what was your argument?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1276.725,1289.173,"Our side argued that there was no negligence at all, that -- that -- that the configuration of the railroad was perfectly proper, and that -- the -- the -- there was a contributory negligence component to what was going on here."
2010.10-235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1366.69,1369.518,Are there any -- any negligence-type statutes?
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1391.632,1396.896,"--There are -- there are Federal statutes that use the word ""proximate""."
2010.10-235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1428.634,1435.505,"--But you said your defense at trial was not about causation, it was no negligence, right?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1435.505,1437.88,"Well, that's -- that's right."
2010.10-235,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1460.541,1473.786,"Assume you could talk to the jury and the jury says to you: We found negligence, so we don't want to hear about that; and we've found but-for causation and we don't want to hear about that; now, explain to us why there isn't proximate cause here?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1476.895,1494.078,"In -- in this case we would say the negligence that is being presented to you and that you have presumably found is that the configuration of these locomotives was dangerous because it could lead to derailment, it could lead to breaking of the couplers between the cars."
2010.10-235,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1508.85,1511.24,"But wasn't the theory different, Mr. Rothfeld?"
2010.10-235,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1520.158,1522.938,"Well, if I may, I'll answer that and then sit down."
2010.10-235,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1546.772,1547.665,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1562.159,1565.002,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.93,1685.793,"Of course, the other side says that what that meant, and -- and -- and the language of our cases seems to support that, FELA uses a -- a -- a comparative negligence standard."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1685.793,1690.996,--And this Court has rejected that kind of approach almost from the beginning of the statute.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.271,1714.003,"Why doesn't ""in whole or in part"" apply to the elimination of contributory negligence?"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1717.469,1720.062,--It's -- it's not one that's consistent with the Court's cases.
2010.10-235,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1768.997,1777.697,"Do you think that the phrase in the statute ""in whole or in part"" allows juries to impose liability based on but-for causation?"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1777.697,1779.07,No.
2010.10-235,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1779.678,1780.49,Why -- why not?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1780.49,1795.016,"--As this Court put a gloss on that language in Rogers, it -- it construed those words to mean that the railroad's negligence has to be found to have played a role, however slight, in producing the injury."
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.626,1798.189,That's what but-for cause means.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1801.091,1801.577,--No.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.577,1802.685,Why not?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1802.685,1804.919,Because the railroad's negligence there--
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.919,1813.806,"Once you abandon a proximate cause requirement, however you want to define that, I don't see why the snake isn't covered, or the lightning on 42nd Street."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1813.806,1819.192,--Because there the railroad's negligence played no part in producing the injury.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.456,1823.676,Sure it did.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1843.809,1849.229,--It was certainly an element of the existence of the condition.
2010.10-235,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.156,1887.916,"As I read the statute -- as I read the statute, it insists, as interpreted in Rogers, that the negligence has to play a part in producing, and in the snake case the negligence doesn't matter."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1892.365,1893.192,Yes.
2010.10-235,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.192,1894.756,And I guess that's how courts have read it.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1900.769,1901.362,That's correct.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.362,1902.676,Is that correct?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1902.676,1903.347,Yes.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.347,1904.408,That negligence didn't play a part?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1904.408,1904.923,Yes.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.923,1907.047,"But for the negligence, the train would not have stopped."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1913.139,1914.468,Justice Scalia--
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.468,1915.638,I mean do words mean anything?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1942.299,1963.213,"--Well, let me start with this by saying that the Court and the language of the statute have already eliminate six possibilities for proximate cause; and the question now is whether there's something additive to the words that Mr. Rothfeld now proposes for the first time, because this was not language that they proposed in their proffered jury instruction, which can be found in the red brief at page 11."
2010.10-235,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2008.789,2024.548,"I don't know if they said this, but I mean, as I read it, I thought the reason that negligence doesn't play a part is the act which was negligent played a part, of course; it was ""but for""; but the fact that it is negligent is totally irrelevant, because it's not within the risk in any sense whatsoever."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2029.547,2030.826,"That is correct, Justice Breyer."
2010.10-235,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2054.02,2061.687,"You're in the jury room and a juror says: This wouldn't have happened but for the wide locomotive; therefore, there should be liability."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2071.354,2079.223,"The negligence theory here, Justice Kennedy, if I could go back to that, was not stated in a way that we would subscribe to by -- by Mr. Rothfeld."
2010.10-235,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2120.535,2123.129,How did any of those things cause his injury?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2123.129,2124.224,--Because--
2010.10-235,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2124.224,2127.846,You've used the formulation negligence played a part in the injury.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2129.815,2131.937,--His -- let's start with his poor training.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.338,2190.024,And you don't assert that that's a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of using a wide-body train?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2190.024,2196.489,It's foreseeable if the railroad is using a piece of equipment without training the person.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.489,2197.581,"Well, you -- you don't--"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2197.581,2199.145,For a purpose that it's not ordinarily used for.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.145,2200.818,--You say it doesn't have to be foreseeable.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2200.818,2204.067,"They didn't ask for foreseeability, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.067,2207.627,"Oh, so you -- you conceded that it ought to be foreseeable."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2207.627,2209.234,What I -- I would say this Court--
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.234,2214.248,I'm trying to see what your case is because I can't believe you don't believe in proximate cause.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2221.184,2236.974,"--My definition, what I think the Court did in Rogers was to try to end the debate over how confusing the word proximate cause is in these kind of cases by offering simple and direct instructions that juries could understand and apply, and that has been the case over the last 50 years."
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.974,2237.38,Do it.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2245.455,2247.546,I would take the words of Rogers.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.841,2251.108,With -- what are the words?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2252.216,2260.838,"The words are on page 10 of the red brief, Justice Scalia, and it follows the model form instruction that's used in all the Federal courts,"
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.287,2276.815,"You don't think that's ""but for""?"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2276.815,2281.69,"Whether you think it's ""but for"" or not I think is beside the point."
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.69,2282.719,I don't care whether I think.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2285.515,2296.432,"Those words mean that ""but for"" plus a relaxed form of legal cause associating the negligence in playing a part in produce the injury."
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.102,2301.931,Negligence is a given; the negligence is not what I'm asking about.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2306.584,2326.483,"Well, I would disagree with that Justice Scalia, and I think the Rogers Court disagreed with that too, because after Rogers this Court upheld in Inman a case on a directed verdict where it concluded after the Rogers instructions had been used that nonetheless the negligence of the railroad had not played a part."
2010.10-235,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2333.229,2339.963,Can I -- can I go back a second and perhaps follow up Justice Scalia's question in a slightly different way?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2348.834,2349.427,Yes.
2010.10-235,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2349.427,2351.05,All right.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2357.8,2358.455,Well--
2010.10-235,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2358.455,2360.845,Reasonably foreseeable.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2360.845,2361.141,--Yes.
2010.10-235,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2406.418,2419.865,"It might not be reasonably foreseeable that an amputation would occur, but it was reasonably foreseeable that some injury to people would happen as a result of these infected insect bites, no?"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2421.802,2422.835,That's correct.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2551.983,2555.497,"If the other side doesn't insist on that, the other side -- we'll give you that one."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2555.497,2559.419,"--And we're delighted with that concession, Your Honor."
2010.10-235,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2559.419,2577.335,"Mr. Frederick, suppose a juror says, We wouldn't -- goes to the judge and says, We would like to have an explanation of, what does it mean that the injury results in whole or in part from the railroad's negligence?"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2580.739,2595.357,"Justice Ginsburg, I'm not entirely sure how a trial judge would take a request for further clarification of this word's -- this Court's words that clarify the"
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.337,2608.585,"Well, this jury found it, though."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2610.149,2611.288,I beg your pardon?
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.288,2614.676,This jury found it unclear and asks you.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2616.536,2645.463,"I think -- and I've never served as a trial judge, but I think my -- my direction would be to go back and try again based on the words that are there, because the whole idea behind these words was to try to end the debate between this Court and many State courts that simply didn't grasp that FELA was intended to provide a remedial statute with a causation element that was a weaker causation element than in normal negligence cases."
2010.10-235,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2670.934,2677.837,"Well, what if the jury says, Well, does it mean that but for the negligence, the injury would not have occurred?"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2679.884,2694.69,"If the jury asked a question, I think the judge would write back and say, No, that's not correct, the words -- please focus on the words: The negligence playing a part, however small, in producing the injury."
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.031,2710.276,"You think that eliminates but-for cause, to tell them that negligence plays a part, no matter how small, in the injury?"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2713.072,2723.161,"--No, Justice Scalia, our position is that it is but-for plus a relaxed form of legal cause that's been well-recognized in the cases and hasn't produced a problem."
2010.10-235,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2751.915,2756.914,"Suppose the jury asks, Is it sufficient, is it necessary for the injury to be foreseeable?"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2758.568,2771.249,"I think the trial judge says, No, it is not necessary for it to be foreseeable in a direct -- if the negligence plays a part, however small, in producing the injury."
2010.10-235,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2903.037,2909.739,We have three justices of this Court that say Rogers is irrelevant because it had to do only with multiple causes.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2909.739,2917.562,"--And my answer to that, Justice Ginsburg, is that after Rogers, the Court applied the Rogers language to single cause cases."
2010.10-235,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2987.286,3008.885,"Mr. Frederick, go back again and tell me what a -- what a judge would say to a jury so he or she doesn't say but-for is not, not using those words, tell me in simple, plain language how a judge differentiates to a jury the difference between but-for and this causation."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3011.4,3015.99,"Okay, I would start with the language in Rogers, and then I would say--"
2010.10-235,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3015.99,3019.476,The -- that negligence played a part in the injury?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3019.476,3019.71,--Right.
2010.10-235,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3021.992,3022.179,Producing the injury?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3022.179,3023.021,That's correct.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.688,3038.872,It sounds like foreseeability you're talking.
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3038.872,3042.436,--It's a relaxed form of foreseeability in much the same way.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.436,3044.121,I thought you said no foreseeability?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3044.121,3051.573,What I said was that this Court's cases go back and forth on the idea of foreseeability and whether or not it's necessary.
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.573,3052.962,Do you want to go back or forth?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3054.319,3064.909,I think it's foreseeable here in this case that using the wrong equipment with the wrong training would produce an injury like the one that my client suffered.
2010.10-235,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3070.72,3074.969,"Well, at -- at -- at least that, it seems to me, is a jury question."
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3074.969,3081.186,"--That's right, Justice Kennedy, and the jury here applied the statute the way it was intended."
2010.10-235,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3087.51,3089.667,But -- but -- but it was not instructed on foreseeability?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3089.667,3093.368,And they didn't ask for a foreseeability instruction.
2010.10-235,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3101.538,3105.378,Wasn't Mr.--
2010.10-235,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3105.378,3107.597,They -- they -- they did ask for proximate cause?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3107.597,3113.89,"They defined proximate cause by saying natural or probable sequence, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3122.45,3125.652,"That sounds like a good definition of foreseeable, doesn't it?"
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3128.105,3130.445,"Probable, though, doesn't--"
2010.10-235,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.445,3134.071,Could something be natural and probable and not foreseeable?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3134.071,3143.723,"--Justice Scalia, the word ""probable"" is more likely than not, which is the stronger standard, it's intention with the words ""in part"" in the statute."
2010.10-235,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3170.539,3172.567,--Could I just ask you this factual question?
2010.10-235,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,3189.905,3204.773,"I think it's -- both theories were presented, and they were both based on the improper equipment that he was asked to use and his improper -- improper training he had been given, which are classic jury questions concerning negligence and causation."
2010.10-235,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3209.086,3210.318,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3211.912,3216.831,"Thank you, Your Honor, just a few quick points."
2010.10-235,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3226.139,3226.845,How about eggshell skull?
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3226.845,3230.218,That is a different kind of problem.
2010.10-235,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3230.218,3231.7,It is not foreseeable.
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3231.7,3235.918,It has been -- the rule of common law from--
2010.10-235,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3235.918,3238.574,"You're just saying, it's all foreseeable, not foreseeable."
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3238.574,3239.401,--No.
2010.10-235,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3305.903,3314.041,"Why not, if you know that there are snakes along this route, just like there's an infected vermin or insects or something else?"
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3314.541,3319.009,"Well, the question would be one for the jury if it's properly instructed."
2010.10-235,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3329.99,3331.191,--So it's not that it's a matter of law?
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3331.191,3331.893,No.
2010.10-235,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3332.361,3337.485,"That -- that's right, A matter of law, there was -- there could be no proximate cause."
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3343.701,3345.437,That -- that's generally right.
2010.10-235,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3358.819,3365.74,Isn't -- isn't Mr. Frederick right in saying that asking whether something is probable is very different from asking whether it's foreseeable?
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3365.74,3368.349,--They -- clearly they are closely related.
2010.10-235,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3377.077,3381.765,"Well, if it's probable it's foreseeable, but it can be foreseeable even though it's not probable."
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3381.765,3393.276,"--Well, it -- but I think what probable means in this context it has to be foreseeable, not simply in the theoretical, I can foresee if I drive too fast in New York, maybe there will be a lightning strike -- I mean, I can imagine that."
2010.10-235,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3396.102,3417.234,"If that's true, that -- everything that's natural and probable is foreseeable, but not everything that's foreseeable is natural and probable, you were requesting a jury instruction that didn't go as far to help you as was possible, but you were still requesting a jury instruction that was on the road."
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3417.234,3431.947,"--That's -- to me the only question now here before this Court is whether we are entitled to a jury instruction that states properly the nature of the proximate cause test, and if the case goes back under that standard, then the arguments that have been suggested by Mr. Frederick can be presented to the jury."
2010.10-235,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3436.475,3438.084,This case go to the jury?
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3438.084,3448.204,I think it would be open to argue that it's so clear that -- that there was no proximate cause that it shouldn't; but that's a question to be posed on remand.
2010.10-235,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3448.204,3458.729,"I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfeld, I didn't understand what you just said, because the requested jury instruction that -- that you gave was any cause which in natural or probable sequence produced the injury."
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3459.138,3460.994,That was the requested instruction.
2010.10-235,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3460.994,3467.476,"So that's essentially saying that the jury has to say it's 51 percent likely to produce the injury, isn't that right?"
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3467.476,3472.116,I -- it was not put in those terms.
2010.10-235,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3473.177,3477.738,"Well, it says natural or probable, and probable means more likely than not, which is 51 percent."
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3477.738,3486.984,"--I -- again, it was not -- unpacking those terms, and I would say it does not have to be -- the answer is -- is no."
2010.10-235,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3496.449,3498.23,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-235,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3499.182,3499.806,"Thank you, Your Honor."
