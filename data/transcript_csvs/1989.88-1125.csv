1989.88-1125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.629,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-1125, Jane Hodgson v. Minnesota; No. 88-1309, Minnesota v. Jane Hodgson."
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,19.164,25.598,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.952,158.285,"Was this all testified to at that trial, Ms. Benshoof?"
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,158.285,159.006,"Yes, it was."
1989.88-1125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.006,163.758,It wasn't just studies or... but witnesses got on the stand and said that?
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,163.758,164.539,Absolutely.
1989.88-1125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,298.496,305.671,"Well, Ms. Benshoof, weren't... those were claims where the absent father asserted a constitutional claim--"
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,305.671,306.492,Yes--
1989.88-1125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.492,307.581,--which we rejected.
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,312.376,322.594,"--In this particular case, the State of Minnesota is arguing that these parents have liberty interests which the state has to promote or otherwise they are in effect vetoed."
1989.88-1125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.594,328.939,"Well, but whether... whether or not... they are... they are constitutional interests, the state might choose to promote them, might it not?"
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,328.939,344.669,"Well, the state could promote interests that are not constitutional interests, but then they would be balanced against rights and constitutional interests in the minor and, I might add, her single mother, so that those rights would even be less cognizable than if they would be liberty interests."
1989.88-1125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.894,359.609,"But when the Court looks at those interests, it's generally looking at them in terms of a constitutional challenge."
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,379.066,380.536,It absolutely can.
1989.88-1125,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,405.482,425.345,"How... how do you define the privacy interest that the child has here in her nontraditional family, say, with the stepfather and... and... and a natural mother apart from any interest she has in medical treatment?"
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,431.939,434.531,"Well, there's two sorts of privacy interests."
1989.88-1125,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,447.941,448.88,"No, no."
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,449.992,450.703,Apart from--
1989.88-1125,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.703,455.676,--because you began by saying that... that this interferes with the ongoing family relation.
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,455.676,457.088,--Absolutely.
1989.88-1125,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.371,498.844,"Well, my... my question is what is the definition of the privacy interest that you're asserting here?"
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,507.42,510.362,"--It would be phrased, first of all, in the--"
1989.88-1125,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,510.362,511.311,Or can you be more specific than that?
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,511.311,513.443,--privacy interest to be able to choose to have the abortion--
1989.88-1125,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,513.443,514.582,"No, quite apart from that."
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,514.582,514.974,--then there would be--
1989.88-1125,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,514.974,515.835,Quite apart from that.
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,515.835,527.113,"--a privacy interest in informational privacy such as this Court recognized in Whalen v. Roe, a private to make... to keep independent information personal to oneself."
1989.88-1125,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,674.268,686.796,"Ms. Benshoof, you appear to be arguing in the brief that applying a compelling interest standard would result in striking the two-parent requirement."
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,691.74,710.983,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that when minors' rights are at stake because, as this Court recognized in Bellotti and I think Justice Stevens particularly recognized in Carey, minors who are pregnant need more protection from this Court than even in other areas because they only have two options left in their life at that point."
1989.88-1125,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,758.805,767.31,That was a commerce clause context in which we were not depriving the state of the authority to legislate.
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,775.684,784.561,"I think that's very apt because first of all we're not saying the state is deprived of authority here, we're not disputing the legitimacy of the state interest."
1989.88-1125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1226.614,1232.508,What was the district court's holding with respect to the constitutionality of the bypass procedure?
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,1234.749,1243.585,The district court struck down the statute in its entirety because they found the two-parent requirement was overbroad.
1989.88-1125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.828,1266.128,So it construed in a particular way and up... upheld the bypass part?
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,1266.128,1273.374,"It invalidated the entire statute, it... because of the two-parent requirement not being severable."
1989.88-1125,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1369.406,1374.95,Is it mandatory that the authorities notify both biological parents of the abuse?
1989.88-1125,0,28893,janet_benshoof,,1374.95,1380.864,It doesn't say both biological... nothing ever says both biological; this is new to this statute.
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1579.855,1601.379,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1125,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.355,1631.479,"Would you explain just what... what... what is this substitute provision of the law, Mr. Tunheim?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1631.479,1642.686,"The... the law provides, Mr. Chief Justice, that parental notification is required in all cases 48 hours prior to performance of an abortion."
1989.88-1125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1769.409,1797.415,"Well, Mr. Tunheim, the statute with its absolute two-parent notice requirement does sweep broadly and pick up some cases, does it not, where a parent would have to be notified even though possibly that parent had been denied custody of the child because the court had found that it was not in the best interests of the child?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1808.204,1816.87,"Your Honor, the evidence in the case shows that approximately 50 percent of minors in Minnesota live with both biological parents."
1989.88-1125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1816.87,1822.023,"Put the other way, 50 percent do not."
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1824.034,1834.651,"That's correct, but that... that 50 percent doesn't include minors who live in families in which they've been adopted or there have been other circumstances."
1989.88-1125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.681,1857.387,"I think to get right to the heart of it, the statute just doesn't provide for any exceptions on the notice, even though clearly there are some circumstances where it would not be in the best interests of the child to notify one of the two parents."
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1858.115,1859.147,"--Your Honor, the statute--"
1989.88-1125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1859.147,1862.98,--How do you defend the state's interest as to that?
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1862.98,1878.088,"--Your Honor, the statute does not require notification of... to a parent whose rights have been terminated, termination of parental rights; does not require notification to a parent or a father who has not been adjudicated as a... as a parent."
1989.88-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.243,1944.282,"Mr. Tunheim, I... I had assumed that the purpose of this provision... I mean, maybe... maybe you will tell me otherwise, but I had assumed that its purpose was not just to... to assist the child, but that the legislature also thought that apart from whether it would do the child good or not, the biological parents were presumed to have the right to provide advice on this matter if they... if they wanted to to the child."
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1944.282,1946.593,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.593,1953.979,"I mean, there... there... there's a... there's a parental interest involved as well as a... as a filial interest, isn't that so?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1953.979,1967.256,"There certainly... there are interests involved in which the state is concerned for the best interest of the minor and has found that parents are best able to help minors in... in a very difficult and traumatic time, but there's also--"
1989.88-1125,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.256,1968.598,"You're not saying what I'm saying... oh, oh, okay."
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1968.598,1979.565,--There is also the separate and distinct interest that parents have in... in actually knowledge about important events in... in minors' lives.
1989.88-1125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2009.625,2034.252,"Well, that might be true in general, but probably you would concede that there are some circumstances in which it would not be in the best interests of a child to tell one of the two parents of her problem and intention."
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2034.252,2039.084,"Certainly, Your Honor, and I submit to the Court--"
1989.88-1125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2039.084,2049.38,And yet there is no mechanism provided at all whereby the best interests of the child can be considered.
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2049.38,2064.121,"--Your Honor, I submit that the a legislature has made determinations that are within the law itself as to those minors whose best interests may not lie in notifying their parents of having a desire to seek an abortion."
1989.88-1125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2072.617,2080.141,"Well, it has to be reported to a state agency that then, in turn, notifies the parents, is that right?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2080.141,2091.627,"--What the law requires is simply that, in order to avoid notification, a minor declare that she is a victim of sexual abuse or physical abuse or neglect."
1989.88-1125,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2113.793,2116.686,Do you think those exceptions are constitutionally required?
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2116.686,2121.267,"Justice Kennedy, I do not believe that they are constitutionally required."
1989.88-1125,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2121.267,2135.997,"So, in your view, the state can require notification to a parent who has been declared unfit and who has been denied the custody of the minor by reason of the parent having sexually abused the minor?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2135.997,2148.215,"Your Honor, if you're talking about a parent whose rights have been terminated as a parent, a finding that they are unfit, then that's a different story."
1989.88-1125,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2148.215,2165.136,"No, I'm saying that custody has been taken away from the parent because the parent is unfit and has sexually abused the minor, and I'm asking you whether or not your position is that the state has the constitutional right to require the minor to notify that parent in all circumstances?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2165.136,2174.802,"Your Honor, I think a state has the constitutional right to do that, but it is not mandated under the Minnesota law in any stretch of the imagination."
1989.88-1125,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2174.802,2181.077,"General Tunheim, does any other state have the two-parent notification?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2181.077,2199.459,"There are, I think, 11 or 12 parental notification statutes that have been enacted around the country and I'm not aware of another one that has a two-parent notification requirement, but I could be wrong about that."
1989.88-1125,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2199.459,2200.301,So your answer is no?
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2200.301,2202.502,I'm not aware of another one that does.
1989.88-1125,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2202.502,2204.142,"Well, your answer is no, then?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2204.142,2204.763,Yes.
1989.88-1125,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2204.763,2212.326,Does Minnesota have a two-parent requirement with respect to any other medical procedure whatsoever?
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2212.326,2226.668,The general rule in Minnesota for minor treatment medical procedures is that there is no autonomy on the part of the minor to make those decisions by himself or herself.
1989.88-1125,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2234.121,2238.834,"So your answer is no again, after all those words?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2238.834,2250.641,"Justice Blackmun, my answer is no, but I submit that a notification requirement is not the equivalent of a consent requirement, and, in fact, let me address that issue."
1989.88-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2376.946,2379.066,May I stop you there with one question?
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2379.066,2379.567,--Yes.
1989.88-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2379.567,2396.718,"Going back to your dialogue with Justice Scalia earlier, just focusing simply on the parental interest in knowing what's happening to the child as one of the justifications for the two-parent requirement, does Minnesota vindicate that interest in any other statute?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2396.718,2415.461,"Justice Stevens, there are other statutes which require notice to both parents, a statute that requires notice to both parents when a minor seeks a name change, so there's one instance of an indication in which notice is required to both parents."
1989.88-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.461,2423.849,"How about Minnesota as compared to Ohio, in the area of drug treatment, sexually transmitted diseases and things of that character?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2423.849,2432.607,"Well, Minnesota law does provide exceptions to the general rule of consent for certain kinds of medical treatment."
1989.88-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.607,2441.721,"I understand that, but what about... do they also require that the parents be notified, to vindicate this interest in keeping the parents informed about what happens to the children?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2441.721,2444.105,In other areas?
1989.88-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.105,2448.446,In the sexually transmitted disease area and in the drug treatment area.
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2451.928,2453.908,"Justice Stevens, the state does not."
1989.88-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2474.052,2477.945,"There's a concern that the parents might object to the treatment, is that it?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2477.945,2491.024,"The concern that by notifying parents that a minor is undergoing drug abuse treatment, that that might keep a minor from coming in to get treatment."
1989.88-1125,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.024,2491.954,I see.
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2507.414,2508.606,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1125,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.598,2592.279,"Mr.... Mr. Tunheim, what is the point of a record in a case such as this?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2602.217,2608.11,"I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that that is not the appropriate role of a trial court in a case like this."
1989.88-1125,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.951,2610.731,"Why did the trial court here do it, do you know?"
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2610.731,2613.573,"--Well, I'm not... I'm not entirely clear, Your Honor."
1989.88-1125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2839.303,2860.576,"Yes, but isn't... isn't it true that the district court did say that although that's a... that's a legitimate purpose and a... and a... a worthwhile goal, that in some situations this statute actually disserves that goal because there will be cases in which the minor is willing to tell one parent if that's going to be the end of the situation, but not to tell both."
1989.88-1125,1,33256,john_r_tunheim,,2874.815,2880.83,"I submit, Justice Stevens, that that particular finding simply doesn't make any sense."
1989.88-1125,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3335.976,3336.958,Ben shoof.
1989.88-1125,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3336.958,3337.579,Ben shoof.
1989.88-1125,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3338.938,3339.759,Thank you.
1989.88-1125,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3371.26,3382.499,"But is that an ordinary thing you would expect a district court to do, to hold a factual trial on whether a statute ""achieves"" the goals that the legislature set out to achieve?"
1989.88-1125,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3384.089,3384.79,Absolutely.
