1993.93-639,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.598,"We'll hear argument now in 93-639, Silvia S. Ibanez v. the Florida Department of Professional Regulation."
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,12.109,15.942,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.259,126.584,"Ms. Ibanez, may I inquire of you?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,133.45,140.105,"Your Honor, the record is clear, the Petitioner has maintained that she does not practice public accounting; she practices law."
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.507,154.203,"If you did practice public accounting, do you recognize that you have to abide by the regulations of the Board of Public Accounting?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,154.203,164.101,"--Your Honor, I believe that anyone who practices public accounting or doesn't practice public accounting is subject to Chapter 473."
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.882,168.224,And did you take a different position earlier in the litigation?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,168.224,168.933,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.874,207.291,"Reading the briefs, I got the impression that the position you've taken has shifted somewhat during the course of the proceedings."
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,207.291,220.251,"Your Honor, I believe the record is clear that in the rule challenge proceedings, a lot of hypothetical questions were posed... that was not the disciplinary proceeding... and the questions, I believe, and the answers are consistent."
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.242,234.348,And does the Board take the position that your law firm somehow has to be licensed or authorized as... by the Board of Accounting for accountancy?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,234.348,238.242,"--Your Honor, it appeared that initially the Board thought so."
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.484,279.01,"And while I have you interrupted, the CFP designation after your name in the advertisement, how is somebody reading that ad supposed to verify what that means and whether you're a member in good standing of whatever that organization is?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,279.01,289.539,"--Your Honor, the record is clear, at the disciplinary transcript found at the joint appendix, that the public is very well aware and informed about the CFP credentialing... considers it quite valuable."
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.268,312.693,"But does... your advertisement at least doesn't make any explanation about what that is or who has issued the certificate, I take it?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,312.693,327.013,"--Your Honor, the CPA and CFP within the context of attorney advertisement, and in the case of a multiple-licensed professional such as Petitioner is, clearly could disclose some disclaimers in connection to the--"
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.013,327.714,Excuse me.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,335.109,335.648,"--No, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,335.648,336.259,Thank you.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,345.063,350.847,"I believe that the State could certainly require, as to the CPA, some disclaimer."
1993.93-639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,360.264,362.595,I'm not sure that I understood your answer.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,369.991,383.46,"Your Honor, I believe in the context of attorney advertisement the CPA credential, which is the credential regulated by the Board, certainly the Board regulate for some disclaimer language."
1993.93-639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,385.28,410.277,"In other words, your position then, is that a State may require some sort of disclaimer or explanation of the use of the term C... certified financial planner, CFP, either when that is used by someone in conjunction with advertising their services as an attorney, or in advertising their services as an accountant?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,410.277,419.563,"Yes, Your Honor, with the following qualification if I may, because it's the CPA credential that's the threshold issue."
1993.93-639,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,449.573,456.407,"Of course, I don't understand why there's concern about lack of information as to what the letters mean."
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,476.39,479.012,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.012,487.097,"May I ask... you said there are two levels of regulation by the Accountancy Board, and you comply with one about your general qualifications."
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,490.32,506.051,"Your Honor, Petitioner has not been charged as to whether she complies or doesn't comply regarding the allegation of unlicensed firm status; only when she is confronted directly, and not indirectly, can she be afforded her due process rights."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.733,516.947,What... just help me out a little bit... what is the nature of the reg... the second layer of regulation?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,525.812,539.753,"Your Honor, as I understand the Board's position, Chapter 473, in various of its statutes and in some of its regulations thereunder, actually counts the regulations and the statutes with the phrase"
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.422,560.296,But I still don't understand what this second layer of regulation regulates.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,567.91,572.634,"Well, I could possibly think of one example in the area of contingency fees, for example."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.562,584.193,I see.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,584.193,585.953,It has an ample regulatory arsenal to regulate conduct.
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.863,589.775,But that would be contingency fees for performing accounting services?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,589.775,590.616,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,590.616,591.135,I see.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,596.18,596.621,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,600.832,613.341,Were you ever told... was Petitioner ever told expressly what she must do to bring herself into compliance with the regulation that she was censured for violating?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,613.341,614.821,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,632.652,634.425,Is--
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,634.425,636.355,She could not have refused if she was not offered.
1993.93-639,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,636.355,649.665,"--In... in your view, does the State have a valid interest in... in prohibiting the... the... the formation of an accounting firm which includes non-accountants... or non-CPA's, I should say?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,649.665,652.617,I believe there are some provisions under Chapter 473.
1993.93-639,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,652.617,655.827,"Well, I know there's a provision, but do you... do you agree that it is a valid provision?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,655.827,657.169,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,662.232,664.756,Including the regulation that requires separate firm registration?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,664.756,665.334,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,668.816,669.477,Okay.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,681.005,683.015,Excuse me.
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,683.996,699.728,"Could a CPA with... perhaps I should ask your opponent this rather than you... but could a CPA, without violating the regulations, who is a practicing CPA, does tax work and audits and all that sort of stuff... could such a CPA put on his or her business card, also a member of the Florida Bar?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,699.728,704.262,--I am not quite sure what the answer would be to that question.
1993.93-639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,717.7,723.165,"Well, from a constitutional standpoint, what's your answer to that question?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,723.165,726.536,I believe it is constitutionally permitted.
1993.93-639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,726.536,742.246,"In other words, there is a constitutional right for an accountant to say that... who is practicing as an accounting... to list on their letterhead or in their professional announcement the fact that they are an attorney?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,742.246,763.771,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that this Court's commercial speech cases in the area of attorney advertising clearly articulate the doctrine of truthful speech, on its face, passive speech, non-coercive, relevant to the listener... because the public interest is very well served by providing them more information, not less."
1993.93-639,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,763.771,764.8,One other question.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,779.542,780.952,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,825.412,844.553,"Ms. Ibanez, do I understand your answer to Justice Kennedy to say that you... you were laced with a total prohibition, and there might not be any controversy if the Board came back with something specific... you might agree with it and there might not be any controversy?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,845.514,846.405,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,881.698,889.355,"--But that remains hypothetical at this point, because we don't have any specifics of what a clarification might be."
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,889.355,892.767,"Yes, Your Honor, right now it is hypothetical."
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1033.171,1043.425,"Well, I... I think when you come to the use of cert... CFP, which stands, I guess, for certified financial planner--"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1043.425,1044.617,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1044.617,1064.13,--I would think that at the very least you would have to acknowledge there is a potential there that the public will be misled into thinking that somehow the State has certified you as a certified financial planner.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1086.505,1087.447,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.59,1128.042,How could that... how could that be?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1133.956,1139.981,"Justice Scalia, very simply, if there is an asterisk to a CPA credential, not engaged in public accounting--"
1993.93-639,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.981,1140.542,Yes.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1140.542,1142.091,--That would cure all misleading effects.
1993.93-639,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.47,1160.724,"Well, it would... it would prevent you from misleading any people looking for accountants."
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1168.258,1174.323,"Your Honor, anyone looking for lawyers has found a lawyer under the attorney advertising and has found a lawyer that complies--"
1993.93-639,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.943,1192.705,"But... but the person looking for the lawyer sees CFP> [""] next to CPA> [""] and knows that CPA is a State-conferred certificate and assumes that CFP is a State-conferred... and you say, that's okay because people looking for lawyers deserve what they get... is that it?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1195.848,1225.066,"Your Honor, I... I will agree with... with Your Honor, but what I would like to say is, if the Florida Bar, who is also the State, regulates attorney advertising... and I believe we all agree on that... and they have already indicated that the credential from a recognized institution is all right with them, then obviously the attorney who uses CFP in the Bar's... in advertising rules, in compliance with the Bar's rules, is perfectly in compliance."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.786,1235.001,"What you're saying is that... that people who are being misled are people in the market for lawyers, not people in the market for accountants... if there is any misleading?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1235.001,1235.922,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.332,1240.886,And the Florida Bar takes the position that you're not misleading anybody?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1240.886,1241.685,"Correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1241.685,1251.613,The Petitioner would not be before this Court if she were attorney-at-law and CFP and not CPA?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1251.613,1253.634,"Correct, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1300.327,1304.117,May I ask you one other factual question about this winding road?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1326.885,1342.824,"Your Honor, in the rules which are in the rule challenge portion of the proceedings in the exhibits at R. 377 to 700, you will find rule 21A-20.006, Florida Administrative Code, that says a CPA may practice as a sole proprietor."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.226,1348.887,"Well, that's not my question."
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1361.666,1364.85,"--The license needs to be, yes, with the firm, as I understand it."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1364.85,1365.32,You do.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1368.849,1369.69,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1370.281,1372.323,And you say you don't need it because you're not practicing accounting?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1372.323,1373.034,--Correct.
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1429.703,1439.688,"Let me... I hate to be asking these stupid little questions, but I wanted... if... if you just want to be a sole practitioner as a CPA, do you need two licenses or one?"
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1439.688,1441.751,As a sole practitioner?
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1441.751,1442.47,Yes.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1442.47,1443.471,Without being incorporated?
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.471,1445.542,"Without, yes, being incorporated or a partnership."
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1445.542,1452.267,"Possibly the Board can answer that question better than I, but as I understand it, the sole practitioner needs to be individually licensed."
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1452.267,1452.768,Period?
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1452.768,1453.779,I believe so.
1993.93-639,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.779,1458.17,Okay.
1993.93-639,0,41536,silvia_s_ibanez,,1458.17,1459.963,The public is not easily misled.
1993.93-639,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1491.034,1492.676,"Very well, Ms. Ibanez."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1495.286,1502.54,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1531.769,1534.089,She claims she is not providing accounting services.
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1534.089,1535.631,Your Honor--
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1535.631,1539.315,What is there in the record that shows that she is providing accounting services?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1539.315,1552.572,"--The record is very clear and Ms. Ibanez admitted during hearing that she is providing exactly the same kind of services now... tax representation, interpretation of financial records, representation before the IRS--"
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1552.572,1555.544,Is that the practice of accountancy under Florida law?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1555.544,1556.645,"--Yes, it is."
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.635,1574.037,"So, then... then a lawyer who represents people in tax matters is practicing accounting?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1574.037,1575.459,Not necessarily.
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.906,1591.137,And tax representation is included among them?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1591.137,1592.339,--If it's within those.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.914,1619.437,"She could do... she doesn't do audit and attest, right?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1619.437,1620.298,--That is correct.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1620.298,1621.227,That's undisputed?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1621.227,1622.248,That is correct.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1622.248,1631.465,Are you saying to us now that she could do everything that she's doing... the tax representation... if she were merely a lawyer?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1631.465,1631.905,Yes.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1631.905,1632.685,She could do those functions?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1632.685,1633.085,Yes.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1633.085,1637.038,But if she is also certified as a CPA--
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1637.038,1637.429,If she holds herself out--
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1637.429,1638.478,--She can't?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1638.478,1642.402,"--If she holds herself out as a CPA, then she can do those things."
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1647.584,1652.67,"Well, do you... do you have... what... what is... what is your evidence that she is not adhering to them?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1662.115,1662.506,That is true.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1664.459,1671.683,--Then why didn't you... why didn't the Board simply go after her to revoke her CPA license because she had failed to register her corporation?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1671.683,1679.427,We originally did have a charge... or the administrative complaint was amended to add that charge to the... the charges against her.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1693.589,1713.892,"Well, they may inextricably intertwined, but do you not understand... is there any reason... let me put it this way... why the Board cannot go after her for failing to... to register her corporation and fight it out as a matter of fact and fight it out as to the validity of the regulation, if she contests it... and I don't know that she does--"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1713.892,1715.141,"--Yes, they could."
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1715.141,1718.403,--Without... without raising any First Amendment problem?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1718.403,1724.828,"They could do that, as well as what they have done in... in raising the advertising violations here."
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1739.788,1744.279,But... but my understanding is that that wasn't a part of the complaint that was retained before the Board.
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1744.279,1745.581,"--Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1764.875,1766.966,Are you referring to the Joint Appendix?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1766.966,1769.297,No; in the record itself.
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1775.792,1788.53,"My understanding is that the only rulings that were before the Board after the complaint was amended was, first, that this CFP designation was misleading, and the second, that the CPA designation was misleading."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1788.53,1789.089,--That is true.
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1789.089,1789.76,Is that an incorrect statement?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1789.76,1790.882,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1805.281,1816.558,"Well, but if the conclusions of law... which was the basis of the... the Board's action... were simply that CPA and... and CFP were misleading, why isn't... that's... that's all that's before us."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1816.558,1818.98,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1836.891,1839.752,Can you read the finding on which you're relying that says just that?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1839.752,1843.345,It says in the Joint Appendix--
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1843.345,1846.809,This is a finding as distinguished from a charge.
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1846.809,1847.707,--Yes.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1870.533,1873.636,Approximately?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1873.636,1874.635,--Excuse me.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1892.868,1893.919,Now--
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1897.7,1899.562,"Yes, she is, individually."
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1899.562,1909.259,"Is there... in the... in the view of the Board, is there any way that she can distinguish herself legitimately from a non-CPA?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1924.257,1929.091,"There are two answers to that question, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.281,1959.092,How does it mislead?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,1986.517,1995.954,Because the public is allowed to believe that she can offer these services through the professional association that she is advertising when in fact that is unlawful.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1995.954,2003.32,"Well, the worst that can happen then is that some member of the public calls up and says, I want you to perform an audit function for me."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2029.246,2031.978,"Your Honor, there are two answers to that."
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2042.645,2043.286,No.
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2064.429,2074.206,"Your Honor, any time that she performs any of the services which fit within the definition of public accounting, which she has indicated she does perform through this firm, she is committing an unlawful act."
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2078.447,2082.291,"But you said she could have on her card Attorney, CPA."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2084.143,2084.842,--Yes.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2084.842,2100.213,"Now, what is it that a member of the public would see differently from her current card than it would see... I mean, if it gets Attorney, CPA, it's still going to have the problem with it, well, a CPA can audit, so I'll call her up and ask her to audit."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2113.462,2119.096,"Because the public is led to believe that she can provide these services through the P.A., which she in fact cannot do."
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2119.096,2119.935,Through the?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2119.935,2122.268,Through the professional association.
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.699,2125.999,"My, that's a very refined misleading."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2135.256,2135.837,--Yes.
1993.93-639,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.792,2162.114,"Do I understand this, to be sure, the card I guess is at page five of the Joint Appendix and it gives her name and her... her degrees and so forth, and then says law offices, and then Silvia S. Ibanez, P.A. Now, if after the words ""law offices"", there were a parenthesis, and said not engaged in public accounting, parenthesis, then you'd have no problem?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2162.114,2168.678,"--That would not be a truthful statement, because the Board found that she was in fact practicing public accounting."
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.678,2173.801,You are engaged in accounting if you are... if you are... if you are an accountant and practice law?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2173.801,2177.444,If you provide accounting services and--
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2177.444,2183.168,"Well, not distinctively accounting services, whatever the Board chooses to define as accounting services... if you do those acts and are an accountant."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2183.168,2189.262,"--Using accounting skills, and you hold yourself out as P.A. and CPA."
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.262,2196.678,I suppose the Board could say that just addition and subtraction are accounting skills and that anyone who performs addition and subtraction and has a CPA is practicing accounting if it wants?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2196.678,2198.188,I don't think there's been any interpretation--
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.188,2198.899,It hasn't moved to that yet?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2198.899,2199.7,"--No, it has not."
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2200.361,2217.231,"So, where... so, where we are is this: If John Doe, who is an attorney and not an accountant, and has simply advertises that he's an attorney, does exactly what Ms. Ibanez is doing, the Board has no problem?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2217.231,2218.323,None at all.
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2218.323,2218.921,All right.
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2227.199,2236.185,Only if you do so in terms of providing those services through an entity that it not licensed if that entity needs to be licensed.
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2236.185,2245.422,"So... so, what you are accomplishing in order to protect the public is not allowing her to disclose her additional qualification?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2245.422,2246.731,"No, she may--"
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2246.731,2248.233,And your position is: that protects the public?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2248.233,2255.145,"--She may disclose her additional qualification if she complies with the other requirements of Chapter 473, which she has chosen not to do."
1993.93-639,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2255.145,2258.778,And those other requirements are to get a license for the firm?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2258.778,2259.389,Yes.
1993.93-639,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.389,2261.751,"Well, she... as I... I'm sorry--"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2271.178,2280.124,"She has to submit an application, pay a fee of $150, and she has to provide proof of insurance for the professional service corporation."
1993.93-639,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2282.575,2285.967,Does an individual seeking a CPA license have to provide proof of insurance?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2285.967,2286.716,"No, they do not."
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2286.716,2306.89,"I take it, under no circumstance is she... could she add the CFP designation, because, as I understand it, one of the regs is that one may not add any term... and I presume any abbreviation indicating a term... with the word ""certified"" on it if the certification is not a State certification?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2309.552,2314.846,The prohibition there is only in conjunction with the CPA designation.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2314.846,2315.747,"Yes, yes."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2315.747,2318.779,It is not... and that is the only time that it comes into play.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2318.779,2319.918,But I mean that's... that's the... that's the only way she wants to use it.
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2328.994,2331.095,"No, that is not true, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2340.29,2340.651,But I--
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2340.651,2341.752,The Board has also--
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2341.752,2343.674,--I thought that was under a separate section.
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2344.615,2344.946,--No.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2344.946,2349.236,"That... that applies to the... to the prohibition against using the term ""certify""?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2349.236,2351.079,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2370.542,2376.094,And which... which section is the provision for Board approval of a deviation here?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2379.286,2384.229,"--Actually, it's a combination; (i) is the one that specifically talks in terms of the term ""certified""."
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2398.29,2399.691,How has the Board made this known?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2404.204,2407.816,--They have... they have formal opinions which are available by public record.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2417.772,2427.038,Is... is... does the record... excuse me... does the record contain any citation to any formal opinion in which it... the Board has indicated that (i) is subject to this dispensation?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2427.038,2428.418,--Yes.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2430.021,2430.461,It is--
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2430.461,2433.133,--There are multiple opinions by the Board.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2433.133,2436.575,--But does the... does the hearing officer's finding cite one of the... the letter rulings?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2441.638,2444.48,I do not believe that they specifically cite an individual opinion.
1993.93-639,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2505.3,2512.954,"Are you suggesting that had there been a... the disclaimer, which you see as required under the rule, she would have been in compliance?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2512.954,2517.398,--I think there's a great possibility that would be the case.
1993.93-639,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2523.473,2539.001,"Well, but if you look at the rule... the regulation... on its face, it says in (i) that use of the word ""certified"" is prohibited."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2539.001,2543.194,"Because of the confusion that is created with the use of the word ""certified""."
1993.93-639,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2543.194,2543.785,Okay.
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2555.193,2556.165,"No, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2556.933,2561.287,"I mean, the Board seem... the... the regulation seems clear on its face as a ban."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2561.287,2563.038,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-639,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.474,2620.195,"Well, that can't be misleading then."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2628.88,2643.13,"--I think that while that person didn't know what it was, I think there is still the potential there, at least a potential there, that it is misleading because they clearly knew what certified meant in terms of a certified public accountant."
1993.93-639,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.153,2648.984,"But her card doesn't say C.> [""]--"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2665.125,2667.256,Yes.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2667.256,2675.842,"This is somebody who is in a firm that's qualified to do audit and attest and all the rest, and that person has whatever is the designation of the accounting firm and then J.D.--"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2675.842,2677.492,That is perfectly permissible.
1993.93-639,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2677.492,2682.186,"--And that's... well, you don't care because that's another profession and you don't care about it?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2682.186,2685.229,The Board does not seek to regulate the practice of attorneys.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2685.229,2687.549,May I just go back to an earlier question?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2708.953,2716.159,I think the public would be protected in that particular instance.
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2720.201,2726.404,"So, you can... you can accomplish everything you claim that you ought to be able to accomplish without regulating speech."
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2726.404,2739.454,"Not entirely, because... because of the very definition of the practice of public accounting, as it is defined in Florida... and Ms. Ibanez has not challenged that definition--"
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2739.454,2741.394,"Well, who cares about definitions if she is not using the term CPA> [""]?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2775.348,2780.46,"--If in fact... if in fact her license was revoked and she quit using the title, then yes, that interest would be served."
1993.93-639,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2780.46,2785.794,"And if she didn't quit using the title and she was no longer a CPA, you would have a very different First Amendment case, wouldn't you?"
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2785.794,2786.695,"Yes, we would."
1993.93-639,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2786.695,2793.909,May I ask the question about the insurance requirement for if you practice as a professional corporation?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2793.909,2794.489,Yes.
1993.93-639,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2794.489,2798.112,Is it different for a lawyer who practices as a professional corporation?
1993.93-639,1,34894,lisa_s_nelson,,2800.102,2804.056,I have no idea.
