1968.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,56.605,"Number 29, United States, Appellant versus the Concentrated Phosphate Export Association, et al."
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,59.496,62.811,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,310.821,320.754,"Mr. Christopher, I may have missed you when you're talking about the two transactions in which GSA did the procurement directly."
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,323.626,327.13,Yes and then transshipped to Korea.
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,327.13,327.791,Oh!
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,336.835,336.954,The --
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,336.954,339.246,It just what happened there.
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,339.246,340.156,GSA did take the --
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,340.156,351.318,"Forgive me for interrupting here but I -- to me the importance, I'm troubles by the mootness point in this case and that has an important -- may have an important bearing."
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,351.318,371.903,"My understanding of the transaction Mr. Justice Fortas is that the goods, the phosphate in each case were shipped from Florida to Korea but in the GSA transaction, GSA actually took legal control of the goods before they were shipped out from the country."
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,386.355,401.306,"Well, if you -- I see you place no emphasis upon the possibility that the G -- if GSA did take delivery on those two transactions."
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,409.476,422.715,"Well, Mr. Justice Fortas, we think the crucial fact here is that the funds came from the United States Treasury and that the transaction was controlled in every respect by AID."
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,437.445,450.342,Do you contend in the two cases that GSA took delivery in other words that so far as I am concerned the contract was completely performed within the United States?
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,450.342,452.812,"Yes, sir and I believe the stipulation bears that out Mr. Justice."
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,452.812,466.44,"But, with respect to the other transactions, delivery was not effective until the phosphate arrived in the Republic of Korea, is that right?"
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,466.44,483.777,"With respect to the other transactions, the Republic of Korea sought the bids in Korea, bids were made there and the phosphate was transferred I believe from the Export Association to the Korean Government in Korea."
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,483.777,488.236,But you -- you nevertheless make no point about that difference?
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,488.236,488.615,"No, sir."
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,499.721,509.211,But if you don't prevail in the ROK transactions and you don't care about prevailing in the other two.
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,509.211,520.551,"Well, Mr. Justice, I think the differences between the two types of procurement are not significant to make it turn on those factors sir."
1968.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.616,647.488,Is there any contention here that there was not competition between the association and other bidders?
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,647.488,657.403,"Mr. Justice White, there was competition between the association and other foreign bidders and other bidders from the United States."
1968.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.403,661.088,"And there were foreign bidders in this picture all the time, weren't there?"
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,661.088,663.432,That's correct Mr. Justice White.
1968.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.206,702.931,And this doesn't make any difference that the fact that one of the purposes of the Act was to permit Americans to compete successfully with foreign bidders?
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,708.265,709.116,That's correct.
1968.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.116,722.244,"Even though -- even though if the purpose of the action is satisfied, you would think the purpose was affected in having a bit lower than foreign bids?"
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,722.244,735.044,"Well, the basic purpose of the Act was to enable the American exporters to compete in foreign markets for what I would call traditional foreign business where the foreign source pays the money."
1968.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.988,1020.41,(Inaudible)
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,1020.41,1058.947,I think the assumption that Congress had when it drafted the Webb-Pomerene Act was that they were going to be aiding small companies in getting together small American companies in getting together in competing in the world market but I think it was an equally important intention of the Congress of 1918 that they should not permit any activity which would be at the expense of the American taxpayer or which would penalize the American people.
1968.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.167,1086.153,"(Inaudible) itself, suggested that (Inaudible)"
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,1086.153,1088.743,"Yes, that is correct Mr. Justice White and --"
1968.29,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.743,1092.186,(Inaudible)
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,1092.186,1104.066,-- as to that I would only say that procurement officials do not act as the final arbiters of the antitrust laws.
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1267.461,1272.129,"Are you going to address yourself to the mootness problem, Mr. Christopher?"
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,1272.129,1273.055,Pardon me?
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1273.055,1276.069,Are you going to address yourself to the mootness problem?
1968.29,0,44339,warren_christopher,,1276.069,1280.736,I'm glad to do so Mr. Justice Fortas.
1968.29,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1394.891,1399.039,You may do so.
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1400.846,1406.224,Mr. Chief Justice if the Court please.
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1597.464,1617.142,"Under the Webb-Pomerene Act if this were, if the sale in question were sale to the United States and paid for by the United States and then the merchandise were shipped by the United States out of this country."
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1626.964,1633.728,"I think a practical sense, Justice Fortas, that would depend on other facts not in your question."
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1663.557,1670.528,"You mean, that that might not be -- that transaction might not be entitled to the antitrust exemption?"
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1670.528,1671.583,"Yes, sir."
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1671.583,1688.17,"And suppose that the United -- same facts that I gave you before in the United States instead of sending it abroad for use by the United States, send it abroad for use by another country."
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1688.17,1697.835,I think that that transaction given only those facts would be entitled to the exemption of the Webb Act by the test that Congress has laid down.
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1697.835,1706.405,So that what you're relying on here are two facts perhaps.
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1738.27,1746.727,We also rely very heavily Justice Fortas on the presence of foreign competition.
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1771.391,1798.342,"Well, would you agree that theoretical matter if the procurement were by the United States for used by the United States abroad, in fact that there would be foreign competition would not put the transaction under the antitrust exemption umbrella of the Webb-Pomerene Act?"
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1798.342,1800.945,"No, I don't believe I would agree with that Justice Fortas."
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1800.945,1817.617,Do you think that if there is foreign competition that that fact standing alone entered to the export of the goods of course makes it a Webb-Pomerene transaction perhaps as an antitrust exemption.
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1817.617,1826.529,I wouldn't agree that that fact standing alone is determinative but it seems to me certainly one of the most significant facts.
1968.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.663,1968.561,"What I gathered from Mr. Christopher's statement that, what percentage did he say of trade had been obtained by foreigners?"
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1968.561,1970.997,I believe he used the figure about 16%.
1968.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.997,1976.988,Of the trade of the AID business or at the trade this Korea or what?
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1976.988,1978.294,I was not clear.
1968.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.307,1982.741,"Well, I understand that."
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,1982.741,1986.828,Two of which are not challenged in this case Justice White.
1968.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.828,1994.189,Which are involved in this case but none of the 16% are these transactions.
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2004.823,2007.487,Quite so and it won awards in the most (Voice Overlap).
1968.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.487,2010.016,Not just bidding but successfully (Voice Overlap)?
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2010.016,2012.042,Absolutely.
1968.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2012.042,2016.139,We'll recess now Mr. --
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2018.843,2029.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please, I should like to return briefly to two questions as just before the recess."
1968.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.937,2130.439,(Inaudible)
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2130.439,2131.181,Sir?
1968.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.181,2134.777,How did you sell the participating (Inaudible)?
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2134.777,2135.949,Korea awarded --
1968.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.949,2137.519,(Inaudible)
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2137.519,2170.184,"Well, Korea invited tenders on and awarded very substantial tonnages and a particular bidder would also make a variety of bids depending on delivery time, different prices for different quantities, different delivery periods and in many of these transactions, the awards were split so much to these defendants and so much to another American supplier, so much to a foreign producer."
1968.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.184,2175.019,Do you think that in these (Inaudible)?
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2175.019,2175.242,Oh!
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2664.327,2689.929,"Well, how about maybe -- the problem I think is a problem of statutory construction application here and the United States -- sales to the United States are not expressly outside of the coverage of the antitrust exemption under Webb-Pomerene Act."
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2714.383,2725.35,"Well, I haven't thought about that on that basis, Justice Fortas but I do agree that a sale to the Untied States for consumption by the United States is not included."
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2725.35,2750.388,"So, it seems to me that the question here that at least threshold question is whether the various functions performed by the United States in these transactions convert this into in effect a sale to the United States by this association."
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2779.758,2799.353,I would begin by saying that that I do not agree that a sale of commodities to the United States which commodities the United States then gives away to a foreign consumer is outside the Webb exemption.
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2801.898,2803.171,"Well, why is that?"
1968.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2803.171,2804.872,You mean within the Webb Act?
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2804.872,2806.43,"Within the Webb Act, yes sir."
1968.29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2806.43,2808.088,Not within the exemption?
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2808.088,2809.632,That's correct.
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2813.39,2838.763,"Even, even though, so you think that the United States, the United States, sovereign United States is deprived of the -- is affected by the antitrust exemption in the Webb-Pomerene Act depending upon what the United States does with the merchandise?"
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2838.763,2861.056,"Well, quite frankly, Justice Fortas, I am unable to answer the sovereign -- the sovereignty aspects of your question and I do not think that this is a position that we have to defend in this case that it is --"
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2861.056,2862.748,But I'm not sure that it isn't.
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2877.756,2880.545,Yes.
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2880.545,2885.726,-- is not covered by the antitrust exemption?
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2890.421,2918.446,"I must have misunderstood your questions Justice Fortas but my position would be and is that Congress set out a clear test in using the word ""export"" in that same sense that it had become settled in the law by that the sense of its ultimate resting place."
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2936.726,2937.581,That's right.
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2937.581,2950.759,"That the provisos would come into play and depending on the facts and the situation, it would be found that there was a kind of effect on domestic commerce which the Act, the Webb Act proscribes."
1968.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2969.267,2972.318,I know but GSA is the United States too.
1968.29,1,41731,samuel_w_murphy_jr,,2972.318,2987.588,"Well, the Government as I understand it attributes no significance to the difference and in our view GSA's participation did not order the substance of the transactions at all."
1968.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3127.232,3131.164,Mr. Attorney General.
1968.29,2,44339,warren_christopher,,3131.164,3134.564,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.29,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3399.992,3409.209,What's the basis for excluding the sales to the United States from antitrust exemption?
1968.29,2,44339,warren_christopher,,3409.209,3419.67,"The Webb-Pomerene Act, Mr. Justice Fortas, provides the exemption for activities done in the course of export trade."
1968.29,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3446.987,3460.057,"In other words, it's not, you're not relying on any expressed provision on the statute but by implication derived from the fact that the United States has a sovereign in that doctrine and the legislative history?"
1968.29,2,44339,warren_christopher,,3460.057,3481.274,"Yes, Mr. Justice I believe that could be argued that the proviso taking out of the exclusion, things are -- that are in restraint of trade within the United States, I think it could be argued that that proviso might be effective here because this conduct restrains trade in American procurement."
