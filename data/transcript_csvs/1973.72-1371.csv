1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.613,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1371, Alexander against “Americans United.”"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,51.244,54.646,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1371,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,337.934,351.731,"If the 13 -- if that number of exempt organizations, how is it possible for the Service to keep track of what each one does from year-to-year and as you point out sometimes withdraw the exemption?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,357.801,364.923,I imagine some of it may be brought to our attention by other people bringing actions to withdraw the tax exempt status.
1973.72-1371,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.926,391.176,"Annual reports are not required, are they?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,398.402,400.5,I don’t believe so.
1973.72-1371,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.5,400.998,I don’t think so.
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,401.162,403.38,I don’t think they require any reaffirmation of that.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,403.38,408.592,Is it still true that many listed aren't even in existence anymore?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,408.592,409.694,That could very well be.
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,433.732,452.834,"I suppose, even though these numbers are rather formidable, but the fact is that only a small, relatively small percentage of this 120,000 are organizations having significant amounts of money, and spending significant amounts of money?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,452.834,454.486,"Oh, I’m not so sure Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,462.595,465.77,"Well, excluding churches for the moment?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,465.77,468.659,"Well, Red Cross might be one."
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,468.659,471.289,Red Cross has a great deal of money.
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,471.289,471.902,Yes.
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,471.902,484.605,"I am just wondering, groping for whether this is a problem obviously you couldn’t conduct visitation of 120,000 or even 20,000."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,498.787,506.226,I think that’s true and I think -- and the large organizations they would – they would just like that in order the Income Tax Returns they --
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,506.226,511.136,"But their concern is on returns, isn’t it, under congressional act?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,511.136,511.223,I’m not certain.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,511.223,512.65,Is it different from the others?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,512.65,514.125,"I’m not certain about that, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,520.583,528.865,"But you don’t have great deal concern about whether local parish churches are conducting lobbying activities, do you?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,528.865,529.224,No.
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,529.224,530.236,Individually?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,530.236,530.542,No.
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,530.542,538.981,"But the problem is, it’s concentrated in a relatively few of the total of 120,000."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,544.42,549.634,"Oh, I think the problem with the lobbying is relatively small in the exempt organization figure."
1973.72-1371,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,820.727,832.362,"And the result is that the Commissioner cannot question the deductibility of contributions made by donors to this institution, is that it?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,832.362,842.302,"Well, the result under the holding of the lower court would be that the injunction should -- the case was referred for a consideration of whether or not the injunction should be granted."
1973.72-1371,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.302,842.532,Right.
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,842.532,848.018,"Now, this would open it up for hearing on the merits I think and the court said it was not expressing an opinion on it."
1973.72-1371,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.998,860.147,But you said a little earlier what the practical effect would be upon the Commissioner and I want to be sure on what this is.
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,860.147,861.382,The practical effect --
1973.72-1371,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,861.382,867.103,"You could not question the deductibility of contributions made to these organizations so long -- during the pendency of this injunction, is that it?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,867.103,868.263,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,872.616,881.321,Has the Service in effect conceded irreparable injury to “Americans United?”
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,881.321,882.391,No.
1973.72-1371,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,883.082,884.477,You think you have not?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,884.477,888.146,"No, we’re not conceding that."
1973.72-1371,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,888.146,898.961,And yet they’re deprived or they would be under your theory for a substantial period of time of donations?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,898.961,900.12,"No, they’re not deprived."
1973.72-1371,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,903.134,908.543,"But precisely and the donations are going to dry up, are they not?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,908.543,912.96,"Well, that depends on I think on the attitude of the donors."
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,953.693,955.493,They did allege that?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,957.119,957.295,Yes.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,957.295,960.127,-- more difficult and practically put them on the business?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,960.127,961.231,They did and --
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,961.231,967.826,And that’s -- aren’t we obliged at this stage of the proceeding to recognize that?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,970.522,971.716,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,979.833,988.686,"Well, what do you have to offer that they will not be irreparably harmed, except your imagination?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,988.686,994.917,"Well, I think that -- I’m not saying that there won’t be harmed, but I don’t think it’s irreparable."
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,995.17,997.014,"Well, what if they were?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,997.014,999.359,"Well, that comes right back to Williams Packing case."
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.508,1005.93,What’s the purpose of the statute?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1006.437,1009.576,I think the purpose of the statute is just that and --
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.576,1014.753,"Because otherwise, I mean otherwise, there’s no need to bar an injunction unless there’s irreparable injury."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1014.753,1017.595,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1019.346,1034.415,"But the real problem as you say it’s an injunction against taxes, and they say it’s an injunction against their organization being able to operate and I recognize, I don’t know which way I come out, but I think there is a little difference there."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1034.415,1036.425,"Well, I -- there is a little difference."
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1043.123,1046.817,Well when -- when were you given these tax deductions?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1051.44,1053.022,I am not sure I understand Your Honor’s question.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1053.022,1059.916,"Well, does the anti-injunction statute apply to tax-exempt corporations is the question I think?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1060.866,1061.008,We say it does.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1061.008,1063.752,-- or do you say it does not?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1063.752,1063.926,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1063.926,1065.159,They say does not?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1065.159,1065.464,Yes.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1065.464,1072.102,"Well, number one, the charitable organization exemption came later."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1076.092,1077.347,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1079.088,1084.509,"And the relief here is no relief which says that you can’t collect taxes, is it?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1084.509,1085.309,"Oh, Yes."
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1090.734,1093.736,I thought the donors were left out of this?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1093.736,1094.978,"No, there are two donors."
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1094.978,1097.877,I thought the Court of Appeals left the donors out?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1097.877,1099.435,"That’s right, it did."
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1099.435,1100.352,"Well, that’s what I’m talking about."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1104.717,1106.416,"Well, yes and no, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1112.44,1113.869,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.869,1119.375,"Furthermore, you couldn’t collect certain kinds of taxes from the organization itself?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1119.375,1120.96,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.174,1123.464,Federal unemployment taxes --
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1123.464,1125.971,We say that they --
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.971,1129.336,If the Commissioner’s action stands you can collect it -- federal unemployment taxes?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1129.336,1131.19,That’s right and we are.
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.19,1133.07,"If the injunction stands, you cannot?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1133.07,1134.107,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.889,1136.051,From the organization itself?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1136.051,1139.982,From the organization itself.
1973.72-1371,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1297.171,1301.684,"Yes, but chaos hasn’t resulted, has it from the Williams Packing Company case?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1301.684,1308.467,No and we think we can live with the Williams Packing Company case.
1973.72-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.698,1478.971,"Because your opponents contend that it is a very small donor, the Service has on occasion simply made the refund and mooted the issue on the merits?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1478.971,1488.068,That allegation is made and I think they do refer to a Church of Scientology case and that case in our view was not in point.
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.325,1598.425,Do you -- does the Government take a position that the Anti-injunction Act has the same impact as 28 U.S.C. 2201?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1598.425,1598.611,Yes.
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1598.611,1600.203,On declaratory judgments?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1600.203,1601.974,"Yes, we say --"
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.974,1611.871,You don’t think the prohibition against declaratory judgments is any broader or any narrower than the prohibition against injunction?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1611.871,1618.147,"Well, no, I think that the Declaratory Judgment Act would probably be a little bit broader because when you use the phrase with respect --"
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.147,1621.862,That's what I want to know -- I want to know what the Government’s position is with respect to that.
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1621.862,1625.647,I think it’s broader and it’s a more recent enactment.
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.038,1637.892,"Well, don’t you have to have in effect the declaratory judgment before you can have an injunction?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1637.892,1641.761,"Well, I haven’t thought about that, [Attempt to Laughter] Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.252,1652.749,"Suppose there are quite a number of injunctions added, but no declaratory judgment in the traditional sense, aren’t there?"
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.749,1656.736,"But there has to be some legal basis, some legal basis for the injunction."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1658.927,1666.041,I would think you could have an injunction and then your declaratory judgment might not be.
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.041,1667.004,"Well, you may not have some --"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1667.004,1668.541,They are not quite the same.
1973.72-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.541,1673.053,"Well, you many not have something called a declaratory judgment now, but --"
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1673.053,1682.442,"I suppose when the permanent injunction is entered the court has declared something, but it isn’t what we think of as a declaratory judgment case."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1682.442,1695.556,"No, I think the concepts at least to my thinking are somewhat different and I come back to Mr. Justice White's point, I think the declaratory judgment statute is even broader than the Anti-injunction Act."
1973.72-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1695.556,1727.462,"I gather, I gather the basis of the Court of Appeals' decision below, I gather also in the next case, the court in that case was that really neither a declaratory judgment nor any restraint against the collection of taxes has been sought, but that we have to read these proceedings as an attack upon the constitutionality of the substantiality exception."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1746.773,1748.063,"Well, I am not quite sure."
1973.72-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1748.063,1748.634,"Oh, I see."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1748.634,1753.586,I had trouble just reading how they were getting around those myself but --
1973.72-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1753.586,1756.981,"But, but surely I’m right that they are trying to get around both."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1756.981,1757.8,Yes.
1973.72-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1757.8,1759.455,And they say that this was neither?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1759.455,1759.859,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1759.859,1760.418,Didn’t they?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1760.418,1760.994,Yes.
1973.72-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1760.994,1767.857,And I gather that’s [Attempt to Laughter] -- isn't that the rather narrow question that we have to decide?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1767.857,1770.099,"Well, I think, yes."
1973.72-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.177,1842.738,"Mr. Crampton, what’s your interpretation of how the Court of Appeals finding that the Government at least had an arguable case on the merits."
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1857.543,1867.34,That’s in my judgment is a rough question because I read that thing and I tried to see where he came out on it and I have had difficulty.
1973.72-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.872,1885.822,But many -- many of our cases have held the fact that constitutional questions raised doesn’t affect the applicability of the Anti-injunction Act?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1885.822,1898.8,That’s right and we’ve cited them in our brief and I say I have had trouble reading the Court of Appeals’ opinion to see where he just avoids the statutes.
1973.72-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1898.8,1904.002,I notice that the concurrence of this opinion was a model of lucidity?
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1904.002,1912.392,"Well, [Laughter] they’ll have an opportunity in just a minute to explain that and maybe they can answer the question of Mr. Justice Rehnquist better than I can."
1973.72-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.155,1914.754,It’s really been a burden.
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1914.754,1916.264,I think so.
1973.72-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1916.264,1922.896,"But I gather on the substantiality point, in a practical world it’s true, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1942.768,1943.368,That’s true.
1973.72-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1943.368,1947.062,Then is this -- what this organization --
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,1947.062,1963.519,"And you wonder what the test might be, if you put a dollar amount in then an organization under the dollar amount might devote a hundred percent to it whereas a bigger organization would be only devoting a fraction and it seems to us that this is about the best test Congress could device."
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2061.246,2063.512,I have been puzzled about your time problem.
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,2075.501,2075.579,Thank you.
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2075.579,2077.587,Your time is actually --
1973.72-1371,0,41108,scott_p_crampton,,2077.587,2084.136,I thought of it.
1973.72-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2084.136,2089.998,"Mr. Morrison, we’ll enlarge the time on your side of the table by three minutes."
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2089.998,2091.252,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.862,2394.157,What if you sued for refund of the ones you paid?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2394.157,2395.054,"I’m sorry, Your Honor?"
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.054,2398.746,What if you sued for refund of your FUTA taxes?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2398.746,2399.694,We could do that Your Honor.
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.881,2401.997,And you could raise this for issue?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2401.997,2403.91,"Your Honor, it could have been done."
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2410.116,2414.441,"Well, whether -- whether that is so or not, is it so?"
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2414.441,2418.595,"The refund suit could have been brought Your Honor, but it is fraught with difficulties."
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.595,2425.465,Then you could have raised this very issue as to whether or not your FUTA taxes were validly collected?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2425.465,2427.42,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.978,2464.647,But if those -- Mr. Morrison applied to other organizations but not to “Americans United.”
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2469.003,2488.622,"Well, we first say, Your Honor, that we’re asking this Court to establish an exception to the Anti-injunction Act to construe it as non-applicable in a series of cases and we believe it would be counterproductive for the Court to establish rules depending upon the peculiarities of or otherwise very similar organizations."
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.965,2522.296,I thought the trouble is that’s the very purpose of the anti-injunction statute is not as to put off to refund suits the decisions of questions like these?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2522.296,2536.898,"Your Honor, in 1876, this Court in the State Railroad Tax Cases referred to the Anti-injunction action Act in connection with the refund provisions as a complete system of corrective justice."
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.416,2571.504,But what if the -- don’t you think the absence of any alternative remedy was an important part of the Court of Appeals' decision?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2571.504,2576.086,"Your Honor, the Court of Appeals did place great emphasis on -- upon that."
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2576.086,2580.885,"No, I don’t know what it would have done if the issue have been before it about the FUTA taxes?"
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2580.885,2589.561,"It was before it, Your Honor and it was dismissed in the footnote as being so far from the mainstream of the litigation as not to be --"
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.561,2590.884,"Well, that’s rather odd, isn’t it?"
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2596.996,2606.479,"Your Honor, I believe Americans United probably could have on the assumption that first it was not mooted out and we take a different view of the Scientology case."
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.081,2610.952,I thought you said a while ago that the issue hadn’t been -- wasn’t raised until --
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2610.952,2617.265,It was put in very briefly by the Government in the second reply brief in the Court of Appeals.
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2617.265,2617.935,In the Court of Appeals?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2617.935,2619.247,"In the Court of Appeals. Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2625.96,2628.433,Is this question involved in Bob case?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2633.071,2634.506,"I believe they did, yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2647.417,2654.865,"Mr. Morrison, you said your exception, you came on, you wanted us to establish an exception to merit the injunction statute?"
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2654.865,2657.245,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2670.495,2673.495,"Well, maybe I ought to warn you."
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2678.065,2682.097,"The same way that this Court has been doing it for 50 years without rewriting the statute, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2682.097,2685.801,Which case did we rewrite the Anti-injunction statute?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2685.801,2686.85,"Well, to begin --"
1973.72-1371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2686.85,2688.117,Why?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2688.117,2689.072,The Standard --
1973.72-1371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.072,2689.785,Let's start all over again.
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2689.785,2699.07,"The Standard Nut Margarine case, Lipke versus Lederer, Hill versus Wallace, and the case we rely upon most Allen against the Regents of Georgia case."
1973.72-1371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2699.07,2702.188,"Now, how do you want us do this one?"
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2702.188,2717.164,"We want you to say, Your Honor that it is the outside the purposes of the Anti-injunction action since as Your Honor quite correctly pointed out earlier, Congress obviously did not have charitable organizations in mind in 1867 when it wrote this provision."
1973.72-1371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.164,2718.901,It didn’t have Automobiles in mind either?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2718.901,2720.126,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2722.102,2723.611,But it did have taxes in mind?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2723.611,2724.358,"It did, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2724.358,2726.685,And this has quite an impact on taxes?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2726.685,2730.007,"Your Honor, I don’t believe it does have quite an impact."
1973.72-1371,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2752.761,2762.056,"Well, I think all of us, everyone on this bench has had that experience as a lawyer, but that’s not the heart of the case, is it, or do you think it is?"
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2762.056,2773.844,"Well, it is important because we think it’s indicative of fact that this case is not dealing primarily with the orderly process of the collection of revenue as has been true in other cases."
1973.72-1371,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2869.695,2876.048,How do you look down on such as in the exclusion rather than the Declarative Judgments Act?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2876.048,2877.185,"I view that as co-terminus, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2877.185,2877.94,Co-terminus?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2877.94,2878.474,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2878.785,2881.315,"That language, it certainly seems broader, doesn’t it?"
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2881.315,2900.056,"It does seem broader Your Honor, but it was enacted specifically to fill a loophole that had been created that some of the courts have started to permit declaratory judgments to do that which the Anti-Injunction Act could not do and it was intended specifically for that purpose and with no other purpose --"
1973.72-1371,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2900.056,2906.936,"I guess you have to take that position, don’t you because with respect to taxes, that’s the word --"
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2906.936,2908.511,It would be very much broader.
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.048,2944.711,Have there been any judicial constructions of it to that effect?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2944.711,2945.304,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.304,2946.603,In this Court?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2946.603,2947.231,Not in this Court.
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.341,2953.672,But Government apparently thinks that it’s broader.
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2958.144,2959.868,That’s right Your Honor.
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.544,2971.387,"Well, that’s alright I’ll get it."
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2971.387,2974.34,"Footnote 6 -- footnote 5 on page 6, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2974.34,2974.759,Yes.
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,2974.759,2986.693,And it makes references to Judge Thame's discussion of the legislative history in the Court of Appeals and I think that it does indicate that that is the case.
1973.72-1371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.615,3131.22,Are you really saying that they are irreconcilable or that they deal with two different things?
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3131.22,3141.393,"Well, I say that they are irreconcilable if the Government statement that there is a substitute that Enochs was a substitute for all of the prior decisions."
1973.72-1371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3158.04,3162.918,"If they are irreconcilable, I suppose the latest in time would prevail?"
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3162.918,3165.06,"That is correct Your Honor, but we believe."
1973.72-1371,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3310.903,3314.574,"Mr. Morrison, may I help you if I alert you in the absence of our lights."
1973.72-1371,1,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3319.21,3320.476,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3360.782,3363.758,"Very well, Mr. Morrison."
1973.72-1371,2,24660,franklin_c_salisbury,,3371.828,3376.476,May it please the Court and Mr. Chief Justice Burger.
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4129.14,4131.245,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1371,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4208.276,4214.477,But is it true that he wants something more than get a refund of that unemployment tax?
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4214.477,4218.639,"Well, he wants a determination that he is an exempt organization and I think he would have gotten it in the proceeding."
1973.72-1371,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4218.639,4224.574,Which has many -- much broader tax implication than just the refund of the employment taxes?
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4224.574,4228.351,"No, because I think to get the refund of employment taxes the court would there to determine --"
1973.72-1371,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4228.351,4229.298,"Oh, I understand that."
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4229.298,4232.804,-- that the an organization is exempt under 501 (c) (3).
1973.72-1371,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4242.507,4249.692,Would IRS be required to follow that as to their contributors?
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4249.692,4251.09,"Well, as to future --"
1973.72-1371,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4251.09,4255.447,"I thought IRS could go along with what the court said about it, whichever way it chose?"
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4255.447,4269.899,"I think they would and I think that’s their policy and we certainly would -- assuming the organization continued to operate the same way in later years that it was in the time of the test case, I think that would be a complete answer and they put their name back."
1973.72-1371,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4271.597,4279.028,That case was -- do you mean that IRS is required to follow that as to contributors?
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4290.353,4304.026,"Well, the way the procedure that they have is the IRS after case like that ask you to submit an application referring to the case as the reason for that you’re now qualified as tax-exempt organization."
1973.72-1371,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4304.026,4304.707,"Well, let me put it --"
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4304.707,4307.577,And they would then put your name back on the list.
1973.72-1371,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4307.577,4309.249,There’s no requirement though?
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4311.467,4320.617,"Well, I think that’s right, Your Honor, but I think you could assume a good faith with the Government in a situation like that."
1973.72-1371,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4320.617,4328.693,"Unemployment taxes, if they were exempt would they be able to pay those voluntarily and cover their employees?"
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4332.419,4333.834,"I am not sure of that question, Your Honor."
1973.72-1371,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4374.036,4374.753,Thank --
1973.72-1371,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4374.753,4378.077,Maybe I -- you answered this and I haven’t followed you.
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4385.521,4404.44,"It’s our view that it would because that suit would be based on the theory that we are an exempt organization under Section 501 (c) (3) and therefore we don’t have to pay the FUTA taxes and if the Court agreed with them, you’d have a determination that it was an exempt organization."
1973.72-1371,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4404.44,4410.303,Until this revocation Americans United did not pay FUTA taxes?
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4410.303,4411.5,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4411.5,4415.039,And that’s what triggered the payment of FUTA taxes?
1973.72-1371,3,41108,scott_p_crampton,,4415.039,4416.501,That’s right.
1973.72-1371,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4419.737,4420.942,Thank you Mr. Crampton.
