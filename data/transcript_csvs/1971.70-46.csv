1971.70-46,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3017.557,3026.855,"Yes, but the DA is apparently a prosecutor, the immigration officer, what is the category, they are required to report there from time to time, are they not?"

1971.70-46,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3178.016,3185.692,Is it not the real reason to be sure that he can at all raise and establish the fact that he is a legitimate alien?
