1973.72-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.507,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1513, Shea against Vialpando."
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,45.451,49.233,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,227.597,235.856,"I am having trouble understanding that as matter of arithmetic as they ranged from $32.00 to $36.00, why is the average is $30.00?"
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,235.856,253.002,"Well, the state of Colorado felt that it was taking into consideration expenses attributable to the earning of income by basing it upon what the employment expenses were and not using the actual figure."
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.916,276.719,I know that -- I know that then that’s the basic question of course in this case.
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,285.622,294.266,It seemed to be a sufficient taking into consideration of expenses reasonably attributable.
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,325.149,328.729,"Well, I don’t see how anybody could come out ahead on this apparently?"
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,333.028,337.966,The person who gains is the person who does not have $30.00 of employment expenses.
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.301,348.569,You mean some people have no expenses?
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,348.569,350.595,Some people --
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,350.595,355.718,"As I understand it those who do have expenses, their expenses range from $32.00 to $36.00, is that --?"
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,355.718,357.907,"No, this was the average figure Your Honor."
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,385.072,386.483,What page are you on?
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,386.483,391.652,Page 41.
1973.72-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.652,396.164,And your $32.00 to $36.00 range was at different times?
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,396.164,396.751,"Yes, Your Honors."
1973.72-1513,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.751,399.033,That was the range of average – a range of averages?
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,399.033,400.233,"A range of averages, correct."
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.233,401.776,I see.
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,401.776,404.375,In other months it would run $36.00.
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,430.097,432.414,That did prevent the use of it.
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,441.611,442.058,"No Your Honor, the average --"
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,442.058,443.072,-- that's been allowed?
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,443.072,444.526,Has not been adjusted.
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,444.526,444.624,So they remain same --
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,444.624,451.144,"-- but I would assume that it would have to be adjusted upward with the cost of living, but the --"
1973.72-1513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.144,460.921,"Well, I’ve already interrupted you, I presume you have a copy of the Solicitor General’s letter, February 25th addressed to the clerk in the Court?"
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,460.921,468.35,"Yes Your Honor, I do."
1973.72-1513,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,662.147,671.65,Isn’t that [Inaudible]?
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,671.65,681.546,HEW requires that the states must promptly determine eligibility for assistance and the amount of assistance.
1973.72-1513,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,681.546,683.767,Individual by individual?
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,683.767,685.086,No Your Honor.
1973.72-1513,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,693.292,695.606,But I’m talking about this letter that Justice Stewart mentioned.
1973.72-1513,0,20753,douglas_d_doane,,695.606,696.791,The most recent letter?
1973.72-1513,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,696.791,698.98,Yes.
1973.72-1513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,698.98,704.471,"Which we must treat as a supplement to his brief, I’m sure you would agree, would you not?"
1973.72-1513,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,704.471,708.075,"Yes Your Honor, I think the letter --"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1105.643,1109.58,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1328.62,1332.195,"They looked at it -- they didn’t look at it, didn’t they?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1332.195,1347.399,"Yes, Your Honor and it is our position that they did not look fully at those work expenses and they failed to disregard reasonable work expenses in a -- that were reasonably attributable to the earning of income."
1973.72-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1370.053,1393.963,"Whether administratively, would there be any point in determining the average and then allowing everyone -- the average or approximately the average, including those who have no expense at all and then allowing supplements for those who went above this hypothetical average?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1393.963,1404.18,"Well, Your Honor, Judge Rouse in the trial court asked whether it made any sense to allow $30.00 per month to recipients who in fact had no expenses or less than that."
1973.72-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1431.729,1450.393,"Would it be administratively feasible, given if you know, given the number of people involved to allow $10.00 a month and then such additions as people could demonstrate by vouchers or by whatever process they do it?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1450.393,1456.23,"Well, Your Honor, this question of administrative efficiency has never been actually litigated in the courts below."
1973.72-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1501.846,1517.481,"Well, could not the State of Colorado constitutionally allow no expense except that that was demonstrable by the same kind of evidence that this lady has produced here?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1517.481,1543.2,"Your Honor, I think the State of Colorado by its participation in the AFDC program has to follow these -- this statute, (a) (7) and that statute requires both the recipient to demonstrate an entitlement to each and every expense and also the State of Colorado to disregard each and every expense as long as its reasonably attributable with their earning of income, yes."
1973.72-1513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1748.1,1755.204,[Inaudible] given this same interpretation?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1755.204,1758.743,"Your Honor, we believe that our position is supported by decisions --"
1973.72-1513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1758.743,1759.885,No conflict as I understand?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1759.885,1769.018,"No, there’s a decision in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the Connecticut State Department versus HEW which we believes supports our position."
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1791.124,1795.563,"That December 23 decision, it’s in your briefs anyway?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1795.563,1803.421,"Your Honor, I believe Anderson versus Graham is set out in appendix E to the respondent’s brief."
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1803.421,1805.887,Thank you.
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1805.887,1810.437,Yes.
1973.72-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1827.014,1829.214,"If you can, of course."
1973.72-1513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1829.214,1832.712,May I ask what the response -- tenor of the response maybe?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1832.712,1846.902,"Well, Your Honor we have not carefully analyzed the contents of this letter, but we do agree that apparently the Secretary of HEW is now taking a position that they didn’t take on October 4 when they filed their original brief."
1973.72-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.437,1864.892,Mr. Armour.
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1864.892,1865.866,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.866,1891.439,"At page 14 of your appendix whether complaint appears, apparently its paragraph 9, you call it ahead of the constitutional claim then you say Section such and such of the Colorado manual of public assistance imposes an arbitrary maximum on employment expense in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1903.201,1912.977,"Your Honor, may I first answer the question by saying that petitioners correctly stated that this issue was not argued at any point."
1973.72-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.761,1915.823,"It is jurisdictional though, I would think."
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1919.793,1934.231,"Well, Your Honor, our complaint was filed under Section -- Title 42, Section 1983 and the jurisdictional sections that we relied upon were 28 United States Code, Section 1343."
1973.72-1513,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.577,1986.913,"Well, don’t they have go to it at least to assure themselves that it’s not frivolous or insubstantial?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1986.913,1990.215,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1513,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.215,1993.857,Did you urge it all to Judge Rouse?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,1993.857,2007.755,"I -- Your Honor, at the time this action was commenced, there was a different counsel arguing the case, but to my best knowledge, the constitutional issue was presented and we did in fact want to argue it."
1973.72-1513,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2019.053,2022.633,"Well, did you press it upon in the briefs or anything at all before?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2022.633,2026.66,"Your Honor, the first -- it was done orally."
1973.72-1513,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2045.5,2050.351,It’s pretty important to you isn’t it otherwise your case goes out the Court?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2050.351,2082.188,"Yes Your Honor, certainly is, but we think there is a substantial constitutional issue and that this Court I believe in Rosado versus Wyman which has been cited for other purposes before by petitioners states that this Court does have jurisdiction to decide statutory issues raised along with claims with constitutional violation."
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2082.188,2090.282,Was the jurisdictional question as such brought to the attention of the District Court or to the Court of Appeal?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2090.282,2091.701,To the District Court Your Honor.
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2091.746,2094.404,Was a motion to dismiss for one of jurisdiction?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2094.404,2098.523,"No, not a motion that was either filed or argued."
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2098.523,2103.479,And -- so how was it brought to the attention of the District Court?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2103.479,2112.778,At the time that plaintiff went to U.S. District Court in Denver to see contemporary restrain order enjoining enforcement of the regulation.
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2129.477,2136.529,And the -- I think your fellow counsel may ask have help for their -- on this question.
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2136.529,2137.293,No.
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.293,2138.916,No?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2146.738,2148.096,The appendix Your Honor --
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.096,2174.438,"You answered, as I understand it correctly, that if there is probably a substantial constitutional claim, the statutory claim was pendent to it and that there is no -- can be no question of jurisdiction but on the other hand if the constitutional claim is frivolous then there’s a very great question about whether there is jurisdiction under these jurisdictional statutes?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2174.438,2178.091,"Well, Your Honor, we certainly I think we have substantial statutory provision, one that can be --"
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2178.091,2181.491,"Well, I know, but that’s not enough, -- they're arguably?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2181.491,2201.831,"Yes, but in addition I mean I think it can be well -- well recognized that it whether -- you have two classifications of working (Inaudible) recipients, one with less than $30.00 per month work expenses and another with more than $30.00 per month work expenses."
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2214.168,2220.566,"And was that again, may I, I am not sure, and I don't mean to be repetitious but I’m not sure I understand your answer."
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2226.172,2235.181,"Your Honor, it was brought to the attention of the U.S. District Court judge at the time there was a hearing to determine whether injunctive relief should be granted."
1973.72-1513,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2235.181,2239.189,Does the injunct -- does the appendix reflect that fact anywhere?
1973.72-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2239.189,2239.909,The District Court had --
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2239.909,2242.466,"No, Your Honor, I believe it does not."
1973.72-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2242.466,2258.549,"-- recorded on page 44 of the appendix, has a sentence saying that the respondent have also raised these constitutional questions which are not under consideration at this time, it's top of page 44."
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2263.007,2268.351,"Yes, Your Honor, that is the first memorandum opinion I believe of the U.S. District Court."
1973.72-1513,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2268.351,2274.397,Were they considered at a later time?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2274.397,2278.662,"No, Your Honor, they were not."
1973.72-1513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2278.662,2305.627,"So, I gather Mr. Armour, there are -- suggest that or implies at least to -- with the -- Judge Rouse thought that there maybe enough for the convening of a three-judge court about that -- in your constitutional claim about that -- he wouldn’t recommend that if -- since the case could be disposed of under statutory claim?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2305.627,2306.876,Yes.
1973.72-1513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2310.769,2311.869,So that falls?
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2311.869,2312.525,Yes.
1973.72-1513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2312.525,2323.025,"But he said that but -- he wouldn’t convene a three-judge court since there was -- or wouldn’t worth convening, only if the case can’t be disposed of on the statutory ground?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2323.025,2326.286,I think Your Honor that clearly implies that he felt that was a question (Voice Overlap).
1973.72-1513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2326.286,2327.875,(Voice Overlap)
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2327.875,2328.276,Yes.
1973.72-1513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2328.276,2340.67,"Justified and in Goosby last year, I guess we set down the standard of what kind of constitutional claim required the convening of a three judge court, didn’t we?"
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2340.67,2341.94,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1513,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2341.94,2347.266,And it wasn’t a non-frivolous or I've forgotten -- that’s rather a broad language.
1973.72-1513,1,42376,tom_w_armour,,2347.266,2360.106,"Well, Your Honor we think, we certainly have a non-frivolous constitutional claim as well as a statutory argument that that holds up under close analysis."
1973.72-1513,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2620.068,2624.803,Thank you Mr. Armour.
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,2628.885,2631.833,May it please the Court.
1973.72-1513,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.032,2746.06,How do you view the purpose of your standard allowance rather than the actual?
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,2746.06,2763.604,The purpose of the standard allowance is largely to reduce the amount of time that an individual eligibility technician at the county level has to spend dealing with each case and there’s a discounted --
1973.72-1513,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2763.604,2773.309,Would the other way of doing it going to the actual expenses also delay the starting of welfare?
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,2773.309,2781.424,"Unless the staff was increased considerably, we could anticipate that it would delay the process in individual cases."
1973.72-1513,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.424,2784.448,And hence the beginning of welfare payments?
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,2784.448,2787.798,Correct.

1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,2804.391,2817.599,"Under the older rule where we would give itemized consideration, once she was no longer in making car payments they would no longer be actual work expenses and her work expense allowance would be reduced by that (Voice Overlap) --"
1973.72-1513,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2817.599,2829.649,So in effect her claim now is that capital expenditure is one that’s properly taken into account as an expense --
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,2829.649,2830.0,That is correct.

1973.72-1513,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3023.572,3026.302,I thought my question was $10.00.

1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,3036.379,3057.197,"What the state’s position is in this case is that once the dollar amount is fixed by a reasonably statistical basis it could if it wanted to pay in excess of that average figure, but it doesn’t have to, that it’s permissible under the Social Security Act to stick with the flat amount."
1973.72-1513,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3073.897,3092.403,"According to the Solicitor General’s letter of yesterday is, at least as I read it, makes the last paragraph on page 2, he says, “Furthermore we inform that no state plan containing a standard working expense allowance has ever granted beneficiaries the alternative of itemizing.”"
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,3098.992,3099.468,Correct.
1973.72-1513,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3099.468,3104.127,-- adopted the suggestion implicit in the Chief Justice’s question.
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,3104.127,3104.981,Right.

1973.72-1513,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3115.494,3116.025,Right.
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,3116.025,3119.128,Correct.
1973.72-1513,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.379,3163.176,"Well, I don’t suppose the parties or the judge can stipulate the jurisdiction?"
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,3163.176,3178.258,"I forgot the exact text of the pretrial order, but I would presume that the context was that there was a constitutional question sufficient to give pendent jurisdiction and then they proceeded to handle the case on the statutory basis."

1973.72-1513,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3357.502,3359.816,What paragraph?
1973.72-1513,2,19412,charles_b_lennahan,,3359.816,3364.671,I’m suggesting a reference be inserted after the second full paragraph on page --
