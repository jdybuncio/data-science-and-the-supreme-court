2010.08-1438,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.452,"We will hear argument in 08-1438, Sossamon v. Texas."
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,7.654,18.795,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: By accepting Federal funds for its prisons, Texas consented to suit for appropriate relief for violations of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act."
2010.08-1438,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,49.247,69.56,"Now, what would it be, Mr. Russell, if there were a suit under RFRA because a Federal penal institution was not allowing for the religious practices that the act protects?"
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,69.56,72.179,In--
2010.08-1438,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,72.179,79.849,"In a suit under RFRA, could there be -- would damages be an appropriate remedy?"
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,79.849,85.836,"--In our view they are, although it's a different context, and we recognize that the government disagrees with us on that."
2010.08-1438,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,101.945,102.445,"Well, could we back up."
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,109.249,125.727,"That is our view, although we recognize that RLUIPA is different in this respect, in that it's a Spending Clause statute under which -- and this Court's decision in Barnes v. Gorman makes clear that damages are traditionally appropriate relief for the violation of any Spending Clause statute."
2010.08-1438,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.708,155.56,"But did it use such language as ""appropriate relief""?"
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,155.56,156.246,"--Well, for example--"
2010.08-1438,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.246,157.146,"I mean, that's the question."
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,173.338,177.807,"--No, we are not saying that the word ""appropriate relief"" in itself supplies the clarity."
2010.08-1438,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,237.679,245.851,"The contract analogy, I suppose, would provide that the meaning of the contract is interpreted against the drafter."
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,247.818,249.887,That would have been true in Barnes as well.
2010.08-1438,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,249.887,250.403,Yes.
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,259.092,263.312,"Well, it gets the same amount of help that the local governments got in Barnes, which wasn't enough."
2010.08-1438,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,276.47,302.687,"Mr. Russell, the State looks at this statute and says, oh, this statute preserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no damages without having a physical injury."
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,315.412,317.031,"Well, I would say two things about that."
2010.08-1438,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.953,360.523,"But in the prison setting, then, isn't it an academic question, because there are not going to be damages anyway?"
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,360.523,362.892,"No, that's not true, for a couple of reasons."
2010.08-1438,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,401.628,402.794,Does it include punitive damages?
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,402.794,403.744,--Excuse me?
2010.08-1438,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,403.744,405.913,Does it include punitive damages?
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,405.913,416.47,"The statute, I think, does not in light of Barnes, because Barnes said that you get traditional contract remedies and punitive damages are not a traditional contract remedy."
2010.08-1438,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.602,509.128,"Yeah, but -- but, I mean, that means either that the Federal Government -- that the State government is liable for damages just as municipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to suit for damages just as the States are."
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,511.478,513.68,"Well, I will point you to other provisions of the statute."
2010.08-1438,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.68,515.698,"Well, maybe let's talk about them, then."
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,515.698,516.082,Okay.
2010.08-1438,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,539.161,544.499,"Well, except this would be a violation of a statute, not a violation of a constitutional right."
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,552.086,557.723,"Well, I would set aside the question of whether Ex parte Young applies of its own force."
2010.08-1438,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.841,604.184,"Well, I can conceive of a case where -- where the State's violation of RLUIPA consists of a State statute that simply deprives the individual of his rights under RLUIPA."
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,616.325,626.514,"I think it's common in that circumstance to sue the State attorney general for Ex parte Young relief, for example, if you have a constitutional claim against the statute, as may very well have happened in the California case, or the governor, I guess."
2010.08-1438,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,671.458,681.997,Isn't it argued that a possible purpose of that was to make it clear that the Federal Government couldn't sue a State to recover money that had been given to it?
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,681.997,684.432,"--Well, the fact -- I would say two things about that."
2010.08-1438,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,774.34,786.398,You addressed the -- the effect of the issue here on persons who are in State institutions other than penal institutions.
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,802.471,803.288,It's quite rare.
2010.08-1438,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,839.875,853.198,"But the answer to Justice Alito's question is that in the land use area, zoning for example, those are mostly cases against municipalities or counties?"
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,853.198,853.965,That is correct.
2010.08-1438,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,853.965,854.634,Not against the State.
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,854.634,855.467,That is correct.
2010.08-1438,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,855.467,867.275,The government is going to tell us that the standard for waiver with respect to the Federal Government is different from the standard with respect to the State.
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,870.108,870.81,No.
2010.08-1438,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,900.927,905.562,But it seems to me that the States are in need of special protection.
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,912.901,913.735,--Well--
2010.08-1438,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,913.735,915.618,That just can't happen with the State.
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,915.618,923.355,--I don't know that this Court's cases support the idea that -- that heightened clear statement rule for States versus the Federal Government.
2010.08-1438,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,927.426,932.144,It's the suggestion of the opposite that -- that I am trying -- I am trying to explore.
2010.08-1438,0,33970,kevin_k_russell,,933.912,934.679,Thank you.
2010.08-1438,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,934.679,936.547,"Thank you, Mr. Russell."
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,945.403,947.636,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.08-1438,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,966.566,977.855,Suppose Congress passes a statute that creates a private right of action against both the Federal Government and against the States and in both instances authorizes all appropriate relief.
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,983.742,988.145,"Well, it would depend on the context to answer both questions."
2010.08-1438,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,988.145,992.197,"Well, the State -- the State provision is a Spending Clause provision."
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,992.197,993.966,Then the answer would be yes as to the States.
2010.08-1438,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1002.989,1004.289,And what about the Federal Government?
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1004.289,1011.261,"--In the Federal Government probably not, although this Court has looked to background principles in interpreting words such as ""appropriate""."
2010.08-1438,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1011.261,1012.677,What sense does that make?
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1032.174,1033.14,"Well, I would say two things."
2010.08-1438,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1058.39,1061.61,"But those cases did not involve States, right?"
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1061.61,1063.927,"Those cases did not involve States, that's true."
2010.08-1438,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.646,1091.546,"And I think that the -- the core question here is the State -- and Justice Alito just posed it: the State is being treated with less dignity than the Federal Government, because your position is that the Federal Government is shielded by its sovereign immunity, and you say the State is not."
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1091.546,1103.252,"--On the contrary, as to the dignity point, Your Honor, if -- the State voluntarily waives its immunity when it accepts Federal funds that clearly condition the acceptance of the funds on the waiver of its immunity."
2010.08-1438,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1110.839,1127.3,"But we are talking about general principles of interpretation and the proposition that we are suggesting is that the State surely should be entitled to the same dignity, the same protection against suits as the Federal Government, and you suggest just the opposite."
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1127.3,1127.917,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.08-1438,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1127.917,1135.104,And it seems to me that's contrary to standard principles of the Federal -- of protecting the Federal balance.
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1135.104,1145.662,"If you were construing a State statute that voluntarily waived its own immunity, then you might -- we might say the use of appropriate relief in that statute should be construed the same as the use of appropriate relief in RFRA."
2010.08-1438,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1164.291,1170.694,But it's -- but it's only because they accept the funds at all that the Spending -- that the Spending Clause is even operative.
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1170.694,1171.61,That's right.
2010.08-1438,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1177.664,1182.133,"But the waiver -- I mean, on the State side they can say it says ""appropriate relief""."
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1206.117,1216.056,--But there is no basis in either the Eleventh Amendment or the statutory provisions in RLUIPA for distinguishing relief of an injunctive nature from relief in damages against the State.
2010.08-1438,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.397,1233.682,"The word ""appropriate"" -- the word ""appropriate"" would -- would suggest that to me."
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1273.14,1273.99,--But even--
2010.08-1438,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1273.99,1291.535,"And -- and although I might sit down and come out with a conclusion after intensive study that yes, maybe the best reading of this statute is that it allows money damages, I find it hard to say that it is unequivocally expressed in the statutory text."
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1291.535,1292.971,"--Well, two things if I could, Your Honor."
2010.08-1438,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1313.032,1315.484,You -- you deny that it has to be unequivocal?
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1315.484,1335.231,"--It has to be unequivocal, but -- but the context in which you are construing whether -- whether the sovereign is expressing its intent to waive its immunity is different when you are talking about the Federal Government applying obligations on itself than when you are talking about the Federal Government offering money to a State in -- in exchange for its agreeing to comply with--"
2010.08-1438,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1335.231,1339.582,But that has nothing to do with whether the language is clear or not to constitute a waiver.
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1353.942,1354.459,--Right.
2010.08-1438,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1400.823,1425.371,"What do you say about -- I think I read in one of these briefs that what I think is the most relevant similar statute, RFRA, has been held not to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the monetary relief, and also there was some legislative history where people testified and told Congress at the time that the word ""appropriate"" won't encompass monetary relief."
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1427.273,1435.413,"Well, I would give you the same answer I just gave, which is that we are not pointing so much to the use of the -- using the phrase ""appropriate relief"" in the statute as we are to the Spending Clause context."
2010.08-1438,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1448.487,1452.791,But then you're bracketing the State with counties and municipalities.
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1487.714,1493.35,"Well, this Court has consistently applied a clear notice requirement to conditions that Congress places on Federal funds."
2010.08-1438,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1547.252,1548.819,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.08-1438,1,41459,sarah_harrington,,1548.819,1549.319,Thank you.
2010.08-1438,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.319,1553.573,Mr. Ho.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1553.573,1564.095,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: the phrase ""appropriate relief"" is a textbook example of ambiguity, not unmistakable clarity."
2010.08-1438,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1566.297,1570.416,"If it is, why is injunctive relief included at all?"
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1580.473,1584.925,We agree with the U.S.'s reading of RFRA.
2010.08-1438,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1595.73,1604.003,Some would say that injunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then compensatory relief.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1617.643,1619.345,"--Two answers, Your Honor."
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1692.44,1695.492,I was looking at the cases the best I can at the moment.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1768.724,1770.059,"I think I do, Your Honor."
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1787.319,1790.069,"I know, but isn't it the same word that governs both?"
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1790.069,1791.604,It is the same word.
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1791.604,1800.543,"If it's the same word that governs both and if land cases very often involve claims for money, I would think that would cut against you."
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1804.612,1808.147,"Well, we are still looking for express language in the text."
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1808.147,1815.735,But there are loads of cases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and in those cases context makes it clear.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1823.989,1830.245,RFRA certainly is the direct context from which the words appropriate relief in this statute are drawn.
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.245,1836.983,Uh-huh.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1836.983,1854.176,"So for that reason alone, I think we might resist the notion that the specific uses of appropriate relief in RLUIPA would somehow provide any sort of change or certainly any expectation that we would have or that Congress would have, for that matter, that the words appropriate relief would take on a new meaning just because it's land use."
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1854.176,1862.281,"I mean, so often, what I'm thinking of, a church wands to build, and they can't because of a land restriction."
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1878.726,1880.11,I'm not sure though--
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.11,1881.678,To fulfill appropriateness.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1881.678,1884.797,--I'm actually not sure that that would be true even in that context.
2010.08-1438,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1918.434,1921.886,I thought a local government would be subject to damages.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,1923.672,1925.622,"We are talking about the state, Your Honor."
2010.08-1438,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1969.23,1971.848,So now we have three distinctions.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2011.807,2013.557,"That would not be our submission, Your Honor."
2010.08-1438,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2039.706,2041.14,Could you explain why?
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2041.14,2041.707,--Sure.
2010.08-1438,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2071.077,2072.693,But equity permits money as well.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2075.362,2081.116,"--In some limited formats, but it wouldn't be compensatory damages in the sense that we are talking about in this case."
2010.08-1438,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2117.689,2122.842,"Before you do that, Barnes and Franklin were cases involving implied rights of action; isn't that right?"
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2122.842,2126.544,Yes.
2010.08-1438,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2129.377,2131.929,Okay.
2010.08-1438,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2131.929,2146.856,"And I'm -- this one question may be covered, but can you give me any examples where States have turned down money under the Spending Clause, say we don't want it, the restrictions are too great?"
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2149.724,2151.01,Where States turn down money?
2010.08-1438,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2151.01,2153.778,"Where States tell the Federal Government: No, thank you, we don't want the money."
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2153.778,2155.878,It's starting to happen in Texas.
2010.08-1438,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2155.878,2160.866,Under programs like this?
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2160.866,2167.002,I don't -- I can't think of a situation where Texas has turned down RLUIPA Federal prison money.
2010.08-1438,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2167.954,2172.256,"I mean other States -- they say, oh, the liabilities are just too great, we don't want it?"
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2172.256,2176.874,--I'm not aware of any State in the country that has turned down Federal prison funds.
2010.08-1438,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2385.471,2403.016,"What do you do with the practical problem that's been brought up that if a State is sued, it can release the prisoner, it can transfer the prisoner, and then no relief is appropriate?"
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2414.49,2428.231,"If a prisoner is transferred, released, or the State simply changes its mind and gives up and provides the accommodation, in all those situations, the prisoner is no longer suffering from the complaint of condition."
2010.08-1438,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2452.865,2461.035,"What's the inducement to do it more quickly rather than to delay, to remedy the wrong faster rather than to delay?"
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2461.035,2462.821,--The reason to do it?
2010.08-1438,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2462.821,2463.504,Uh-huh.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2463.504,2465.173,Simply to avoid litigation.
2010.08-1438,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2481.563,2499.058,"That's an ideal world, that they'll respond, but there is an allegation that some prisons wait until the eve of the trial after onerous discovery on the plaintiff and after enormous harm to plaintiffs, physical and otherwise, before they capitulate."
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2500.493,2503.028,"--Well, the inducement is to--"
2010.08-1438,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2503.028,2504.262,To move faster.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2504.262,2507.464,--States are -- States are suffering the litigation costs as well.
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2567.132,2569.2,Let me ask -- get this information from you.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2610.277,2612.144,--Those are two great examples.
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2612.144,2613.31,"Yes, but are there any others?"
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2616.612,2616.996,Sure.
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2619.181,2619.698,All right.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2621.75,2624.035,"--No, no -- I would actually -- I would note there are two other cases--"
2010.08-1438,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2624.035,2624.218,What?
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2624.218,2627.237,"--that I would refer you to, and of course discussed in the briefs."
2010.08-1438,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2716.276,2726.714,You -- you have already addressed this but I think it's their -- the position of your friend on the other side of the case is that with the Spending Clause you have a contract.
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2766.708,2771.176,I'll try to take each of those points in turn.
2010.08-1438,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2852.358,2853.524,"Thank you, Mr. Ho."
2010.08-1438,2,30685,james_c_ho,,2853.524,2853.908,Thank you.
2010.08-1438,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2853.908,2861.995,"Mr. Russell, you have four minutes remaining."
2010.08-1438,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2861.995,2862.764,Thank you.
2010.08-1438,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.926,2946.692,Was that contested in Barnes?
2010.08-1438,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2946.692,2948.561,"Which part, I'm sorry."
2010.08-1438,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2948.561,2955.032,Was the liability for compensatory damages contested in Barnes?
2010.08-1438,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2955.032,2955.365,No.
2010.08-1438,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2956.715,2957.598,Just punitive.
2010.08-1438,3,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2965.304,2993.454,"Well, the legal principle this Court adopted to resolve that issue was one that, I take it, was not just a principle for that case, but that in general, funding recipients are on notice that they are subject to contract remedies and unless this Court is going to back away from that as a general matter, unless the Court is going to say that Pennhurst applies differently in the Spending Clause context than it does in the sovereign immunity context, I don't see how you can come to a different result in this case."
2010.08-1438,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3105.107,3106.041,"Thank you, counsel."
