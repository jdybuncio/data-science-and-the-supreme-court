1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.706,We'll hear arguments next in St. Martin's Evangelical Church v. South Dakota.
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,100.866,103.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,289.087,294.555,sSuppose there had never been that third exception?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,299.709,302.661,I think that third exception was--
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.661,304.013,Do you think it is just superfluous or not?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,304.013,308.215,--I think it had no effect on parochial schools.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.215,310.0,It did on nonparochial?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,310.0,315.135,"It did on other nonprofit schools, and perhaps it had an effect on public schools."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.135,322.058,But it was never needed to exempt the kinds of schools involved in this case?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,322.058,324.041,"That's our position, yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,324.041,329.395,"Although that was never the view of the Service, I guess?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,329.395,337.651,That was not the view of the Labor Department after repeal.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.651,339.353,Or before.
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,339.353,352.327,"Well, I think, before, Mr. Justice, it never had occasion to arise, and I don't think the Secretary of Labor--"
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.327,353.71,Didn't they issue exemptions?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,353.71,358.731,"--No, you don't get an exemption, the exemption is automatic, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.881,361.199,So you never have to--
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,361.199,364.135,--You don't apply or do anything to get it.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,368.52,376.459,--So you never knew why the tax wasn't collected from religious schools?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,382.947,384.215,That's correct.
1980.80-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,411.782,414.834,Are you talking about the South Dakota statute?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,414.834,420.055,"I'm talking about the South Dakota statute, which is a mirror image of the federal statute."
1980.80-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.055,426.292,"But if the South Dakota Supreme Court has construed the South Dakota statute, aren't we bound by that?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,426.292,436.849,"I don't think so, Mr. Justice, because the South Dakota statute is so closely interwoven with the federal statute, and--"
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,436.849,450.824,"That question bothered me, in reading the briefs in this case, and the only discussion of it I found was in Footnote 2 of the Government's amicus brief which is rather short; it may be correct."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,458.53,470.155,"--Well, I suggest, Mr. Justice, that it does not because the penalties to the states, if they don't comply, are so severe--"
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,470.155,478.86,"But the State Supreme Court seemed to be talking about the South Dakota law, didn't it?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,478.86,479.96,"--Mr. Justice, I think--"
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,479.96,485.58,"It sets it out on page A-3 of its opinion, and that's the one it discusses."
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,485.58,503.459,"Are you suggesting that because of the interaction with the federal law and the question in the case, that that alters the usual rule that we won't reexamine a state court's interpretation of its own statutes?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,503.459,504.375,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,520.485,537.53,"You're saying, then, it's like the Zacchini v. Scripps case we decided two or three years ago where we felt that the state court might have decided this case differently had they not been under a misapprehension as to federal law?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,537.53,539.898,"I think that's correct, yes; Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.898,557.76,"Well, suppose we ruled that the federal law didn't intend to subject religious schools to this tax?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,568.401,576.988,"We think this Court has power, Mr. Justice, to overrule and reverse the South Dakota Supreme Court--"
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.988,579.523,"Well, not as to the meaning of a South Dakota statute."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,583.911,594.85,"Until the Supreme Court changed its mind, the South Dakota statute would continue to mean exactly what it meant."
1980.80-120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.85,615.965,"Well, unless, under cases like Zacchini or Benguet Consolidated Mines, we were to vacate and remand for reconsideration free of any misapprehension the state court might have had about the federal law question involved."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,615.965,624.921,"--If you did not want to get to the constitutional question, yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,630.123,661.161,"Well, the point of it is that if your state supreme court construed the statute in reliance on an understanding of federal law that we say was erroneous, and we send it back, we couldn't change it from your state supreme court; but we could send it back to them, that's the suggestion, and let them reconsider their interpretation of the state statute in light of what we've said about the federal question."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,661.161,664.696,"That might be correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.80-120,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,671.367,672.802,"Well, we might have another case."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,672.802,674.052,--And we'd have another case.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.995,769.014,And the Department of Labor.
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,769.014,773.584,"--and the Department of Labor is wrong, because a building can't employ somebody."
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,919.895,933.238,"Are you saying that they are essentially the same, substantially the same as the Sunday School classes or summer school classes held traditionally at Lutheran churches and others?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,933.238,939.741,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the school is a basic part of the church's mission."
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,939.741,943.51,"In other words, it's an implement of the faith of that church?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,943.51,944.795,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,944.795,946.645,Is it governed by state rules?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,952.866,956.937,The state rules of education?
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,956.937,959.389,Do they supervise those schools?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,966.809,977.517,"Mr. Justice, the state heretofore has not really enforced their certification requirements, their attendance requirements."
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,979.651,982.135,"Well, do you do that for your church school?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,982.135,983.17,"Yes, they do."
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,983.17,983.77,The Sunday School?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,984.854,985.706,Not Sunday School.
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,985.706,988.139,"Of course you don't, so they're different, aren't they?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,990.489,995.709,"Well, Sunday Schools are not a requirement of compulsory school attendance."
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,997.309,1001.327,"Well, I mean, you said in answer to the Chief Justice that it was just the same as the Sunday School."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1003.963,1010.367,"--I meant, insofar as the inculcation of religious doctrine goes, I did."
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1022.609,1029.18,"The state has police power to require attendance at primary school, does it not?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1029.18,1029.88,"Yes, it does."
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1029.88,1036.434,"It could not, under the religion clauses, compel attendance at a Sunday School."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1042.671,1043.356,"No, they could not."
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1070.523,1082.898,"You referred to the Synod, and according to your brief the membership of the Synod is the churches themselves rather than church officials, is that correct?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1082.898,1083.398,--That is correct.
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.398,1085.183,In the Lutheran organization?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1085.183,1085.8,That is correct.
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1085.8,1087.067,The dictionary meaning includes both.
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1087.067,1090.604,"That's correct, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1090.604,1096.407,"So the Synod is an assembly or a group of Lutheran churches, not of people?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1096.407,1097.607,That's correct.
1980.80-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.857,1112.098,"Mr. Schilling, maybe I'm laboring the point, but the referee found, as I remember, that the primary purpose of the school was education rather than religious training."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1113.681,1127.774,"Yes, I do dispute that finding The referee found that religion is inculcated in everything they teach, but then he said that the primary purpose was education."
1980.80-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.035,1179.373,"These schools do perform the same educational function that public schools do insofar as the general education that is needed by a child, doesn't it?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1179.373,1180.658,"--They do; yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1180.658,1186.746,"But, certainly, logically, they wouldn't even exist if they didn't have some function beyond that."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1186.746,1188.579,That is correct.
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1200.387,1208.075,"Well, is it any different in this situation from the schools of the Roman Catholic churches and others that we have dealt with?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1208.075,1215.063,I think the situation insofar as Roman Catholic schools or Baptist schools is all the same.
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1232.625,1237.345,"Are these schools restricted to Lutheran children, or can other children attend?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1237.345,1241.047,They're not restricted.
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1248.118,1250.652,"That's not true in the Catholic parochial schools, is it?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1250.652,1252.938,--I can't speak for the Catholic parochial schools.
1980.80-120,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1252.938,1255.556,"Well, you just a minute ago, you did say they were similar, though."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1255.556,1262.294,"Well, I think they're pretty similar, insofar as their... similar insofar as their inculcating of religious doctrine."
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.294,1274.268,"And I gather from what you've just said, or said a few moments ago, that you don't think that the question of whether the church is a separate corporation is a dispositive question?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1274.268,1276.018,"I don't, Your Honor."
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1276.018,1276.768,In this case they are not.
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1276.768,1278.22,I don't think the fact--
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1278.22,1281.688,"I say, in this case they are not, and you rather emphasized that in your statement of the facts."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1281.688,1287.076,"--We emphasized the fact that they are not, because in our case, of course, we have that fact."
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1315.778,1325.801,"So even though something were incorporated separately as a school, albeit a parochial school, that would not be a dispositive question in your submission?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1325.801,1327.351,I don't think that would be a dispositive question.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.351,1335.307,Why are the institutions of higher learning that are religious covered?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1335.307,1337.841,Why are they covered?
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.066,1349.699,"Well, how about for purposes of the statute?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1360.29,1361.857,I think their freedom's--
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.857,1366.028,"Because it's being, it's still part of the church?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1366.028,1374.098,"--But I don't think their purpose in college is primarily religious, that is for most church colleges."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.435,1382.203,"Well, none of them... I mean, all of them are covered."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1382.203,1384.089,--They're included.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.089,1385.289,All of them are included.
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1385.289,1386.774,They're not exempt.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1386.774,1388.474,That's right.
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1398.832,1403.367,"Insofar as colleges, that's correct."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.367,1405.836,How long has that been true?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1405.836,1408.705,"I think, since 1970."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.705,1410.557,Were they not covered before?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1410.557,1412.457,They were not covered before.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.457,1414.425,Because why?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1414.425,1416.543,Because they were a nonprofit corporation.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.678,1422.03,And that was repealed?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1422.03,1424.147,Then that was repealed in 1970.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.034,1434.588,How did you know that colleges were exempt under that section rather than under the church section?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1434.588,1437.874,They were never exempt.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.364,1529.234,Would your argument be different if the exemption that was repealed had exempted the employees of church-related and other private schools?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1529.234,1536.554,"I think our exemption would still come back under 3309(b)(1), either (a) or (b)."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.554,1542.107,Even though Congress had thought that it was repealing the exemption for those people?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1542.107,1543.909,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.909,1564.64,"Well, it seems to me that under the plain language of (1)(a) at least, to be exempt, the employment has to be of the church, or convention, or association churches, not of a separate corporation."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1564.64,1568.425,Under subsection (a)?
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1568.425,1569.009,Right.
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1572.846,1576.048,Except for Congress's definition?
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1576.048,1579.5,"Well, I'm talking about the statutory definition:"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1589.406,1593.574,But they're in the employ of a church.
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1593.574,1596.026,"Of a church, and your clients are, you tell us."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1596.026,1596.493,That's right.
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1596.493,1601.079,"But it would be dispositive of whether or not there were a separate corporation, wouldn't it?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1609.952,1612.721,It might then come under (1)(b).
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1612.721,1614.287,It might or might not come under (1)(b).
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1614.287,1617.106,"That's right, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1617.106,1621.16,"So the corporate organization is dispositive, at least with respect to (1)(a)."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1623.862,1631.349,"I don't think so, because when Congress defined the words"
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1639.086,1644.49,"Well, I'm looking at the statute, which is what Congress enacted."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1650.561,1659.266,"If you'd look strictly at the statute, then it would appear that separate incorporated schools would not come under the subsection (a)."
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.951,1664.07,And that's what you stand on?
1980.80-120,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1664.07,1665.22,He stands on both--
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1665.22,1666.353,I stand on both.
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.353,1667.188,--But you're standing on (b)?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1667.188,1669.974,We're standing primarily on (a).
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1669.974,1672.14,But you are--
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1672.14,1672.807,And (b).
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.807,1673.892,--Standing on (b).
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1674.559,1675.126,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-120,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1675.126,1677.211,"If you can't come under (a), then you'll take (b)?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1677.211,1678.511,Then we'll take (b).
1980.80-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1678.511,1709.099,"Mr. Schilling, insofar as you rely on (b), and of course I understand you disagree with the referee's characterization as to ""operated primarily for educational purposes"", but would it not be necessary in every case involving a church-affiliated school, for the taxing authorities to make it an ad hoc decision as to whether that particular school was primarily for religious purposes or primarily for educational purposes, rather than having a general rule that would cover all schools."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1713.651,1717.621,"Aside from this constitutional question, that might be the answer, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.621,1724.459,There might be a large number of individual determinations that would have to be made in order to determine the scope of (1)(b).
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1724.459,1726.644,"That's quite possible, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.644,1731.596,"Then you'd have to decide what ""religion"" was, too."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1731.596,1737.868,"That might be, but we might have the establishment problem."
1980.80-120,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1737.868,1742.653,"Well, your problems were certainly non-existent before they repealed (3)."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1742.653,1743.986,That's right; we had no problem.
1980.80-120,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1743.986,1751.323,"It fell right under (3) and now you say, you also fall under (1)(a) and (1)(b) if you can't get under (1)(a)?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1751.323,1751.592,And (1)(b).
1980.80-120,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1754.159,1760.448,Would you comment just on one thing that's mentioned in the opinion below.
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1772.255,1788.782,"Well, with respect to those numbers, all I can say is, in a footnote in that report, there was a bigger number of 261,000, instead of the 242,000."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.798,1843.519,Were there any hearings on this exemption?
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1847.903,1860.444,"Yes, but the primary hearings were, all involved the public or the state and local employees."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1860.444,1869.586,"But there's nothing in the hearings, no data in the hearings as to what kind of employees, how many employees were being affected?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1869.586,1876.156,"Mr. Justice, never in the Congressional Record or debates does the word ""church"" or ""church employees"" appear."
1980.80-120,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1876.156,1880.125,"Where did those figures come from, those 242 and 261?"
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.125,1885.945,"The figure was 242,000 employees of private schools."
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1888.13,1889.297,"That's correct, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1889.297,1890.499,"Well, where did that come from?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1893.099,1896.403,I don't know.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1903.39,1906.175,"I know, but in the congressional hearings?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1906.175,1906.642,No.
1980.80-120,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.961,1912.079,"Nothing in the hearings, nothing in the testimony taken, none of the correspondence?"
1980.80-120,0,23129,edward_thomas_schilling,,1912.079,1914.198,"None that I found, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.733,1919.935,I'm afraid your time has expired.
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,1927.438,1935.092,Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:
1980.80-120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.698,2259.654,"Well, you normally, though... you wouldn't suggest that normally, when you use the word ""church"" you think about a church school at the same time?"
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2259.654,2261.922,"No, sir, I think you'd normally--"
1980.80-120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.922,2266.91,In ordinary language you'd talk about those things as different entities.
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2266.91,2268.86,"--Mr. Justice White, I think normally--"
1980.80-120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.86,2270.112,"And, legally, you're quite right."
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2277.181,2280.05,"--Mr. Justice White, I think it does depend--"
1980.80-120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.05,2284.185,"Ask anybody where he works, he says, I work at the Baptist school."
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2286.787,2291.941,"--I think it is correct, Mr. Justice White, that it depends somewhat on the context in which you're speaking."
1980.80-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2334.452,2345.576,"Of course, in this case, the employees in question were in the employ of a church, in one case, or an association of churches in the other, were they not?"
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2345.576,2346.695,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, that's correct."
1980.80-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2346.695,2347.262,However defined.
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2347.262,2351.064,"Well, the Secretary defines the word to mean the building."
1980.80-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2355.55,2360.252,"Well, you could be employed by a church and work in some other building, I suppose."
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2360.252,2362.954,"Well, perhaps that's their point."
1980.80-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2362.954,2366.089,Or you could work in a church building and be employed by somebody else.
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2366.089,2376.381,"We submit that in this context the word ""church"" must include the legal entity that controls the building and that hires and fires the employees."
1980.80-120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2376.381,2399.227,"If the building is relevant at all to the legal issues in this case, is it not a fact that in many cases churches and parochial schools are all one structure, a city block, one part of it assigned for worship services, and one part assigned for teaching?"
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2400.496,2401.362,That is exactly--
1980.80-120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2401.362,2403.964,"The building isn't really very important to the legal issue, is it?"
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2403.964,2405.733,--I don't believe it is.
1980.80-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2449.227,2451.31,Would this also apply to a church hospital?
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2451.31,2457.814,"--Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe that all church hospitals are separately incorporated."
1980.80-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.666,2464.503,"Well, if there possibly would be one that wasn't incorporated?"
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2464.503,2470.64,"--If, Mr. Justice Marshall, if the hospital were part of the church itself, were not separately incorporated--"
1980.80-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2470.64,2483.298,"I'm not talking about the church, I'm talking about St. Isaac's Hospital that's three blocks away from the church but it's owned by the church."
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2483.298,2489.285,"--If it is part of the church, not a separate corporation, then the literal language--"
1980.80-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2489.285,2493.506,I didn't say... you charged on; I told you the facts.
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2495.322,2506.23,"--What I mean to suggest, Mr. Justice, is that if the employees of that hospital are employed by the church entity, as in this case, their salaries paid--"
1980.80-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2506.23,2507.08,They are paid by the--
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2507.08,2507.814,--from the church account.
1980.80-120,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.814,2510.782,--They are paid by the hospital but the money comes from the church?
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2510.782,2523.858,"If the hospital has a separate legal identity, in other words, a separate bank account, a separate association, corporation, or structure, then we think that it would not fit within the language of (b)(1)(a)."
1980.80-120,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.858,2528.077,"And if the school does, likewise?"
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2528.077,2529.76,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.80-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.099,2540.801,May I ask just one question?
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2565.166,2569.487,"That's only true, Mr. Justice Stevens, if you focus on private schools."
1980.80-120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.683,2629.776,"Is it not true that normally when one, just as you say, when you work for a school or a church, the same sort of question, when you talk about private schools, private secondary schools, for the most part you are encompassing within that concept a very large number of parochial schools, aren't you?"
1980.80-120,1,17051,allen_r_snyder,,2639.964,2651.456,"--I agree, the great majority of nonprofit private schools are parochial schools but the phrase, nonprofit schools, was not in the language that you quoted, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.80-120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2661.83,2662.314,Very well.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2664.532,2667.215,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2724.403,2732.426,"Well, I take it your point is that if they share some of these things, this dilutes the church or religious aspect."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2733.009,2745.567,"--No, not so much that as to the point made by my colleague that there will be entanglement, should this one small portion of the operation of these parochial schools be subject to some taxation."
1980.80-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2816.796,2818.448,What about the teachers?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2819.364,2825.352,"--Well, I think that some would be and some would not be, depending on a factual determination."
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2842.027,2858.006,"In any event, all of them are in the employ, either of St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church, on the one hand, in the one case, or by the Synod in the other case."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2858.889,2860.108,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2860.108,2865.679,Whether they're cafeteria employees or janitors or lay teachers or whatever?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2865.679,2866.612,That's correct.
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2895.881,2896.981,It's always what?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2896.981,2898.483,"It's always ""church school""."
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2927.067,2928.585,"General, that's the point I want."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2937.608,2943.679,"Well, we don't have an income tax in our state, but I would say this, that--"
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.679,2946.631,Are they considered that for federal income taxes?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2946.631,2947.281,--No.
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2959.489,2961.14,"If that applied, of course that'd apply to this too."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2961.14,2961.99,--That's right.
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.685,2990.993,"But you would concede, I gather, that a cook in a church, which everybody agreed was a church, a church building, would be exempt under (1)(a), wouldn't it?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,2990.993,2993.243,"No, I did not agree under (1)(a)."
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3006.253,3016.524,"Well, then, you do not concede that when the statute exempts people in the employ of a church, that it exempts janitors in the employ of the church?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3016.524,3023.262,"I did, sir, but the State can make the determination of what is a church purpose, and in this case--"
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3023.262,3027.682,"In my hypothetical case, he sweeps up the church building."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3027.682,3032.32,"--Well, I guess it's a matter of interpretation of the statute."
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3032.32,3035.003,"And he's employed by the church, and only by the church."
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3037.705,3040.324,Let's take a concrete example.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3052.983,3053.633,Yes.
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3057.951,3059.303,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3075.579,3077.265,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3152.079,3160.752,"How do you suggest that differs from the states which require attendance, so far as the issues here are concerned?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3160.752,3169.857,"Well, I think it goes to the definition and the exemptions, and I think that we recognize, as the Court does, that this does have to be applied across the land."
1980.80-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.198,3244.239,Might they not have been both a school and also an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes before (3) was repealed?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3244.239,3246.255,They might have been.
1980.80-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3274.858,3285.364,All you're saying is that by qualifying as a school they would have come under (3) if it were still in existence.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3288.518,3311.597,"Well, I believe it does, because what our appeals referee decided and our Supreme Court decided is that this school, St. Martin's Academy, which is still going on, was not primarily for religious purposes but was primarily for educational purposes, and to be taught with religious overtones, you might say, or in the way that they wish to do it."
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3313.466,3324.441,"But narrowly, narrowly, the church's embarking in this enterprise is for strictly religious purposes, is it not?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3324.441,3327.226,"It could be, but there is a desire wherein I believe--"
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3327.226,3332.111,"They don't want the public school system, or some of the people don't?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3340.367,3342.919,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-120,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3343.969,3354.21,"Mr. Attorney General, may I ask, I gather that (a), obviously, is limited; (b) can't include a church, because (a) is the exemption for a church."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3361.63,3368.386,--I think it would be those instances where it was an institution to train ministers and only--
1980.80-120,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3368.386,3369.203,"Seminaries, you mean?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3369.203,3369.803,--Seminaries?
1980.80-120,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3370.886,3372.338,"Why couldn't they say, seminaries?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3376.373,3394.434,"Well, it's not for me to... but I think that it also goes to this extent, Mr. Justice, that certain publishing duties, perhaps certain insurance duties, that would only have something to do with perhaps the churches themselves, not a true free marketplace-type company."
1980.80-120,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3412.496,3423.954,"If they have a diocesan paper, for example, and they have their own print shop, would the printers, do you think, fall under (b) as exempt under (b)?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3423.954,3435.928,"--I would think not because of the Pilgrim Holiness case which applied the minimum wage requirements of the Fair Labor Act, because in that case, which this Court denied cert; it was a lower court case, but--"
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3435.928,3441.398,What if all they printed in that print shop were Bibles?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3441.398,3446.136,"--I think it would be much closer and it would stand the test, this Court having read--"
1980.80-120,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3446.136,3448.936,"Well, a diocesan paper is a purely religious paper, isn't it?"
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3450.171,3452.373,At least it is in the Roman Catholic church.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3452.373,3452.79,--I'm sorry.
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3458.61,3464.931,My hypothetical was to remove from all doubts the factual question about whether it was or was not a religious document.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3464.931,3470.752,"I think in that case that representing a state I would say, yes; if it was organized primarily for religious purposes."
1980.80-120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3470.752,3477.905,"Well, would an elementary school operated by the church ever be operated primarily for religious purposes in your view?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3477.905,3482.242,"I think not, especially in this case where--"
1980.80-120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3482.242,3491.598,"That's something, if the exemption is available, the authorities would have to decide."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3500.121,3503.989,--I think that that would be a duty of whatever government to decide that.
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3503.989,3511.659,"General, how come is it impossible for a school to be an ""organization""?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3516.047,3524.652,"Well, I think because at the time it was passed in 1970, the paragraph (3) directly approached schools."
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3540.745,3549.101,"But is there any other ""organization"" of a church that would have to comply?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3549.101,3553.22,"--Yes, I think there probably would be a great number of them."
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3553.22,3554.553,Like what?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3554.553,3575.133,"Well, I can't speak and I don't know but I would say that if a church were to have a fleet of school buses that were organized as a corporation, only to bring children to Bible classes or Sunday School classes, that that organization could be organized for the purposes of religion, and if the buses were not used in general commerce."
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3575.133,3584.672,"Well, then the school is the only one that wouldn't be, is the only organization that wouldn't be included."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3584.672,3586.024,I think there could be a great--
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3586.024,3589.143,I'm in trouble with school not being an organization.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3590.926,3611.99,"--But I think, as you watch the legislative history of 1970, they specifically approach schools, and then in 1978 they specifically said that schools, whether they're public, private, or parochial schools, would not have an exemption."
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3668.243,3671.178,The primary purpose of a school is education.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3671.178,3673.563,--And that's why we believe that--
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3673.563,3677.451,But they say there's another one; it's religion.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3680.403,3691.009,"--Then there would have to be a decision made, as there was in this case, by the appeals referee, that these two institutions were not primarily for educational purposes."
1980.80-120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3693.461,3694.711,We can't escape that.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3695.663,3701.566,"--That's right, and I think great weight has to be given to the appeals referee who did determine these issues."
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3701.566,3721.128,"Well, am I right in reading the statute in this way, that exemption No. (1), both (a) and (b), depends upon the identity of the employer, by contrast with exemption No. (2), which depends entirely upon the identity of the employee?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3721.128,3722.813,Yes.
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3722.813,3737.906,And am I further correct in my understanding that in this case the employer is in the one case a church and in the other an association of churches?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3737.906,3743.309,I guess that is in my mind one of the issues.
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3751.832,3754.201,"Well, the school itself is not an entity, is it?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3764.723,3767.509,But the fact remains--
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3767.509,3768.825,"Am I correct in that, factually?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3768.825,3770.794,--I think factually that's correct.
1980.80-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3792.04,3795.611,But that isn't just their description of the church.
1980.80-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3795.611,3804.098,"It's a tracking of (1)(b), isn't it, where it says, an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3804.098,3810.186,"Yes, I believe that if they fall under any exception, it's not (a), it's (b), which is an organization--"
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3810.186,3813.49,Don't they literally fall within (1)(a)?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3813.49,3815.356,--I would say not.
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3815.356,3815.906,Literally?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3815.906,3817.339,"No, I would say, not."
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3837.652,3844.723,"Maybe we differ as to our understanding of the word ""employment"" but it seems to me that your employer is the person who pays your salary or wages."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3844.723,3849.591,"Well, but I think there has to be a determination--"
1980.80-120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3849.591,3850.793,"Doesn't ""wages"" refer to the employer?"
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3850.793,3853.01,"""In the employ of""."
1980.80-120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3855.662,3857.614,"""Services performed in the employ of. """
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3857.614,3859.63,"""In the employ of""."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3868.386,3882.062,"--Well, again, this is an instance, which is the only case before it, but our determination by our Supreme Court was that this instance fell under (b) and that it was not primarily for religious purposes."
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3882.062,3888.383,"So it doesn't fall under (b), because it's not operated primarily for religious purposes."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3888.383,3889.216,That's right; there is no exemption.
1980.80-120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3894.387,3898.422,It seems to me that you can't read it the way you're doing it now.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3903.493,3904.276,--Yes.
1980.80-120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3904.276,3910.999,"And if you say they're in the employ of a church, they also are in the employ of an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3910.999,3913.565,I don't think that necessarily follows.
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3938.482,3941.518,"But that would be the employer, in your hypothetical case."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3950.374,3953.926,"Well, I'm not here arguing the intent of the Congress."
1980.80-120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3953.926,3954.859,"Except that (1) does not refer to the employer, it refers to the nature of the services."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3954.859,3956.159,"Pardon me, sir?"
1980.80-120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3956.159,3957.978,(1) doesn't refer to the employer.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3963.865,3972.638,"In interpreting the language of Congress when they set out the three exemptions, I think it was clear that they separated."
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3991.015,4004.275,"But you seem to place great emphasis, Mr. Attorney General, on the fact that there is a committee, a board, designated; but the minister of the church can't be expected to run everything."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,4016.849,4018.149,I would think so; yes.
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4018.149,4024.938,Just as you'd have a committee of the church on visitation of parishioners and a whole lot of other things.
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,4029.39,4041.448,"Well, I think there is, because this is an organization which Congress recognized, that there were going to be organizations, spin-offs from churches, of other duties."
1980.80-120,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4052.423,4073.586,"If, as I understood you to agree with me, the test under (1) is the identity of the employer, then the employer is the church, which is operated primarily for religious purposes, isn't it, and as in any church--"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,4073.586,4097.284,"--No, I did... the employer is the school, which is a subsidiary, if you will, of the church, perhaps, but it is a separate entity, and it is intended, as these schools, and they're being organized, two, three a day, with the resultant work force, and they're operated for different reasons, never once questioning the petitioners in this case."
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4114.38,4119.234,"--No, but there's no one compels them to work for one of these institutions?"
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,4119.234,4136.945,"No, but the intent of Congress is for one reason, under the unemployment law, those people who are thrown out of work... and we're talking about a very few people here, as I think we recognize... those people who are thrown out of work by the discontinuance of this operation should be covered by unemployment."
1980.80-120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4139.545,4141.163,"Let me just ask one more question, if I may."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,4148.583,4166.878,"--I think that the Secretary of Labor has directed us... and I might say, I'm like two bookends here, because the State's in between having our funds cut off by the Federal Government, and be attacked on this side... I would say that then it's a test, like so many other employment tests, where are his duties lodged?"
1980.80-120,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4232.321,4242.695,How about a teacher in a parochial school who's fired for teaching doctrinally wrong religion?
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,4242.695,4250.384,--I think first of all that that is an issue that probably will not come up except in very limited circumstances.
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4269.846,4271.631,"Very well, Mr. Attorney General."
1980.80-120,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,4271.631,4273.764,"I submit my time, if I have any left, to my colleague."
1980.80-120,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4273.764,4274.833,Very well.
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4293.394,4309.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-120,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4349.648,4352.248,"Well, aren't most statutes remedial?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4355.366,4364.555,"--I think that's right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and that's always bothered me, about how you distinguish among remedial statutes."
1980.80-120,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4364.555,4365.571,Beneficent ones?
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4365.571,4366.855,Pardon?
1980.80-120,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4366.855,4368.507,And beneficent ones?
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4368.507,4379.815,"Well, it seems to me that here, as this Court has said in California Department of Human Resources v. Java, we have a very special kind of remedial statute."
1980.80-120,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4431.913,4436.084,"Well, if we accept that broad a thing, then there wouldn't be any exceptions at all."
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4436.084,4439.203,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-120,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4439.203,4441.019,Even the ministers of churches will sometimes become unemployed.
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4441.019,4448.559,"And, in fact, 98 percent of the work force is now covered by this statute as a result of the amendments--"
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4448.559,4453.779,"Well, what percentage is covered by it is the issue in this case, isn't it?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4453.779,4458.914,"--Well, I think that the number of workers that are involved in--"
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4458.914,4459.447,Whether it's 98 or 97.
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4459.447,4460.266,--That's right.
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4468.539,4471.907,But the decision in this case will bear on what percentage is covered by it.
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4471.907,4472.407,--That's right.
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4494.07,4501.324,"Well, that's true about section (2), that is, what is your... what are you?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4512.032,4512.548,"--That's right, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4515.399,4520.285,"Number (1) doesn't ask at all, what are your duties?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4525.605,4541.551,"Well, I think I might subscribe to Mr. Justice Stevens' slight differentiation in the way he has put that, because I have the sense that it would be helpful to me, but I'm not quite sure I understand the distinction."
1980.80-120,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4552.507,4556.643,If you'd read the laundry case of a few days ago you'd find that it's a very dangerous thing on which to rely.
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4556.643,4578.157,"I think what needs to be pointed out here is that this construction of ""church"", first of all, is not as irrational as it sounds on its face when put in the argument that a building can employ anybody."
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4594.084,4612.313,"According to the Secretary, does a person, in order to be exempt from the Unemployment Tax Act, have to be not only employed by that house of worship but carry out his duties in that house of worship, his employment duties?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4612.313,4616.265,"--Well, I would think that in most cases--"
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4616.265,4622.769,"No, in most cases that question perhaps needn't be asked, but I'm asking it."
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4626.471,4631.959,"--Well, I think that it would be, that the person--"
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4631.959,4641.666,"Well, he both has to be employed by... that is his salary has to be paid by the house of worship, and his employment duties have to be within the house of worship, is that it?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4641.666,4646.784,"--No, that's not it."
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4649.836,4655.557,It seems to me it would exclude people who are literally covered by the statute.
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4655.557,4675.554,"--That's correct, and I would say that the source, the analogy on which the Secretary is relying here, is the similar problem that's been worked out in the Fair Labor Standards Act cases, where we have, the statutory language says, employed by an establishment."
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4675.554,4675.838,Right.
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4675.838,4689.147,"The establishment, in that case, refers to a physical or geographical location from which a person may go out to work in some other place, but where he is based."
1980.80-120,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4718.298,4722.951,"Don't get too carried away with this building, please."
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4735.509,4746.067,"Well, I would assume in that case, Mr. Justice Marshall, that Hogate's Restaurant paid the janitor, and that consequently we wouldn't have a problem for purposes of this statute."
1980.80-120,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4746.067,4750.769,"Except in our church we called him a sexton, and you'd better not call him a janitor."
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4750.769,4770.615,"The other point that I would make about the Secretary's construction of the first exemption is that this exemption is not something, that this construction is not something that the Secretary has dreamed up out of whole cloth as a result of these amendments."
1980.80-120,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4799.451,4810.474,"Does the Secretary take the position that an employee of a seminary, religious seminary, is not within (b), (1)(b)?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4810.474,4820.282,The Secretary's position is that any employee of a religious seminary would not be subject to coverage of the Act.
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4820.282,4821.332,Because of (1)(b)?
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4821.332,4823.015,That's correct.
1980.80-120,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4955.585,4964.457,"Did this staff committee presentation, occur at a hearing considering the bill?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4964.457,4967.223,I don't believe that there is any testimony.
1980.80-120,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4975.063,4984.085,Is there any indication whether the report was ever made known to the Congress before the law was enacted?
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,4984.085,4998.094,"I'm not sure that I know the answer to that, although I have no reason to assume that it wasn't made available to Congress."
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5043.04,5049.711,"The (1)(a) and (b) simply inquires, who are you employed by?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,5054.698,5055.967,I think that--
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5055.967,5058.083,And I think it's self-explanatory.
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,5058.083,5059.585,--I think the problem is this.
1980.80-120,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5061.085,5062.204,And that's a very bright line.
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,5062.204,5073.476,"--I think there's been a lot of talk about parochial schools as if they were marbles, and that they were all alike."
1980.80-120,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5118.54,5123.509,"But seminaries are schools, and yet they were not subject to the coverage of the Act."
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,5123.509,5128.396,"And Sunday Schools are schools, and they're not subject to the Act."
1980.80-120,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5131.115,5134.4,"You don't have any paid teachers in Sunday Schools, do you?"
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,5134.4,5138.787,"Again, I cannot speak authoritatively to that."
1980.80-120,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5140.587,5148.326,"If you can't answer that I think I can take judicial notice of the fact that generally speaking in this country, in all faiths, Sunday School teachers are volunteers."
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,5148.326,5154.796,I would just close with one example that follows up on something that the Chief Justice said this morning.
1980.80-120,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5196.473,5199.825,"Then you're taking yourself out of this statute, though, I suggest."
1980.80-120,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5203.461,5207.015,"Well, Mr. Sullivan... except for one thing."
1980.80-120,3,18062,barry_sullivan,,5227.262,5231.646,"--No, I don't think there's any constitutional question."
1980.80-120,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5261.416,5263.852,Do you have anything further?
