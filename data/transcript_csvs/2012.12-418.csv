2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-418, United States v. Kebodeaux."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,8.12,11.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.808,90.408,What's the limit of that power?
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,103.4,105.667,"--Well, certainly, Justice Sotomayor--"
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,105.667,117.791,"Could it ask every convicted Federal felon to come in for a DNA test, because we know that people who have been convicted of a crime are more likely to be recidivists?"
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,117.791,133.17,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, there are independent constitutional limits both outside of Article I and within Article I that mean that I will answer your question no, it's not the case that my position today means there are no limits."
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,134.97,136.455,So what -- what is the limit?
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,147.596,153.131,--The -- the principal limitation on retroactive legislation is the Ex Post Facto Clause.
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,158.702,159.285,I don't understand.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,168.26,172.878,So if -- if the Court agrees that it's not a punitive measure and it is a remedial measure--
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,172.878,176.08,"--Well, I don't know if I agree with that, but accept -- accepting that hypothetical."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,176.08,181.401,"--Well, if you don't agree with it, then you'll be going on the Ex Post Facto Clause, and you won't be getting to Article I."
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,181.401,182.601,"No, you know, that's settled law."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,184.936,191.173,"It is settled law, and that means that sex offender registration provisions aren't punitive."
2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,201.397,217.924,"Well, in Comstock, it was very different than the situation here, because the analysis was that the Federal Government basically was the source of the problem in incarcerating sex offenders away from the State so that no State felt an obligation to do something with the problem of their release."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,219.526,220.359,--No.
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.997,281.683,"So I assume that applies to all Federal crimes, right?"
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,321.926,333.199,"Well, Justice Scalia, there is no per se rule in Article I that forbids retroactive civil regulations imposed on a Federal offender."
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.484,339.555,"No, no, that's not the point, that it's -- that it's retroactive."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,344.674,356.314,"--Well, I think the whole point in this case is that it's retroactive, because there isn't any serious dispute that if somebody commits a Federal sex offense they can be placed on supervised release for life so--"
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.314,358.699,That would be an execution of a Federal power--
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,358.699,359.883,"--Well, so is this."
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.883,362.151,--the power -- the power to prevent that crime and to punish it.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,362.151,369.657,"Well, but Congress's power is not limited to preventing and punishing crimes through criminal law."
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.089,403.478,But they have to be imposed simultaneously as -- as the punishment for the crime of which the individual has been convicted.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,422.542,424.076,--That's precisely--
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,424.076,424.576,Yes.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,424.576,425.928,--what makes it a civil sanction.
2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,442.353,451.276,"So your argument depends in no way on the fact that he was convicted of a Federal offense or -- or incarcerated for that offense, nothing at all?"
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,461.167,466.303,This case turns entirely on the fact that the defendant is a Federal offender.
2012.12-418,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,485.032,504.594,"Well, we start out with the power under the Constitution to make rules to regulate the military and we end up with a registration requirement that applies to someone who's not in the military and perhaps is not even living anywhere near any military installation."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,522.824,540.536,"Justice Alito, I think the most helpful way to do that would be for me to progress through a series of examples that illustrate how protecting the public against a Federal sex offender is a legitimate aim under the Necessary and Proper Clause to implement the underlying constitutional authority."
2012.12-418,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,540.536,541.036,Yes.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,541.036,548.023,"So start with a sex offender who commits a sex offense in the military, is tried, court-martialed and sentenced."
2012.12-418,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,668.236,670.502,"When you say in a civil proceeding, you mean?"
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,670.502,671.771,"Yes, noncriminal."
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.971,679.175,"So it's just by a preponderance of the evidence we think this guy probably, you know, 51/49, committed a sex crime."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,679.175,682.894,Not going to be a criminal punishment that's imposed at the end of the day.
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.894,687.298,So just -- just more -- more likely than not is the test.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,687.298,690.9,That's an acceptable level of proof for the civil law.
2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,703.909,705.375,"Yes, but if they can do that."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,714.431,717.983,"Yes, absolute -- well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's not linked to the incarceration."
2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,750.604,753.556,Because the States were not doing anything about it.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,753.556,754.175,Right.
2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,754.175,761.496,Here you have a situation where I think at the time every State dealt with the issue of whether the sex offenders should have to register or not.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,761.496,762.662,That's correct.
2012.12-418,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,826.321,836.996,"The discussion so far has assumed, your discussion primarily, that there's this line between civil and criminal, we don't need to worry about ex post facto."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,865.146,867.515,"--Yes, it is, I believe, Justice Kennedy."
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,988.859,989.544,Mr. Dreeben--
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.544,992.913,To -- to what does this civil -- civil-criminal line apply?
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1022.915,1027.384,"It's not per se barred by Article I, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1040.893,1042.762,I find that difficult to believe that--
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1042.762,1044.028,"Well, there's no--"
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.028,1055.67,"--that whether it's ex post facto and impermissible or not is simply eliminated, that issue was eliminated by simply calling it civil."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1055.67,1056.553,"--Well, it's not eliminated."
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.33,1071.563,I'm talking about the -- ex post facto.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1071.563,1073.032,He can argue that.
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.483,1076.566,Because it's civil.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1076.566,1082.553,"If it in fact is civil and passes through this Court's analysis, then yes."
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.553,1085.689,I -- I find that difficult to grasp.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1085.689,1094.445,"Well, it's actually quite well established as a principle of double jeopardy law in cases like Hudson v. United States and United States v. Ursery."
2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1108.705,1127.499,"Your argument based -- your argument based on Congress's authority with respect to the military, your Article I argument, and you say it doesn't make a difference that he's no longer in the military, does that -- do you come out differently if the basis for jurisdiction is asserted to be inter -- interstate commerce?"
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1127.499,1128.284,No.
2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1129.384,1144.544,"The fact that somebody at some time in their life traveled across State lines means that the Federal Government can go back, even though their activity that's challenged in the particular instance is only intrastate, and still assert jurisdiction over them?"
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1144.544,1155.519,"--Well, that would probably fail a Necessary and Proper Clause analysis, in which there has to be a showing that the measure is plainly adapted to furthering the underlying power."
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1170.778,1191.859,"--As broad as that authority is, perhaps I'm going back to Justice Alito's question, which is if you put aside that it's part of the punishment because you say it's not part of the punishment, you want us not to look at it as punishment because otherwise you'd run into the ex post facto problem, you're saying we have a need today."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1217.676,1218.876,--Justice Sotomayor--
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1218.876,1220.211,What's promoted?
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1220.211,1227.032,--There is a sufficient Federal interest in protecting the public from someone who committed a Federal crime.
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1230.984,1234.388,But that was -- why did we even bother going through anything in Comstock?
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1246.861,1248.245,It's a valid--
2012.12-418,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1248.245,1251.897,You could do whatever civil penalties you want for as long as you want.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1254.399,1257.817,"--Justice Sotomayor, really, the answer to your question is the same."
2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1309.936,1315.173,I'm getting confused between two different assertions of a Federal interest.
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1343.775,1360.035,"Well, it does because when the criminal law finds someone who has violated Federal law, many of the purposes of the sanctions that are imposed on that individual are public protection purposes and anti-recidivism purposes."
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1379.365,1390.923,"It -- it seems to me that when -- when you say that as your answer to the Chief Justice, you're -- you're no longer relying on -- on the power to regulate the military."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1419.907,1429.881,"As the Court has pointed out numerous times, including in Comstock, there is very little authority in the Constitution in an enumerated way for criminal law at all."
2012.12-418,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.921,1441.272,"That's right, because it protects Federal functions."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1456.782,1465.138,That is inherent in taking somebody who violated Federal law and imposing appropriate sanctions on them for that violation.
2012.12-418,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1465.138,1473.058,"Mr. Dreeben, it would help me in answering some of these questions if you went through the analysis on the assumption that this was instead a Commerce Clause case."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1478.029,1481.314,"It would look essentially the same, Justice Kagan."
2012.12-418,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1546.673,1570.121,"Mr. Dreeben, you say nothing about the -- what was the opening argument in -- in your brief, that the assumption that SORNA is something new added after is wrong because there were these predecessor laws that established a Federal requirement to register."
2012.12-418,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1570.121,1574.109,"Justice Ginsburg, I believe that the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that too."
2012.12-418,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.163,1608.213,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1615.519,1616.286,Yes.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1654.977,1672.356,"Going back to -- to a prior question, are you challenging -- you didn't on appeal, but it seems as if you're accepting that the Federal Government has the power to impose this requirement as part of a Federal sentence."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1672.356,1673.739,I think that's correct.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1673.739,1674.475,All right.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1692.186,1699.506,"In this case, on these facts and based on the Federal statutes that exist today, the answer is yes."
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1706.21,1710.731,"Well, SORNA today becomes part of the supervised relief terms."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1710.731,1711.298,--Correct.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1711.298,1713.266,I'm not talking about SORNA today.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1713.266,1713.816,Okay.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1713.816,1723.456,"I'm talking about just any prisoner who has been in jail but it's not made, has not been paid, part of the punishment."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1723.456,1736.013,"I think the law permits a sentencing judge -- I'm not talking about Congress, but a sentencing judge -- to go back and impose additional conditions of supervised release."
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1736.013,1739.667,"I -- I don't know of that power, but do you have a statutory--"
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1739.667,1744.302,It's 18 -- 18 United States Code Section 3583.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1757.462,1757.845,--All right.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1768.335,1769.269,Well--
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1769.269,1774.221,Are the same factors that compel permission for the Government to do it then?
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1774.221,1784.112,"--It's because the way the statute works, even though it wasn't announced at sentence, supervised release is considered to be part of the sentence."
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1801.538,1803.407,We are not talking -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1803.407,1804.457,That's all right.
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1804.457,1805.542,I didn't mean to interrupt your question.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1805.542,1806.142,It's all right.
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1806.142,1808.643,We're not talking about statutory authorization.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1845.567,1852.006,"I think not, but I want to qualify that because it depends on what powers Congress is relying on."
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1860.676,1862.862,"Well, we know what -- and we know what power they are relying on."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1887.513,1901.753,"It does if the person is still in the military or if he has been -- or if he has committed a criminal offense and the prosecutorial power, the Federal power to prosecute him for that offense, has not been exhausted, yes, that can be done."
2012.12-418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1901.753,1903.522,How about if he is on supervised release?
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1909.176,1917.449,"I think if he is still being supervised by the military, then I think it's likely that power exists."
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1917.449,1918.649,Okay.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1919.465,1924.686,Because Mr. Kebodeaux was not on supervised release.
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.686,1925.503,Well -- why not?
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,1940.028,1940.647,"Yes, but--"
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1940.647,1950.336,"So somehow I have to get out of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential violation of due process part, the equal protection part, take that aside."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2047.834,2050.702,"--Well, the power can't go to both of the examples that you've given."
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2071.132,2099.699,"Where you're leading me, because I'm not so worried about this case, but where you're leading me is down in Commerce Clause cases and all kinds of other cases, suddenly a distinction arises that Congress can, in fact, do all kinds of things having Federal authorities do this and that, but you couldn't make someone in a State -- you know, you can imagine a few that are coming into my mind -- and so what I'm worried about is following this distinction into other areas."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2099.699,2105.003,"--I don't think that is a problem, and I think the reason is I disagree fundamentally with the Government."
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2128.016,2132.152,"Well, let me -- let me try this chain of reasoning out on you and -- and get your reaction."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2201.914,2210.587,"Well, I think while that person is still within the criminal jurisdiction, or any Federal jurisdiction, it could be done."
2012.12-418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.662,2229.215,You don't have to go that far though to -- to distinguish the example that Justice Alito just gave.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2263.389,2263.572,I think it may well be.
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2263.572,2288.004,"But yet, now that's exactly the problem for me, because the -- the wilds of Alaska you think I think, and I think I think, that -- that sure, if there's a post office there -- there's a post office there, then what -- the military is all right, they can mail a letter to the -- to be delivered to the local doctor to say, look, he has a problem."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2332.783,2338.52,I haven't thought of it that way and that really isn't the argument that I'm making.
2012.12-418,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.126,2362.218,"We've never -- we've never held, have we, that what the Federal Government can itself do under the Necessary and Proper Clause it can impose upon individuals to do under the Necessary and Proper Clause?"
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2373.943,2375.978,--I absolutely agree with that.
2012.12-418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2440.837,2445.139,"I guess, Ms. Fuentes, what I don't quite understand about the argument, this goes back to Justice Alito's original question."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2479.693,2483.812,"I'll answer that question first, then come back to another."
2012.12-418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2511.832,2514.683,"Well, I wasn't assuming that he was in the military while he was on supervised release."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2514.683,2516.033,I'm sorry.
2012.12-418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2516.802,2528.943,"I was assuming that he was out of the military in both these cases, but that you said while he was still serving his sentence, it would be appropriate for Congress to add this additional thing, but not after."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2528.943,2530.576,I think--
2012.12-418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2530.576,2532.728,"In both cases, he's not in the military anymore."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2532.728,2542.184,"--Constitutionally, it -- it can be all right constitutionally, depending on the statutory procedures that govern it."
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2581.659,2589.498,Is it your argument that Congress lacks the power to impose supervised release after the date when the person leaves the military?
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2589.498,2590.381,No.
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2597.219,2601.02,Someone is sentenced to prison--
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2601.02,2601.638,Right.
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2601.638,2609.209,"--under the UCMJ, released, dishonorably discharged from the military."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2617.648,2631.158,"Not if -- not unless it was -- that provision was imposed as part of the sentence or while he was still within the Federal power, before the Federal criminal jurisdiction expires."
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2631.158,2638.478,"See, I understand -- I can understand why that might create -- that might raise all sorts of constitutional arguments about notice and so forth."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2647.334,2651.636,"Well, I'm not sure--"
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2651.636,2652.769,--under the power to regulate the military.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2652.769,2653.321,--Yes.
2012.12-418,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2679.619,2693.946,"Well, you could be making the argument that the power to make rules for the military applies only to people who are in the military, and that once you're out of the military that power does not permit Congress to do anything special to you."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2696.165,2696.631,No.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2721.215,2754.603,"How would you write this opinion if you wanted to protect against what Justice Breyer was concerned about, constricting the Commerce Clause, which has been since Madison more broadly defined than he did, or Justice Alito's example of ensuring that you're not closing off other things that can be done after someone leaves, that might be related to, like punishing a crime that you find out about afterwards."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2757.055,2760.423,Just the way the Fifth Circuit did in its en banc opinion.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2760.423,2784.372,"Well, it wasn't really helpful, because it -- it doesn't give us a limiting principle like -- I don't know if it's possible -- that if you're relying on just recidivism, Congress has to have an independent basis, a power for the imposition of -- of criminal or civil sanctions on someone."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2784.372,2787.407,I'm not certain an opinion like that could be written.
2012.12-418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2813.975,2816.36,"Well, how -- I'm not sure that makes much sense."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2824.782,2825.499,No.
2012.12-418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2826.649,2827.567,So in what sense--
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2827.567,2828.667,--I -- I apologize.
2012.12-418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2829.451,2834.555,"--Well, in what sense does it then depend on which enumerated power they're invoking?"
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2834.555,2840.142,"Well, let -- let me give an example that goes to the collateral consequence cases that the Government raised."
2012.12-418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2886.606,2891.575,They say -- they say it exists by virtue of the enumerated power to regulate the military forces.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2891.575,2894.594,"--Well, I don't think it does."
2012.12-418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2895.879,2905.817,"Well, I'm trying to see why you're saying the enumerated power under the Spending Clause allows them to take this subsequent action, but the enumerated power under the Military Clause does not."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2905.817,2907.269,"--Well, because the -- I'm sorry."
2012.12-418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2907.269,2917.125,"I would have thought that if you're arguing under the Necessary and Proper Clause, that you need an enumerated power that the Necessary and Proper Clause is going to serve."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2921.011,2925.065,I think it all -- I think it does turn on the nature of the power.
2012.12-418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2934.354,2935.471,I get to ask the questions.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2937.289,2938.756,Sorry.
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2940.741,2946.061,"No, but it's the military -- look, it's the military that they are mostly -- that they're relying on."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2946.061,2946.894,Yes.
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2947.644,2949.613,"So they say -- I mean, the famous statement -- I looked it up --"
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,2995.911,2996.761,--Well--
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2996.761,3000.529,--because they didn't get it right in respect to what the previous statutes require.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3001.279,3004.783,"--Well, the Fifth Circuit did get it right with respect to the previous statute."
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.517,3037.571,I just want to know what to do if I end up thinking they are right.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3037.571,3038.104,Yes.
2012.12-418,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3038.804,3045.242,What's your recommendation there on that assumption?
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3047.61,3049.796,--I -- I guess it depends on which assumption.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3076.196,3079.481,Your argument is he was released on condition of State registration.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3085.385,3085.985,--No.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3140.389,3142.489,The bottom line is you don't think the Wetterling Act applied to him.
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3143.341,3143.858,I'm sorry?
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3143.858,3145.808,The Wetterling Act didn't apply to him; is that--
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3145.808,3146.21,No.
2012.12-418,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3147.893,3148.16,--At all?
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3148.16,3149.244,Correct.
2012.12-418,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3195.206,3207.331,"I -- I guess what I'm not understanding, Ms. Fuentes, is -- I understand the difference between a requirement of registration and a penalty for failing to register, but it's a little bit cutting -- slicing the baloney thin."
2012.12-418,1,35792,m_carolyn_fuentes,,3227.059,3229.378,I guess I don't.
2012.12-418,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3309.88,3312.215,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-418,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3314.433,3316.402,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-418,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3357.212,3358.129,But that's not unusual.
2012.12-418,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3366.651,3382.245,"Well, that's just wrong, Justice Scalia, because this Court made clear in United States ex rel Toth v. Quarles that if an individual has left the military but hasn't been prosecuted, they can't be court-martialed, but they can be prosecuted in an Article III clause."
2012.12-418,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3382.245,3385.363,Not for something that they've done after they left the military.
2012.12-418,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3393.885,3398.17,But sex offender registration is a consequence of the military crime.
2012.12-418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3422.905,3424.072,And that's not limited.
2012.12-418,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3445.235,3447.453,"--Let me make two points about that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-418,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.661,3461.28,That's part of his sentence.
2012.12-418,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3467.101,3472.755,I don't see any relevance that has to Article I authority; it has relevance to other constitutional provisions.
2012.12-418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3493.518,3496.37,"So your answer to my question is yes, Congress can do that."
2012.12-418,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3504.424,3515.181,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not going to say no to that question, because I don't want to foreclose options that Congress may decide it's appropriate to pass, but the Court--"
2012.12-418,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3515.181,3515.831,Right.
2012.12-418,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3517.216,3521.485,--But the Court does not have to agree that that is constitutional -- may I complete my sentence?
2012.12-418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3521.485,3522.085,Sure.
2012.12-418,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3522.085,3532.876,"--in order to uphold this narrowly focused, tailored law that looks at a specific crime and imposes a specific requirement that's directly tied to the nature of that crime."
2012.12-418,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3532.876,3534.578,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
