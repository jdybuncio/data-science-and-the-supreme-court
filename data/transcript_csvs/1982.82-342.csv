1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.917,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Philko Aviation, Incorporated, against Shacket."
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,13.852,18.492,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.82-342,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.128,376.721,Mr. Bishop.
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,376.721,377.329,--Sir?
1982.82-342,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.329,384.625,Do you think all of these facts are really essential to resolve the legal issue presented in the petition for certiorari?
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,384.625,387.296,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,537.673,549.87,Are you repeating all these facts to demonstrate or persuade us that we're confronted with two bona fide purchasers here?
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,549.87,554.819,"Well, we have a slight difference, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.411,605.112,"Shacket had the airplane, didn't he?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,605.112,606.176,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,639.115,645.128,"You agree that, except for the federal law, the right result was reached below?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,645.128,647.3,--I'm sorry?
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.908,656.904,"If there were no federal recording statute, the result reached below would be correct in your view?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,656.904,658.526,"Not entirely, Your Honor."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.526,662.278,"At least it wouldn't concern us, because it would be a matter of state law."
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,662.278,665.417,"That is correct, that is correct."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,665.417,669.71,So your focus is on the impact of the federal statute.
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,669.71,671.384,"That is correct, yes, sir."
1982.82-342,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.609,849.576,"Well, Mr. Bishop, I think you've got some problems in your argument with the language of Section 1406."
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,862.319,878.564,"Well, it's a question I think where we have our problem, Mr. Justice, is that if you have resort to state law for substantive ownership rights, you've gone beyond the scope of 1406."
1982.82-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.351,999.032,"Mr. Bishop, you would agree, would you not, that because of 1406 that the validity of the instruments describing the second transaction, which were in fact recorded, are governed by Illinois law because of 1406?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,999.032,1012.119,"--Yes, sir, and there is no dispute that those documents are properly executed under Illinois law and that they are the original documents to the transactions that they purport to represent."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.189,1038.249,Were 1403 and 1406 passed at the same time?
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1038.249,1039.485,"No, sir."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.996,1049.729,And so when did--
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1049.729,1050.431,--It was voluntary.
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.134,1056.913,--When did 1406 come along?
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1056.913,1062.91,"1964, 1964."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1062.91,1068.893,"So... and both sections use the word, either ""validity"" or ""valid"", didn't they?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1068.893,1070.765,Do both sections?
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.765,1074.734,No transfer--
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1074.734,1076.2,"Validity or valid, yes."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.138,1082.978,--Don't you have to say that the validity means different things in those two sections?
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1082.978,1086.054,"Oh, yes, I think so."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.301,1102.924,What are you talking about in 1403?
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1102.924,1111.826,"--1403, you're talking about any document, and you are talking about the substantive rights of the whole world apart from the document."
1982.82-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.211,1127.225,"Well, that's a slight overstatement, isn't it, Mr. Bishop?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1133.051,1133.738,"--Yes, sir."
1982.82-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.738,1134.927,Even if it's not recorded.
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1134.927,1138.331,"In this context, I mean third parties without notice."
1982.82-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.331,1148.813,"So that if it should develop that the relationship between your client and the fraudulent dealer was such that your client should be deemed to have been on actual notice, then you would be bound?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1148.813,1152.155,"The result would be otherwise, that is quite correct, sir."
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.937,1189.766,"Well, it wouldn't be only useless, would it?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1191.638,1192.886,I'm sorry?
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.886,1199.479,Suppose the Shacket papers had been filed with the FAA.
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1204.162,1212.379,We are saying that this 1403 is not framed in language--
1982.82-342,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1212.379,1216.317,Your client wouldn't be in the fix he is if Shacket had filed his papers.
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1216.317,1217.627,--That's quite so.
1982.82-342,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1369.751,1379.718,"Mr. Bishop, I am concerned by the legislative history, which you have not really mentioned."
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1425.904,1431.103,"Not really, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-342,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1534.747,1542.121,"Well, they may have been concerned more with having a central registry than with requiring the priorities."
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1552.053,1553.227,The Mortgage Convention?
1982.82-342,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1554.35,1559.926,The treaty dealing with--
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1559.926,1560.394,The treaty.
1982.82-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1569.687,1573.999,"--May I follow up, Mr. Bishop, on what Justice O'Connor was asking you about."
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1584.946,1588.443,"No, I would not agree with that, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.962,1592.226,--At least if they were both security interest documents?
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1592.226,1594.254,--I would not agree with that.
1982.82-342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.567,1638.443,"Well, but I'm suggesting that if there had been two recorded documents."
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1649.451,1655.012,"--Well, I think you have, as we suggested in our brief, Mr. Justice, a race-notice statute."
1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.859,1725.843,"When your client made the purchase, did he... where was the airplane?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1725.843,1734.277,"It was actually, we found out later, in Mr. Shacket's hands back in Detroit."
1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.583,1783.446,"Suppose, instead of a conflict between two purchasers in good faith, at the time your client made the purchase, consummated the transaction, the airplane was in the custody of some repair organization and had a claim for $50,000 for repair and maintenance."
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1790.13,1792.458,Mechanic's liens?
1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1800.97,1813.261,"Well, if it was in the possession of the company making alterations and the alterations had not been completed, there wouldn't be any occasion to record."
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1815.398,1817.336,Of the claim.
1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1817.336,1818.304,Of the claim.
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1823.132,1828.77,"If that claim is not a matter of record, I would say to you--"
1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1828.77,1829.753,Under the federal Act?
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1829.753,1839.751,"--Under the federal Act, yes, sir, that I would say that anybody who is not on notice should not have to deal with that claim."
1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1839.751,1844.295,"Well then, what does the repairman have to do, file his lien before he starts his work?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1844.295,1845.327,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-342,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.039,1869.816,"Well, don't most state laws require that a mechanic, to preserve a lien on a moving vehicle, has to retain possession of it?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1871.314,1874.956,"Yes, he must retain possession to assert his lien."
1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.511,1903.676,"Well, did your client have no obligation to find out where this aircraft was and whether someone in possession might have a mechanic's lien claim, as yet unrecorded because as yet unknown?"
1982.82-342,0,34172,leslie_r_bishop,,1903.676,1908.956,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, how... where would you search?"
1982.82-342,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1949.55,1954.955,Mr. Murray.
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,1954.955,1957.734,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.979,2128.35,"Mr. Murray, is it not possible that, even though the second purchaser wasn't a purchaser under Illinois law, that either he or the bank had a security interest in the claim?"
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2130.445,2131.868,--There has been no ruling.
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2139.877,2152.06,"No, but if it hasn't yet been decided don't we have to, for purposes of analyzing the federal statute, at least consider that one possibility is that the second purchaser did acquire a security interest in the plane?"
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2152.06,2153.448,"--Yes, I'm not disagreeing with you."
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2153.448,2163.804,"And then you'd have to decide whether such a security interest would be valid as against a prior unrecorded transaction, assuming that the security interest person did not have notice."
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2163.804,2164.959,That's correct.
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.192,2222.734,"Well, you may be entirely right, but all I'm suggesting is that it has not yet been decided whether the second purchaser got a security interest, because the district court didn't really address that."
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2222.734,2223.685,That's absolutely correct.
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.685,2234.682,"And it seems to me that we have to assume that possibility in order to resolve the proper construction of the federal statute, that it is at least possible that on remand, because we have a summary judgment situation--"
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2234.682,2235.338,That's correct.
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.338,2237.697,--that a trial would show there was a security interest.
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2246.287,2260.75,"And I don't... first of all, if you're suggesting that this case, in order for that issue to be determined, should be remanded for further consideration, I would suggest to you, Justice Stevens, that that is unnecessary, because all the facts in this case are in the record."
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.388,2265.684,"Normally we don't decide questions of state law, is all I'm suggesting."
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2265.684,2268.184,"--I agree with you, and I'm not suggesting that you should decide it."
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.556,2311.916,"Well, even if that's true, what that means is that even if you lose the battle here you may win the war."
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2311.916,2313.148,That's correct.
1982.82-342,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.023,2363.658,"Well, I suppose Philko claims that it's being stripped of its rights to its new aircraft."
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2366.801,2370.611,"I'm not suggesting, Justice Rehnquist, that both parties do not have equities."
1982.82-342,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2406.658,2411.501,"Well, isn't the real issue that contained in the remark you just made, I think, isn't it?"
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2413.342,2414.5,That's correct.
1982.82-342,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.5,2418.107,"--with respect to two people, each with presumably very substantial equities."
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2418.107,2421.402,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-342,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2477.755,2490.014,"But isn't your argument that there was no interest to convey at the time it was conveyed, isn't that essentially based on a recording statute rather than a substantive law?"
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2490.014,2492.903,"No, it's not, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-342,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2541.854,2545.742,So you really say the federal statute essentially just tells you where to record?
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2545.742,2546.444,--That's right.
1982.82-342,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.243,2551.007,Yes.
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2558.237,2567.672,"That is our position, Your Honor, and the first... in order for us to determine that intent, the first thing we look at is the statute itself, and--"
1982.82-342,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2567.672,2570.889,"Well, what does 1403 mean, then?"
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2578.557,2586.445,"--Well, I can only refer this, Justice White, I can only refer this Court to the decision--"
1982.82-342,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.445,2590.333,"You say that that word ""valid"" just has no force at all."
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2590.333,2592.334,"--No, I'm just saying--"
1982.82-342,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2592.334,2597.707,That you have to look to state law for every substantive consequence of the filing?
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2597.707,2601.299,"--As it relates to title, that's correct."
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.507,2674.957,"Well, Mr. Murray, I really don't think that's correct, because you're arguing about the fact that state law controls the meaning and validity of recorded instruments."
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2693.058,2697.758,Let me tell you that that also could deal with a ridiculous result.
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.507,2855.82,"You might have the second set of papers filed first, is what you're saying."
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2855.82,2856.538,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2856.538,2861.412,But that would not be within 1403(c) because then there would not be a failure to record.
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2861.412,2862.005,"No, that's--"
1982.82-342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.005,2864.24,Then you'd have both transactions recorded--
1982.82-342,1,31718,james_c_murray_jr,,2864.24,2865.207,--My client under the--
