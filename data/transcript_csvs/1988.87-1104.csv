1988.87-1104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.857,"We'll hear argument now in No. 87-1104, Walter Zant v. William Neal Moore."
1988.87-1104,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,17.338,19.712,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.726,225.362,"Ms. Boleyn, may I inquire how your proposed standard differs from that in Reed against Ross for the novelty standard for procedural defaults?"
1988.87-1104,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,225.362,233.624,"Your Honor, our reasonably available standard differs from the, the standards set forth in Reed v. Ross for the cause standard in several respects."
1988.87-1104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.306,292.07,How does your standard differ from that suggested by Judge Tjoflat below?
1988.87-1104,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,292.07,295.022,Our standard is very similar to that of Judge Tjoflat.
1988.87-1104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.65,340.471,Could you... could you tell me how it could ever be held that the claim... that the claim was not reasonably available when there has been a change in the law?
1988.87-1104,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,352.342,358.152,We think we have adopted a simpler rule because part of it depends on the way you look at new law.
1988.87-1104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.763,417.207,"But at least if he... if his trial where he didn't raise the point was simultaneous with the trial in which the point was raised that came up here that produced the decision which is allegedly new law, at least in all those cases you would have to say it was reasonably available, wouldn't you?"
1988.87-1104,0,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,422.283,430.671,"You would only be talking about those cases that were earlier than the one in which the point raised, but that would not necessarily be an excuse because you could have--"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1337.336,1343.272,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1488.277,1495.397,"Well, what congressional choice, Mr. Boger, do you think was involved in the language involving the abuse of the writ in Rule 9?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1495.397,1499.568,"Well, the legislative history, Your Honor, I believe reflects a choice--"
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1499.568,1501.114,How... how does the statute itself read?
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1501.114,1509.049,"--The statute itself, Your Honor, says... asks whether the defendant has deliberately withheld or otherwise abused the writ."
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1565.027,1567.135,A colloquy is... is legislative history?
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1567.135,1569.477,"--No, Your Honor, it's not."
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1590.437,1594.622,"Well, do you think Sanders froze the abuse of the writ doctrine for all time?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1594.622,1598.605,As a judicial holding perhaps it did not.
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1606.164,1614.115,"But if... if you ratify a judicial holding that left things fluid, why doesn't the ratification also leave them fluid?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1614.115,1616.958,"--I don't believe that it did leave things fluid on this point, Your Honor."
1988.87-1104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.614,1732.88,Excuse me.
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1735.644,1738.893,"--Well, we have... we have two reports."
1988.87-1104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.048,1745.438,"If I were a member of the Senate, could I have voted against that report?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1745.438,1747.233,"You could have, Your Honor."
1988.87-1104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1750.169,1753.074,Can a member of the Senate vote against a report?
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1754.762,1755.09,I'm sorry.
1988.87-1104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.134,1763.664,"A member of the committee, but certainly the rest of the Senate didn't vote on the report, did they?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1763.664,1764.149,No.
1988.87-1104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.008,1770.911,"You're hanging an awful lot on, on, on the report from the committee, and you're speaking as though Congress said this."
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1770.911,1774.926,"Well, let me... let add, Your Honor, it's not as if Congress was unaware of other voices."
1988.87-1104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.252,1830.497,"It... granting, granting all that you say, why does it... and maybe this is the same as the Chief Justice's question... why does it show anything more than that Congress was not willing to change the rule?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,1838.885,1851.192,"Well, my understanding of the way the... both the substantive law works and the Rules Enabling Act works is that this Court may propose rules to Congress which Congress then accepts or rejects."
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2254.124,2255.983,Proffitt is a decision of the Eleventh Circuit.
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,2255.983,2256.451,--That's correct.
1988.87-1104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2291.047,2299.231,"On Gardner, Mr. Boger, didn't the state court determine that the attorney had seen the report, the presentence report?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,2299.231,2304.042,"--The, the state court does make a holding that the claim is without merit."
1988.87-1104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2322.33,2328.405,I thought it could be fairly read as finding that the attorney had seen the report.
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,2335.45,2338.512,We don't know why Mr.... Mr. Bonner did not.
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2592.581,2594.408,"Well, why did he not reach the claim?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,2594.408,2604.513,"Initially, Your Honor, he denied the motion to amend to add the Gardner claim in the context of granting full sentencing relief on another issue."
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.134,2620.85,"When you say she immediately raises them, she files a motion to amend the petition?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,2620.85,2623.848,She filed a motion to amend saying I want to amend to add in the Gardner claim.
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.751,2675.142,You say without notice.
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,2676.953,2677.515,"--Oh, none at all."
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2678.202,2681.388,--Then why do you mention the fact it was without notice?
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,2681.388,2694.977,"I simply meant that Ms. Hicks, and by this time Mr. Givelber, didn't know until they had received full sentencing relief what the dispositions were going to be on the Gardner or other motions."
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2734.071,2736.43,"That, that was reversed by the court of appeals?"
1988.87-1104,1,29041,john_charles_boger,,2736.43,2736.789,That's right.
1988.87-1104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2921.247,2922.997,"Thank you, Mr. Boger."
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2925.839,2945.019,"Let me clarify that under the standard that we've proposed, which we think is clearly authorized by both Sanders and Rule 9(b), we're not asking counsel representing a habeas corpus petitioner to be able to foresee all the types of matters that Mr. Boger has discussed before the Court this morning."
1988.87-1104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.715,2961.168,xxx court of appeals ask that question?
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2962.152,2963.464,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1988.87-1104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.464,2967.01,What did the... what did the court of appeals... what was their test?
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2967.01,2976.553,"The court of appeals test, Your Honor, was that reasonably competent habeas counsel could not have foreseen the cases that ultimately came out."
1988.87-1104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.553,2978.99,Is your... is your test different from that?
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2978.99,2979.973,"Yes, Your Honor, very different."
1988.87-1104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.973,2980.832,What is it?
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2984.941,2995.529,"You have to be reasonably competent habeas counsel, but you don't have to have this clairvoyance that is implied at least by... to some extent--"
1988.87-1104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2995.529,2999.263,"Well, I, I just don't understand how you differ... how your test differs from the court of appeals."
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,2999.263,3000.199,--Let me see if I can clarify that.
1988.87-1104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.199,3002.746,Reasonably competent counsel was the court of appeals test?
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3002.746,3007.775,But they said reasonably competent counsel could not have foreseen the confluence of all these decisions.
1988.87-1104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.744,3053.21,"Well, do you think Judge Tjoflat really differed with the standard the majority applied, or was he just differ... differing with the application of the standard?"
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3053.21,3059.238,"He differed with the standard, Your Honor, because he wasn't going to say the question was whether a reasonably competent habeas attorney could have foreseen."
1988.87-1104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3070.156,3074.981,"But is there... is the difference only in the,... the time on which you focus?"
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3074.981,3075.856,No.
1988.87-1104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3075.856,3076.762,Or is it something more?
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3078.933,3082.182,It's not only just the time that you're focusing on; it's a matter of perspective.
1988.87-1104,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.761,3124.742,"So, you say you shouldn't ask whether, whether a later decision was foreseeable, but you ask whether or not the claim should have been made?"
1988.87-1104,2,41061,susan_v_boleyn,,3124.742,3135.833,"--And were there decisions then that they could use, not could they foresee the one that ultimately came, but were there decisions around them that they could use to mount the claim based on their factual situation?"
1988.87-1104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3215.91,3217.644,"Thank you, Ms. Boleyn."
