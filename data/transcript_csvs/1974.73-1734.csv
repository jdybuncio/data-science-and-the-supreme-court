1974.73-1734,0,18781,charles_r_davis,,29.165,33.974,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1734,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,152.211,171.493,"If I get you're argument correctly in your briefs Mr. Davis, you're saying the state has no more right to tax him for being this conduit than they could tax an Internal Revenue Agent who collects the money and passes it on to the collector in Mississippi, is that about it?"
1974.73-1734,0,18781,charles_r_davis,,171.493,173.949,That's correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1734,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,207.012,216.637,There is something of a difference though in your case in so far as it turns on the federal statute and in that party your case where it turns on two state statutes.
1974.73-1734,0,18781,charles_r_davis,,230.037,256.033,"Mr. Justice, its our contention that this Court under the circumstances of this case may disregard the characterization of that Mississippi excise tax by the Supreme Court of Mississippi and the designation of the tax as a privilege tax by the legislature and --"
1974.73-1734,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.033,258.971,In what authority would we have for doing that?
1974.73-1734,0,18781,charles_r_davis,,258.971,317.848,"Well, we've cited authorities in our brief which we believe indicates that where constitutional questions are presented such as we have here where if Mr. Gurley is taxed a sales tax by the state of Mississippi is imposed upon Mississippi gasoline excise taxes in his hands that that's to take his property without due process of law, and therefore we submit that this Court may look to the operation and effect of the Mississippi statute and determine that despite the ruling by the Mississippi Supreme Court that it is a tax on the consumer of gasoline."
1974.73-1734,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,317.848,327.828,But that the construction is the construction by the highest court of the state is it not of the state statute?
1974.73-1734,0,18781,charles_r_davis,,327.828,331.034,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2024.427,2028.71,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1734,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2079.632,2083.536,You have specific corrections you want us to make on particular pages or you just want to --
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2083.536,2088.879,I just want to apologize for having referred to that as a sales tax.
1974.73-1734,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2088.879,2090.283,Alright.
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2090.283,2127.029,"With respect to our argument on the fact that the decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court is not subject to review by federal courts with respect to the incidence of the Mississippi tax which is in point for of our brief, we have cited two cases and quoted from one of them."
1974.73-1734,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.088,2162.246,Your blue-covered brief?
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2162.246,2169.61,"Yes sir, that's properly printed, the other one was not."
1974.73-1734,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2319.955,2328.387,May I get back a moment Mr. Gholson to your suggestion that the complaint did not alleged any federal constitutional defect?
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2328.387,2329.462,I believe that's correct.
1974.73-1734,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2329.462,2330.12,"Then may I ask you, here is the question."
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2330.12,2332.039,"Yes, Justice Powell."
1974.73-1734,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2332.039,2347.026,"What did as regards to your state tax, the Mississippi Supreme Court addressed and decide the federal constitutional claim in respect to that tax?"
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2347.026,2374.173,"The Mississippi Supreme Court decided that under the -- their understanding of the prevailing rules of this Court that the federal excise tax is legally an incident placed upon wholesaler, Mr. Gurley, and not upon the consumer and for that reason is not -- is a part of the gross sale price."
1974.73-1734,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2374.173,2376.719,So that federal question clearly --
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2376.719,2376.913,Yes.
1974.73-1734,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2376.913,2377.531,That your Court decided?
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2377.531,2377.826,Yes.
1974.73-1734,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2377.826,2385.988,"Now, how about the attack upon the inclusion of the state franchise tax, the 7 cents."
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2385.988,2402.215,"The state franchise tax has been determined by the State Supreme Court to be legally upon the wholesaler, because it is imposed at the moment that the tax is brought into the state and I think this gets us --"
1974.73-1734,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2402.215,2410.28,"Very well but what I'm getting -- I'm trying to get to is in sustaining it, did they sustain it against the claim that had violated the federal constitution?"
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2410.28,2412.475,I found nothing in the complaint that alleges --
1974.73-1734,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2412.475,2413.971,"No, in the opinion to --"
1974.73-1734,1,27101,hunter_m_gholson,,2413.971,2415.312,"No sir, no sir."
