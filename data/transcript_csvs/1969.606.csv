1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,0.0,4.408,May it please the Court.
1969.606,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,38.3,40.169,We take a note of that problem.
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,40.169,41.63,Thank you Your Honor.
1969.606,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,41.63,44.763,"Do you agree that the case is not moot, do you not?"
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,44.763,46.903,"Yes, we do Your Honor."
1969.606,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,54.45,56.622,That's no longer an issue between.
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,58.65,60.857,"Yes, Your Honor I will."
1969.606,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,60.857,62.994,"Now who filed this, you?"
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,62.994,65.893,"Yes, Justice Douglas this was filed by the --"
1969.606,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,65.893,67.45,By you or by the --
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,67.45,71.173,"The State of Illinois, is the petitioner."
1969.606,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,71.173,74.922,I know but I said who filed this memo on mootness?
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,74.922,82.343,"The point was raised in the respondent's brief, we replied in a reply brief."
1969.606,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,189.418,192.252,Was he present for some part of the trial?
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,192.252,196.136,He was present Your Honor for the entire defense.
1969.606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,208.539,210.191,"So, he was not there for the opening?"
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,210.191,211.155,He was not there for the opening.
1969.606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,211.155,213.245,Nor for any of the evidence in states' case.
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,213.245,214.328,Not of the states' case.
1969.606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,233.42,235.088,There was appointed counsel was --
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,235.088,236.403,There was.
1969.606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.403,238.061,He was present throughout the states' case?
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,238.061,239.603,Throughout the entire states' case.
1969.606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,239.603,242.192,And did he cross-examine the witnesses?
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,242.192,242.692,He did.
1969.606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.692,243.663,Did he make an opening?
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,243.663,247.641,"He did, Your Honor I would draw that I'm not sure if he chose to be --"
1969.606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,247.641,248.709,What is the Illinois practice?
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,251.709,253.123,There is.
1969.606,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,253.123,254.137,By both side and --
1969.606,0,30250,joel_m_flaum,,254.137,258.257,By both.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,1809.059,1815.853,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, may it please the Court."
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1819.059,1824.238,"Would you raise your voice counsel, we seem to have a little difficulty with acoustics today."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,1824.238,1837.014,The effects are not in dispute but I feel that they need some elaboration -- so that the Court can more accurately understand the situation of this trial.
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1898.046,1900.76,How is this relevant now on our issue?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,1900.76,1905.167,Because I'm trying to explain Allen's behavior.
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1929.384,1932.356,"But that issue is out of this case long since, isn't it?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,1933.179,1945.624,"No, I have not raised but it bears to -- I think it's important for the Court to realize the type of person who Allen was and what the trial judge was confronted with."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.309,1993.515,"Did Allen realize what he was saying when he said, “You're not going to hold any trial (Inaudible)?"""
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,1999.593,2000.842,"No, he did mean that."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2000.842,2001.28,He did?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2001.28,2004.947,He did mean that because he wanted to conduct his own trial.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.947,2007.138,What should the Court do then?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2008.431,2009.372,"Well, no."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2091.764,2094.496,What was the judge did do have been?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2094.496,2094.792,Pardon?
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2094.792,2097.452,What was judge to do then?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2101.638,2109.746,"Well, if he did not, if the judge felt that Allen had the competence to conduct the trial in the beginning he should have let him proceed."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.203,2115.801,"Well, he didn't know he was going to carry on like that at the beginning, didn't he?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2115.801,2123.281,"Well, then you don't begin a dialogue for two minutes and say, “Now, do it right, do it the way it should be done or I'm going to deny that right."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.72,2134.629,"Well, who got in the courtroom -- in the mean time?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2134.629,2137.109,But the judge realized this before he gave him the right.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2139.908,2142.74,"Well, how could he have known that?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2142.74,2144.579,Because his record was before him.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2145.434,2147.552,The record was before the judge?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2147.552,2159.024,"Well, the judge knew of his prior commitment to a mental hospital because the defendant made a request to the court that he wanted an order from a prior judge."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.27,2171.347,(Voice Overlaps) Do you have any reasons form to know that?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2175.107,2177.128,It wasn't raised by the lawyer but when --
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2177.128,2179.066,Was it raised by him?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2179.066,2180.03,By Allen?
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.03,2181.732,Yes.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2181.732,2187.25,Only with respect to a -- reference to a order from a previous judge as to his commitment.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2187.25,2188.686,And when was that?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2188.686,2191.495,That was during this dialogue between the courts.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.495,2195.567,"Well I'm saying at that stage, what should the judge do then?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2195.567,2208.536,"He should recess the court, sit-down with the defendant in chambers, take five minutes out and explain to him very simply in a calm passion rather than an argumentative passion and say, “Here's what's going to happen."""
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2209.339,2215.652,"I would suggest that he would go in and ask the defendant, “How do you want me to run the trial?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2228.977,2231.221,"Well, there were two rights which --"
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.221,2233.534,We have already talked of binding and gagging?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2233.534,2234.494,Well no.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2234.494,2235.078,Was he?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2235.078,2237.129,Pardon me.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2286.877,2289.596,Is that still a choice made by Allen?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2289.596,2290.317,Pardon?
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2290.317,2297.213,"Is that a choice he made that judge says, “You need to keep quiet or get out"" and he didn't keep quiet?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2297.213,2315.05,"He has a choice, after he has given the right to defend himself and that right and is now denied, just sits still and sit in a chair and have an attorney who he doesn't know represent himself, have an attorney who he hasn't talked to or who may know nothing at all about the case."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2321.636,2326.259,"But how the court does by saying you're going to be at corps on lunch time, is that protest?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2326.259,2341.368,"Well, Allen was in custody, I am sure that this is something that was said in the heat of the dispute between the court and Allen and I doubt very much if the judge took that seriously."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2344.453,2354.432,"In the New York case, Ben Vento (ph) picked up an old chair and told him and mentioned the judge."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2354.432,2362.764,"Yes he did, but that was after the trial had commenced. In Allen, it was a logical growth from his being denied his right to represent himself."
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.764,2378.498,"Mr. Harris, are you arguing that as a matter of the Confrontation Clause, there are no circumstances under which and if defendant may be removed from the courtroom for misconduct and the trial proceed without him."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2379.878,2392.114,I am going that far because I believe that under today's technological advances there are alternatives for dealing with the unruly defendant which will preserve his right to confront the witnesses.
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.63,2403.089,What are the alternatives?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2403.089,2408.444,The alternatives are a glass sound proof booth which could be constructed.
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2459.928,2465.942,This is all very interesting but did you propose that some time or did the counsel propose (Voice Overlap)
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2465.942,2470.067,I propose that to the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit and I'm late --
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2470.067,2473.538,It was a little late wasn't it?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2475.138,2475.722,No it wasn't.
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2475.722,2479.772,Do you suggest that was a viable alternative?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2479.772,2484.513,"No, I did not and it was not proposed at that time."
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.474,2489.161,Is there any other?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2490.961,2498.847,"Well, I suggest the possibility of close circuit televising the trial to another room where again he can see the proceedings and --"
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.847,2501.859,What about gagging?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2501.859,2516.421,"I feel that he should be -- if the court will not accept close circuit television or a booth then he should be gagged, he should remain in court because even though he's gagged and he can't talk to his attorney, you can still hear what's going on."
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.816,2541.767,"Well, now certainly you don't contest the very premise all of the gag which is that the government has a right to try in the key, doesn't it?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2541.767,2542.513,Yes.
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.513,2554.627,Is that the very premise of at least are just safeguards about the accused to see that he gets the kind of trial that the constitution guarantees?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2554.627,2555.218,That is correct.
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.218,2563.038,"But certainly, he has to recognize the government's right to trial, doesn't he?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2563.038,2565.255,Yes.
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.69,2575.039,Doesn't that suggest that he may then by his misconduct that he prevents the government from trying it?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2575.039,2576.597,Well I think I --
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2576.597,2580.148,And he may by that misconduct?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2580.148,2594.147,"I do not believe that we can permit or the court should permit a defendant to disrupt the trial, to cause a mistrial to delay the trial by conduct."
1969.606,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.534,2685.026,"Well, I take it if you have a number of defendants who are equally abstract with your thought would be that each should have to have his own cubicle, state would have to provide -- what is that?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2685.026,2706.782,"Well, to close circuit the trial, I mean a cubicle I think is impractical because as was done in the senate hearing in California when the defendant got in the cubicle as a last effort to disrupt the proceeding -- he then pretended to be asleep during the entire hearing which lasted two or three weeks."
1969.606,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2720.329,2722.749,Probably that doesn't preserve his right to confrontation.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2722.749,2728.225,"Yes, but at least he will be seen the witnesses and he will be able to communicate with his attorney and tell him how to cross-examine."
1969.606,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2728.225,2734.1,It preserves some time but it does not preserve his right to confrontation.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2734.1,2740.009,"Well, that depends on how the right of confrontation is defined."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2769.867,2786.972,"Suppose he is put in a separate room or in the chamber and we find at the end of the trial that the telephone which sometimes happen, is that all in 15 minutes?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2786.972,2788.8,If the phone is out of order --
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.8,2789.917,Do we have new trial?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2789.917,2806.282,"No, because I would think that there should -- there would be a marshal in the room with the defendant who could -- if the phone is out of order, he could very simply communicate by a runner to the court that the phone is not working and let's get it repaired or recess for 10 or 15 minutes."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2806.282,2810.609,"But if he didn't do it, does he have to have a new trial?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2810.609,2811.744,Well --
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2811.744,2817.49,"Well, he didn't have is right of confrontation for 15 minutes I understand that's your argument."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2817.49,2835.795,"Well, he would still have the opportunity to see what is proceeding if the phone is not working because he now tries the phone to his attorney, it would only be a matter of minutes for him -- for a runner to go from the room where he's watching the trial to the court."
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2846.81,2853.695,He says from the beginning and sticks to it and I am not going to be tried.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2861.186,2862.932,Well --
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2862.932,2868.207,"That's his plan but he intends, what goes with that?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2878.799,2893.924,Because the court still has a responsibility and the courts do have a responsibility and we should not permit certain defendants to use of the power of the courts and dictate to them what or what is not going to happen.
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2893.924,2903.86,Let's say but I'm not going to be tried well would he cooperate anymore if you put him on somewhere where he could get a telephone and call up his lawyer?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2903.86,2904.992,"Yes, but at least he would --"
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2904.992,2906.617,(Voice Overlap) for other reasons?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2906.617,2911.068,But he is not disrupting the orderly process of the trial which is going on.
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2941.852,2960.707,"Well, as a lawyer, what do you think is, what would you suggest that a judge is under a duty to do but the defendant announces you will not be tried and conducts himself so as to prevent a trial in the courtroom?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2962.7,2966.158,I would either have him bound and gagged or I would build a glass --
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2966.158,2968.601,"(Voice Overlaps), wouldn't it?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2972.308,2981.641,"Why should that look bad? Historically this right has been -- defendant has always been bound and gagged, if he tries to cause a disturbance."
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2983.422,2984.869,"But, you take (Voice Overlaps) better."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,2986.485,2990.047,"Well, I think the best thing is the closed circuit to trial too."
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2996.748,3002.256,"What are you going to do when you get out of the small county like our practice at once he didn't have anything like that, is it?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3002.256,3011.153,"Okay, if you can't televise the trial, if you can't build a glass booth, then bind him and gag him and keep him in court."
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3011.153,3030.637,"Now, this seems to be the theory that this numbly disabled defendant had from the start and reading from a transcript here where he said to the judge after getting his second warning, you have the right to restrain me but you haven't got the right to remove me and you're not going to remove me."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3030.637,3031.237,That's correct.
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3031.237,3034.874,That's the theory of your case here and that was his theory of case of the trial.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3034.874,3038.908,That is correct.
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.908,3041.054,Pretty good analysis on his part?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3041.054,3066.395,"Well, he spent a lot of time in prison reading law books Your Honor and he relied on that recent Illinois Supreme Court decision, the Decimian (ph) case which counsel referred to where a defendant did cause a disruption -- he was removed from the courtroom for a moment and at which time the attorneys approached the bench."
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3089.391,3094.086,"I'm not saying it should have been done but of course, we are not ready to say (Voice Overlaps) --"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3094.086,3094.532,Pardon?
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3094.532,3105.538,"Suppose the judge could simply say, “Alright, you say you will not be tried, I will let you go to jail and stay until you're ready for a trial."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3110.927,3116.274,"Well, I think the court had the right to do that but the problem inherent in that is that there were four witnesses against--"
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3116.274,3117.564,But that is about the claim?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3117.564,3122.335,"Yeah -- no, I don't because there were four witnesses against the respondent."
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3143.68,3148.304,"Well, that's the life – things that happen and different would always happen."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3148.304,3150.171,"Well, but you see if --"
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3150.171,3154.35,I remember trying a case once in 12 years that's a murder was committed.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3155.965,3162.445,"Well, but there are certain circuits in where witnesses may disappear, they may die."
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3181.551,3192.335,"You would agree, won't you that something has to be done to keep the court -- the big subject to such indignity with such frustrations of justice."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3192.335,3196.591,"Yes, I do."
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3266.29,3273.976,"But I thought you were arguing a little earlier that he shouldn't been bound and gagged and kept all the time, wouldn't that be (Voice Overlaps) reminder?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3273.976,3278.41,"Sure, keep him in court, but don't bring him in and out of the court every time you want to identify him."
1969.606,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3297.553,3304.625,Don't you think this man was given about as fair a trail as it would possible for him to get?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3306.172,3312.752,"In the reading in the record, I will acknowledge that the court appointed attorney for him did an excellent job."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3358.164,3360.217,How many times does this man had been convicted?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3361.84,3369.669,He was convicted three times and I'm advised that there were other charges against him which he was never prosecuted on.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3369.669,3372.347,How old was he?
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3372.347,3378.036,"When he was convicted -- he is 38 now, he was convicted in 57, he was --"
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3378.036,3382.651,I was wondering about why he needs all these fatherly discussion.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3387.947,3402.2,"He -- well, I don't I -- it's not so much him, it's what he stands for which is the right of the defendant to be tried and preserve his rights and protect those rights."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3402.2,3417.379,What I don't understand is under your theory every other person in that courtroom has to act with demeanor in respect for the court except the defendant.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3419.181,3438.9,I think that the defendant also has to conduct himself with respect but you can exclude a spectator from the courtroom without violating the constitutional rights of the defendant but I believe that you cannot do that to the defendant because he has the right -- the defendant was on trial.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3438.9,3441.441,Regardless of what he does.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3441.441,3451.332,"Regardless of what he does, he has -- if he wants to go to sleep during the trial, that's his right."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3466.924,3470.8,All your point is it is why he wants to be there.
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3470.8,3483.475,"Well, anytime a defendant is tried, that's all the court really knows it, that is there because you have no knowledge as to what he is doing in his mind whether he is thinking about the baseball game that may be going on next week or something else."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3483.475,3487.608,"Is that your idea of confrontation, he is there bound and gagged?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3487.608,3497.172,The constitution does not require that the defendant sit and be alert and pay attention to the trial -- it just requires that he be there so he has the right to confront the witnesses.
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3497.172,3502.49,"Well, what's the difference between him sleeping outside and sleeping inside?"
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3502.49,3508.695,"Because, if he changes his mind that he wants to pay attention and wants to defend himself he can then do it."
1969.606,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3508.695,3510.967,"Well, he had four chances to change his mind."
1969.606,1,27197,h_reed_harris,,3510.967,3517.233,"Well, no, he was warned once about conducting his trial then that right was denied him."
1969.606,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3669.422,3673.7,"Very well, you have one minute left Mr. Flaum."
1969.606,2,30250,joel_m_flaum,,3673.7,3676.437,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.606,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3731.374,3732.806,Thank you Mr. Flaum.
