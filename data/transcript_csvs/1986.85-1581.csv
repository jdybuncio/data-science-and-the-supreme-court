1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.388,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1581, Solorio against the United States."
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,12.308,17.774,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1581,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,108.754,114.518,"We're speaking only now of the alleged Alaska offense, are we not?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,114.518,116.423,"--That's correct, Justice Blackmun."
1986.85-1581,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,116.423,117.064,Not the New York ones.
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,117.064,118.437,Not the New York offense.
1986.85-1581,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,118.437,125.122,Had the Alaska authorities indicated any interest in prosecution?
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,125.122,134.946,The Alaska... the Alaska authorities have given a tentative deferral of the prosecution to the Coast Guard.
1986.85-1581,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,166.575,170.62,But these particular victims and their fathers are no longer there?
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,170.62,172.79,"That's correct, Justice Blackmun."
1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,244.98,247.369,"Well, you say historic disapproval."
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,257.616,283.231,"Well, the O'Callahan decision basically goes through the history, especially at the time of the founding of this country, and also the history of our English ancestors, and basically states that there has been a disapproval of generally trying civilian type offenses by court martial."
1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.231,284.731,"Well, certainly not in this country."
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,289.089,295.525,"Well, that... it did perhaps impliedly overturn these decisions."
1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,297.117,300.382,"Well, then where do you get your historic disapproval from in this country?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,300.382,318.719,"--Well, even after the founding of this country, O'Callahan seems to indicate that there was a period of time when in this country most ordinary offenses were not tried by court martial."
1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.136,333.634,Disapproved by whom and when?
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,333.634,338.039,"Well, it would be disapproved by this Court."
1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.789,341.584,Before O'Callahan?
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,341.584,354.112,"--As I say, I believe that the founding fathers had a... and the history of our ancestors in England indicate--"
1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.112,359.0,"Well, do you think then the early cases from this Court didn't properly reflect this view of the founding fathers?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,359.0,368.075,--I don't think the early decisions of this Court directly addressed this particular issue.
1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.075,376.931,"I think your statement, there's a historic disapproval in this country, simply isn't supported by those early cases."
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,382.039,393.613,"Well, it was an extension, I believe, of some cases that had started to limit jurisdiction over people like military contractors and dependents."
1986.85-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.537,644.699,"Mr. Bruce, could you give me another example, the one that you would consider the closest, where a threshold question of whether the Court has jurisdiction over the matter is to be determined on the basis of, what do we have, 21 factors, and I assume that they're not exhausted?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,658.226,663.02,"--Offhand, Justice Scalia, I can't think of one."
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.889,762.244,xxx speaks of the military interest in so many words?
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,762.244,784.862,"Well, I think O'Callahan and Relford, and also this Court's Schlesinger decision, all imply that there's a balancing here between the military's interest in prosecuting a case, and the service member's interest in trial at a civilian court."
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.862,791.749,"But they don't... they don't really say that, do they?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,791.749,798.357,"Justice White, that's my reading of the cases."
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.357,802.73,"Do you find the words, military interest, in the O'Callahan?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,802.73,803.433,No.
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.37,808.698,"Or the word, balance?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,808.698,833.937,"--I think the closest that comes to that is perhaps language in Schlesinger that basically summarizes the service connection test, when it indicates that there should be a unique military interest that can't be adequately vindicated in a civilian court."
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.477,865.176,"So you don't... I take it you're not urging that there must be some finding that military discipline will be disturbed, or interfered with?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,865.176,869.751,I think that's one of the main justifications--
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.751,870.391,But not essential?
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,870.391,873.734,"--Well, the other one would be something that affected a--"
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.734,875.42,"Well, is it essential or not?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,876.342,876.998,"--No, sir."
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.466,880.371,"Well, that's all I really asked."
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,880.371,881.637,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,895.195,906.986,"Well, is that just a restatement of the service connected language in O'Callahan, or is that a narrowing or a broadening of O'Callahan?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,906.986,913.937,--I intended it to be just a restatement of the language in O'Callahan.
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.937,921.075,"xxx offsenses had occurred on the base, would there be court martial jurisdiction?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,921.075,929.353,"I believe that under the Relford decision, if they had occurred on a military base, there would be court martial jurisdiction."
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.353,932.961,Even though the victims were the same?
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,932.961,934.944,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.944,938.771,And... all right.
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,950.594,964.715,I think that the Relford decision has indicated that a crime of violence or that violates property on a military base may be sufficient to justify service connection.
1986.85-1581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.715,966.872,May or is?
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,966.872,971.354,"Is, excuse me, Justice White."
1986.85-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1042.887,1068.36,"xxx divided up argument with the amicus, but is either you or the amicus going to address the portion of the Solicitor General's brief that urges that if we agree with you, that the factors in Relford were not met, that we should overrule Relford and O'Callahan?"
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,1068.36,1069.547,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.547,1073.25,"Because if the amicus is not going to address that, I'd like to talk to you about it."
1986.85-1581,0,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,1073.25,1077.185,"Justice Scalia, I believe Mr. Fidell is going to address that point."
1986.85-1581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1146.345,1147.736,Thank you Mr. Bruce.
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1149.547,1156.373,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1263.972,1271.25,"Well, one reason to reconsider O'Callahan would be if we simply felt it was wrong as a matter of constitutional law."
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1274.249,1277.264,"That question obviously is always on the table, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1287.478,1291.727,"It has to be clearly wrong, rather than just wrong, before we overrule it?"
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1291.727,1295.695,--I think it should be very clearly wrong.
1986.85-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.362,1316.438,"Mr. Fidell, you say that it hasn't created any decision problems."
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1334.056,1335.931,"Not quite, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.715,1377.949,"Not at the moment, but it has been?"
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1377.949,1381.151,"For awhile, but that was departed from--"
1986.85-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.151,1383.493,"Well, here's my problem with it."
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1431.115,1436.91,"--Well, if Congress had taken the matter in hand, it might be a different question."
1986.85-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.705,1446.204,"Well, they couldn't take it in hand, once we tell... once we tell them it's a constitutional point."
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1446.204,1446.954,"--Yes, that's correct."
1986.85-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.042,1461.463,I don't know what I would do with a particular drug offense.
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1467.726,1472.895,"Well, but it's a point that the Court of Military Appeals, and the other military courts, have been grappling with."
1986.85-1581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.478,1504.758,xxx about the forgery and fraud cases?
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1504.758,1511.272,"You're think, I think, Justice White, of the Lockwood case."
1986.85-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.828,1575.327,"Well, you could restate the law of torts in, you know, a couple of lines."
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1577.763,1578.576,I'd need more time.
1986.85-1581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1581.216,1582.856,xxx anything that a reasonable man wouldn't do.
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1585.308,1589.323,"But the problem... the problem, Justice Scalia, it might be my last clear chance."
1986.85-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.846,1783.345,You're now using up your colleague's rebuttal.
1986.85-1581,1,22277,eugene_r_fidell,,1783.345,1786.405,"Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1986.85-1581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.511,1799.558,"Thank you, Mr. Fidell."
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,1801.276,1809.68,"In this case... thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1581,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1833.905,1837.152,"The military judge, however, found otherwise?"
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,1837.152,1839.121,"That is correct, Justice Blackmun."
1986.85-1581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.121,1841.588,Was it on base in Alaska?
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,1841.588,1844.29,In Alaska it was off base--
1986.85-1581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.29,1846.821,Off base in Alaska; on base in New York.
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,1846.821,1848.087,"--in New York, the offenses were on base."
1986.85-1581,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1848.087,1850.54,But the New York offenses are not at issue here?
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,1850.54,1852.149,They are not at issue here.
1986.85-1581,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2280.198,2283.226,"You want to go back, then, to the old status argument?"
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,2283.226,2285.539,"We do indeed, Justice Blackmun."
1986.85-1581,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2310.513,2314.23,"It would merely overrule O'Callahan, and with it Relford, of course."
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,2314.23,2317.229,--It would overrule O'Callahan.
1986.85-1581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2367.803,2375.675,"General Fried, before you go further on the constitutional point, let's assume we stand by Relford."
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,2428.609,2432.686,"--It seems to me, Justice Scalia, to make an enormous difference."
1986.85-1581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.254,2500.049,"So he's a thief, but he doesn't steal from his comrades."
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,2501.846,2518.339,"Stealing from his comrades does aggravate the offense, and does indeed implicate the concerns of the military, is the argument we are submitting; that is correct, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.448,2598.885,What if they change back?
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,2603.227,2611.099,--I would think not.
1986.85-1581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2783.718,2787.606,Did you intend to address at all the ex post facto argument?
1986.85-1581,2,18942,charles_fried,,2787.606,2794.65,"Well, the ex post facto argument troubles us a great deal, because it does not seem to us to be properly here."
1986.85-1581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2850.942,2852.255,"Thank you, General Fried."
1986.85-1581,3,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,2854.722,2870.388,"First of all, I'd like to address the suggestion that there should be a per se rule, that any offense against a dependent should be service connected."
1986.85-1581,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2909.388,2912.403,"Well, that's a good policy argument, but that can be made to the Congress."
1986.85-1581,3,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,2930.725,2936.802,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think it's really a constitutional issue."
1986.85-1581,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.769,2945.034,The argument you're making isn't a constitutional one.
1986.85-1581,3,38776,ribert_w_bruce_jr,,2950.642,2951.485,That's correct.
1986.85-1581,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.539,2979.562,"Thank you, Mr. Bruce."
