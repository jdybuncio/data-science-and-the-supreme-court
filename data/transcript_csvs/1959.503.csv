1959.503,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,46.699,48.673,"Counsel, wouldn't otherwise be present today."
1959.503,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,54.176,56.087,"Well, they should be here now."
1959.503,1,31584,jess_larson,,82.965,84.195,Mr. Chief Justice --
1959.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,84.195,87.721,(Inaudible)
1959.503,1,31584,jess_larson,,87.721,92.505,I -- I apologize to the Court for the mix up.
1959.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,100.678,104.481,(Inaudible)
1959.503,1,31584,jess_larson,,104.481,107.025,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1959.503,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,107.025,110.627,(Inaudible)
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,110.627,115.412,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.503,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,133.377,134.93,On a navigable river?
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,134.93,137.239,A nonnavigable.
1959.503,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,150.827,152.651,Franchise and waterways.
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,152.651,155.287,That's all.
1959.503,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,182.563,188.637,"Now, may I ask you, that land taken by condemnations of fast lands?"
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,188.637,197.654,"Partially and partially by -- I think there are some agreements about part of it, but there is no problem about it."
1959.503,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,198.677,200.592,(Inaudible)
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,200.592,203.442,There is no issue in the case about it.
1959.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.215,230.92,"What's the difference between those two, the franchise to build a dam and -- and the water rights --"
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,230.92,231.252,Well --
1959.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,231.252,233.552,-- vested in this state commission?
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,233.552,255.437,"There are riparian rights like the Niagara Mohawk case that you worked, Niagara Mohawk, you recall what International Paper Company had and they had separated from the land, those riparian rights and the Court held that since Congress contemplated, they should be compensated for, that they would have to be paid for."
1959.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.24,259.439,Quite apart from the franchise?
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,259.439,261.019,That's right.
1959.503,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.213,271.922,Well who -- it's for that reason that I asked this question I can see --
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,271.922,292.442,"But they're still separate and apart, if they were -- the United States would recognize that if they were vested water rights that someone held, that legally held under law that they would have to be obtained by condemnation or purchase or otherwise."
1959.503,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,325.165,336.757,Do I understand that you said in (Inaudible) and if water rights --
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,336.757,337.735,350.
1959.503,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,337.735,344.222,(Inaudible)
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,344.222,345.151,That's right.
1959.503,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,345.849,346.282,(Inaudible)
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,346.282,349.796,"No, that's right and that's the position of the Government."
1959.503,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,363.438,372.007,"Oh, were those (Inaudible) with the property (Inaudible) fast lands on using property?"
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,372.007,373.205,"Yes, fast lands."
1959.503,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,373.205,403.597,"In the Tax of Court of Government or purchase (Inaudible) isn't not just condemnation or purchase has with it all elements of the property involved including the highest and best use of the fast lands which includes the right to build and operate a dam with these rights, and if (Inaudible) they have that compensation to (Inaudible) --"
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,403.597,417.484,"Well, the Government does not claim that it has made compensation for that and it must be kept in mind that these lands are -- that are involved here or -- are not riparian in any way."
1959.503,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,667.521,669.923,What would the three (Inaudible) in this?
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,669.923,682.38,"The first one was the effect -- a substantial effect on navigation and the second was flood control, which is really a contributing factor and the other is a hydroelectric development."
1959.503,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,729.771,744.842,Why did a state license has no significance -- had no words (Inaudible)
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,744.842,748.672,"Well, it was worthless as far as the United States was concerned."
1959.503,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,751.053,752.167,As it was --
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,752.167,752.752,"Well, I --"
1959.503,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,752.752,761.787,-- but it would any (Inaudible)
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,761.787,763.81,"None, whatsoever, Mr. Justice."
1959.503,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,777.705,801.825,From that I understood that they couldn't utilize whatever they had in mind (Inaudible) by the decision (Inaudible)
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,801.825,805.16,"Well, my answer to that, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, would be that it did not."
1959.503,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,837.019,859.471,(Inaudible)
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,859.471,862.207,I couldn't conceive that were done to your holdings.
1959.503,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,976.617,979.117,Water at this place?
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,979.117,979.738,Yes.
1959.503,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1196.517,1200.407,And I take it that -- that the law of means -- that Oklahoma law is dependent.
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1202.233,1203.128,Yes.
1959.503,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1224.851,1227.627,"Is there a right, suppose rights."
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1227.627,1228.94,If the Court of Claims was right --
1959.503,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1228.94,1231.582,(Inaudible)
1959.503,2,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1231.582,1243.747,"Then I think that the-- the handling of water rights in the State of Oklahoma, if they got title to it anytime, would be in accordance with their laws."
1959.503,3,31584,jess_larson,,2751.219,2762.703,"Mr. Chief Justice, Members of Court."
1959.503,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2975.029,2979.208,"If they do that, if Oklahoma did not have a title?"
1959.503,3,31584,jess_larson,,2979.208,2981.306,"I'll come to that, Your Honor, in just a moment."
1959.503,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2981.306,2984.405,Very well.
1959.503,3,31584,jess_larson,,2984.405,2987.108,"Now, in 19 --"
1959.503,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2987.108,3000.894,"Before you get off that subject, could you tell me what -- what you mean by given the exclusive control, does that mean that's exclusive for purchases out of its power or (Inaudible)"
1959.503,3,31584,jess_larson,,3000.894,3016.4,"That -- they could use it for purposes of irrigation, for storage, for making it available to municipalities for water supply and for recreational and conservation and other purposes."
1959.503,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3016.4,3019.687,So they have to be given (Inaudible)
1959.503,3,31584,jess_larson,,3019.687,3021.415,That -- that is correct to the --
1959.503,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3021.415,3023.413,All -- of all the waters --
1959.503,3,31584,jess_larson,,3023.413,3026.438,Of all the waters of the Grand River as they flow through Oklahoma.
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6367.806,6370.857,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6370.857,6405.483,Before you -- before you (Inaudible)
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6405.483,6406.245,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6406.245,6410.91,How will you know (Inaudible)
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6410.91,6414.044,It is not like that at all.
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6438.371,6440.456,And did you go definitively?
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6440.456,6443.269,Exactly and that's the difference.
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6459.434,6467.73,(Inaudible)
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6467.73,6468.759,That's right.
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6468.759,6482.299,(Inaudible)
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6482.299,6483.071,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6483.071,6498.202,(Inaudible)
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6498.202,6506.089,"Yes, except that I think this is even more than that because this is a frustration of an opportunity rather than something that is destroyed."
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6508.048,6516.357,(Inaudible)
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6516.357,6517.376,This facility?
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6517.376,6517.845,Yes.
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6517.845,6519.616,They had no facility.
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6529.001,6529.949,I understood it.
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6541.177,6544.874,"Well, they have hoped to have a dam here and the facility that they (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.503,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6544.874,6557.777,"Well, didn't they actually have any process, Mr. Solicitor, the procedures for acquiring the lands upon which the dam would be built when you moved in?"
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6557.777,6561.24,"I don't know, but I would assume what Mr. Larson said in that regard."
1959.503,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6561.437,6577.08,"From what I understood this is what in the fact that they'd moved the transmission lines as I understood it, the right of way down to the place where the dam was to be constructed and were in the process of about to acquire the lands when you stepped in (Inaudible)"
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6577.08,6578.616,I have assumed that what he said.
1959.503,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6586.108,6597.68,And is it true that these three dams were all under the basic master plan to be part of a -- a coordinated complex for the generation of electricity and flood control and navigation?
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6597.68,6598.115,That is correct.
1959.503,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6598.115,6615.33,And that possibly the three together were taking away -- taking -- possibly taking away one dam would do more damage to the whole than just the -- that particular -- that portion or the part?
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6615.33,6636.947,"Well, I don't -- I think that's all resolved in the denial of their claim with the Federal Power Commission, but you -- the further fact that you should know that it's in our brief is that the Markham Ferry Dam was allotted by the Federal Power Commission to the Government to build and then Congress decided to have the authority build it."
1959.503,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6652.803,6658.06,"So this is a value of those plans, no dams would be left."
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6664.752,6675.822,"Well, there's a $6,500,000, we'd say it tell about in the footnote that Congress has voted as an appropriation for them with the release connected to it."
1959.503,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6686.839,6689.652,That was all like damage to the residue idea.
1959.503,4,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6689.652,6690.871,Apparently.
