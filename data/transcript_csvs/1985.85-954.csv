1985.85-954,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.456,"Mr. Burns, I think you may proceed when you are ready."
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,11.456,15.593,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,71.078,76.632,"You are not suggesting, then, if Congress clearly intended to do that it would be unconstitutional?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,76.632,77.965,"No, I am not, Your Honor."
1985.85-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,112.138,115.59,You wouldn't know that from the brief that the Congress has filed in this case.
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,115.59,121.577,"No, you wouldn't, but I shall try to embellish that point as we proceed."
1985.85-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.407,224.293,"That's the statute that we're dealing with, or we're dealing with the two of them together?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,224.293,236.702,"--Yes, but as the court below found and as I think we all agree, the language which I quoted in the Pelly Amendment is the language which the Court must address in this case."
1985.85-954,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,329.711,333.597,"Mr. Burns, I'm not an expert in whales."
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,336.032,336.815,Minke whale.
1985.85-954,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,350.041,350.974,How do we know that?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,351.993,358.73,"Well, they... believe it or not, Justice Blackmun, there is methodology for determining that."
1985.85-954,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,364.634,367.919,"But only 300,000 minke whales?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,367.919,368.486,Right.
1985.85-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,381.827,384.529,How do you classify that agreement?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,384.529,392.301,"--I classify it as an executive agreement between two sovereign nations, Justice White, binding on both."
1985.85-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,392.301,397.271,And it was negotiated and signed by the Secretary of Commerce?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,397.271,408.913,"No, it was negotiated and signed by the Secretary of Commerce on the one hand, with the approval of the Secretary of State, and a diplomat, an authorized diplomat of the Japanese government."
1985.85-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.913,411.179,Cabinet level?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,411.179,412.095,"Oh, yes."
1985.85-954,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,465.48,473.169,"Did the court of appeals majority, General Burns, hold out in so many words that last... that any violation of the harvest quotas would be a diminishment?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,473.169,474.019,In so many words.
1985.85-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.304,480.906,May I ask one question about the litigation.
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,486.91,497.535,"--We have difficulty, jurisdictional difficulty, which we argue in our reply brief after the issue was raised by respondents on the issue of standing in the case to begin with."
1985.85-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.535,498.368,I understand.
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,507.724,512.395,"I think under appropriate circumstances, it would, yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-954,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.395,513.178,You do agree with that?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,513.178,533.708,"If the decision below is reversed and the international agreement between the United States and Japan, which is the single most important whaling nation in the world, if that decision below is reversed all whaling by Japanese nationals will surely end by April 1, 1988."
1985.85-954,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,553.204,562.143,"Would those sanctions be the sanctions that were in the wind, in the offing, two years ago when the bargain was struck?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,562.143,599.333,"Oh, yes, and Mr. Chief Justice, you will find as one goes through this record that there have been six instances in which certifications have taken place, five of them under the Pelly amendment, and in each of those five instances involving Japan and the Soviet Union, Korea, Chile and Peru, sanctions that were issued because when we brought them to the bargaining table the countries involved fell into line and in each instance joined the International Whaling Commission."
1985.85-954,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,599.333,603.304,Has there been any instance where the certification has not taken place?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,603.304,624.051,"Justice Blackmun, there are three instances in which certification has not taken place, one in 1979 involving Spain, one in 1980 involving Taiwan, and one I believe in 1982 involving Chile."
1985.85-954,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,660.438,663.24,I can understand your policy argument all right.
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,666.509,674.531,"--And with specific reference to that, we need not speculate and we need not conjecture, Justice Blackmun."
1985.85-954,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,766.537,778.012,"Mr. Burns, may I ask, is there some kind of agreement which provides a five-year moratorium on whaling ending in 1990?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,778.012,785.851,"There is a, today a moratorium in force without any termination date."
1985.85-954,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,787.784,796.39,"Well, what's the Japanese agreement, if there is a reversal... you have said that Japan would be out of the whaling business in 1988?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,796.39,796.957,--That's correct.
1985.85-954,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,796.957,803.895,"Well, is it that, or are they simply going to abide by the moratorium which as I understood it, by its terms ends in 1990?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,803.895,816.47,"They will abide by the moratorium, but there are 41 nations in the International Whaling Commission, Justice Brennan, only eight of whom are whaling nations."
1985.85-954,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,824.874,835.699,"No, my question was, what is it Japan has agreed to do in 1988, get out of whaling entirely, or simply to abide by the moratorium until its termination?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,835.699,849.108,"--They have agreed to abide by the moratorium and as a practical matter, we say, the Secretary of Commerce says, the Secretary of State says, that this amounts to a cessation of commercial whaling."
1985.85-954,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,849.108,850.174,In 1988?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,850.174,852.143,"Yes, in 1988."
1985.85-954,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,852.143,854.46,"Not in 1990, or whatever the termination--"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,854.46,861.582,"April of 1988, at the end of the coastal whaling season which ends April of 1988."
1985.85-954,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,861.582,872.188,"--This agreement between the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of State, was Congress involved in that in any way, shape or fashion?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,872.188,873.974,"No, it was not, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-954,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,873.974,876.676,"So, you don't know what their position is?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,876.676,878.042,"Well, I do know what--"
1985.85-954,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,878.042,880.811,Except what they said in the statute?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,880.811,884.531,"--No, I know more than that, and I'd like to share it with you if I may, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-954,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,884.531,885.947,Is it in the record?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,885.947,886.53,"Yes, it is."
1985.85-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1011.444,1012.394,Mr. Burns--
1985.85-954,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1012.394,1014.077,--It's not precise to me.
1985.85-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1014.077,1028.154,"Mr. Burns, may I inquire what the effect is of the fact that Japan objected to the quotas, and therefore under the terms of the Act is not bound by them?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,1032.439,1046.865,"It means that Japan has the right under international law, under the international compact originally entered into once they filed the objection to ignore the compact."
1985.85-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1046.865,1053.019,But that fact has nothing to do with the imposition or determination to impose sanctions?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,1053.019,1078.936,"Well, the point is that Japan in this case clearly would have been violating and departing from the schedules adopted, but was persuaded not to follow that course and an agreement was struck whereby they would take, starting now, for example, 1986 through 1988, 200 sperm whales in each of those two years."
1985.85-954,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1082.788,1092.862,"Yes, but is there any effect at all by virtue of the fact that Japan objected to the quotas and therefore supposedly wasn't bound by them?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,1092.862,1114.276,"The effect of that would be that absent the negotiation, absent sitting down at a table, absent an agreement, Japan would be whaling and continue to take whales without limitation, subject solely to its own determination, subject only to its own discretion."
1985.85-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.276,1116.127,But subject to sanction?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,1116.127,1122.365,And subject to the availability of sanctions under both the Pelly Amendment and the Packwood Amendment.
1985.85-954,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.365,1124.781,Which they might think were serious?
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,1124.781,1127.833,There's no doubt that they thought they were serious.
1985.85-954,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1144.611,1153.817,"Well, the basic agreement doesn't seem to have much binding effect to it; at least, it permits a great deal of dilatory tactics here, doesn't it?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,1153.817,1156.269,The answer to that is twofold.
1985.85-954,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1170.529,1179.868,"Meanwhile, two or three years of crops of whales are taken contrary to the intent, at least the basic intent of the original agreement?"
1985.85-954,0,15556,arnold_i_burns,,1179.868,1184.355,"The original agreement between the two sovereign nations, yes."
1985.85-954,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1197.179,1214.958,Mr. Whitney.
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1214.958,1218.576,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-954,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1234.67,1236.586,Would you like to raise the lectern.
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1245.942,1264.605,"--The Japanese petitioners agree with the presentation, essentially with the presentation we've just heard by the federal petitioners."
1985.85-954,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1324.394,1327.346,But may resume after 1990?
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1327.346,1346.574,"Only if the International Whaling Commission dissolves the moratorium, a point which my predecessor pointed out, is highly unlikely since the International Whaling Commission normally votes 37 or something to one on the subject."
1985.85-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.013,1434.715,"Well, what are they involved in?"
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1434.715,1436.565,--I'm sorry?
1985.85-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.565,1439.35,Are they involved at all in this litigation?
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1439.35,1439.884,"No, sir."
1985.85-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.884,1442.286,Are there any limits on them?
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1442.286,1453.343,"They are the subject of independent protection, protective measures, and there have been... there has been no taking of those species of whales for a very long time."
1985.85-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.343,1453.943,Yes.
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1453.943,1469.603,"Indeed, this is only indirect but one of the concerns is the rapid increase in the minke whale population which is a species involved in this agreement, is endangering the survival of the blue whale by encroaching on their feeding."
1985.85-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.299,1553.375,"Absent any treaty at all, I suppose Congress could limit... could impose some limits on the taking of whales in certain waters?"
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1553.375,1559.545,--I'm not terribly sure they could do that as to foreign nationals.
1985.85-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.946,1589.398,Is this... was this presented below?
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1589.398,1590.098,"--Yes, sir."
1985.85-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1590.098,1591.498,Was it rejected?
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1591.498,1595.785,"It was, I think fair to say, not even considered."
1985.85-954,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.785,1599.07,Is it among the questions presented in this case?
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1599.07,1601.689,Only indirectly.
1985.85-954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.275,1667.298,"But, Mr. Whitney, the Pelly Amendment, as I read that Section 1, doesn't talk about violation of a treaty."
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1672.285,1693.449,"Yes, that's the point I am striving to make, is that it is inherently paradoxical and self-contradictory to conclude, we submit, that the exercise of an unqualified treaty right to object somehow diminishes the effectiveness of the treaty which propounds and endows that unqualified right."
1985.85-954,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.449,1696.067,"But the Pelly Amendment doesn't say ""treaty""."
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1699.019,1704.856,"Well, that's... I take it that does embrace the convention that we're talking about."
1985.85-954,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1708.791,1712.577,"Now, you challenge the amendment itself?"
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1712.577,1714.295,I'm sorry?
1985.85-954,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.295,1718.164,Are you bringing the validity of the Pelly Amendment itself--
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1718.164,1718.683,"No, sir."
1985.85-954,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1842.078,1843.094,Your time has expired.
1985.85-954,1,42250,scott_c_whitney,,1843.094,1843.928,"Thank you, sir."
1985.85-954,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1843.928,1850.917,Mr. Rogers.
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,1850.917,1854.552,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2198.459,2212.719,"Mr. Rogers, a couple times you referred to diminishing the effectiveness of the convention, which I realize is the language of the Packwood Amendment, but the Pelly Amendment says, diminish the effectiveness of an international fishery conservation program."
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2214.235,2242.238,"The reason for... the reason, Mr. Justice Rehnquist for the distinction in language was that the Pelly Amendment was first drafted to include, most importantly, the North Atlantic salmon regulatory system so that the broader term, ""international fishery system"", was used, but it's clear that Congress meant to include in Pelly the whaling convention system as well, for the legislative history."
1985.85-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.337,2298.623,To remove the discretion of the President?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2298.623,2299.989,--I'm sorry?
1985.85-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.989,2301.755,To remove the discretion of the President?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2301.755,2302.289,Precisely.
1985.85-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2437.278,2447.233,"Mr. Rogers, all I have before me is the language of the Pelly and Packwood Amendments set forth in Addendum 1 to the Brief for the Federal Petitioner."
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2469.499,2474.384,"That is the privilege to fish... excuse me, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2478.521,2480.321,"So, we're not talking about imports?"
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2480.321,2480.487,"No, no."
1985.85-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.487,2481.154,But we're talking--
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2481.154,2482.237,Not under Packwood-Magnuson.
1985.85-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.766,2533.503,--And what was the alleged failure to comply this time?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2537.339,2537.672,Yes.

1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2548.611,2554.182,"--This was, and it is admitted by all parties to have been an intentional violation."
1985.85-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.182,2555.884,Of the moratorium?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2555.884,2556.851,Of the moratorium.
1985.85-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.851,2558.752,No one should have taken any whales?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2558.752,2568.941,"First on sperm whales, and indeed it should be understood, Mr. Justice, that the sperm whale ban went into effect, we sued, and then the agreement occurred."
1985.85-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2626.913,2633.884,What about the legislative history at the time of the adoption of the Pelly Amendment rather than later?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2642.739,2645.239,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1985.85-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2713.383,2738.967,"Well, I think the language that one would have to look at is the language that says, when the Secretary of Commerce determines that the fishing operations are being conducted in a manner or under circumstances which diminish, all that language--"
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2738.967,2739.483,Yes.
1985.85-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2739.483,2749.406,"--which is perhaps not necessarily definitive, doesn't admit of the certainty that you speak of--"
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2749.406,2780.377,"In the abstract, you are right, but in the context first of the fact that this Pelly Amendment in connection with whaling was directed to reinforce Congress's effort to strengthen the International Whaling Convention system, and the fact that as Congress saw it numerical quotas were the very heart of that system."
1985.85-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2864.548,2875.672,"--Well, I know it's not this case, but suppose that it were determined or alleged that a nation had taken a single whale by mistake."
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2875.672,2876.722,By mistake?
1985.85-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2876.722,2877.972,After that moratorium.
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2877.972,2881.34,"We would not be here, and we would not contend that would diminish the effectiveness."
1985.85-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.853,2907.074,Are you going to deal with the availability of mandamus in your oral argument?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,2907.074,2918.613,"Yes, I'll say a word about that, if I may, Justice Rehnquist, as soon as I finish up with respect to the legislative history point."
1985.85-954,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3059.003,3065.34,"You still haven't mentioned anything about the legislative history of the Pelly Amendment, I noticed."
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3065.34,3085.486,"Well, I meant to say, and I will mention again if I may, Justice O'Connor, in our view the legislative history of Pelly is as good, although of course no enlightened by the eight years experience thereafter with respect to the legislative intent of the Congress at that time."
1985.85-954,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.562,3179.531,May I ask a question about the language of the statute that troubles me a little.
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3197.408,3229.446,"It's an issue that we hadn't focused on, Justice Stevens, because the order as it came out of the district court was an order enjoining the agreement, but I would suggest that the order appropriately, if it's expressed in affirmative, mandatory terms, would be that he certifies, that he has no discretion not to certify."
1985.85-954,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3229.446,3240.504,"But that is if he has made a determination, but we treat it as though it is so clear, that the facts are there, that he must certify that he has made a determination even if he hasn't?"
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3244.306,3271.689,"He hasn't made a determination, but our position is, on that, that an intentional wholesale violation of a numerical quota, and most dramatically and particularly a wholesale violation of the supreme act of the Commission, the global moratorium, is inevitably, must by any standard be determined to be a diminishment of the effectiveness."
1985.85-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.689,3284.163,"--Well, he can't be... he has no authority to certify unless he makes that determination, so if he certifies he has to say there is a diminishment of the fishery?"
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3284.163,3286.163,"That's correct, yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-954,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3286.163,3287.865,"He has to say, ""I have determined that""--"
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3287.865,3289.765,"""I have determined, and I therefore certify. """
1985.85-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3317.384,3324.538,"--Well, the mandamus doesn't issue in a case where someone has exceeded their authority."
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3329.108,3329.608,Yes.
1985.85-954,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.326,3343.868,"Well, but you know, we don't have many cases where a writ of mandamus has been issued to a Cabinet officer, and in the area of foreign affairs."
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3343.868,3352.889,You have not had many cases either where his authority is so clearly limited as it was here.
1985.85-954,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3370.149,3374.72,Wouldn't a declaratory judgment give you all the relief you need?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3374.72,3375.487,Beg pardon?
1985.85-954,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3375.487,3378.505,Wouldn't a declaratory judgment give you all the relief you need?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3378.505,3381.391,I think the declaratory judgment would give us relief.
1985.85-954,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.249,3434.341,You say the Secretary should not have purported to permit another country to take a certain number of whales contrary to the moratorium?
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3434.341,3434.958,Correct.
1985.85-954,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3505.437,3509.989,"I take it you would not say that it's wholly divergent from foreign policy considerations, though?"
1985.85-954,2,45991,william_d_rogers,,3509.989,3510.389,No.
1985.85-954,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3552.466,3556.703,"Mr. Burns, you have three minutes remaining."
1985.85-954,3,15556,arnold_i_burns,,3556.703,3558.572,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
