1985.84-1728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.848,"Ms. Kuhl, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,66.848,69.269,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.081,236.779,"Well, Ms. Kuhl, suppose that we agreed that the circular is not a law for purposes of Section 7106."
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,254.585,257.755,"That ends the inquiry in our view, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.755,259.864,What is the inquiry?
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,262.661,263.457,That's correct.
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.595,271.999,"I thought your opponent says it doesn't, because in any event it's grievable under the Act."
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,271.999,272.717,--That's right.
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,306.049,313.904,"I take it, though, that you take the position that under Section 7117(a)(1)--"
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,313.904,314.357,Yes.
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,314.357,318.917,--the circular is a rule or regulation?
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,318.917,322.339,"Well, of course the language there is a bit different."
1985.84-1728,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,365.196,368.898,"Counsel, is the circular reproduced in your brief any there?"
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,368.898,373.709,"The circular has been lodged with the Court, Justice."
1985.84-1728,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,373.709,374.771,Is it very long?
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,374.771,377.504,"Well, I can show it to you."
1985.84-1728,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,378.972,380.362,"Yes, but that isn't the full circular."
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,398.105,402.649,"Well, I apologize if the Court does not have those materials available to it."
1985.84-1728,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,418.691,421.861,"It's all of ten pages, eleven maybe."
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,421.861,422.907,It's quite short.
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,574.314,586.122,"What effect would the proposal have on management rights, other than an effect on grievance and arbitration procedures?"
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,588.028,590.34,"Well, it would have really a very substantive effect."
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,615.938,616.907,Not the union's.
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,618.313,618.671,"--I'm sorry, I misspoke."
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,623.983,627.449,I just wonder what effect it would have other than on grievance and arbitration.
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,629.23,635.915,"Well, when a grievance is filed, Justice O'Connor, the agency is really placed in a difficult dilemma."
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,637.367,644.209,"Well, it is... you agree that it would have no effect other than on grievance and arbitration procedures?"
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,644.209,657.687,"--Well, the grievance and arbitration... I think our point is that the grievance and arbitration procedures would affect the substance of contracting out, because the agency's decisions will be affected."
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,657.687,666.215,"Well, the other side takes the position that the Act requires that these matters be subject to grievance and arbitration anyway."
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,666.215,679.882,"That's correct, but that's because they do not admit that the ""nothing in this chapter"" language applies to the grievance proceedings as well as to the negotiability context."
1985.84-1728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.528,703.669,"Well, be a little more concrete."
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,717.866,718.35,--That's right.
1985.84-1728,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,734.389,739.076,"And if the arbitrator agreed with then, the contracting out would be interfered with, I gather?"
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,739.076,740.075,It would be.
1985.84-1728,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,826.056,854.139,"I take it you submit alternative theories by which you could prevail, the theory that 7106 ends the inquiry if the circular is not a law or the theory that 7117(a)(1) ends the case if we say it's a rule or regulation that's inconsistent."
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,854.139,859.058,"That's correct, and we have yet another variation on the first theory."
1985.84-1728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.746,979.713,"Well, under the union's theory, would that then be decided by an arbitrator?"
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,979.713,983.555,"That's correct, it would be decided by--"
1985.84-1728,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,983.555,986.726,Whether the fire service... Forest Service was laying off the right people?
1985.84-1728,0,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,986.726,989.35,"--That's right, it would be decided by an arbitrator."
1985.84-1728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1348.625,1354.295,Ms. Peters.
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1354.295,1357.045,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Courts:
1985.84-1728,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.05,1622.998,"It is a little difficult to conceive of a policy circular like this as being a law, though, isn't it?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1622.998,1636.76,"Well, I would note that it was published for notice and comment in the Federal Register, and that even Petitioner would have it be a rule or regulation within the meaning of Section 7117."
1985.84-1728,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1636.76,1638.523,But not necessarily a law.
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1645.599,1659.266,"In terms of Section 7106, I think that a natural meaning given to that term and the term that the Authority has given to the term ""in accordance with applicable law"" means applicable legal requirements."
1985.84-1728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.959,1702.45,"Well, what if a Director of OMB, instead of issuing a circular, had simply called in the administrative officers of all the agencies and departments and said: Look, I'm going to tell you now how we're going to handle contracting out, and he told them maybe in 15 minutes or a half an hour what the substance of this circular."
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1709.62,1712.511,"In that situation, it may not be."
1985.84-1728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.582,1741.561,"Well, what if a third party interested in contracting out were to try to litigate the question of whether EEOC had properly complied with the OMB directive?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1745.949,1748.667,They may have access to the Comptroller General.
1985.84-1728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.667,1751.104,Do you think... that wouldn't be a lawsuit.
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1752.322,1756.305,"Well, that I do not know."
1985.84-1728,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1874.461,1884.316,"Well, Ms. Peters, suppose we disagree with you and think the circular isn't a law under the terminology of Section 7106."
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1885.535,1902.62,"Well, I'm not sure conceptually how it would not be an applicable law, first of all, particularly in view of the fact, for example, that OMB itself--"
1985.84-1728,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.62,1906.51,"Well, just suppose that we disagree with you and think it's not."
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1907.634,1930.22,"--In my view and in the authority's view, the scope of the grievance procedure is defined by the statutory definition of ""grievance"", and the statutory definition of ""grievance"" talks about matters, first of all, relating to the employment of an employee, and secondly about the misapplication of laws, rules, or regulations affecting conditions of employment."
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.214,1945.166,How would it be pertinent?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1945.166,1946.51,Pardon?
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.51,1948.446,You just said that would be pertinent.
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1951.117,1957.161,"If it were a rule or a regulation, even if it could not be considered a law, and if it contained some mandatory criteria--"
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.161,1961.236,And the Authority's position is that any applicable rule or regulation is grievable?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1961.236,1964.688,--That relates... that affects conditions of employment.
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.594,1967.952,Is that because of the definition of a grievance in the statute?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1967.952,1969.046,--That is correct.
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.046,1979.605,And so it doesn't make any difference whether in the collective bargaining agreement it says that management will abide by all rules and regulations?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1979.605,1980.62,That is correct.
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.634,1993.896,"So a grievance... under this scheme, grievances are not limited to construing and applying the collective bargaining agreement, is that it?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,1993.896,1996.879,"--That is correct, under our statutory scheme."
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.364,2000.455,That's in the statutory definition?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2000.455,2001.345,"--Yes, it is."
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.345,2007.89,Do you have... does the agency have authority to issue regulations to implement the statute?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2007.89,2008.14,Our statute?
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.559,2019.12,"So what do you call the statute, the Federal Labor Relations Law?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2019.12,2023.587,"Yes, it's called the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute, yes."
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.587,2030.6,You feel... and is it clear that the agency is entrusted with the enforcement of that statute?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2030.6,2032.677,"Of our statute, yes."
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.782,2053.481,"And you construe the language of the statute to apply to a situation like this, whether this is a law or whether it isn't for another purpose?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2062.993,2070.411,--Petitioner has found it to be a Government-wide rule or regulation within the meaning of Section 7117 of the statute.
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.702,2090.67,"So why should be debate some abstract thing like whether this presidential directive is a ""law"" or not?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2093.543,2098.494,"--Well, that would I think be the pertinent point."
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.13,2111.707,"Well, it needn't be negotiable to be grievable."
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2111.707,2114.847,--That is correct.
1985.84-1728,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.384,2144.287,"To make it negotiable, don't you have to say that it's a law?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2149.489,2157.502,"--Well, in our view it is... in our view, the natural meaning of the phrase ""in accordance with applicable laws"" means applicable legal requirements."
1985.84-1728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.203,2242.779,"Ms. Peters, may I ask you a question at this point?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2242.779,2242.983,Yes.
1985.84-1728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2242.983,2248.026,That's true whether or not this provision is included in the contract under your submission?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2248.026,2248.573,That is correct.
1985.84-1728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.573,2257.711,"Under your submission, would the inclusion of this provision in the contract make anything subject to the grievance procedure that would not already be subject to the grievance procedure?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2257.711,2262.302,The inclusion of this in the contract would make nothing subject to the grievance procedure which is not already.
1985.84-1728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.302,2265.676,And why is it so important to the union then?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2265.676,2280.827,"Both NTEU, the amicus, and AFGE, our Respondent, our joint Respondent here, indicated in their brief to this Court that it is simply a common practice in the federal sector, where so many things are subject to law--"
1985.84-1728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.827,2282.124,Is it worth litigating about?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2282.966,2284.856,--It is what we are litigating.
1985.84-1728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2284.856,2289.792,"Is it worth all the time if it really doesn't make any difference, if it's customary to do it?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2292.214,2294.259,For putting it in the contract?
1985.84-1728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.259,2296.196,"Yes, if you have the same rights without it."
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2300.68,2306.88,"Well, of course simply... it is in line with long-established precedent to find this negotiable."
1985.84-1728,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.34,2327.762,At least it would make the contract shorter if you left the provision out.
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2336.227,2336.68,Yes.
1985.84-1728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2336.68,2354.094,"Is it your position that the phrase in the statute ""in accordance with applicable law"" means that they conduct an arbitration to decide what that means, what is applicable law?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2354.094,2362.107,"Arbitration only would view mandatory criteria that somehow affect, that affect conditions of employment."
1985.84-1728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2373.384,2375.274,"Well, I'm still not sure I have your answer."
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2379.007,2379.553,Yes.
1985.84-1728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2379.553,2383.52,--whether something is in accordance with applicable law?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2383.52,2387.55,"Well, the arbitrator would look at something and see--"
1985.84-1728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2387.55,2398.266,"You mean the arbitrator and not the agency, not the statutory agent that's engaging in the contracting out?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2398.266,2406.027,"--The statutory agent would be an employing agency, and it would have one view, perhaps, of the applicable law."
1985.84-1728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2408.916,2410.29,But you're saying that must be arbitrated?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2410.29,2427.581,"--Under the statute, the express terms of the statute, the grievance procedure extends to misapplications or misinterpretations or violations of laws, rules, or regulations, and that would include laws, Government-wide rules or regulations, or agency regulations."
1985.84-1728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2427.581,2429.049,And that includes--
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2429.049,2429.424,"Yes, in our view, yes."
1985.84-1728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2429.424,2431.329,--Your position is that applicable law includes the circular?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2431.329,2433.719,"That is correct, yes."
1985.84-1728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2433.719,2434.187,Ms. Peters--
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2434.187,2434.625,Yes.
1985.84-1728,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2434.625,2460.973,"--Did the agency interpret the proposal with respect to circular A-76 to mean that, if it were agreed to or otherwise came into effect, that the provisions of circular A-76 as it then stood would bind EEOC as to the employees, even though OMB were to change the circular?"
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2460.973,2464.566,I don't know if that's what the Petitioners here have in mind.
1985.84-1728,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.133,2531.226,Ms. Peters--
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2531.226,2531.46,Yes.
1985.84-1728,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2531.46,2536.303,--why couldn't this have been settled within the administrative section of Government?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2536.303,2540.847,"Well, we are an independent agency and we are an adjudicatory--"
1985.84-1728,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2540.847,2544.439,Is there no way to... there's nobody who can settle this?
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2544.439,2553.56,"--Well, we are here as Respondents, Justice Marshall, and this case began when we made an adjudication of a negotiability dispute."
1985.84-1728,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2558.044,2561.886,But this is a case of the United States versus the United States.
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2561.886,2564.448,"--Perhaps, perhaps."
1985.84-1728,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2584.611,2590.202,"The Government pays for all of these expenses, the briefs, and everything, on both sides."
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2590.202,2590.734,"--That is correct, that is correct."
1985.84-1728,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2590.734,2591.951,On both sides.
1985.84-1728,1,40194,ruth_e_peters,,2591.951,2592.81,That is correct.
1985.84-1728,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3105.667,3109.758,"I'd just like to make one point briefly, if I may."
1985.84-1728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.716,3149.602,Don't you have to convince us that the agency's interpretation of the relevant statute if just contrary to the statute?
1985.84-1728,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3149.602,3150.274,"Well, I'm--"
1985.84-1728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.274,3154.178,And there's just not any room for their position?
1985.84-1728,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3154.178,3160.082,"--Well, I'm glad you asked that question, because it does raise the question of agency deference."
1985.84-1728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.25,3172.545,"And you have to convince us of that, don't you?"
1985.84-1728,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3172.545,3176.81,"Well, but also the agency has not been consistent in its interpretation, and I think--"
1985.84-1728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.81,3179.574,"Well, a lot of agencies aren't and we still defer."
1985.84-1728,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3179.574,3183.618,"--Well, but it is on this very--"
1985.84-1728,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3183.618,3185.993,And your office frequently asks us to.
1985.84-1728,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3187.305,3192.865,"--Well, it is unusual for us to be arguing against agency deference here."
1985.84-1728,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3192.865,3197.067,"Isn't there something of a little bit of reciprocal deference involved here, too?"
1985.84-1728,2,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,3199.504,3210.249,"Well, and indeed, as to the interpretation of A-76, it should be the interpretation of the Office of Management and Budget that should prevail."
1985.84-1728,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3254.262,3256.09,"Thank you, counsel."
