1974.74-548,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.596,"We’ll hear arguments next in 74-548, United States against Mississippi."
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,49.411,50.568,Thank you.
1974.74-548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.177,627.82,Would you be making the same argument if this case had come here from the state court of Mississippi?
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,627.82,629.711,Would we be making the same argument?
1974.74-548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.12,636.12,You mean the legal incidence matter is a federal constitutional law --
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,636.12,637.512,"Yes, I think -- I think this --"
1974.74-548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.512,642.216,"Because you wouldn’t have to construe, take the construction of the Mississippi court as to wiggle into."
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,642.216,669.111,"I think the Court has on occasion in its intergovernmental immunity cases stated that what the state’s highest construction of its statute is certainly persuasive, but in the Agricultural Bank case upon which we heavily rely, I think the Court also said that “As since it doesn’t involve a constitutional principle, that the Court feels free to reexamine the basis of that state court’s holding.”"
1974.74-548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,669.111,675.476,"So, in terms of the question I asked there’s no difference between the federal court and the state court?"
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,675.476,676.16,I don’t think so.
1974.74-548,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,676.502,677.955,"Well, at least this much --"
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,677.955,680.484,"Yes, is at least this much, I suppose that it is --"
1974.74-548,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,680.484,690.598,"What we’ve said is in the state -- where the highest state court has said, what the state statute does in the way of legal instance is entitled to great respect nonetheless?"
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,690.598,691.216,I think that’s right.
1974.74-548,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,691.216,693.009,"Considerable weight and so forth, isn’t it?"
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,693.009,708.722,"I think that’s absolutely right Mr. Justice Brennan, but in the Agricultural Bank case, I think the Court after stating that and that case did come here from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, the Court went on to disagree with the Massachusetts' highest court’s interpretation of their --"
1974.74-548,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,708.722,710.459,"Well now, I think it’s implicit and they --"
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,710.459,710.612,Yes.
1974.74-548,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,710.612,712.502,-- were stated it that it’s still open.
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,712.502,715.03,"Oh, I think that’s absolutely right, I think that’s absolutely right."
1974.74-548,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,745.067,750.453,"Don’t you might saying now, what is the Government’s position as to the proper definition for legal incidence?"
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,750.453,777.107,"We think that the proper definition of legal incidence is that where -- in other words, let me put up to you this way, that if the statute requires that the tax be passed on and collected from the purchaser as it was in Massachusetts and as it is in this case, then we believe that the legal incidence of the tax falls upon the purchaser and not upon the vendor."
1974.74-548,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,782.41,789.024,"Well, when the vendor is free or not to do so, then it’s really only shifting the economic burden and doesn’t affect the incidence."
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,789.024,789.755,Yes.
1974.74-548,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,789.755,790.373,Legal incidence.
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,790.373,790.832,Right.
1974.74-548,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,806.2,809.627,Does your opposition concede that Mr. Smith?
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,809.627,826.142,"I don’t think, well I think -- I think to the extent that our opposition talks about the Agricultural Bank case here, I think what they have argued to the court is that that case is not germane because it didn’t involve a constitutional holding."
1974.74-548,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,853.956,861.901,But don’t they place a great deal of emphasis on the ability of the distiller to absorb this tax himself?
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,861.901,887.964,"They do place some emphasis upon that, but I think that the court in Agricultural Bank simply said that in fact, it’s really right at the end because of the same point was made in Agricultural Bank and the court right at the end of its opinion said “It seems clear to us that the force of the law is such that regardless of sanctions, businessmen will attempt in their everyday commercial affairs to conform to its provisions as written."
1974.74-548,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,962.764,970.735,"And that’s being distinguish James against Dravo that there, the contractor could or could not pass it along depending on what he felt like doing it?"
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,970.735,981.191,"Well, James against Dravo dealt with several different points, but I think that there, I think that is a distinction essentially that if the contractor could or could not."
1974.74-548,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1029.828,1033.699,"But you didn’t say the legal incidence in King & Boozer was on the purchaser, isn’t it?"
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1033.699,1036.342,I think the legal incidence in the King & Boozer was on the purchaser.
1974.74-548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.724,1103.727,"The instrumentally argument is the same, is it not?"
1974.74-548,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1103.727,1106.606,"The instrumentality argument is the same, exactly."
1974.74-548,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1564.348,1568.828,Very well Mr. Smith.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1569.628,1573.369,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-548,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.617,1688.04,None of the regulation tell it -- doesn’t the regulation tell the distiller to collect a certain markup?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1688.04,1690.854,The regulation tells him of course.
1974.74-548,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.854,1693.608,And he is supposed to do that?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1693.608,1704.796,He is supposed of course to collect a markup so that he will have the funds to pay the state its tax.
1974.74-548,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.419,1718.398,But he’s also supposed to collect it from his purchasers?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1718.398,1721.012,Well he has to invoice it of course.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1749.286,1753.55,"Mr. Wright, did you say that the tax can never be collected from the purchaser?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1757.817,1768.96,"It is an out -- well, when the state itself of course, when it sells to private retailer collects the tax in the form of the purchase price of the liquor."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1768.96,1774.655,"In this situation, suppose the distiller was unable to collect the tax?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1774.655,1801.644,"He pays it first before he pays the tax when he bills the retailer, and it’s a matter of the total indifference to the state whether or not he then is able to receive reimbursement for the tax, but by the nature of things, a tax which takes the form of a wholesale markup, even without any urging."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1829.769,1833.301,"Well if he doesn’t collect it, who is responsible for it?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1833.301,1837.795,"He is responsible for it, whether collects it or not."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1837.795,1840.764,"Well, is there a time sequence here?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1840.764,1842.346,"Yes, there is a time."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1842.346,1845.768,Must he pay it before he delivers the liquor to the purchaser?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1845.768,1852.522,"He pays it at the time that he invoices the liquor, yes."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1855.439,1857.503,He doesn’t wait to collect it from the purchaser --
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1857.503,1857.655,No.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1857.655,1858.695,-- before he pays the state?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1858.695,1860.199,No.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1870.645,1878.56,"So, there’s no way in any event that the tax can be collected by the state, the statute doesn’t provide for collection by the state from the purchaser?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1878.56,1881.289,"No, the tax is not -- this is the whole point."
1974.74-548,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.806,1903.335,So you say that if the state wrote a letter to the purchaser and said “Pay me the tax.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1906.574,1908.262,"Well, certainly."
1974.74-548,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1932.152,1932.94,Mr. Wright?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1932.94,1933.87,Yes?
1974.74-548,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1933.87,1941.311,Could the state solve this problem by requiring that all liquor sold in this city be bought from the Mississippi State stores?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1941.311,1942.24,Yes.
1974.74-548,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1942.24,1943.762,"Well, why they didn’t do it?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1943.762,1953.029,"Well, I suggest that the purpose of the option was for the benefit of the retailers rather than for the state, although the state does benefit to this extent."
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2002.692,2004.97,And the military uses a whole lot of vodka.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2009.797,2011.677,No they don’t Mr. Justice --
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.677,2014.423,I submit the record show they all buy all kinds of whiskey.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2014.423,2016.346,They do buy all kinds.
1974.74-548,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2042.377,2076.882,"Mr. Wright, suppose taking the hypothetical case that Mr. Justice Powell suggested, suppose the state did that and then the response of the United States was that they would load a hundred trucks with all the supplies they needed including replacement shoes and ammunition and peanut butter and what not along with vodka and whiskey and gin, and shipped the whole thing in, do you suggest that Mississippi could stop that shipment and stop liquor from coming into a military base?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2076.882,2079.902,"If they found out about it, there’s no --"
1974.74-548,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2079.902,2080.049,I’m assuming it.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2080.049,2081.424,-- of course it’s quite possible.
1974.74-548,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2112.823,2122.948,"Well, I’m assuming that all the material that I just suggested was used on military bases by military personnel and not distributed outside of the base."
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2126.74,2129.085,If it was brought in for resale.
1974.74-548,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2129.085,2130.767,"No, no for use."
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2130.767,2143.221,"No well if this -- no, the wholesale tax applies only -- this tax only applies to liquor brought -- bought for resale within the state, and this is where the Buck Act is decisive."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2251.751,2256.081,"Well that’s true Mr. Wright I guess 105 -- Section 105, but what about 107?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2256.081,2257.399,Yes.
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.584,2396.567,"Mr. Wright, could you tax the sales of the drinks in the exclusive camps in Mississippi?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2396.567,2397.658,"Tax, I beg your pardon?"
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2397.658,2404.306,On the drinks that are served in the officer’s club on the base which the United States have exclusive jurisdiction?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2404.306,2405.855,"No, I don’t think so."
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2407.388,2412.872,"But if you can tax the whiskey that’s used, aren’t you doing the same thing?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2412.872,2413.568,No.
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.079,2427.66,The sale is not made in Mississippi then?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2427.66,2440.372,"Well, they certainly are, if Your Honor please, they are -- the liquor is invoiced to the bases and is resold on the bases."
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.27,2447.73,Did Buck Act apply to the exclusive jurisdiction bases?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2447.73,2449.274,It certainly does.
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2449.274,2449.305,It does?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2449.305,2450.965,That was its expressed purpose.
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2450.965,2454.793,"Then, why can’t you tax them on that?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2454.793,2455.873,A sale tax?
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.873,2456.724,Yes.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2456.724,2460.454,"Well, I think you probably could, yes."
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2460.454,2460.631,You could?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2460.631,2462.254,If you’re talking about a --
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2462.254,2464.773,You started taxing these sales on camps.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2466.452,2471.403,"Well, let me point out one more aspect in which this regulation --"
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2471.403,2473.794,How are you going on there and collect it?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2473.794,2474.585,It takes --
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2474.585,2476.662,If it’s exclusive jurisdiction?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2476.662,2481.892,The Buck Act also gives authority to the state to go in and collect its sales tax on exclusive jurisdiction bases.
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2481.892,2482.265,"On a camp, into a camp?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2482.265,2486.746,That’s what it says.
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.746,2488.088,I see.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2488.088,2494.993,"That’s -- that was its purpose, was as I say, to wipe out this prior distinction the James case had made in the exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction bases."
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2494.993,2500.171,You’d go into a missile base too?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2500.171,2500.887,I beg your pardon?
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2500.887,2502.796,You’d go in to a missile base too?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2502.796,2503.789,Any kind of [Laughter]
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.789,2507.427,I wouldn’t try.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2507.427,2509.471,I beg your pardon?
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.471,2511.405,I would not even try. [Laughter Attempt]
1974.74-548,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.405,2514.114,Just borrow a tank when you get there.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2514.114,2515.264,[Laughter Attempt]
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2515.264,2517.488,I think you get hit for that. [Laughter Attempt]
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2517.488,2539.162,"Well, I suppose the military could bar anyone from a base they please, but the purpose of the Buck Act is made quite clear in the Senate report that and it was to treat all federal enclaves whether they’re exclusive or concurrent enclaves alike."
1974.74-548,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2550.024,2555.353,I don’t see how you reconcile that with the express language of Section 107 (a) Mr. Wright?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2555.353,2556.775,Yes.
1974.74-548,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2577.76,2583.835,"Well, that’s quite a bit of -- that covers quite a bit of area that constitutional exception?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2583.835,2602.688,"Well, a constitutional amendment -- going -- sales to the United States, taxes on sales to the United States haven’t been regarded by this tax -- this Court as taxes on the purchasers since the Panhandle Oil case."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2642.938,2644.639,"So how expressly it is, did it?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2644.639,2644.955,"Yes, it was."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2644.955,2646.657,King & Boozer as I recall it said that whatever --
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2646.657,2672.486,"Explicitly repudiated Panhandle Oil, so this -- there is no -- there are no constitutional tax immunity decisions of this Court which say that a tax on sales to the United States and one of its instrumentalities are taxes on the United States."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2673.802,2678.006,"Of course, Panhandle was a gasoline excise tax --"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2678.006,2678.434,Yes.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.434,2679.866,-- on the seller.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2688.066,2690.385,They bought it directly -- court held it was.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2690.385,2699.495,"But you don’t doubt that instead of being a tax on the vendor, had it been a tax on the United States directly on its purchases --"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2699.495,2699.925,Had it been --
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2699.925,2701.589,"You’d have no problem with that, would you?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2701.589,2706.104,"Had it been laid on the retailer, it probably would’ve been invalid."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2706.972,2707.818,Probably?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2707.818,2708.277,What?
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2708.277,2711.073,Probably if the United States were the purchaser under the --
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2711.073,2718.003,"If the tax were laid on the privilege of retailing, now Mississippi has a liquor tax on the privilege of retailing."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2718.003,2724.988,"No, but what would be the case had the Panhandle tax, instead of being imposed on the vendor, but imposed on the vendee, the United States?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2724.988,2733.015,"It would’ve been precisely the same, because in that case, the court held, if you’re talking about what that court would’ve done."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2733.015,2735.248,"No, I’m not talking about what that court would’ve done."
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2740.825,2743.289,"Well, you have the answer in the James case."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2748.494,2750.828,I guess I’m not making myself clear Mr. Wright.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2750.828,2751.366,"Well, I’m sorry."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2751.366,2755.504,Old cases are cases where the incidence of the tax was on the vendor.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2755.504,2755.907,Right.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2755.907,2761.962,I’m talking about the effort to impose a tax directly upon the United States as a purchaser.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2761.962,2763.861,"Yes, that would be invalid."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2763.861,2764.486,That’s right.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2764.486,2767.428,That would come within the Buck Act exemption.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2767.577,2769.156,"That’s 107, isn’t it?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2769.156,2770.547,"Yes, that’s 107."
1974.74-548,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2770.547,2781.328,"Then, how do you reconcile that with your answer to Mr. Justice Marshall when you said that they couldn’t levy a tax on the sales made in the officer’s club?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2781.328,2790.129,"Well, the sales made in the officer’s club are not of issue here, because we do have a regulation which exempts the military clubs."
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2854.867,2860.158,"I see you say at the military clubs, if I go in as an officer to purchase a drink?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2860.158,2861.346,Yes.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2861.346,2864.956,Ordinarily in most bars it's a 5% sales tax?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2864.956,2865.291,Right.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2865.291,2869.898,"But as an exemption for purchases, I make at the bar of a military --"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2869.898,2870.128,Correct.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2870.128,2870.884,Is that right?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2870.884,2870.954,Yes.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2870.954,2875.661,"And then you say there’s also an exemption, you said a retail exemption of what kind?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2875.661,2879.226,"Yes, Mississippi has a retailer’s tax --"
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2879.226,2880.207,A gallonage tax?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2880.207,2881.022,Its gallonage tax.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2881.022,2882.361,That’s an excise tax?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2882.361,2885.707,It’s an excise tax on the privilege of selling liquor at retail.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2885.707,2888.076,"And there’s an exemption for that, is that it?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2888.076,2888.711,Yes.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2888.711,2891.98,And the only one they do collect is this one?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2891.98,2892.582,Yes.
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2892.582,2893.039,I see.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2893.039,2896.709,There’s a $2.50 a gallon tax on --
1974.74-548,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2896.709,2903.257,"So if I’m in uniform, I could still get a cheaper drink at an officer’s club than I can at any other bar in Mississippi?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2903.257,2919.82,The record is clear that the exemptions and the regulation permitted the clubs both to buy liquor cheaper than any civilian retailer in Mississippi could buy it and to sell it cheaper and to still make profits.
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2933.044,2934.91,You want 2 million more?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2934.91,2935.351,I beg your pardon?
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2935.351,2941.543,"You just want 2 million more, $2 million more?"
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2941.543,2948.807,"No, we -- we have the -- collected this from the distillers."
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2969.742,2972.741,So whichever way it goes the drinker pays it?
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2972.741,2974.32,Right.
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2975.083,2976.307,As he should.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2976.307,2979.34,That much is clear with respect to any --
1974.74-548,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2979.34,2981.994,I’m sure he’s restricted to that with whiskey.
1974.74-548,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2981.994,2984.267,Any excise tax.
1974.74-548,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3274.71,3276.858,Do you have anything further Mr. Smith?
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3276.858,3277.681,Just have a --
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3277.681,3279.091,May I just ask Mr. Smith?
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3279.091,3279.881,Sure.
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3279.881,3288.64,"I’m clear am I not that if the Government is wrong and the legal incidence of this tax is on the wholesalers, you lose?"
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3288.64,3289.711,"No, not necessarily."
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3299.216,3300.38,Yes.
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3300.38,3317.415,"Essentially, what its -- point of it is, is that if the legal incidence of the tax is on the wholesaler, assuming arguendo, then you have a situation where the wholesaler is told by the State of Mississippi “If you sell to us the state, you don’t have to pay any tax."
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3332.771,3335.293,"Now, that issue of course wasn’t addressed below because --"
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3335.293,3337.081,"Well, that issue was addressed below Mr. Chief --"
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3337.081,3338.181,By the court?
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3338.181,3342.989,"Mr. Justice Brennan, it was not discreetly briefed in the way that I’ve --"
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3342.989,3343.045,"No, no."
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3345.675,3346.407,"Yes, it was."
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3346.407,3346.903,I see.
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3346.903,3351.392,Look at page 36 (a) --
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3351.392,3352.984,Of what?
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3352.984,3356.967,"Of the District Court opinion, he says here at the end --"
1974.74-548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3356.967,3357.297,"Oh, I see."
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3357.297,3361.488,“There being no discrimination against the federal government within the state’s tax scheme.”
1974.74-548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.231,3369.335,"And also you separately argue that it would violate the federal policy, isn’t it?"
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3369.335,3371.268,"Yes, yes absolutely."
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3427.948,3432.706,"Now, what you could say for example, if you want to truck it in from Texas, this says you can't?"
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3432.706,3433.774,You can’t do it.
1974.74-548,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.774,3439.509,You think that’s -- you think that argument goes before the concurrent jurisdictional bases?
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3439.509,3440.958,"Sure, sure."
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3440.958,3442.625,Despite the Twenty-first Amendment?
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3442.625,3453.23,"Well, you know, I would simply suggest that you know, that this is really almost a concomitant of the doctrine that the federal government is immune from state taxation."
1974.74-548,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3462.28,3464.901,But doesn’t the Twenty-first Amendment have relevance to it?
1974.74-548,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3464.901,3467.204,I would suggest the Twenty-first Amendment has some relevance.
1974.74-548,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3497.626,3498.217,Thank you gentlemen.
