1989.88-1182,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.079,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-1182, Baltimore City Department of Social Services v. Jacqueline Bouknight."
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,14.352,26.529,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1182,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,112.193,114.556,Why was that done?
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,118.568,122.722,"It certainly has absolutely the same tragic facts, Your Honor."
1989.88-1182,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,122.722,124.932,Can you defend that action?
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,124.932,129.747,I think... certainly with benefit of hindsight it was a great error to return the child.
1989.88-1182,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,135.802,137.07,Why do we need hindsight?
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,138.452,143.355,"Well, I would have to respectfully answer no, it wasn't apparent."
1989.88-1182,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,229.942,230.771,Where is she now?
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,230.771,233.272,"She is in the jail in Baltimore City, Your Honor."
1989.88-1182,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.272,244.802,"Mr. Tyler, does... would the act of production of the child be a testimonial statement of some kind?"
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,244.802,246.351,"Not in our view, Your Honor."
1989.88-1182,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.112,264.073,"Well, in cases where orders have been entered to require turning over some kind of paper, this Court has indicated in its opinions that to do so has testimonial aspects."
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,275.322,289.18,"--Because, Justice O'Connor, in the cases where the Court has said that there would be testimonial content to an act of production, the identified variables have been existence, possession, authentication."
1989.88-1182,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.606,302.47,"Well, is that strictly speaking true?"
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,321.481,325.484,"It is, of course, true that we do not know where the child is."
1989.88-1182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.669,332.909,Physical custody?
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,332.909,335.86,She... she certainly had physical custody.
1989.88-1182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,341.214,349.76,"Well, but the custody... she has not conceded... correct me if I'm wrong, perhaps she has... that she now has physical custody of the child."
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,358.166,370.782,"--Well, what she... what she did concede, Justice Kennedy, at the hearings in the juvenile court in April of '88 is, first, her counsel on her behalf represented that the child was fine and that there was no basis for concern."
1989.88-1182,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.416,409.288,"Well, certainly there may not be any question about her legal custody."
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,419.335,421.065,--Well--
1989.88-1182,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.065,423.339,I just don't understand why it wouldn't be.
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,423.339,433.414,"--Well, it wouldn't be in our view, Justice O'Connor, because this is the only living parent of a child who at the time the case was in the juvenile court was 19 months old."
1989.88-1182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,444.651,446.694,"Well, that may be an argument for an exception."
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,455.309,470.878,"--Your Honor, the status of immunity under Maryland law has changed dramatically while this case has been pending and as of April... as of July of '89 there is a broader immunity statute in Maryland."
1989.88-1182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.509,477.533,"Well, wouldn't use immunity suffice for your concerns and the concerns of... of others in this very important case?"
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,481.546,487.881,"--Well, our objection, Your Honor, is that she has asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege which we claim does not exist."
1989.88-1182,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,499.918,511.756,"Well, if we thought she did, is Maryland now in a position to grant limited use immunity for the testimonial aspects of the compliance with the production order?"
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,511.756,512.157,Yes.
1989.88-1182,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,521.852,531.95,"And the state could make it a laser-like limited immunity so that just the testimonial aspects of production could be protected, I gather."
1989.88-1182,0,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,531.95,533.078,--Yes.
1989.88-1182,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,712.868,714.529,"Thank you, Mr. Tyler."
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,715.69,723.876,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1182,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,778.873,785.806,"Well, why is that so if limited use immunity is available for just the act of production?"
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,785.806,794.231,"Your Honor, limited use immunity is available only upon the consent or the request of the state's attorney."
1989.88-1182,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,877.317,880.359,"Mr. Mirviss, straighten me out on one thing."
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,887.315,895.83,"Justice Blackmun, the mother, through her counsel, informed the court that the child would be produced and that the mother was on her way."
1989.88-1182,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,900.934,902.456,But counsel gave that assurance?
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,902.456,903.204,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1182,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,903.204,904.326,Her counsel?
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,904.326,905.287,Her counsel.
1989.88-1182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,935.645,948.966,Is that... is that the way it usually works or does the social welfare worker simply have the authority to go out and investigate the home and take the child?
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,953.297,970.898,"Ordinarily, and in Maryland, the statute governing child protective services investigations has a probable cause requirement written into it such that a social worker with a police officer can go into a home when there is probable cause to believe that a child is in danger."
1989.88-1182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,970.898,974.962,"--There's a... as I say, it would be an exigent circumstances so no warrant is required?"
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,974.962,975.933,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,976.745,978.574,Isn't this the way it usually happens?
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,978.574,981.366,--That is the ordinary course in emergencies.
1989.88-1182,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1033.31,1037.503,"Mr. Mirviss, it seems to me the record is silent about a father."
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1040.195,1050.013,"Your Honor, my client's father was killed approximately a year and a half ago to two years ago... I believe in March of 1988... in a drug-related shooting incident."
1989.88-1182,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1050.013,1052.154,Were they married?
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1053.875,1054.976,"No, Your Honor, they were not married."
1989.88-1182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1054.976,1070.935,"But just to conclude the point, you're saying that there are scores, hundreds, many cases in which courts today routinely issue subpoenas to parents requiring the parents to come to the court with the child?"
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1070.935,1072.016,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.662,1083.413,"Well, but I mean, does it now exercise that power on a wide scale?"
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1083.413,1094.52,"--Not on that scale, but that power is the authority underlying social worker access to children and into parents' homes."
1989.88-1182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1125.963,1137.19,"Well, I take it then that in most cases the only testimonial implications of producing the child are something that's known already through independent evidence that the child was living at the house and that the child has injuries."
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1152.429,1161.005,"--Your Honor, the testimonial inferences that could be drawn from the production of this child are slight, just as they would be in that situation."
1989.88-1182,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.429,1220.197,"Mr. Byers... I mean, Mr. Mirviss, are you going to address the California v. Byers aspect of the case?"
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1220.197,1220.806,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1182,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1315.707,1332.6,"Well, it's a little different, isn't it, because here the operation of the contempt order is particularly individualized and based on specific showings that also lead to criminal prosecution probably."
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1336.772,1337.633,--Your Honor--
1989.88-1182,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1337.633,1339.573,Much more individualized.
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1339.573,1346.579,"--Your Honor, Byers focused on the general risk or the general degree of incrimination."
1989.88-1182,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1372.806,1377.888,"Well, but in Byers you have a system whereby everybody involved in an accident has to file a report."
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1377.888,1379.4,--That's correct.
1989.88-1182,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1379.4,1398.051,Here it's only the person whose conduct is such to give rise to concern for the physical safety of the child that would lead to the imposition of a contempt order that would give rise to your suggested Byers exception.
1989.88-1182,1,36372,mitchell_y_mirviss,,1398.051,1408.249,"Your Honor, the concerns that could prompt this juvenile court to exercise its statutory authority are not limited to instances of extreme abuse."
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1607.968,1610.3,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1182,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1637.191,1638.29,"Well, stop--"
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1639.612,1653.009,"--Well, if, for example, the child is injured, if the child were unfortunately dead, then admitting that you had custody of that is certainly a reasonable conclusion that you're responsible for the injuries or the death of the child."
1989.88-1182,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1674.384,1675.295,I don't follow that.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1694.015,1696.987,"--I... I'm not sure I follow, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-1182,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1769.325,1776.201,"Well, but our cases say, you know, that the court can't inquire in any detail once the claim of privilege is invoke."
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1779.123,1781.684,"--I think that's to some extent, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1182,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.314,1816.877,--Why can't you raise the same privilege when you're ordered to bring it in under that statute?
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1816.877,1824.391,"--Because under... no, you wouldn't be ordering him to bring it under that statute, your Honor, you would be prosecuting him for the failure to bring it in."
1989.88-1182,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.535,1847.736,But it would be by a criminal prosecution rather than by a juvenile proceeding?
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1847.736,1850.099,"Well, it... it... it's a funny statute."
1989.88-1182,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1853.141,1862.225,"Yeah, you put them in jail under the neglect statute but you can't put them in jail for refusal to produce."
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1862.225,1866.158,"Well, I think the key difference... as a practical matter I have to agree with that, Justice White."
1989.88-1182,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.608,1881.419,Putting her in jail.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1881.419,1884.441,"But when we're talking about civil contempt, however, we're looking at two problems."
1989.88-1182,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.736,1895.487,Like for a--
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1895.487,1896.078,--which I think gives the distinction.
1989.88-1182,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.078,1897.808,--Like for a neglect prosecution.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1897.808,1900.271,"No, Your... no, Justice White."
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.486,1907.856,"Mr. Burns, let's talk about homicide."
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1934.684,1935.585,"Well, Justice--"
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.585,1937.025,And the court cannot compel the husband to--
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1937.025,1947.433,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think as this case shows, that the court being able to say bring it in three days and these cases, if they are determined, is not going to have any effect, if indeed... if indeed everything--"
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.433,1947.821,--That's not going to have an effect?
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1947.821,1949.323,"--Well, Your Honor, with--"
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.323,1952.095,We say you're going to stay in jail until you produce the child.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1952.095,1953.156,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the same thing."
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.166,1969.847,I'm not worried about neglect.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1972.127,1972.879,"--That's certainly true, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.879,1974.649,And prosecuting him for murder if the child dies.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,1974.649,1975.72,"Certainly true, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.995,2002.759,I suppose for the same reason that we don't torture people after they've been convicted of murder.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,2002.759,2005.521,"Well, Your Honor, I agree we shouldn't."
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.893,2007.12,"Well, no."
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,2028.915,2029.395,--And I agree.
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2029.395,2029.816,--a crime.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,2030.816,2031.377,"Well, Justice--"
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.377,2036.619,--whether you can use normal means of punishment to... to fulfill an important societal end such as--
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,2036.619,2036.91,"--Sure, Justice--"
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.91,2037.531,--saving the life of the child.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,2037.531,2037.981,--Scalia.
1989.88-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.702,2058.583,There is no child abuse statute in existence.
1989.88-1182,2,24919,george_e_burns_jr,,2059.485,2061.556,"You mean as a hypothetical, I assume."
1989.88-1182,3,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,3155.534,3179.58,"Without any doubt, the interests in this case are the most fundamental and important interests that the state has to protect and that we as a people have to protect, and none of the arguments advanced today or in the brief or in the opinion of the Court of Appeals of Maryland meet either half of this case."
1989.88-1182,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3212.901,3220.175,"Mr. Tyler, do you agree... I thought the question presented was whether the order directing a parent to produce a child and so forth violated the Fifth Amendment."
1989.88-1182,3,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,3226.57,3231.473,"Well, I think the sequence, your Honor... really the one followed the other quite quickly."
1989.88-1182,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3232.004,3233.684,"Yeah, I know, but they are legally distinct."
1989.88-1182,3,40603,ralph_s_tyler_iii,,3233.684,3235.236,--I'm not disputing that.
1989.88-1182,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.581,3259.85,"So you agree the issue is the validity of the contempt order, not the order to produce."
