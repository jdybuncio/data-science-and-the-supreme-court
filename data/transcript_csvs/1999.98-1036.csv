1999.98-1036,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.288,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-1036, Illinois v. William Wardlow."
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,11.6,20.412,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,53.09,58.784,"When you said he had reasonable cause to believe there was a problem, you mean that he had reason to believe that crime was afoot."
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,59.61,60.536,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1036,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,67.329,69.081,What crime?
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,69.081,81.53,"Throughout the history of this country, flight has been considered by the courts and by commentators as inherently suspicious."
1999.98-1036,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,81.53,82.19,Of what?
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,82.19,88.96,"It is not...  it is not required, Your Honor, that the officer have reasonable suspicion of a particular crime."
1999.98-1036,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,111.296,114.39,Does he have to have some rough idea of what kind of crime?
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,117.073,118.642,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1036,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.825,119.097,What was it?
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,119.097,149.728,"it is our submission that if the officer has reasonable suspicion that there may be some type of criminal activity...  and flight has historically been related to criminal activity, as Mr. Burrill noted in his commentary back in the 1860's, that flight for a burglar, an arsonist, a robber is common, and that in fact if someone committed one of these acts, that it is so natural to flee that if an individual did not, he would be considered mentally deficient."
1999.98-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.728,161.904,"I suppose if a policeman sees somebody with a smoking rifle, he wouldn't exactly know what precise crime was...  was probable or possible either."
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,167.766,169.252,"You would not, Your Honor."
1999.98-1036,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.564,190.39,Mr....
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,197.737,205.334,"Mr. Chief Justice, we are proposing that a rule be adopted that is not limited to high crime areas."
1999.98-1036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.966,231.506,"Well, you want some per se rule, it sounds like, rather than what we have normally done on a Terry stop, which is inquire whether there is reasonable suspicion based on the totality of the circumstances."
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,233.548,234.934,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1036,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.961,256.815,"But in...  in...  in this case, there may well be special circumstances that would enter the mix."
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,285.832,287.03,"Well, no, Your Honor, there are three..."
1999.98-1036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,287.03,287.318,there.
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,287.318,297.349,"There are three factors that we propose be part of the rule: one, the flight; second, that it's from a clearly identifiable police officer; and thirdly, that it's without provocation"
1999.98-1036,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,308.949,309.199,Mr....
1999.98-1036,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,309.199,319.313,"Would be the same rule if, say, the...  the person who's stopped was wearing jogging shoes and sweat pants and a sweatshirt and carrying a basketball?"
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,319.313,334.462,"Your Honor, it would fit in, in that the reasonable police officer, the standard that the Court uses, would have to conclude that the flight was in response to his presence and without provocation."
1999.98-1036,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,342.347,346.517,"What...  what if he had seen him running, then he stopped for a while, then he saw the police officer, and he started running again?"
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,348.913,349.86,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1036,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.054,356.259,No.
1999.98-1036,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,356.259,356.63,He stops.
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,360.057,367.943,"I would say that that's ambiguous behavior that would fall within the totality of circumstances rather than within the rule we're proposing, Your Honor."
1999.98-1036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,367.943,372.317,"Mr. Devine, the...  let me tell you the difficulty that I have with your proposal."
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,462.142,476.798,"Well, Your Honor, I would again note that flight, going back to the time of the Framers, has been considered suspicious behavior, but looking at the balancing this Court does in analyzing the reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, we look at the governmental interest."
1999.98-1036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,492.235,499.461,"Yes, but he may have the ability to note a number of other facts besides the one that you mentioned, and some of them have come up on the bench here."
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,534.195,544.952,"Your Honor, I...  I would submit an alternative thought, namely that...  that flight is such inherently aberrant behavior that it does create the reasonable suspicion..."
1999.98-1036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,544.952,552.96,"Yes, but we don't have a rule that says anytime anyone flees from the police, there is...  there is sufficient suspicion for a Terry stop."
1999.98-1036,0,39050,richard_a_devine,,558.699,565.591,"Well, this Court has commented that when an individual flees from the police, common sense might tell us..."
1999.98-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.591,566.872,"Oh, it's darned good evidence."
1999.98-1036,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,566.872,567.532,No question.
1999.98-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.65,573.643,"Well, not yet we haven't."
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1211.094,1219.723,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1253.531,1254.357,"Well, Mr. Stewart..."
1999.98-1036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1254.357,1254.557,What do you do...
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1268.02,1271.735,I think we...  we believe you should look at the totality of the circumstances.
1999.98-1036,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1302.822,1311.654,Are you saying that there's...  is there a right of an individual to go their own way even though there's a police officer known to be on the scene?
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1315.946,1323.914,"I think there...  there is a...  there is no right to avoid police observation or police contact, that is the Court...  in public areas."
1999.98-1036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1365.813,1373.698,But there...  what do you make of the slippery slope argument that...  that takes the...  the situation one step further?
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1413.55,1414.088,No.
1999.98-1036,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1425.893,1427.379,Let's assume the language is extreme.
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1427.379,1428.205,Okay.
1999.98-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1480.795,1488.225,"If you're going to frisk the person, doesn't the policeman have to have at least some notion of what kind of a crime this person might have committed."
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1506.224,1516.544,"Well, I think the ground for frisking him is, first, the belief that he may be...  the ground for frisking him is to protect the officer's safety while the stop is taking place."
1999.98-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.544,1519.683,You disagree with Justice Harlan's articulation of the standard.
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1519.683,1531.943,"Well, I think what Justice Harlan was saying...  I don't know that Justice Harlan had in mind the situation in which police had an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity but no particular crime in mind."
1999.98-1036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1531.943,1534.665,"Well, that...  that was not the view of the majority in Terry."
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1536.977,1537.349,That...  that's correct.
1999.98-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.667,1590.687,"Your...  your brief mentioned the fact it was a high crime area, and that seems to have dropped out of your argument really."
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1599.354,1606.784,If the...  if the police see somebody running in the elegant neighborhood and the running appears to have been prompted by...  by their...
1999.98-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1606.784,1607.322,It's prompted by the police.
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1607.322,1611.986,"Yes, I think that would be suspicious, and we would say it is sufficient to justify a Terry stop."
1999.98-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1611.986,1613.472,I would think it would be more suspicious.
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1625.982,1629.447,Typically...  you could make the argument either way.
1999.98-1036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1635.641,1640.759,"Well, Adams against Williams certainly refers to a high crime neighborhood."
1999.98-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.759,1641.147,Doesn't it?
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1641.147,1641.314,That's correct.
1999.98-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.679,1667.592,"There could...  there could be a lot of elses, though, besides mere provocation, couldn't there?"
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1709.285,1723.199,"I think certainly if the individual could establish that within a particular community it had become the norm for people to flee from the sight of an apparent police officer for whatever reason, if that had become typical behavior within the community..."
1999.98-1036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.199,1732.404,"Well, Mr. Stewart, you know, we don't have a lot of empirical testimony in these cases as to whether something had become the norm in a community."
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1736.119,1755.066,"And I think certainly the general rule would be absent...  we would think that the norm in most and perhaps all communities is the innocent people don't typically flee upon the arrival of the police, but we would say if an extraordinary case arose in which a person could actually establish that this had become accepted, typical behavior..."
1999.98-1036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.066,1757.871,"Well, doesn't that bring it back to the general Terry test again?"
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1766.045,1766.75,I think that's correct.
1999.98-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.927,1791.846,"And the test is not whether the individual was reasonable in fly...  in fleeing, but whether the policeman should have realized that the...  that the fleeing does not necessarily connote guilt."
1999.98-1036,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1791.846,1792.468,That's correct.
1999.98-1036,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1815.335,1816.904,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,1818.102,1823.98,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.003,1873.914,"Well, that goes too far."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,1888.774,1889.433,Well...
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.433,1896.964,"to prevent the police from catching up with him, in such manner as to...  as to prevent the police from catching up with him."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,1896.964,1904.954,"That calls into question then or calls into certainly consideration the notion of what is flight, and that is as descriptive term as applied by the police."
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.954,1905.409,Sure.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,1905.409,1910.034,"If my client was elderly, saw the police and turned on his walker to go away, that might be slow flight."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.377,1916.078,That's where the totality of the circumstances comes in.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,1925.266,1926.297,"Well, I would agree."
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.384,1944.957,"Well, but you know, I...  certainly there was an argument that this sort of panicked flight is enough."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,1946.747,1954.904,The officer should have to say or articulate what is it about the flight that caused him to focus on this particular person at that time.
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.793,1965.39,"Well, but you know, you're saying more should be required, but there's certainly an argument on the other side that a panicked flight is enough."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,1965.39,1971.334,There is an argument on the other side that panicked flight is enough in a case-by-case basis.
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.057,1991.601,"Well, but I...  I think the argument developed on...  on the petitioner's case is that they think these circumstances generally come within a Terry stop rule, not that every single time you have a flight, as Justice Scalia's questions indicate, you're...  you're going to have a basis for a Terry stop."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,1991.601,1999.486,"On every...  every time somebody flees then from the police without provocation, if I understand the question."
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.486,2000.767,Yes.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2000.767,2010.094,"And...  and I would say that it sounds like or smacks of a per se test, that every time somebody seeks to avoid the police at any rate or any speed and it calls..."
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2010.094,2012.406,"Well, no, it's not at any rate or any speed."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2016.493,2040.93,"Well, if I can apply it to this case, and Justice Souter's comment, in this particular neighborhood...  though we would disagree it is a high crime area, the Illinois Supreme Court said it was on a de novo review...  but it would make perfect sense for...  if you see four police cars and eight police officers converging on a scene at one time, that one person might duck behind a car."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.786,2075.293,I'm not really sympathetic to...  to those who...  who run away because they don't want to be called as a witness.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2081.591,2091.623,"No, I don't, Your Honor, but...  and I don't know that you would be sympathetic either to those who don't want to be subject to misidentification or harassment, those who don't want to be intimidated in the area."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.796,2101.299,There may indeed.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2117.546,2123.285,"Well, then there should be, as I understand Terry, some articulable basis for stopping that person who's left."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.907,2129.024,You really don't think it's an articulable basis that a police officer is patrolling a beat.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2139.26,2141.489,That may arouse suspicion in context.
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.763,2144.051,Fine.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2144.051,2145.165,Flight in and of itself...
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.165,2145.331,No.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2152.761,2156.561,I would submit it is suspicious and it's a hunch that something is amiss.
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.561,2157.942,"Right, right."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2157.942,2159.594,But without some articulable suspicion of what...
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2159.594,2160.626,It's unprovoked.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2186.26,2191.629,"Well, time, context, other people on the street."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.743,2202.403,"Oh, it could have worse."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2208.142,2215.368,That there is no context...  there's no articulable basis by the police of what it is that called my attention to him running.
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.608,2221.517,"Well, they didn't just see him running."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2224.86,2228.409,"Well, they saw him running from...  they looked...  my client looked in their direction..."
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.409,2229.318,And then ran.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2229.318,2229.978,and then ran.
1999.98-1036,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2230.722,2233.611,Let me...  let me make sure that I understand your argument.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2265.561,2266.654,"That's correct, Justice Souter."
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2266.654,2267.13,Is...  that's your point.
1999.98-1036,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2267.13,2273.984,"So, whether...  whether they...  whether in fact this was or was not a good Terry stop is not really the issue in this case, as I understand it."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2275.22,2277.178,"And I agree, and I would add that what the..."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.178,2278.443,You are not really.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2315.799,2329.712,"Justice Scalia, what the Illinois Supreme Court said was what was untenable was there were no articulable facts in the record from which they would be willing to tilt in this situation individual's freedoms in favor...  whether it's per se or totality, in favor of the State."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.712,2338.379,"Which means that they are unwilling to consider flight from a police officer suspicious, and that's really what all of this debate is about."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2338.379,2339.122,It's my...
1999.98-1036,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2339.122,2341.312,"I thought, Mr. Koch, that that was your point."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2375.242,2375.697,No.
1999.98-1036,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2386.305,2388.988,You mentioned scream and running from a store.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2391.506,2394.811,There may be a call in the neighborhood that they're responding to.
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.873,2429.651,"Mr....  Mr. Koch, the question presented, whether a person's sudden and unprovoked flight from a clearly identifiable police officer, who is patrolling a high crime...  is sufficiently suspicious to justify a temporary investigating stop under Terry."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2437.369,2437.741,No.
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2437.741,2454.709,"So, I understood your answer to Justice Souter's question was that your position was that really the Supreme Court of Illinois could have been wrong in this case, but that the Supreme Court of Illinois could have decided this case otherwise."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2465.854,2469.819,That to give discretion to the Illinois Supreme Court decision in review?
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2469.819,2479.229,"Well, as I understood your answer to Justice Souter's question, it was that you're not saying that the Supreme Court of Illinois couldn't have come out the other way in this case."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2484.308,2495.37,"It's my...  our position is that the Illinois Supreme Court correctly said that flight in and of itself will never be enough absent corroborating circumstances, and they will not adopt a per se test..."
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.37,2500.655,And it would have been wrong in the...  your position is that the Supreme Court of Illinois would have been wrong to come out otherwise.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2500.655,2504.947,"Absent corroborating circumstances or articulable suspicion, that's correct, Justice."
1999.98-1036,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2504.947,2506.971,But that's not what you came up here to argue.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2507.509,2508.457,I came here...
1999.98-1036,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2508.457,2514.773,What you came here to argue is that the per se rule is a wrong reason for reversing the Supreme Court of Illinois.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2515.145,2515.278,That's...
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.278,2515.733,Okay.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2515.733,2516.188,That's correct.
1999.98-1036,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.188,2518.417,May I ask you a question about the facts?
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2546.941,2548.055,"No, I have not, Your Honor."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.026,2572.37,"If you haven't conceded it, you should have objected to the question presented."
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.37,2573.113,You didn't say that.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2583.848,2585.744,That's correct.
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.744,2591.317,"Gee, I didn't really think we were going to get into the facts of this case as to whether, indeed, it was an unprovoked flight."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2593.796,2597.966,There's nothing in the...  in either the Illinois appellate court or the record that says it's provoked or unprovoked.
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.966,2598.166,"Well, that may be."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.166,2599.163,You should have raised that point earlier.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2605.396,2615.76,"Even if it was unprovoked flight, and...  and that's a given, it's unprovoked without corroborating circumstances that his flight was related to some criminal activity."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.335,2649.734,"Mr. Koch, I...  I'm...  I don't think that...  tell me if I'm wrong in this."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2666.658,2667.484,"Yes, it is."
1999.98-1036,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2667.484,2667.651,Unprovoked...
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2667.651,2671.199,Absent corroborating circumstances of some criminal activity...
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2671.199,2671.654,Right.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2671.654,2673.966,"something that...  that colors the flight, the context."
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.966,2674.255,Right.
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2674.255,2674.521,Right.
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2674.521,2683.543,"And the other side, it seems to me, is not arguing that unprovoked flight alone is often enough...  is always enough."
1999.98-1036,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.396,2692.792,That's certainly not my recollection of the three-pronged argument.
1999.98-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.969,2704.531,"Well, I thought they acknowledged that there are other circumstances which would show...  which would show that...  that there was reason for the flight."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2713.43,2721.232,It's my understanding that they're saying that flight from a police officer without provocation is always in every circumstance grounds for a Terry stop.
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2721.232,2726.889,"If you win on that...  if you win on that, what about running away under these circumstances?"
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2741.09,2741.954,And...
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2741.954,2749.468,He's right in front of the storefront which everyone knows is the storefront where on a daily basis they sell narcotics.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2760.242,2769.408,"And I would submit that if Officer Nolan in that situation had testified...  in the record, it does say, Justice Breyer, I went to this area with the four cars..."
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2769.408,2775.064,"It doesn't...  it seems...  maybe it's a little ambiguous, but it seems to say 4035 Roosevelt Avenue."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2775.064,2776.96,That's the...  that's where he sees my client.
1999.98-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2790.047,2793.557,"I know, but what about my...  my hypothetical rather than yours?"
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2793.557,2798.237,"I think in your hypothetical, had that been articulated, that may very well constitute reasonable suspicion."
1999.98-1036,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.081,2815.105,"Would you take the same position if instead of running off, he jumped into his car on the...  it was parked curbside...  and sped away?"
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2815.105,2826.001,I think I would take the same position that we have the right to eschew interactions with the...  with law enforcement or the government.
1999.98-1036,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2864.517,2870.295,"Suppose in the luggage case, in response to the police request, the man takes his luggage and starts to run."
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2870.295,2878.014,"In a...  that may be with other factors, it may be there's some."
1999.98-1036,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2879.378,2879.954,No.
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2882.722,2885.422,I would submit that that is not grounds for a Terry stop.
1999.98-1036,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2890.357,2896.218,"On the grounds that it is more likely than not that he is innocent of any activity, of any criminal activity?"
1999.98-1036,2,31220,james_b_koch,,2896.218,2900.555,On the grounds that the manner in which you exercise your rights shouldn't constitute a violation of it.
1999.98-1036,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2905.961,2907.735,"Thank you, Mr. Koch."
