2006.04-1350,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.476,"We'll hear argument next in No. 04-1350, KSR International versus Teleflex, Incorporated."
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,10.698,13.59,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.04-1350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,41.848,49.154,"May I ask, if that's the position of the PTO, why aren't they proceeding to cancel the patent?"
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,49.154,64.714,"--The case is in litigation at this point, Justice Ginsburg, and in patent litigation district courts are vested with authority and this Court is vested with authority to render a judgment of invalidity under Section 282 of the Patent Act."
2006.04-1350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,64.714,72.498,"But the question is, you say the PTO has recognized that it issued this patent, that it's an invalid issuance."
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,77.561,85.616,"Well, there is the possibility of director-initiated re-examination of patents as certainly an administrative remedy that does exist."
2006.04-1350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.344,204.073,You're talking about in this case.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,204.073,204.384,--Yes.
2006.04-1350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,204.384,207.656,We're talking about what the law should be.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,237.947,253.848,"Your Honor, what the Federal Circuit has done in recent times has been after a certiorari was granted in this case to erect a series of escape devices from what is otherwise a categorical test that must be imposed in all cases."
2006.04-1350,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,286.427,300.888,"But what is the difference between asking whether something is implicit in the, in the prior art and simply asking whether it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art?"
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,300.888,315.856,"The statute and this Court's precedents make the benchmark of patentability skill, what degree of skill is needed to devise subject matter in respect to an objectively defined problem, objective looking at the claim and looking at the prior art?"
2006.04-1350,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,333.02,344.596,"Of course, the reason that the Federal Circuit has devised this additional test or gloss on Graham is that they say obviousness is, it's deceptive in hindsight."
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,357.995,364.59,"Well, the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, the Court needs to be very clear what is meant by the term ""hindsight""."
2006.04-1350,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,446.723,450.666,"I can understand, I think, what a teaching is."
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,462.823,463.482,Winslow.
2006.04-1350,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.482,464.153,--Winslow.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,496.925,503.149,"Well, the best I think anybody could do would be to look at the opinion in this case and try to figure that out."
2006.04-1350,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.149,503.99,I tried.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,538.613,555.274,"Well, in this case what the respondents is Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation to look to the Asano-designed pedal because he was trying to meet the requirements of Fort Motor Company and Asano would not have met those requirements and therefore Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation to start with Asano."
2006.04-1350,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,555.274,556.234,Say that again?
2006.04-1350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,570.856,572.967,You disagree with the motivation test.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,572.967,573.438,Yes.
2006.04-1350,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,573.438,574.336,So perhaps you're not the--
2006.04-1350,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,574.336,575.388,Right person to ask.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,575.668,578.199,I respectfully suggest--
2006.04-1350,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,578.199,582.483,You don't have a motive to answer that question right away.
2006.04-1350,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,582.483,583.782,"Fine, that's fine."
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,583.782,604.336,"--I believe if you study carefully this Court's precedence, including Graham itself and just about every other case this Court has ever decided, what this Court has said is the measure, what our society agreed to pay off on is subject matter that reflects a certain degree of skill."
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.495,630.482,"Well, would it be, would it be inadvisable for us to say the motive test teaches us something important; it has a valuable place; it's just not the exclusive test for what's obvious."
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,630.482,631.874,Certainly.
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,631.874,635.177,Or do we have to reject it all out of... out of hand?
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,635.177,639.519,The... the presence or absence of motivation to devise something.
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,639.519,641.541,Motivation in this special sense.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,641.541,644.812,"Well, I'm not sure it is in a special sense."
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,668.888,676.634,"But, but, but my question is does it not serve to show us at least one way in which there can be obviousness?"
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,676.634,680.237,--I would agree that if there is--
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,680.237,681.818,It may not be the exclusive test.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,684.289,696.487,"--Well, the test, I mean in this case, the specific claim at issue in this case is very analogous to the claim that this Court considered in the Anderson's-Black Rock case."
2006.04-1350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.2,778.712,How does... how does motivation enter into that analysis in that case?
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,787.708,792.513,"Well, if the patentee in that case--"
2006.04-1350,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.513,795.285,"--He had no particular motivation to use that earlier patent, did he?"
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,795.285,798.237,"--Well, actually in that case there actually was quite a story."
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,827.796,828.326,No.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,837.762,858.846,"--Well, the, on this record, and even if you take at face value what's said in the respondent's brief in this case, which is very largely not based on the record, the story is, from Mr. Engelgau is, Ford Motor Company had a particular requirement and Mr. Engelgau sat down to design to it."
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,880.031,882.723,"Do you, do you concede... do you concede that claims 1 through 3 are valid?"
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,882.723,883.895,--We take no position on that.
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.585,888.055,If I had asked your opinion as an expert would you...--
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,888.646,897.081,"Well, Your Honor, with respect, I would have no opinion on that question."
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,899.793,910.231,"Well, I mean it seems to me that the whole argument that you're making as to Ford is that anybody knows you could, you use an electronic... you have an electronic throttle, it serves a purpose; the pedal serves a purpose; put the two together."
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,910.231,910.95,Here's the--
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,910.95,912.893,"Why doesn't... don't 1, 2 and 3 do the same thing?"
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,912.893,914.285,"--Well, because... because--"
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,914.285,918.517,If they're invalid then I have... then I'm struggling to find what your test is.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,918.517,919.278,--Here's the reason.
2006.04-1350,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,919.278,920.137,I don't know what your test is.
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,920.137,921.208,Here's the reason.
2006.04-1350,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.175,999.418,"Going back to the asphalt case, were you suggesting that if they had made a claim for a process patent, that it might have been valid?"
2006.04-1350,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,999.418,1000.83,Conceivably.
2006.04-1350,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1004.734,1005.955,"Thank you, Mr. Dabney."
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1013.83,1020.705,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.04-1350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1043.819,1047.553,What do you understand motivation to refer to in that test?
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1047.553,1049.135,"Well, it's not entirely clear, Your Honor."
2006.04-1350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1073.501,1086.349,"Do you agree that in that context it would serve a valid purpose, i.e., can we... that is to say, can we keep the motivation test and then supplement it with other, with other means of, other ways of showing obviousness?"
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1086.349,1086.94,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.04-1350,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1144.94,1157.877,"What do you make of the, sort of the revolution argument that whether it's contrary or intention with, in fact the, it's been applied in what is now the Fed Circuit for what, 20 years, more than 20 years I guess."
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1163.87,1164.792,"Well, several things, Your Honor."
2006.04-1350,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1180.033,1187.186,"Well, I realize there's been comment on it, but guess I'm... I'm raising the question that comes up in the old motto."
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1193.881,1194.502,"No, Your Honor."
2006.04-1350,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1221.39,1225.761,"No, but... if we see it your way, are there going to be 100,000 cases filed tomorrow morning?"
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1225.761,1227.483,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2006.04-1350,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1249.547,1253.089,"Mr. Hungar, this is the problem that I have with your test."
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1264.106,1264.837,--Correct.
2006.04-1350,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1264.837,1276.057,"And what I understand your brief to say is that it has to be supplemented with what you have called, you've labelled ""sufficiently innovative""."
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1290.626,1298.651,"Your Honor, I think the ""sufficiently innovative"" is more of a description rather than a test; it's a description of what this Court said in Graham."
2006.04-1350,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.319,1349.524,"Mr. Hungar, I have a question that's sort of along the lines of Justice Ginsburg's."
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1383.996,1410.282,"Your Honor, I think that it would make sense because the statute requires it, and as a practical matter it shouldn't make any difference, because the only category of cases in which the result would change under our test is the category in which as a matter of law, in light of the factual issues that are required under Graham, as a matter of law the Court concludes that the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is so trivial that it cannot be given the protection of a patent."
2006.04-1350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1484.785,1493.401,"Well when you talk about the statutory focus, your innovation test... I mean, do you regard that, is that a legal conclusion of nonobviousness?"
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1498.022,1500.723,"We haven't suggested an innovation test, Your Honor."
2006.04-1350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1549.406,1552.889,"In this case, would there have been anything for a jury under your test?"
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1552.889,1568.398,"No, Your Honor, because in this case it is perfectly clear that it would have been obvious for a person of ordinary skill to take the Asano patent, add the sensor, the electronic sensor in a manner that that off-the-shelf sensor is designed to be added, and voila, you have a winning combination."
2006.04-1350,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1568.398,1569.57,"What about claims 1, 2 and 3?"
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1569.57,1570.722,"I don't know, Your Honor."
2006.04-1350,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1588.283,1588.664,What about the experts?
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1605.093,1605.834,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.04-1350,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.801,1619.884,"Well these, these were declarants who gave a whole declaration."
2006.04-1350,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1622.826,1625.299,"--But again, it's a legal question."
2006.04-1350,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1641.587,1642.629,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1645.871,1648.653,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.776,1667.124,You're right about that.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1667.124,1667.685,--without--
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1769.862,1772.503,"Well, if that's all it means, why don't they say it?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1772.503,1773.625,--They do say that.
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1773.625,1777.127,"Well, then what is this word that confused me a lot, motivation?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1800.383,1801.162,I understand.
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1835.868,1836.197,For who?
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1836.948,1837.839,"For a practitioner, yes."
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.839,1838.93,For me the inventor?
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1838.93,1838.998,Yes.
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1838.998,1840.3,"I know that, because otherwise--"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1840.3,1840.821,No.
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1842.35,1843.602,--That's true.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1844.902,1848.705,The question is not... I can illustrate it with this case.
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.01,1888.893,"Well, the claim goes beyond that."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1930.811,1932.311,"--In a particular place, yes, that's correct."
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.463,1983.675,But why Asano?
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1983.675,1985.786,"--You'll have to ask them, Justice Scalia."
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.306,1990.81,You're the one that's standing up here making that argument.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1991.028,2005.838,"Justice Scalia, the patent examiner gave us a patent, initially rejected this patent as obvious, decided that it wasn't after considering all of these things, a statutory presumption of validity attached under Section 282."
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.993,2047.917,"You look at that thing, you think what this genius did, and I don't doubt that he's a genius, is there are wheels that turn around."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2151.623,2152.154,--Okay.
2006.04-1350,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2176.872,2181.935,"It looks like Dystar was decided by the Federal Circuit after it decided this case, didn't it?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2181.935,2183.755,"Yes, it did."
2006.04-1350,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2183.755,2187.278,"I mean, you have to be defending what the Federal Circuit did in this case."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2193.662,2195.943,"If I could just clarify, Dystar--"
2006.04-1350,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2195.943,2201.659,"And I think you should tell us when the case has been decided after, I think it has much less, much less weight."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2201.659,2207.623,"--Justice Kennedy, I agree that you have to distinguish two things rightly."
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.633,2227.785,You say its test is inclusive.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2253.572,2264.2,"--Justice Scalia, I disagree for the following reasons, and that is: What the Federal Circuit is saying is that any amount of evidence, any form of evidence is relevant to answer a particular question."
2006.04-1350,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.745,2290.258,Don't you think there's a grammatical difference in the meaning of the word obvious and the meaning of the word apparent?
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2290.258,2292.09,"--No, I don't."
2006.04-1350,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.09,2294.311,So you're saying that the question is whether it's obvious?
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2294.311,2295.092,"Yes, that's right."
2006.04-1350,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2333.857,2346.746,"Yes, but your... the Federal Circuit is saying that it is obvious if and only if the previous patents taught this."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2358.854,2360.664,"Justice Kennedy, that's not--"
2006.04-1350,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2360.664,2365.729,"And the Federal Circuit said oh, it's not in the patent, it's not obvious."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2365.729,2372.913,"--Justice Kennedy, with respect, that is not a fair description of the Federal Circuit's test, and I will take you to the language that addressed this claim."
2006.04-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2411.308,2423.366,"Well, once you define the teaching, suggestion and motivation test that way so that it can be implicit, it can be based on common sense, I don't quite understand the difference between that and simply asking whether it's obvious."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2425.807,2429.29,"Well, all that it adds is an analytical framework."
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2431.912,2452.074,"It adds a layer of Federal Circuit jargon that lawyers can then bandy back and forth, but if it's... particularly if it's nonexclusive, you can say you can meet our teaching, suggestion, or motivation test or you can show that it's nonobvious, it seems to me that it's worse than meaningless because it complicates the inquiry rather than focusing on the statute."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2452.074,2469.358,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the reason that the Federal Circuit disagrees and over 30 years this special court has elaborated this problem... these judges alone, for example, have heard 300 cases on nonobviousness... is that we need a guidance, we need guidance for the lower courts."
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.871,2491.101,Or anything else.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2491.101,2491.671,Or anything else.
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.671,2492.803,So why don't you say that?
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2492.803,2493.534,They have.
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.534,2494.883,It is... I agree with the Chief Justice.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2515.928,2527.054,"Justice Scalia, I this it would be surprising for this experienced Court and all of the patent bar... remember, every single major patent bar association in the country has filed on our side--"
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2527.054,2528.396,"Well, which way does that cut?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2532.457,2536.421,"--Mr. Chief Justice, it turns out that actually is not accurate."
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.421,2546.458,"It produces more patents, which is what the patent bar gets paid for, to acquire patents, not to get patent applications denied but to get them granted."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2556.464,2559.675,"Justice Scalia, that is not the point of these bar associations' either."
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2571.784,2600.291,"As you know, we've had a series of cases and in these series of cases we have received many, many briefs from all kinds of organizations and there are many from various parts of the patent bar that defend very much what the Federal circuit does and there are many from parts of the patent bar and others who are saying basically that they've leaned too far in the direction of never seeing a patent they didn't like and that has unfortunate implications for the economy."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2631.794,2638.136,"--Justice Breyer, there is a big debate over whether or not there is too much patenting in this country and Congress is involved in the debate."
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.753,2738.705,It doesn't have to go on top.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2788.166,2802.357,"--Justice Breyer, I think that's the dilemma that the Federal Circuit has been facing and is in answer to the criticism of Justice Scalia and that is the Federal Circuit isn't trying to articulate every single possible thing that can show you that it is obvious."
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.72,2838.869,"Supposing we then were to say exactly what this Court already said, that the standard here is obvious, we list a few of these additional factors that they've thrown in, and just as the Court said before, all these additional factors are there."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2858.183,2859.242,No.
2006.04-1350,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2859.242,2866.899,"Well then, in this case let's assume that we all strike out on coming out with the magic formulation."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2906.113,2911.819,"Justice Kennedy, that's absolutely right, and I just want to focus you on why it is you now think I lose."
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2944.528,2948.621,Where in claim 4 do you say it's putting it together in a particular way?
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2948.621,2952.184,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I can take you to the big book that I asked you to--"
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2952.184,2953.036,"Right, page 8."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2953.036,2954.566,"--Page 8, exactly."
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3033.927,3053.431,"Is it basically an invention where in fact there are only four or five moving parts on the thing that we have seen, every one of the moving parts is moving with a fixed ratio to the accelerator going up and down, as it must be because they're also moving in fixed ratio with the throttle thing coming out."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3074.614,3074.824,--All right.
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.194,3106.737,Who do you get to be an expert to tell you something's not obvious.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3106.737,3108.416,You get--
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3108.416,3112.22,"I mean, the least insightful person you can find?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3113.249,3122.004,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we got a Ph.D. and somebody who had worked in pedal design for 25 years."
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3122.004,3122.675,Exactly.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3122.675,3127.088,And people who actually know this industry.
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3144.16,3144.66,Excuse me.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3151.223,3162.743,"Justice Scalia, the way these cases are litigated, and properly so, is the other side says this would be obvious in light of a particular piece or collection of prior art."
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.104,3184.666,I think they happened to use Asano simply because that's what you stuck it on.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3196.484,3200.296,"--Well, that is not... we did not stick it on Asano."
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3206.31,3217.737,"Well, that's because the Federal Circuit's approach focuses narrowly prior to our grant of certiorari, allegedly more flexibly after, on prior art, as opposed."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3225.332,3227.074,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that's not correct."
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3333.043,3334.965,And it so quickly modified itself.
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3334.965,3344.443,"And in the last year or so, after we granted cert in this case after these decades of thinking about it, it suddenly decides to polish it up."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3344.443,3354.759,"--Justice Scalia, if you actually believe that, then you just don't believe the judges in the Federal Circuit because in each of these opinions they say quite explicitly we are not changing it."
2006.04-1350,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3354.759,3367.949,"Would you dispute that in some of the earlier cases, like Dembiczak with the garbage bag that looks like a pumpkin, that this TSM test was applied in a way that seemed to ask for something quite explicit in the prior art?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3367.949,3370.32,I do think that you can find outliers.
2006.04-1350,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3415.048,3421.973,"Tell me again, just to be sure I have it my... tell me very briefly, what it is that makes this invention nonobvious?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3421.973,3422.604,Two things.
2006.04-1350,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.878,3446.808,"The invention, to use an old-fashioned term, is the decision of where to put the control."
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3446.808,3448.25,That is the extent of the entire invention.
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3448.25,3457.357,And just... what makes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving piece?
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3457.357,3463.411,"An adjustable pedal that has a nonmoving pivot, yes."
2006.04-1350,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3463.411,3465.091,But the claim doesn't require that.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3465.091,3465.561,Yes it does.
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3471.286,3480.001,"But just to follow up from Justice Stevens' question, what makes this nonobvious is the decision to place the electronic control on a part of the car that doesn't move?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3480.001,3482.812,On the support--
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3482.812,3483.383,Right.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3483.383,3485.164,--And then a particular kind of adjustable pedal.
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3486.846,3487.637,I'm sorry.
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3489.177,3491.33,Does the pivot turn?
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3491.33,3493.794,"Isn't there an axis, and the axis turns?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3493.794,3494.562,Yes.
2006.04-1350,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3494.562,3495.493,The pivot rotates?
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3495.493,3501.298,"The pivot rotates, but it doesn't... the difference is that the pivot doesn't move with the adjustment of the pedal."
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3511.766,3515.396,"And the wires would get worn, worn down, right?"
2006.04-1350,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3519.819,3521.07,That would be a motivation.
2006.04-1350,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3537.852,3539.204,Thank you.
2006.04-1350,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3544.106,3546.868,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.04-1350,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3662.654,3669.169,What about in this case where the wires were getting frayed until this disclosure?
2006.04-1350,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3669.169,3678.825,"--That's not, if you read the affidavits carefully that is not an accurate characterization of... of any evidence put in by the petitioner."
2006.04-1350,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3680.155,3681.467,So suppose I read the record the other way.
2006.04-1350,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3686.6,3698.007,"--That would be, to the extent that that... if that is established that could be taken into consideration along with other facts."
2006.04-1350,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3698.007,3699.64,Why would that be?
2006.04-1350,3,29961,james_w_dabney,,3718.57,3735.352,"What the statute calls for, Justice Kennedy, is not to focus on a particular subjective problem like fitting into a Ford F 350, or particular difference between a prior art pedal that provides wire chafing and a claimed invention."
2006.04-1350,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3820.822,3821.122,"Thank you, Counsel."
