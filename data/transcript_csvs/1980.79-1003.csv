1980.79-1003,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.57,"We'll hear arguments next in County of Imperial, California, v. Munoz."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,62.906,63.723,Thank you.
1980.79-1003,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,269.572,272.524,How far away is Mexicali from this well?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,272.524,277.945,"Approximately, I would say, six miles, Your Honor."
1980.79-1003,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,279.38,281.397,So it would be more than twice as far to the other well?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,281.397,294.823,"--The well is on Highway 98, which kind of parallels the Border, and the Ocotillo well is eight miles north on Highway 98."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.812,333.448,"Well, it was an estoppel judgment though, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,333.448,340.852,"Yes, it was an estopped judgment, and I've indicated what the facts were substantiated in that estoppel."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,340.852,352.493,And your res judicata argument is that not Mr. McDougal should continue to be bound by that judgment but his vendees--
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,352.493,353.695,Exactly.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,353.695,356.214,--should also be bound by that estoppel judgment.
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,356.214,357.097,Exactly.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.868,365.003,"Well, you have to, I suppose."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,365.003,365.62,"--Yes, indeed."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.213,392.353,"You could say it was true, but still the estoppel judgment shouldn't stand against these people."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,392.353,393.987,I will get to that.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.601,415.651,"Yes, it affirmed the injunction."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,415.651,418.755,--Affirmed that portion of the injunction.
1980.79-1003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,565.732,584.443,"Well, don't many courts disagree with the 9th Circuit's rather limited definition of res judicata as limited to issues that have been litigated on their merits and say that it's any issue that was litigated or might have been litigated?"
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,584.443,587.561,I think that's correct.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.616,622.418,"Well, Mr. Harmon, didn't... weren't those other issues, though, presented in the state litigation?"
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,629.654,630.34,That's correct.
1980.79-1003,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.34,634.208,But isn't estoppel itself a substantive ground?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,634.208,634.958,"Yes, it is."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.427,639.946,And the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said it wasn't.
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,643.731,653.336,The cases clearly establish that estoppel is an independent and adequate ground for--
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.336,658.221,"Well, I guess McDermott, I suppose, at least, or McDougal, or whatever his name is."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,658.221,664.542,--I'm further suggesting that the respondents are in privity with McDougal.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.605,765.323,Could you have named him a party to your lawsuit?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,765.323,775.615,"I think the County might have, but the problem with that, Your Honor, is conceivably there are hundreds of people who might have been named parties; namely--"
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.615,781.602,But you think... that bind all of McDougal's customers on the privity theory.
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,781.602,784.637,"--On the facts of this case, yes."
1980.79-1003,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.558,881.182,"Mr. Harmon, would you make the same argument if some new person in Mexico who formed a water brokerage business, was not involved previously as a customer of this well, came in and said, I'd like to attack the zoning ordinance."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,881.968,887.419,There is not a zoning ordinance here in effect.
1980.79-1003,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.419,887.954,I understand.
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,887.954,891.906,"Vis-a-vis use permit, I think that... yes, Your Honor, I think that the underlying--"
1980.79-1003,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.906,898.243,So you really don't rely at all on the prior relationship between the Mexican broker and the property owner?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,898.243,906.666,"--I rely extensively on the contractual relationship between McDougal and his broker, Munoz."
1980.79-1003,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.666,910.633,But you said the same argument would apply to someone who had no prior contractual relationship?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,910.633,911.4,I think so.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.341,931.131,"You say it isn't a... just to make it clear... this isn't a zoning ordinance, this is a restriction on the sale of water, as the Supreme Court said?"
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,931.131,934.316,--This is a land use permit.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.601,937.618,But it's a restriction on the sale of water?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,937.618,938.22,--Right.
1980.79-1003,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,959.55,964.268,Would it make any difference to your case if there were a county-wide restriction?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,964.268,983.33,"If there were a county-wide restriction which the respondents were individually affected by, I would certainly believe under that set of circumstances they could have standing to challenge the restriction."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.105,1177.223,Was McDougal held in contempt?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1177.223,1180.425,"Yes, he was held in contempt."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1180.425,1182.359,"But then the judgment was stayed, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1182.359,1186.496,"The execution of the judgment was stayed, Your Honor."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.496,1191.13,"And depending on how the Court of Appeals came out, it was stayed permanently?"
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1191.13,1195.101,That's correct; execution was.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.101,1197.553,"Well, now, so what does that mean about the injunction?"
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1197.553,1218.717,"Well, it certainly doesn't indicate to me that the state courts have deferred making a determination, as for example was the case in Hale v. Bimco, where the Florida State Supreme Court before ever getting to final judgment said--"
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.717,1225.954,"Well, what if the state court was at least saying as to McDougal, this injunction doesn't mean anything; he can violate it if he wants to."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1225.954,1234.409,"--The state court was aware, I think, Your Honor, that cross-contempt proceedings were also going on in the Federal District Court, and--"
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.409,1237.778,"Well, I know, but they stayed it pending the outcome of this case."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1237.778,1241.063,--Stayed execution of the contempt judgment against McDougal.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1241.063,1249.55,"And if McDougal won this... or if Munoz won this case and McDougal was off the hook, then McDougal was off the hook."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1250.085,1250.685,I think that's correct.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.685,1253.121,So what does the injunction mean?
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1253.121,1255.804,The injunction or the--
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1255.804,1256.739,Against McDougal.
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1256.739,1263.643,"--The injunction against McDougal is clearly a final judgment, by the California Supreme Court."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1263.643,1271.333,"Well, but it's been rendered... it certainly isn't the creature that it was, if McDougal can violate it at will."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1271.333,1282.973,"Well, I think the final judgment of the California Supreme Court has been all but emasculated by the preliminary injunction issued by the Superior Court."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.025,1288.544,The Superior Court is the one who issued the injunction in the beginning.
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1288.544,1289.444,That's right.
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.031,1299.483,"Well, that doesn't keep the Superior Court from setting it aside."
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1299.483,1307.939,"--The Superior Court, Your Honor, has shown no intention to set aside its judgment; to the contrary."
1980.79-1003,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.939,1311.308,Except insofar as it tells McDougal he doesn't need to obey it.
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1311.308,1322.431,Except insofar as it has withheld execution of the contempt judgment against McDougal until a final determination by the United States Supreme Court.
1980.79-1003,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1417.327,1420.779,"The merits are not really before this Court in this posture of the case, are they?"
1980.79-1003,0,30983,james_h_harmon,,1420.779,1421.647,I believe not.
1980.79-1003,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1428.118,1441.942,Mr. Kronberger.
1980.79-1003,1,45191,william_h_kronberger_jr,,1441.942,1445.227,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1003,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1495.91,1504.349,"Would there be any question of the standing of these plaintiffs to bring a suit, quite apart from the question of res judicata?"
1980.79-1003,1,45191,william_h_kronberger_jr,,1504.349,1505.166,I don't believe so.
1980.79-1003,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.704,1518.423,Are these just three of probably thousands if not millions of potential buyers?
1980.79-1003,1,45191,william_h_kronberger_jr,,1518.423,1538.32,"--Well, I would suggest that in our allegations we have pointed out that these particular plaintiffs are lawfully within the United States, and once you are lawfully within the United States, it seems to me that the Constitution talks in terms of persons are protected, and it doesn't say, citizens of this country, and it seems to me that a person--"
1980.79-1003,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1538.32,1540.689,Well we're talking about the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.
1980.79-1003,1,45191,william_h_kronberger_jr,,1540.689,1555.031,"--That's correct, and I believe that a person lawfully in this country exercising the right as a purchaser ought to be able to invoke the basic fabric of this nation, the Commerce Clause, in a Federal District Court."
1980.79-1003,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.031,1575.295,"Well, Mr. Kronberger, what if your clients had litigated the precise same issue that you say they are now seeking to litigate here in the Federal District Court up through the California state court system, saying that this violates the Federal Constitution, the Supreme Court of California had ruled against them, certiorari denied here."
1980.79-1003,1,45191,william_h_kronberger_jr,,1579.747,1590.704,"I think that that question is answered by the principles of res judicata, and if res judicata would apply because they were in those proceedings, then I would agree with your statement."
1980.79-1003,2,30983,james_h_harmon,,3177.549,3179.001,"Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
