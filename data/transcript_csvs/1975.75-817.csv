1975.75-817,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.9,"We will hear arguments next in 75-817, Nebraska Press Association and others against Stuart."
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,12.181,12.474,Thank you.
1975.75-817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,58.207,62.428,"You are going to define that prior restraint somewhere in your argument, Mr. Prettyman?"
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,62.428,77.358,"I certainly think that under any definition Your Honor, it applies here and that is, it is in this case at least, it is an order not to print certain information in advance of that information being printed."
1975.75-817,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,121.722,124.729,What are the local media in the Lincoln County?
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,124.729,131.556,"Actually, there is no newspaper in Sutherland, the small town of 800 where it occurred."
1975.75-817,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,154.938,157.89,There is no local media right in this town?
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,157.89,160.105,Not in Sutherland.
1975.75-817,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,161.98,163.147,Is North Platte is the county seat?
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,163.147,163.391,Yes.
1975.75-817,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,165.518,167.561,And there is a --
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,167.561,168.912,North Platte Telegraph.
1975.75-817,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,168.912,172.056,"-- a newspaper and what, two or three radio stations?"
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,172.056,177.501,"That is my understanding, yes sir."
1975.75-817,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,252.238,257.978,"Mr. Prettyman, could that have been in a closed hearing with the consent of the defendant?"
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,257.978,270.696,"We are in a strange situation in regard to closed hearings there because you have a statute that says that it had to be open, but the Nebraska Supreme Court in this case seems to be interpreting in a way that seems to allow to have been closed."
1975.75-817,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,289.329,301.723,"Do you agree Mr. Prettyman that to entertain the arguments you advance, we must explore all of the alternatives to what you characterize as prior restraint?"
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,301.723,308.554,I think you must say that there are certainly -- I would certainly argue that there are many alternatives available.
1975.75-817,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,327.885,339.588,"Would you take the same view of an order directed at prosecutor and the defense counsel, that they would be held in contempt if they discussed the case publicly?"
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,339.588,341.941,"Again, Your Honor, that is not this case."
1975.75-817,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,358.652,363.552,"Would it be a prior restraint, if you order the prosecutor not to discuss the case?"
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,363.552,366.024,"Well, it would be a prior restraint on the prosecutor."
1975.75-817,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.024,370.566,It would be that the same constitutional principles apply or not?
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,370.566,372.357,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1975.75-817,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,373.281,376.495,That it is a prior restraint is not controlling?
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,376.495,388.687,"In the prior restraint on the prosecutor, you have a free speech problem for the prosecutor, but you do not have the direct prior restraint on the Press that you have here."
1975.75-817,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,388.687,391.566,How important is the label prior restraint?
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,391.566,407.813,"Well, I think insofar as this case is important, I do not know that the label means very much, but what actually occurred is of extreme importance, that is you have directly prohibited the Press from publishing a certain information."
1975.75-817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,414.838,417.495,(Inaudible)
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,417.495,418.42,Absolutely.
1975.75-817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.42,425.606,And (Inaudible) prior restraint (Inaudible)
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,425.606,446.202,"That may well be -- that is correct and in the next case you may have to decide that, but certainly, if you are going to have prior restraints, the one that is worst, the one that affects the public the most, the most onerous one is the one that is the direct prior restraint on the Press as this Court has recognized in New York Times and University of Minnesota and in a lot of other cases."
1975.75-817,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,446.202,457.229,Those extreme examples that to a degree the rules of evidence and the rules of procedure are a restraint on the lawyers who are appearing in the courtroom?
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,457.229,458.667,Sure.
1975.75-817,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,458.667,460.17,And so --
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,460.17,467.313,"Just as you can restrict the Press in a courtroom too, from not sitting inside the bar and from doing a number of -- taking pictures and from doing a number of things."
1975.75-817,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,467.313,468.889,What about sound equipment?
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,468.889,474.453,"Absolutely, there is no question, but that you can impose some restrictions on the Press."
1975.75-817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.869,497.216,"Do you say that the prior -- the cases say that prior restraint comes here with a heavy presumption against it, are at least at their core, limited the case is involving the Press rather than the individuals?"
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,497.216,498.079,Yes sir.
1975.75-817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,505.515,507.05,Interpreted broadly.
1975.75-817,0,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,507.881,509.706,"Yes, that is correct."
1975.75-817,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1683.762,1686.194,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-817,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.52,1968.118,Mr. Abrams neither you so far nor Mr. Prettyman have refereed to the trial judge's post-trial inquiry of the jury.
1975.75-817,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1972.461,1975.664,"Sure, Your Honor."
1975.75-817,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2183.663,2187.755,"Mr. Abrams, before you proceed, I think perhaps I miss something."
1975.75-817,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2193.759,2195.289,Yes.
1975.75-817,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2195.289,2203.53,"-- and then you told us, why was not it attributable to this and not attributable to that and not attributable to the other thing."
1975.75-817,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2207.337,2214.396,"Justice Stewart, what I meant to convey in Nebraska, I have lost in conveying, but that I think it is attributable to two separate things."
1975.75-817,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.37,2286.17,"Mr. Abrams, let me just ask you a specific question."
1975.75-817,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2303.566,2325.826,"I think you have to live with it, Mr. Justice Stevens and one of the ways that you live with it is by giving jury instructions by appropriate voir dire, by all the Sheppard methods, but to take your questions at its narrowest, yes it is our view that there are such things as we do have to live with if it had finally comes to that, be it confessions or something else."
1975.75-817,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2360.697,2364.07,Thank you Mr. Abrams.
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2367.415,2373.053,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.75-817,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2510.23,2552.368,"Mr. Mosher, suppose that after the restrictive order, challenged as prior restraint had gone into effect, did the local television station decided to re-run the dramatization of the Texas Sniper killings and both the defense and the prosecution came to the court and said this is going to stir up all kinds of passion and prejudice and impede a fair trial and we want a restraining order to restrain the showing of the dramatization of the Texas City Affair."
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2554.973,2557.91,"I doubt it very much Your Honor, I doubt it very much."
1975.75-817,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2557.91,2562.006,We have a tendency to provoke passions and prejudices?
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2562.006,2563.426,I doubt it.
1975.75-817,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.55,2627.085,"A quick question, your characterization of the order is a narrow one."
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2640.415,2642.118,Certainly.
1975.75-817,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.871,2643.336,Yes.
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2644.727,2650.556,"Certainly, let me continue though with some facts if I may because I think they are important."
1975.75-817,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2750.255,2761.083,Just an order restricting them from making false statements or making any statements?
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2761.083,2785.027,"I think it means Your Honor is that, first of all, before they are going to get to a question like this, before they would ever to it again, is whether or not this Court is going to allow the Supreme Court of Nebraska to implement Section 3.1 of the Guidelines of the American Bar Association's fair trial free Press."
1975.75-817,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2900.743,2910.213,"Mr. Mosher, you have I gather two hearings in Nebraska prior to the trial at least two, one is in arraignment and the other is the preliminary hearing?"
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2910.213,2911.006,That is correct.
1975.75-817,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2911.006,2912.857,And which comes first?
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2912.857,2913.833,The arraignment is the first --
1975.75-817,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2913.833,2915.969,And what is the function and purpose of an arraignment?
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2915.969,2930.323,"Primarily, the only function of that is to set a time for preliminary hearing and it serves a second function to determine whether or not the accused has sufficient funds to secure the services of an attorney, that is all is so called arraignment does."
1975.75-817,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2930.323,2931.207,There is no evidence --
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2931.207,2933.059,"None whatsoever, none whatsoever."
1975.75-817,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2947.572,2948.33,There is no pleading?
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2948.33,2950.929,"None whatsoever, absolutely not."
1975.75-817,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2950.929,2953.321,(Inaudible)
1975.75-817,2,27671,harold_mosher,,2953.321,2955.127,"Yes, it can be waived."
1975.75-817,3,36179,milton_r_larson,,4211.806,4216.718,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors and may it please the Court."
1975.75-817,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4766.248,4776.934,"Does that not cut in other way in the place of 800 people, would they talk, would 800 people talk about anything else but the --"
1975.75-817,3,36179,milton_r_larson,,4776.934,4784.833,"No Your Honor, I presume what is your getting to now is the rumor in innuendo that goes in the absence of a court, and is that correct?"
1975.75-817,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4784.833,4786.674,You cannot stop that?
1975.75-817,3,36179,milton_r_larson,,4786.674,4808.878,"No, and my answer to that and it is only a feeling, but I think it is correct that that which Mrs. Jones tells me, I am going to be more easily convinced to put aside than if I have read in the papers in the headlines, evidence established at preliminary hearing shows that a confession was made."
1975.75-817,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4830.133,4833.644,In the small town of 800?
1975.75-817,3,36179,milton_r_larson,,4833.644,4835.33,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-817,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4850.615,4855.817,(Inaudible)
1975.75-817,3,36179,milton_r_larson,,4855.817,4856.899,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-817,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4856.899,4859.894,(Inaudible)
1975.75-817,3,36179,milton_r_larson,,4859.894,4871.567,"You cannot stop it Your Honor, but I do think that it is not going to be as prejudicial as what comes out in the paper that judicial proceedings have indicated that a confession was made."
1975.75-817,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4947.39,4952.382,"Before a confession is introduced in a preliminary hearing, is there any test of its voluntariness?"
1975.75-817,3,36179,milton_r_larson,,4952.382,4970.291,"No, Your Honor, that was the next point that I was going to make, Due Process before the admission of a confession, into the trial portion, requires a due process hearing outside the presence of the jury with relationship to voluntariness, that was held."
1975.75-817,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5117.743,5121.14,Thank you Mr. Larson.
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5125.295,5129.349,"I do not think that I will take it all, Your Honor."
1975.75-817,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5165.774,5174.442,"(Inaudible) If the Press are permitted to be present and have access to the entire record, they have a rather hard time covering it up."
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5178.996,5196.749,"Well, the problem of course is that is what is actually going on and that is that you are having a combination of closed hearings and prior restraints and what we are having more and more now and what is developing at an accelerating rate as the fact that the Press is being cutoff entirely."
1975.75-817,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5237.586,5242.465,(Inaudible) our decision in The Rideau case was erroneous?
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5242.465,5243.627,No.[Laughter]
1975.75-817,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5275.558,5280.374,"Now, the issue there was whether or not he was unconstitutionally entitled to a change of venue --"
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5280.374,5281.484,That is true.
1975.75-817,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5281.484,5289.61,"Mr. Prettyman, I suppose your position, if you prevail here will be to increase the number of closed hearings."
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5292.142,5293.684,Yes sir.
1975.75-817,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5293.684,5298.396,-- but is this a privilege for the Press to assert or for the defense to assert?
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5298.396,5310.512,"Well, of course, we would contend and the Nebraska Supreme Court does not agree with us that the Press is entitled to intervene here, that it represents not only its own rights, but the public's right."
1975.75-817,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5380.135,5382.901,Your grand jury is certainly closed --
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5382.901,5383.931,I am sorry I did not hear you.
1975.75-817,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5383.931,5387.482,"In the federal system, your grand jury is certainly closed."
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5390.171,5391.737,"No, absolutely not."
1975.75-817,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5401.408,5410.258,But I thought you were saying that the State of Nebraska is constitutionally obligated to open up its preliminary hearing?
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5410.258,5411.888,"No, I was not arguing at that now."
1975.75-817,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5456.815,5469.495,"Mr. Prettyman, your argument on the matter why is it essential that it be published tomorrow morning as distinguished from a later point?"
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5469.495,5470.455,"Yes, Your Honor --"
1975.75-817,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5470.455,5475.161,Assuming that there is no barrier whatever to the subsequent publication?
1975.75-817,4,22982,e_barrett_prettyman_jr,,5475.161,5476.267,Yes.
