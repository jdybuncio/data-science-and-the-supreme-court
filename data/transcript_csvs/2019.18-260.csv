2019.18-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.32,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-260, the County of Maui versus the Hawaii Wildlife Fund. Mr. Lin."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,8.32,22.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is not about whether the releases from Maui's underground injection wells should be regulated at all but how."
2019.18-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,137.8,141.32,"Counsel, I -- I want to make sure I understand what your test is."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,149.64,150.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,150.28,157.96,"What does that mean? That if it ever runs into groundwater, it is not the means of conveyance but the groundwater is?"
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,157.96,163.48,"That's correct, Your Honor. The -- what we mean by ""means of conveyance"" is at the point source."
2019.18-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,169.4,177.52,So the -- so any intervention of groundwater removes the jurisdiction of the point source program?
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,177.52,181.04,"That's right, because groundwater is a nonpoint source."
2019.18-260,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,189.28,197.6,"But the well -- the well is the source of the pollution, so it would seem that that should be the object of regulation."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,214.24,251.08,"Yes, Your Honor, the wells are a point source, and we don't dispute that it is a discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, but not all point sources require point source permits. If that were the case, as Respondents suggest, there would be very, very little, if anything, left for nonpoint source regulation. And so our contention, Your Honor, is that if you're reading the statutory text and considering the words ""addition from any point source,"" that that contemplates that the point source must be the thing or point sources must together -- as one functional point source must be what actually delivers the pollutants to the --"
2019.18-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,251.08,251.88,So if --
2019.18-260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,251.88,253.52,I guess I --
2019.18-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,253.52,272.28,"So, if you have a point source under pressure that, you know, just -- that doesn't seep up, kind of shoots the pollutants out, and there, you know, that motion gets to the jurisdictional water, would that be covered? Would that be pollution of the jurisdictional water by that point source?"
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,272.28,272.6,It --
2019.18-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,272.6,285.76,"I'm envisioning two different things, one where it's -- the pollutant is put in the groundwater and then gradually, you know, seeps into the -- into the ocean, and one where it's sort of forcefully expelled, although it goes through the groundwater."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,285.76,294.96,"Your Honor, I think if it still goes through the groundwater, the -- the question under the statute is what is the -- what is the conveyance, what is the thing that carries and delivers the pollutants."
2019.18-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,318.0,337.52,"So what happens if you just take the pipe and you decide what we'll do is we're going to end the pipe 35 feet from the river or from the ocean or something? Now you know perfectly well that it'll drip down into the ground and it'll be carried out into the navigable water. In your theory, that isn't covered?"
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,337.52,343.88,"In that scenario, Your Honor, the land is the conveyance and that pollution would be regulated under the nonpoint source --"
2019.18-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,343.88,352.52,"Well, no, the conveyance is the groundwater that is underneath the land into which the pipe drips the pollutant."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,352.52,352.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,354.2,354.2,Yeah.
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,354.2,356.92,-- then the groundwater is what's carrying and delivering the pollutants --
2019.18-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,356.92,357.4,Yeah.
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,357.4,361.32,-- and that scenario would be regulated under the nonpoint source program. The Congress --
2019.18-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,361.32,370.76,"All right, but then what we have is, I take it, an absolute road map for people who want to avoid the point source regulation."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,394.28,395.12,Your Honor --
2019.18-260,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,395.12,400.04,And at the same time doesn't turn everything into -- undercut the groundwater program.
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,400.04,407.4,"If I may, I would quarrel with your use of the word ""evasion,"" because I think what's important to remember is it's a comprehensive scheme."
2019.18-260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,444.92,445.56,But Congress --
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,445.56,445.88,-- the Hawaii --
2019.18-260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,445.88,450.0,"Excuse me, Mr. Lin. Congress wanted the point source program to do something."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,474.64,477.84,"And I think, Your Honor, the key there is that they knew they could."
2019.18-260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,499.76,500.6,But that's the problem --
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,500.6,502.12,-- Justice Breyer is talking about.
2019.18-260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,502.12,507.52,"-- but that's the problem, isn't it? Because it presumes the state will regulate, and some states don't."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,546.16,547.12,A few --
2019.18-260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,547.12,551.32,"To accept yours, you have to put in the word ""into."""
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,551.32,552.72,"A few answers to that, Your Honor."
2019.18-260,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,552.72,557.52,"To -- to -- to accept your meaning, we have to transform ""in"" into ""into."""
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,557.52,576.12,"If I may, let me turn first to the question of states and whether states would regulate. So I think the answer to your question is, could there -- could there be states that would simply allow this to be a wild west, where there's no regulation of nonpoint source pollution? And the answer to that is absolutely not. There's a couple reasons why that's not true."
2019.18-260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,603.92,604.8,"But, Mr. Lin --"
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,604.8,605.2,-- that have --
2019.18-260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,605.2,607.16,-- the question is what this statute means.
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,638.16,642.72,"Your Honor, I think it comes down to what -- what work is ""from"" doing in the statute."
2019.18-260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,672.0,673.96,"Well, it's defined as more than a conveyance."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,715.0,756.36,"Your Honor, if I could start with the statutory language, I think the wells as an example is important to address, but if you -- I think if you look at the words ""addition from any point source,"" and you substitute in, for point source, pipe, which is in the statute and nobody disagrees is a -- is a point source, addition to a lake, to an ocean, to a river, a navigable water, an addition to a lake of pollutants from a pipe, addition to a lake of sewage water from a pipe. I think, I submit, Your Honor, that the ordinary understanding of that, what one pictures in one's mind is a pipe that is next to the water, not a pipe that is a mile away."
2019.18-260,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,761.6,761.92,That --
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,761.92,763.44,"-- delivery -- yes, Your Honor?"
2019.18-260,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,763.44,764.28,Keep going. Sorry.
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,764.28,771.36,"-- that has delivery in it and it's -- it's being associated with conveyance, which is a thing that transports, carries, and delivers."
2019.18-260,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,771.36,777.24,That sounds like the directly argument that Justice Scalia's opinion rejected.
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,777.24,778.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-260,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,789.12,798.96,"Well, why -- why is point source to point source to navigable water covered and point source to nonpoint source to navigable water not covered?"
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,798.96,822.16,"Textually, we think that point source to point source is covered because it is the phrase ""any point source,"" not the phrase ""a point source,"" that must be the means. And because ""any"" includes one or more, you could have more than one point source. And the only way more than one point source can -- where all of the point sources are carrying, delivering, is where they are integrated and operating as one point source."
2019.18-260,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,822.16,839.08,"If -- if the word ""from"" -- suppose I think you have a strong argument on the word ""from,"" and so, too, does the opposing side have a strong argument on the ordinary meaning of the word ""from."" What then should we look at to help us decide how to interpret it?"
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,839.08,843.24,"Your Honor, as this Court has said many times recently, you have to look at all the other tools of statutory --"
2019.18-260,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,843.24,843.6,And what --
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,843.6,844.2,-- interpretation.
2019.18-260,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,844.2,845.56,-- and what -- what are the best ones for you?
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,845.56,846.4,A couple of them.
2019.18-260,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,846.4,849.12,Give me one or two that -- that you think are best for you.
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,849.12,883.2,"If I had to go with two, I would start with structure, the fact that nobody disputes that there should be a point source program and a nonpoint source program, and that their reading renders the nonpoint source program, by their own admission, into a residuum, whereas ours leaves a meaningful role for the nonpoint source program. The second tool of statutory interpretation, Your Honor, is to look at the context and the other provisions, including the punitive provisions, which, as this Court has recognized, impose civil penalties of more -- of more than $50,000 a day. We're talking about a permitting regime."
2019.18-260,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,903.96,939.52,"The term ""from"" could be read very broadly to mean that a discharge requires a permit if the pollutant emerges at some point from a point source and by some means, no matter how remote, some quantity of the pollutant eventually makes its way into the waters of the United States. Now I take it that interpretation which Respondents once advocated is no longer their position."
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,956.0,997.16,"Your Honor, I think the limiting principle is the means of delivery test, which is that you -- that -- that what Congress wanted regulated entities and regulators and courts to look at is, how is the pollutant reaching the navigable water? Is it a discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance? Now that is a case-by-case factual determination and there are lines that need to be drawn, but we think in the overwhelming majority of cases it's going to be clear. Your Honor, in terms of whether ""from"" could be more broadly read, I think, yes, if the statute were written differently, if it said, for example, emitted from a point source, that might be a different case."
2019.18-260,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,997.16,1013.72,"What about the limiting principle that the Respondents now propose, which is that it has to be fairly traceable and there has to be proximate causation and, therefore, foreseeability, is -- can that be found in the text and is it workable?"
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,1013.72,1021.0,"Your Honor, we don't think it can be found in the text because we don't read ""from"" -- we don't think Congress intended ""from"" to mean causation."
2019.18-260,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1023.76,1036.32,"But that would be a normal way of reading the word ""from,"" wouldn't it; in other words, to say, to decide whether something is from something else, you have to look as to whether it's from something else? (Laughter.)"
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,1036.32,1037.36,"Your Honor, if I may."
2019.18-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1037.36,1037.56,Yes.
2019.18-260,0,63179,elbert_lin,,1037.56,1044.64,"Your Honor, with respect, I think it -- it -- that assumes that a certain kind of word is following from."
2019.18-260,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1064.84,1074.4,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart."
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1074.4,1157.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The first point I'd like to make about the -- the definition of discharge of a pollutant is that the combination of the words ""to"" and ""from"" import more than either term in isolation; that the statute defines the term ""discharge of a pollutant"" to mean any addition of a pollutant to navigable waters or to the ocean from a point source. And, for example, if at my home I pour whiskey from a bottle into a flask and then I bring the flask to a party at a different location and I pour whiskey into the punch bowl there, nobody would say that I had added whiskey to the punch from the bottle. It would be true that the punch -- that the whiskey originated in the bottle, its route was fairly traceable from the bottle to the punch bowl, and it wound up in the punch bowl, but you wouldn't say it was added to the punch from the bottle. Now, at the other extreme, if I brought the bottle to the party and I poured it, the whiskey from a few inches above the surface of the punch and so it traveled through air or if it traveled through a funnel so it passed over a solid surface, in ordinary parlance, we wouldn't say that simply because there was some spatial gap between the bottle and the punch, therefore, I didn't add it from the -- the bottle to -- to the punch. In between those two extremes, I don't think that the ""to"" and ""from"" will get you all the way home."
2019.18-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1230.84,1235.8,"And in -- in your test, any little bit of groundwater is enough to break the chain?"
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1235.8,1236.52,Yes.
2019.18-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1237.88,1238.2,Yes.
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1240.16,1240.88,Two inches.
2019.18-260,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1258.36,1261.08,What's the difference between the groundwater and the land?
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1261.08,1262.44,The big difference is that groundwater --
2019.18-260,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1262.44,1265.08,The land is not a conveyance.
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1265.08,1281.44,The -- the -- the big -- the big difference for purposes of applying the statute is that the land is not -- the land right next to the bank is not subject to its own body of distinct federal and state regulation in the way that groundwater is.
2019.18-260,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1281.44,1281.56,Why --
2019.18-260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1281.56,1288.68,"Sorry, Mr. Stewart, I didn't get the idea of your -- what -- what do you say to the hypothetical, which is the pipe goes five feet to the shore?"
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1288.68,1304.16,"If it goes five feet to the shore and the pollutant travels onto the land, travels across the land and into the water, you know, through its own force, it spews out of the pipe or simply through the force of gravity because you're on an incline, we would say that's covered."
2019.18-260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1304.16,1317.12,"So, if the pipe is on the -- is on the land and spews onto the land, it's regulated and you need a permit; but, if the pipe is underground, it's not and you don't need a permit?"
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1317.12,1325.44,You would not need a -- you would not need a NPDES permit because you would not be discharging onto -- you would not be discharging to the navigable water --
2019.18-260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1325.44,1326.32,It's the same problem.
2019.18-260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1326.32,1329.96,But just to follow up with Justice Breyer's -- Justice Breyer said that this was a road map.
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1339.16,1363.4,"Well, I think if you were going to -- to do it in the form of a well or do it in the form of a contraption that had the physical consequences of a well, that is, you were injecting pollutants into the groundwater from the surface, you would be subject to this distinct body of regulation. The Clean Water Act requires states that want to implement their own -- to administer their own NPDES programs to regulate disposals into wells."
2019.18-260,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1372.52,1377.08,The problem I see is that all those other statutes have different focuses.
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1407.36,1408.92,There's --
2019.18-260,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1408.92,1412.56,It's the only one that serves that permit -- that purpose.
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1412.56,1414.24,I guess I'd say a couple of things.
2019.18-260,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1431.36,1432.32,But that's -- that's --
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1432.32,1432.4,It --
2019.18-260,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1432.4,1435.36,-- one manner of curing the problem.
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1448.48,1453.68,It's -- it's simply illustrative of the fact that the NPDES program is not intended as a cure-all.
2019.18-260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1458.96,1466.92,"Well, that's true, Mr. Stewart, and -- and -- and nobody's saying that the federal government can go in and start regulating groundwater as groundwater."
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1509.68,1509.96,Yeah --
2019.18-260,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1509.96,1517.72,It leaves -- I guess what I'm saying is this leaves a very large sphere of activity that the federal government is still not touching.
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1528.6,1568.28,"I -- I guess the other thing I would say is when -- when we're distinguishing between nonpoint source and point source pollution, we are at least in general looking at the means by which the pollutants are conveyed into -- to the waters. And so, for example, if you apply fertilizer to your lawn and a rainstorm comes and the fertilizer is washed into a nearby river, the -- the contraption that you use to apply the fertilizer might fit the statutory definition of a point source, but that would still be treated as nonpoint source pollution. It would be what they refer to sometimes as -- as sheet flow, unchannelized rainwater that washes into a navigable water."
2019.18-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1568.48,1571.56,"Mr. Stewart, Justice Breyer has been trying gamely --"
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1571.56,1571.88,I'm sorry.
2019.18-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1571.88,1572.44,-- to question you.
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1572.44,1573.0,I'm sorry.
2019.18-260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1573.0,1576.72,Just if you have a reaction to this.
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1639.44,1661.4,"I mean, I -- I guess the reason I'm skeptical of that from our point of view is I think the people -- without further guidance from the Court, I think the people on the other side of the case and their amici would say, if it can be shown that the pollutants that were released from the point source ultimately wound up in the navigable waters, then it is the functional equivalent."
2019.18-260,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1661.4,1679.36,"Then what we do is we -- basically, it would be up to the EPA, policed by the courts, to see that they've come up with a -- a reasonable decision, consistent with the basic objectives of the statute, dah-dah-dah, okay? So we don't know exactly what the -- you see the point."
2019.18-260,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1679.36,1680.2,Yes.
2019.18-260,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1694.76,1709.32,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Henkin."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,1709.32,1719.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Clean Water Act prohibits unpermitted additions of pollutants to navigable waters from any point source."
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1848.52,1853.24,"Well, that's the extreme problem on the other side."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,1869.16,1874.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, the limiting principles would be traceability and proximate cause."
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1874.56,1886.6,"All right. Now traceability is a technological issue because we know that the water, including the pollutants, has gotten to whatever it is, the ocean or something, whatever the jurisdictional water is."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,1902.48,1909.56,"Proximate cause, which comes from the notion of -- of this is -- this is -- this statute regulates behavior that causes something."
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1915.72,1930.2,"Well, proximate cause is notoriously manipulable. What -- give me an example where you think there would be an intervening cause, where you have, in addition to the groundwater, the groundwater eventually makes it to the ocean, but there's an intervening cause."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,1930.2,1939.08,"Well, for example, if someone is discharging into an injection well, they've got a Safe Drinking Water Act permit and that permit told them that this groundwater doesn't go anywhere."
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1940.48,1946.24,"No, I'm looking for a limited principle when the groundwater does go to jurisdictional waters."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,1946.24,1951.48,"Well, proximate cause cuts off factual causation when it's -- it's too attenuated."
2019.18-260,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1975.72,1975.84,What --
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,1975.84,1976.08,-- it needs to go --
2019.18-260,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1976.08,1976.28,-- what about --
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,1976.28,1977.12,-- as far as that --
2019.18-260,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1977.12,1984.0,-- what about the Fourth Circuit test? I take it you are advancing the Ninth Circuit fairly traceable test.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,1994.72,1997.72,"Justice Ginsburg, in our view, our test is narrower."
2019.18-260,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2031.64,2032.36,Is there an example --
2019.18-260,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2032.36,2045.72,I'm not sure I really see much of a distinction between the direct hydrological connection or a hydrological connection and what you're -- and what you're advocating. Let's take the example of a wastewater treatment facility.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2061.24,2062.36,"No, Justice Alito."
2019.18-260,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2093.92,2094.16,Okay.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2133.24,2163.36,"Well, Justice Alito, if I understand your hypothetical correctly, at the time that they purchased the house, they had no reason to believe that any pollutants would be getting to the ocean. And that would be a reasonable assumption for a homeowner because septic tanks, as both, I think, the homeowners brief -- or the National Home Builders brief, as well as Anderson County brief point out, the reason that we have these types of regulations locally has nothing to do with the Clean Water Act. It's so that a septic tank is properly installed and it's going to use the ground as a treatment system, but it doesn't even pollute groundwater, much less any down --"
2019.18-260,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2163.36,2184.36,"Well, what -- I mean, what if they buy it from -- and they don't have a lot of money and so they shop around and they buy it from the lowest cost provider and the lowest cost installer -- and then, if it turns out, well, it should have been foreseeable that because you bought this from this cheap outfit that there was going to be a problem, that would be a violation?"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2184.36,2196.36,"Well -- well, fortunately, Justice Alito, it's -- it's a -- it's a highly regulated thing, a septic tank. And so they not only need to get a purveyor, but they're going to have to follow the rules of the locality in the state. So I have personal --"
2019.18-260,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2196.36,2196.68,But -- but --
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2196.68,2198.12,-- experience with this because I built a house --
2019.18-260,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2198.12,2198.6,"-- but, counsel --"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2198.6,2199.52,-- and I had to put in a septic tank.
2019.18-260,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2199.52,2201.72,-- could you just answer Justice Alito's question? I'd be grateful if you would.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2222.36,2223.04,"Correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-260,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2223.04,2231.56,So all that talk about what they personally think is irrelevant. Why -- why aren't they liable under your test?
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2231.56,2242.36,"Well, Justice Gorsuch, if -- if -- if a reasonable person in the position of the homeowner would have no reason to believe the septic tank is going to get to navigable waters, the pollutants from the septic tank, they wouldn't be held liable."
2019.18-260,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2243.52,2249.32,"Well, again, we're positing -- I think you're fighting the hypothetical, and one -- you know, I'll give it one more shot."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2249.32,2249.72,Oh --
2019.18-260,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2249.72,2273.36,"You know, that -- that -- that you've got great proof because water runs downhill, and gravity tends to work its wonders with water, and that the snow in the Rockies tends to wind up in the Mississippi River, and that this septic tank happens to be built pretty close to a navigable river, and it was put in by a shoddy installer, or whatever facts you have that are objective."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2295.88,2299.68,"Well, you also have the concept of traceability."
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.56,2316.48,You're trying with this.
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2323.72,2329.44,-- and that virtually every little drop of rain that falls finds its way to the sea.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2405.12,2429.2,"Well, Justice Breyer, we believe that the way the statute is written, that traceability and proximate cause was a fair reading of the plain language of the statute. But the question presented to the Court is simply whether the mere fact that discharges that, concededly, are from a point source reach a navigable water through some distance of groundwater, whether that cuts off Clean Water Act liability. The answer to that is clearly no, because --"
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2429.2,2430.04,All right.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2430.44,2430.72,And --
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.72,2431.92,But we have to write an opinion.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2433.0,2433.52,Yes.
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2433.52,2436.0,-- I think we're going to have to have a standard.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2439.52,2440.0,Yes.
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2440.0,2448.6,But I am worried about 500 million people or something suddenly discovering that they have to go apply for a permit for the EPA.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2448.6,2449.24,And -- and --
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2449.24,2452.64,Now traceability and causation don't quite seem to do it.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2463.36,2473.0,"Well, Justice Breyer, we could certainly embrace functional equivalent, because there's no question that Congress intended to regulate discharges whether it goes through the air."
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2515.68,2516.16,"Well, I --"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2516.16,2517.32,Then you turn --
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2517.32,2527.76,"-- don't -- I don't mean to be critical of the author of the phrase, but what does ""functional equivalent"" mean? (Laughter.)"
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2527.76,2535.72,"What do you understand it to mean? I mean, the -- what we're looking for -- as for an equivalent, it's an equivalent to a point source, right? Which is --"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2535.72,2536.0,Right.
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2536.0,2536.48,Okay.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2537.76,2538.16,Yes.
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2538.16,2542.04,"Well, what's the functional equivalent of a pipe when you're talking about groundwater?"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2542.04,2562.64,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case, when Petitioner was designing their wastewater treatment plant -- and I should mention in Miccosukee, this Court emphasized that applying NPDES permits to -- to wastewater -- municipal wastewater treatment plants is really what Congress was all about in enacting the law in 1972, when, I also might add, there was no Safe Drinking Water Act --"
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2562.64,2563.2,"Well, but that's --"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2563.2,2563.6,-- in 1972.
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2563.6,2564.2,-- that's a big wind-up.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2564.84,2565.12,Yes.
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2565.12,2568.08,-- what's the functional -- what's a functional equivalent?
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2568.08,2574.36,"The -- when they were planning this, they thought about doing ocean outfall and they said no, we can dispose of it just as well through injection wells."
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2594.4,2600.48,I know it's -- I understand it's not your -- but it sounds an awful lot like as vague as fairly traceable.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2608.76,2623.24,"It -- our -- that -- that -- I mean, that's why we suggest it as the test, that it would be traceable and so you would have causation in fact, and you would use principles of proximate cause, which this Court has embraced in other situations, like in the Endangered Species Act."
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2627.84,2633.44,"Don't worry, he'll have an opportunity, because you didn't make this phrase up. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2633.44,2637.44,And -- and it's a little bit -- and we do have -- we do discuss these things.
2019.18-260,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2639.6,2661.84,"I -- I was looking for something, which I'm not wedded to the one I said, but I'm looking for something that does give the EPA some leeway on this but doesn't go as far as what traceability and causation do, which seem to say the sky's the limit. And -- and that -- that's -- that's what I'm looking for."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2674.4,2681.88,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think ultimately the question before the Court, the question presented, is whether or not mere passage through a little bit of groundwater cuts off Clean Water Act liability."
2019.18-260,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2681.88,2682.32,On that --
2019.18-260,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2682.32,2688.96,"Mr. Henkin, could -- maybe I don't understand the science of this and perhaps like scientists can do everything."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2708.08,2708.24,Yeah.
2019.18-260,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2708.24,2710.28,-- could you say that as to a septic tank?
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2710.28,2714.0,"No, in -- in our view, Justice Kagan, you -- you normally could not."
2019.18-260,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2729.04,2729.44,So you couldn't say --
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2729.44,2730.48,-- and that's normally the situation.
2019.18-260,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2730.48,2732.84,-- whether it's from your house or your house or your house or your house.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2739.44,2740.0,Not at all.

2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,2802.56,2803.32,That's absolutely correct.

If you complied with that, if you -- if you maintain it properly, you have -- objectively, you have no reason to believe that it's polluting the ocean, and so you would not have any foreseeability, any obligation to get a permit.

And, if it was, how do you account for the fact that there isn't any direct reference to it in the definition of a conveyance or any of the other provisions that are directly relevant here?"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3168.84,3184.56,"Well, Justice Alito, there's no reference in any of the NPDES permitting program or the definition of a point source to regulating discharges via air, yet Petitioner concedes if the pipe is hanging over the water's edge, it can pass through air. The United States concedes --"
2019.18-260,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3184.56,3202.4,"I mean, do you think that that's really comparable, where you have a pipe that's over the river and the pollutant is coming out of the river and going through the air, that anybody's going to seriously argue that, well, because it went through the air, it wasn't covered? Do you really think that's comparable to groundwater that can travel a long distance?"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3202.4,3213.4,"Well, Justice Alito, I could imagine a situation in which you have a pipe hanging out over the water and it's trickling into the water, and there's a strong wind, and every once in a while the trickle gets batted upon the shore. So that's not covered because it's now on the shore."
2019.18-260,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3232.92,3234.08,"Well, I don't know about that."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3255.8,3259.68,"Well, a conveyance has to be confined in some way."
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3333.84,3341.88,"-- you tasted the punch and you said this tastes like whiskey, you'd say, where did that come from? You wouldn't point to -- you'd say it came from the whiskey bottle."
2019.18-260,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3358.48,3362.48,"Well, I didn't know Mr. Stewart was spiking punch. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-260,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3362.48,3369.92,"But would you say in his extent -- extend his example, that it came from a barrel in Scotland?"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3369.92,3372.16,"Well, let's say the whiskey was spoiled in some way."
2019.18-260,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3394.52,3417.08,"But -- but Congress knew about the ground -- groundwater issue and there were debates about this precise groundwater issue, maybe not this precise, but the groundwater issue, and there were proposals, as you're well aware, and some of the amicus briefs go through this at great length, to put in regulation of groundwater, and Congress rejected those. So how do we assess that in thinking about this?"
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3417.08,3426.72,"Well -- well, Justice Kavanaugh, those debates quite clearly resulted in a vote that said, we are not going to enact national standards to control the quality of groundwater."
2019.18-260,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3433.88,3437.8,So your point -- your point is that's a separate topic from the issue today?
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3437.8,3438.76,Absolutely.
2019.18-260,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3439.88,3439.96,Okay.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3439.96,3456.8,"-- they said we recognize the essential link between ground and surface waters and the artificial nature of any distinction. If Congress had wanted to say point source discharge that reaches the navigable waters through groundwater is exempt, because we want to leave that completely to the states, they would have said that in the language of the Act."
2019.18-260,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3478.04,3478.64,Why -- why are the --
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3478.64,3479.88,-- particularly for --
2019.18-260,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3479.88,3480.72,I'm sorry.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3489.76,3498.0,"Well, I think the question, Justice Kavanaugh, is whether Congress intended to establish uniform --"
2019.18-260,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3498.0,3499.84,"No, I -- I understand your legal argument."
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3514.2,3515.36,Please.
2019.18-260,2,63180,david_l_henkin,,3515.36,3523.72,"Well, there are examples in the EPA official's brief in which delegated states are regulating those sources of pollution by using the NPDES permit program."
2019.18-260,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3542.52,3544.88,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lin, three minutes."
2019.18-260,3,63179,elbert_lin,,3544.88,3556.6,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd just like to pick up where my friend left off, which is with the example of the Colorado DEQ and the footnote in Maryland's brief."
2019.18-260,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3583.88,3591.4,Why are you doing what you're doing? This is fairly traceable to you in large quantities.
2019.18-260,3,63179,elbert_lin,,3598.04,3600.48,"Your Honor, there are a number, starting with the --"
2019.18-260,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3600.48,3606.84,"No, no, you're doing it, what's stopping you from? This is not."
2019.18-260,3,63179,elbert_lin,,3615.4,3618.6,"Your Honor, I don't think this is a question of --"
2019.18-260,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3618.6,3620.2,"Not you, but I mean the --"
2019.18-260,3,63179,elbert_lin,,3620.2,3620.64,"Of course, Your Honor."
2019.18-260,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3621.52,3622.32,-- I mean the -- the polluters.
2019.18-260,3,63179,elbert_lin,,3626.12,3633.2,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I think, if I can take issue with the -- the -- the premise there, which is that there's something that's being gotten away with here, the --"
2019.18-260,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3633.2,3633.92,If they followed --
2019.18-260,3,63179,elbert_lin,,3633.92,3635.12,-- these wells were --
2019.18-260,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3635.12,3640.12,"-- all the laws, and they still are polluting, they're getting away with it."
2019.18-260,3,63179,elbert_lin,,3643.92,3644.28,Your --
2019.18-260,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3644.28,3652.28,The preventive measures of this law were not followed and something failed.
2019.18-260,3,63179,elbert_lin,,3652.28,3716.84,"Your Honor, the -- the whole -- even under NPDES permits, point source discharges can include pollutants that are below effluent limits. So I think the -- the mere fact that there are -- are nutrients that are getting into the ocean doesn't mean that the system has failed. And I think it comes back to the fact that, in this particular circumstance, these wells were constructed with encouragement and funding from EPA as a more environmentally protective solution than simply constructing an outfall pipe to the ocean. If I can come back to the traceability point, I think it's also important to note, my friend runs very far away from the septic tank examples, and, Justice Kagan, to answer your question about traceability, there are 7,000 cesspools within 750 feet of the ocean in Hawaii, and we cite to a study in our reply brief that showed that through a tracer, dye tracer study, not dissimilar from what was used here, it was established that pollutants from individual septic tanks were getting to the ocean within three hours to five days. So traceability can be done."
2019.18-260,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3732.6,3733.96,Why don't you finish your thought.
2019.18-260,3,63179,elbert_lin,,3733.96,3735.92,-- you -- you had suggested functional equivalents.
2019.18-260,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3754.52,3755.4,"Thank you, counsel."
