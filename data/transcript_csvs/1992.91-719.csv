1992.91-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.71,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-719, Al C. Parke v. Ricky Harold Raley."
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,39.899,41.601,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,133.454,144.644,"Well, Mr. Sonego, the Kentucky Supreme Court allows a defendant to make some sort of challenge to the validity of a prior conviction under this statute, doesn't it?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,144.644,146.193,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.585,175.033,"So you don't think it was just interpreting Kentucky's, the Kentucky recidivous statute when it said that you can make that sort of challenge?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,175.033,185.91,"No, Your Honor, the Commonwealth contends that the Kentucky Supreme Court was viewing itself compelled by decisions of this Court."
1992.91-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.533,217.261,"So the Commonwealth wants something more favorable to it from this Court than they've got even from the Supreme Court of Kentucky, say nothing of the Sixth Circuit?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,217.261,221.834,"Well, Your Honor, of course this Court could reverse on much narrower grounds."
1992.91-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.484,237.195,As the Supreme Court of Kentucky did.
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,237.195,238.447,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,245.121,254.498,"I wonder if there isn't even a more narrow ground than that, because is it not true that the proceeding that we're involved in is a collateral attack on the 1987 conviction?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,254.498,259.581,--It was a habeas corpus proceeding.
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,263.545,273.592,"So the question in this case is whether the procedure followed in Kentucky satisfies due process sufficiently to defeat a collateral attack on the 1987 conviction, isn't that correct?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,273.592,275.632,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,314.319,318.742,In fact I'm not sure it is even a collateral attack on the '81 conviction.
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,334.764,356.29,"Well, Your Honor, I would be, I would have to agree with you that there should only be one collateral attack, but clearly you are correct in saying that this collateral attack was brought because of the persistent felony offender conviction, not because of the 1981 conviction."
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,366.198,385.992,"Could a state say that, introduce in the record evidence of a conviction is conclusive proof that the person was indeed convicted of the crime for purposes of the persistent felony offender statute?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,385.992,392.597,"Yes, Your Honor, the Kentucky Supreme Court has said that the judgment is sufficient to satisfy the statute--"
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,392.597,396.2,"Well, not... can it be conclusive evidence?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,396.2,404.007,"--Yes, Your Honor, it could be conclusive evidence if--"
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.007,408.95,Could a state provide that the record conviction itself suffices?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,408.95,425.23,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think the state could provide that by following the analogy of Lewis v. United States in taking the position that a collateral challenge would have to precede the subsequent charge."
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,425.23,440.972,So that the status of being a person with a record conviction is all that's needed from a constitutional standpoint to suffice for your being convicted under a statute like the PFO statute in Kentucky?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,440.972,443.623,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,460.845,467.207,Does the same answer apply if there is a separate offense for being a PFO?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,473.663,476.124,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that should make a difference."
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.376,508.016,Would your answer be the same if all parties conceded that the prior conviction was obtained through an unknowing plea?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,508.016,516.082,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it would."
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,519.225,521.607,"What about an uncounseled plea, there is no counsel present?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,521.607,530.593,"--Your Honor, I would have to, I would have to say that the precedents of this Court establish that a defendant may attack an uncounseled guilty plea."
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,530.593,531.104,"Well, why?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,533.415,548.104,"The difference is, Your Honor, the defendant presumably has had the advice of counsel and therefore certainly had an opportunity to discuss with counsel the events leading to the guilty plea."
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,548.104,555.297,Does the difference depend upon the fundamentality or the gravity of the constitutional violation?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,555.297,563.394,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that is an important point to make because the Court has clearly stated the right to counsel is fundamental."
1992.91-719,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,567.808,579.655,"Well, under the hypothesis we're assuming that the guilty plea was uninformed, it was a completely uninformed waiver."
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,585.409,597.327,"Your Honor, I think the difference is the court has assumed that where counsel is not provided it is more likely an innocent man would plead guilty than otherwise."
1992.91-719,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,655.474,660.308,"What's the relevant historical tradition here, do you think?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,660.308,691.077,"Your Honor, the history of the precedents of the Court have directed that the denial of counsel is a fundamental right permitting a collateral attack on a guilty plea, and have also indicated that an involuntary guilty plea may be collaterally attacked."
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,792.145,798.22,May I ask a question about the nature of the burden you think the petitioner would have?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,818.044,832.934,"Yes, Your Honor, that could shift the burden of proof to the prosecution, bearing in mind this Court said in Marshall v. Lonberger that the defendant must convince the trial court of the credibility of his testimony, or whatever witnesses."
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,874.254,882.622,"But then what if the only other documentary evidence is that there was no transcript prepared, even though say normally they do prepare a transcript but in his case they didn't?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,885.813,899.652,"Well, Your Honor, he certainly could present other witnesses such as his former attorney, the former judges, bystanders, Kentucky allows a bystander bill."
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.838,930.805,What is the practice in Kentucky about making a transcript of plea hearings?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,930.805,936.02,"I understand the normal practice, Your Honor, has been only if an appeal was taken."
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.02,936.781,I see.
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,936.781,941.213,"The judge could order it, but otherwise it wouldn't be made."
1992.91-719,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,941.213,962.767,"Mr. Sonego, when you concede that at least a certain quantity of evidence would be sufficient to shift the burden to the state, do you mean that it would be enough to shift the burden of proof or just that it would be enough to shift the burden of going forward in the sense that if there's a prima facie case made and the state does nothing the state presumably is going to lose if the judge accepts the evidence as it appears?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,967.362,981.05,"Well, Your Honor, in this case the Commonwealth is arguing under Johnson v. Zerbst it should be the burden of proof, but certainly the opinion of the Kentucky Supreme Court seemed to indicate it's simply the burden of producing the evidence."
1992.91-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.794,999.422,"Mr. Sonego, I, my understanding is that you did not raise below the contention that the entire issue could not be raised on habeas."
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,999.422,1002.925,"The matter of the Boykin warning, Your Honor?"
1992.91-719,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1002.925,1003.155,That's right.
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1003.155,1019.157,"Well, Your Honor, the Commonwealth's position is that that was inherent in our argument that Dunn v. Simmons was wrongly decided and is inherent in the issue of which side must bear the burden of proof, because the question becomes how is that burden of proof to be satisfied."
1992.91-719,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.477,1050.787,Did you make the argument below in the court of appeals that for purposes of Federal habeas corpus this kind of a claim was not entertainable?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1050.787,1056.163,"--No, Your Honor, that was not a precise argument caption."
1992.91-719,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.044,1060.987,So you're making an argument here that wasn't made in the court of appeals?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1060.987,1071.463,"--Yes, in one sense, Your Honor, but we're contending that it was subsumed within the other arguments presented, the argument that Dunn v. Simmons was wrongly decided."
1992.91-719,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.463,1073.336,How was it subsumed?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1074.097,1080.841,"We contended that the Sixth Circuit's opinion in Dunn v. Simmons was in error, which placed the burden of proof on the Commonwealth."
1992.91-719,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1080.841,1082.604,You mean the state court was in error?
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1082.604,1086.788,The Sixth Circuit's opinion in Dunn v. Simmons.
1992.91-719,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.788,1086.948,Yes.
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1086.948,1095.474,And by asking the Sixth Circuit to reexamine that ruling we contend that they also had to reexamine whether it fared around a Boykin warning.
1992.91-719,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.474,1096.375,I see.
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1096.375,1103.738,More recently in the McLaughlin case the Sixth Circuit seems to have indicated a Boykin warning is not an essential component of a guilty plea.
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.738,1107.02,"May I ask one further, just a practical question?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1120.49,1134.73,"I believe the Chief Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court has directed the stenographers to try to save their notes for 5 years, but there is no further evidence in this case."
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.73,1138.663,"--And they don't regularly make sound transcripts of these hearings, do they?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1138.663,1143.107,"Your Honor, I believe that some court reporters do and some don't."
1992.91-719,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.107,1144.549,"That's up to the court reporter, in other words?"
1992.91-719,0,28684,ian_g_sonego,,1144.549,1146.44,"Yes, Your Honor, that's my understanding."
1992.91-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1149.07,1150.342,"Very well, Mr. Sonego."
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1152.613,1160.77,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.772,1241.119,"May I just ask, because I want to be sure I understand you correctly, you say as a matter of Kentucky law the fact of conviction is the critical thing."
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1246.344,1250.718,It does have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt under Kentucky law and it is proven to the jury.
1992.91-719,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.878,1328.882,"Mr. Manning, do some states characterize their recidivous statutes as being separate offenses as opposed to sentencing enhancing, and if they do are they then required to prove the prior offenses beyond a reasonable doubt or is your answer still the same?"
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1328.882,1342.753,It depends on how they... I mean under this Court's cases such as Martin v. Ohio and Patterson v. New York the answer is that it doesn't really matter whether they treat them as offenses as such or as sentencing factors under state laws.
1992.91-719,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1399.853,1404.137,"And is the rule the same if the conviction is uncounseled, if there is no compliance with Gideon?"
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1404.137,1405.429,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.91-719,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.647,1429.77,Is there anything else that's on that plane?
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1429.77,1454.645,"Well, we would suggest that the kind of error would have to be a fundamental structural error such as perhaps the adjudication of the case before a kangaroo court or the adjudication of the case before a biased judge, something that went to the very legitimacy of the process and not merely cause one to doubt the reliability of the conviction, but the very legitimacy of the proceeding from which it was rendered."
1992.91-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.504,1478.721,What about a case in which the defendant had a lawyer but did not speak English and the lawyer didn't speak anything but English and the judge didn't speak anything but English.
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1481.004,1496.553,"Your Honor, that... your question essentially is the same as asking whether a defendant can raise a voluntariness claim in general in the context of a collateral attack in a sentence enhancement proceeding, and our answer to that would be no."
1992.91-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.313,1512.864,But in the hypothetical I gave you if the lawyer wasn't there he could--
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1512.864,1514.905,I'm sorry?
1992.91-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.905,1518.528,--In the hypothetical I gave you the presence of the lawyer would make the difference?
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1518.528,1525.763,"The presence... presumably the lawyer... yes, if the defendant has a lawyer then the courts--"
1992.91-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.763,1527.945,Even if the defendant can't communicate with the lawyer?
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1527.945,1531.047,"--Well, the lawyer presumably will get an interpreter, Your Honor."
1992.91-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.047,1532.436,"Well, I'm assuming he didn't in the case."
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1534.85,1539.752,"Your Honor, with respect, it's always possible to come up with very--"
1992.91-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1539.752,1542.975,"I understand, but your position is right to counsel and that's it?"
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1542.975,1543.986,"--Well, the court--"
1992.91-719,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1543.986,1545.558,"Or don't, or no jurisdiction."
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1545.558,1550.433,"--Right to counsel and fundamental structural errors that would be equivalent, and we frankly think there are very few."
1992.91-719,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1565.733,1574.569,But what about a plea where all admit that the plea was entered unknowingly and without knowledge of any rights?
1992.91-719,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1574.569,1584.586,"Again, Your Honor, that would be the same question as Justice Stevens asked, which is whether a state must allow the defendant to raise such a claim."
1992.91-719,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1655.875,1659.708,"Thank you, Mr. Manning."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,1662.48,1672.668,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-719,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.29,1708.783,"You're talking about what, Jefferson County?"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,1708.783,1713.126,"That's Jefferson County, Kentucky, where this plea was taken."
1992.91-719,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1771.943,1773.735,They have an hour and a half for lunch?
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,1773.735,1775.726,They have an hour and a half.
1992.91-719,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1775.726,1777.088,That's more than we do.
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,1777.088,1779.491,They usually get an hour if they go up until 12 o'clock.
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.909,1855.474,"Of course he might lie about that just as he would lie about his guilty plea, right?"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,1855.474,1856.863,A defendant may lie--
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.863,1859.815,"I mean, just to move things along, as you say."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,1859.815,1872.595,"--Many times people will enter into a plea of guilty for many different reasons, but the important point here is that on the record he has acknowledged that he is giving up certain rights."
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.595,1887.054,"You're painting this as a right somehow so fundamental that it requires the permission of collateral attack in a subsequent proceeding, and I fail to see that it's that fundamental."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,1912.134,1923.009,"We are collaterally attacking the 1987 conviction, which is an attack at the procedure used by the State of Kentucky."
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.706,1940.762,"Wherein you say their procedure is bad is that it does not permit a collateral attack on the earlier conviction, right?"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,1943.466,1945.347,"That, the way... yes."
1992.91-719,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1977.56,1986.135,So you think a Boykin violation is on the same level as the violation of the failure to furnish counsel at all?
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,1986.135,1990.078,As far as... yes.
1992.91-719,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2001.9,2014.847,"In other words you're saying it is enough simply to prove, on collateral attack now, it is enough simply to prove that he didn't get the warnings from the judge himself?"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2024.665,2027.757,That is exactly what this Court said in Boykin v. Alabama.
1992.91-719,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2027.757,2030.01,"Well, Boykin, was Boykin a collateral attack?"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2030.01,2032.361,Boykin was not a collateral attack.
1992.91-719,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2032.361,2032.531,Okay.
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2038.275,2060.688,"Boykin did not address the collateral attack and the rights that were being given up in Boykin were fundamental constitutional rights, which is the same thing that is taking place when you enter to a guilty plea and if you waive your right to counsel."
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2062.811,2081.384,"Well, Mr. Clare, now this, the defendant after this 1987 conviction could have challenged in a direct appeal any claim that he might have that he didn't waive his constitutional rights, could he not?"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2081.384,2085.237,"He challenged his, procedurally--"
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2085.237,2088.449,"That was open to him on direct appeal, to challenge?"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2088.449,2094.264,--On direct appeal he went straight from the circuit court on his motion to suppress the entry of the convictions to the court of appeals--
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2094.264,2099.579,"No, I'm talking about the earlier conviction itself when it was handed down."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2099.579,2102.32,--The '87 conviction?
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2102.32,2102.51,Yes.
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2112.366,2112.957,Correct--
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2112.957,2116.87,And Kentucky relied on two earlier convictions.
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2116.87,2117.812,--That's correct.
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2117.812,2128.801,"Now, on both earlier convictions is it not true that the defendant could have challenged on direct appeal whatever claim he had at that time--"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2128.801,2129.763,"Yes, he could have."
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2129.763,2130.561,--that he didn't understand his rights.
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2130.561,2130.741,Yes.
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2130.741,2131.452,But he didn't do that.
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2131.452,2132.373,He didn't do that.
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2132.373,2146.415,"And yet you say that now, later, when he is charged with some consequence of those final convictions that now he can still make that kind of a challenge."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2146.995,2152.282,My position is that this is not now a collateral attack of those convictions.
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2153.343,2164.321,"Well, your position is that now, after they have become final, that he can nevertheless reopen the validity of those convictions."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2164.321,2175.058,--My position is that now they are final and the State of Kentucky wants to use them to prove the present crime of being a persistent felony offender.
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2183.473,2193.331,You're saying that the Constitution requires Kentucky to require more than just putting into evidence those convictions?
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2193.331,2194.473,--That's correct.
1992.91-719,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2199.905,2206.45,But don't the vast majority of states just allow proof of former conviction?
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2206.45,2221.392,"--Once the defendant alleged that they were not constitutionally valid and there is not a silent record, the presumption is then in the defendant's favor that he did not waive his constitutional rights, and there is no record there to prove that he did."
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.392,2223.552,"Why, who cares?"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2260.607,2264.579,The State of Kentucky states it is a conviction.
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.317,2290.566,"I doubt whether the legislature meant the all prior convictions to be retried every time, which is the only way you can know for sure that it was a valid conviction, is to retry it."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2304.284,2305.666,I'm attacking its use.
1992.91-719,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2305.666,2307.666,You're not attacking the conviction as such?
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2307.666,2308.818,I'm not attacking the conviction at all.
1992.91-719,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2308.818,2310.809,Isn't that a significant distinction?
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2310.809,2314.082,That is the distinction that I've been trying to establish here.
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.908,2326.36,"It can't be used because it's invalid, isn't that what you're saying?"
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2328.293,2329.532,--That's correct.
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.532,2334.618,"The time to show that it was invalid was the time it was received, by appealing it and getting it set aside."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2363.478,2364.848,That was a long--
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.848,2369.142,I wanted to be sure I wasn't leaving anything out.
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2369.142,2382.931,--The state in the sentencing phases can establish any elements that it wants as long as they are within parameters in order to enhance the defendant's sentence.
1992.91-719,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2433.795,2459.343,"I suppose in one sense, under your theory of the case at least, you would still have an argument for the defendant even if we said Boykin is a prophylactic rule, it cannot be alleged on collateral attacks, Stone v. Powell applies."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2484.138,2489.831,I don't believe I understood that.
1992.91-719,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2489.831,2500.149,"Well, in other words you argue in a case that comes up that's like this, even if we had said that Boykin is not available on collateral attack you'd say well, that's irrelevant."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2506.143,2506.964,That's correct.
1992.91-719,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2506.964,2512.878,"So in that sense, although Boykin helps you it is not essential to your case."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2512.878,2519.883,"I'm asserting that this is not a collateral, that this is not a collateral attack of those prior convictions."
1992.91-719,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2538.025,2566.154,"But if that is so it seems to me that you have to answer the arguments made by Kentucky and by the Solicitor General and indicated, rephrased by Justice Scalia, that the gravamen of the offense here is being convicted of a third offense when you have the status of being convicted of two earlier ones, whether or not those convictions were valid."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2566.154,2593.402,"My response is the same as with Justice Scalia, was that by using the word convict in the statute that the legislature placed in there or assumed, although we cannot assume what they meant because they have to state exactly, but they used the word to convict, and that it would not have been an assumption to use an invalid conviction or a constitutionally invalid conviction."
1992.91-719,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.402,2601.52,"Well, I would have no problem if the, you know, the Kentucky Supreme Court decided the case on that basis, that when our legislature said convict it meant validly convict."
1992.91-719,2,29571,j_gregory_clare,,2629.3,2631.343,That is... yes.
1992.91-719,3,28684,ian_g_sonego,,3234.787,3236.189,"Thank you, sir."
1992.91-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3254.492,3260.144,"Can you give us one case for that proposition, Mr. Sonego?"
1992.91-719,3,28684,ian_g_sonego,,3260.144,3261.884,"The Kentucky Supreme Court case, Your Honor?"
