1967.742,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,49.113,"Number 742, Maryland et al., appellants versus W. Willard Wirtz, Secretary of Labor."
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,55.112,58.582,Thank you sir.
1967.742,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,58.582,61.422,"Mr. Wilner, you may proceed with your argument."
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,61.422,62.54,Thank you.
1967.742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,920.634,931.132,You mean this -- you mean this is on the assumption that the states are not paying the minimum or not paying overtime -- this is what the actual cost of the --
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,931.132,941.976,This is -- let me clear this up now Mr. Justice White in contrast to the impression sought to be conveyed of the amicus briefs of the unions.
1967.742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.369,952.47,This is just an overtime?
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,952.47,954.555,This is primarily overtime.
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1043.654,1049.017,"Was an amendment to take care of that submitted to the Congress, considered by the Congress?"
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1049.017,1050.621,To take care of what sir?
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1050.621,1056.087,The problem of the overtime provisions is applicable to this situation?
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1056.087,1056.815,No.
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1137.742,1142.002,So you're not arguing that the burden per se --
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1142.002,1143.126,Yes.
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1143.126,1146.059,"-- affects constitutional question, are you?"
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1146.059,1147.226,"No, I'm not."
1967.742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.257,1164.524,Was the matter of information -- it didn't -- the law does not cover all school employees for example?
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1164.524,1165.164,Yes sir.
1967.742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.164,1166.637,Or hospital employee?
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1166.637,1167.177,No sir.
1967.742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.323,1171.107,"It excludes teachers, doctors and supposedly what?"
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1171.107,1173.985,It excluded professional and administrative people.
1967.742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.438,1198.39,"And I suppose your argument is if the government can reach these, they can reach all the others that they've excluded?"
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1198.39,1199.099,Yes sir.
1967.742,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1208.652,1210.168,The government --
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1210.168,1213.034,The governor's office by things in commerce too.
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1311.709,1322.86,"Well, is your complaint be the same if the Congress had merely said that they have to pay state hospital employees a dollar an hour?"
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1328.065,1337.151,I think that we would still be here because there is a very serious question as to whether this is even commerce in the sense of the Constitution.
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1338.051,1354.475,"How about the second point -- suppose that it is commerce, would you be here arguing your second point that is to say that the regulation would be an unconstitutional interference with state functions?"
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1354.475,1365.295,"I think that it would, but I must confess Mr. Justice Fortas that it maybe less so, but I think it still presents a very serious constitutional question."
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1365.295,1407.695,This is really as far as I'm concerned at the moment of the essence that to say whether you concede in effect that the federal government has power assuming the commerce point now so you could concede that the federal government has power or arguing here it exercise that power in a way so destructive as to constitute an infringement of state's rights under the Constitution or whether on the other hand you're arguing that the federal government does not have power to fix minimum wages etcetera for employees of state hospitals etcetera?
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1407.695,1414.747,My argument is this that you have to look at what the act in question does.
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1476.275,1488.226,I would like you to do -- are you saying that the hospital workers engage in what used to be called a purely governmental function.
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1489.52,1489.978,No sir.
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1490.386,1512.584,What you're saying is -- are you then saying that the impact of these particular regulations on otherwise regulable state function is so severe as to make the federal activity an unconstitutional invasion of the state -- state rights.
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1512.584,1517.448,"Well, I would accept that, but I would like to paraphrase it if I may."
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1517.448,1518.048,I wish you would.
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1518.048,1535.305,"I think that -- what we're talking about here is not whether the Congress can regulate state hospitals or state schools, but simply whether the regulation doesn't go beyond that and more substantially affect state government in itself --"
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1535.305,1536.103,But why?
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1537.445,1554.97,"Well, because in this instance with respect to this particular act, it does a way entirely with the concept of state legislatures determining what taxes to levy, where to appropriate the money, what the scope -- is going to be."
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1554.97,1557.067,Because the impact is so heavy?
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1557.067,1566.886,"Not just because of the financial impact, but simply, it doesn't matter whether it increase the total cost, $100 million or $10,000."
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1580.171,1590.226,"But if you applied the wage now regulations people engaged in the bottling of water, I think that's bottling of spring water state enterprise."
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1590.226,1591.115,That was taxed.
1967.742,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1591.49,1593.033,"Well, whether it's tax or not."
1967.742,0,17241,alan_m_wilner,,1609.118,1613.145,"Well, I think it's the quantitative and qualitative Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1874.87,1878.641,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.742,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1894.439,1898.683,"How did you device, back and forth?[Laughter]"
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1898.683,1909.125,I think Mr. Justice Douglas that I must brainwashed my students to find the statute unconstitutional.
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2069.771,2080.726,"Are you arguing -- Professor Wright, are you arguing that the wage and hour act cannot apply to husbands?"
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2083.386,2083.542,Yes sir.
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2083.542,2086.257,-- because of the limitations of the Commerce Clause?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2086.257,2087.079,That is precisely --
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2087.079,2088.228,That is your position?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2088.228,2088.866,Yes.
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2088.866,2090.978,How about retail stores?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2090.978,2093.801,Of course it is going to apply the retail stores.
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2093.801,2104.107,"Well, how about laboratories, medical laboratories?"
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2104.107,2119.732,"Well, it seem to me that the test would depend on whether or not we have an entity that is charging people for what it is doing and that therefore the wages and hours that it pays its employees will have an effect on the price that the customer ultimately pays."
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2119.732,2130.831,Is that the -- I thought you're arguing generally that hospitals are outside the reach of the Commerce Clause whether the people pay for it or not?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2130.831,2133.651,I'm arguing that state hospitals are outside the Commerce Clause.
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2133.651,2135.881,Only state hospitals and that's what I was asking.
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2135.881,2137.671,"I'm sorry, I misunderstood the question."
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2137.671,2146.85,"Now, will you tell me what the distinction is that you make with respect to the Commerce Clause between state hospitals and private hospitals?"
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2146.85,2155.279,"The fact that in one -- the patient is paying and then the other as a practical matter, he is not."
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2155.279,2156.972,What do you mean as a practical matter?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2160.219,2184.096,"The stipulation and the facts between Texas and the United States show that in the year involved of 2900 patients in our tuberculosis hospitals, only nine paid any fee, that in Baylor County Hospital, 94% of patients paid nothing whatever that in our state schools between 5% and 10% of the parents may pay the nominal charge that we assert."
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2184.096,2194.061,"And so you say that because -- well, let's assume that nobody pays, you say that has an effect on commerce clause?"
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2194.971,2195.804,I would not want to say Mr. Justice --
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2195.804,2196.9,-- any case on that?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2198.433,2200.924,No.
1967.742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.256,2416.082,"If you would be making the same argument that this law covered teachers, would you?"
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2416.082,2421.694,We're going to keep the public schools running Mr. Justice White regardless of strikes.
1967.742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.694,2424.104,Some of the places haven't manages to --
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2424.104,2426.244,"For temporary periods, they haven't manage to --"
1967.742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.244,2431.796,Is there a law against -- it works out about public employees in Texas?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2431.796,2434.204,I do not know.
1967.742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2434.204,2436.548,Is that relevant?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2436.548,2442.149,I would not think so -- I would not think it reaches the constitutional question.
1967.742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.929,2543.821,[Inaudible] to demonstrate some congressional power over the wages of a manufacturing company for example that engages in interstate commerce?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2543.821,2559.028,"I suggest sir that the impact there is an extremely close one, that the possibility of destructive competition is present unless the Congress can regulate the wages for manufacturing institutions."
1967.742,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2567.007,2572.092,You don't think work stoppages are particularly relevant to the question?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2572.092,2593.994,"I would think that a work stoppage at the Jones & Laughlin plant of course has a tremendous impact on the state commerce as the Court held in 301 U.S., but I do not think that a work stoppage that the University of Texas law school is going to have any impact or whatever on interstate commerce."
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2740.878,2759.403,"If I understand you Professor Wright, if you have a hospital that is under the private management, that hospital would be in the reach of the Commerce Clause, but under state ownership, state operation, it is not."
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2766.479,2769.071,My position is not quite that.
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2769.761,2771.052,That's what I'm trying to get at --
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2771.052,2772.556,If I will retain my --
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2772.556,2774.41,-- if that's what you said?
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2774.41,2781.988,"I were retained by a private hospital, I think perhaps I could make an argument but I could not make the argument that I can make when I appear here on behalf of the State of Texas."
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2781.988,2784.616,That doesn't help me very much.
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2830.221,2844.01,I think my position maybe precisely stated in this fashion that I am arguing that a public hospital in which very few patients are charged is beyond the reach of the commerce power.
1967.742,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2848.736,2853.336,Let's stop right there if you will and take that exact hospital.
1967.742,1,20273,charles_alan_wright,,2888.515,2901.209,"Well, I -- if I am to take a position for purposes of this case only will be that the private hospital that charges $50.00 a day would be subject to regulation."
1967.742,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3064.688,3068.033,May it please the Court.
1967.742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4303.976,4317.929,"Well, it that's the measure of the federal power then I don't suppose you ever exceeded in setting minimum wages for state employees."
1967.742,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4325.348,4331.876,Someone may have to argue that someday before --
1967.742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4331.876,4338.384,The principle that you are stating would certainly be -- that were sustained would be a good thing --
1967.742,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4338.384,4366.207,"If there is no qualification whatever, it would seem to go that far and if Congress should which currently I suppose is unlikely to pass a statute regulating minimum wages and overtime for employees of state legislatures or of the state courts, it would be possible it seems to me to defend it."
1967.742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4369.83,4375.151,Or set the prices for the tuitions for state schools?
1967.742,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4375.151,4376.157,Yes.
1967.742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4376.157,4376.87,Prices.
1967.742,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4376.87,4385.529,We've gone virtually as far as that under the war power which is perhaps a somewhat different matter but --
1967.742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4385.529,4392.347,But I want to ask you the last one whether they could license the state government?[Laughter]
1967.742,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4392.347,4397.811,I have no doubt that they license the state government for some activities.
1967.742,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4408.403,4410.843,But the governors don't have a federal certificate in their office?
1967.742,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4410.843,4411.425,No.
1967.742,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4863.408,4864.494,Professor Wright.
1967.742,3,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4864.494,4868.134,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.742,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4956.386,4984.832,"Well, then it must be your position Professor Wright that the wages paid to people per se will not affect interstate commerce and now let's suppose you had a monopoly, pure monopoly to then compete with anybody, just assume that with me if you will, and it's general activities are such to bring it within the interstate commerce category but that doesn't compete with anybody."
1967.742,3,20273,charles_alan_wright,,4998.606,5000.843,No sir.
1967.742,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5113.649,5116.594,That is [Inaudible]
1967.742,3,20273,charles_alan_wright,,5116.594,5124.758,Yes and in my judgment Mr. Justice White the two arguments fit together.
