1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,19.786,25.139,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1958.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,133.257,141.778,"When was the relation to these cases that we have just heard, that the Board hold that they had no jurisdiction?"
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,142.434,143.77,We -- we --
1958.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,143.77,145.037,-- after they started?
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,145.037,148.458,It was shortly after the case has started.
1958.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,152.858,160.618,The first -- is that the first time the -- they had ever ruled on -- on that definitively?
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,160.618,162.801,"In -- in our case, no."
1958.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,170.107,170.63,What year was that?
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,170.63,172.456,That was 1952.
1958.21,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,176.658,187.996,I understood counsel in the other case to say that this union had consistently refused to admit the -- that the Board had jurisdiction.
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,187.996,191.352,It is true that this union has on occasion.
1958.21,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,244.895,251.742,"After the 1952 case, the Board has consistently refused to take any, hasn't it?"
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,252.171,252.553,That's --
1958.21,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,252.553,254.485,-- discontinued the ad hoc practice?
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,254.485,255.421,That's correct.
1958.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,262.659,264.915,Here in the District of Columbia?
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,264.915,268.679,Since 1952 --
1958.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.679,269.001,"Well, it's --"
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,269.001,270.537,"Yes, in the District of Columbia."
1958.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.042,276.239,"Well, it's not --"
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,276.239,277.562,But I think there have been some cases --
1958.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.562,277.823,But --
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,277.823,278.439,-- in the District of Columbia.
1958.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,278.439,279.35,-- it's true that --
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,279.35,279.384,But they --
1958.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,279.384,283.893,"-- that they exercised their discretion for a while, at least, not to take them --"
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,283.893,284.095,In --
1958.21,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.095,288.791,-- elsewhere than in the District of Columbia and in one of the positions (Voice Overlap) --
1958.21,0,28949,j_w_brown,,288.791,289.552,That is correct.
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1637.702,1640.237,May it please the Court.
1958.21,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1789.293,1794.24,"Well, some of them went with the opposite, the employees case, didn't they?"
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1794.24,1802.526,"Well, the only one that went out, Your Honor, was the -- was the standard relating to unions when they were acting as ""employers."""
1958.21,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1878.355,1893.318,"You're -- you're making me feel that the concurring dissented opinion under that with four of us is quite redundant, and all of a sudden, they're confederates of majority."
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1893.318,1894.477,"No, Your Honor."
1958.21,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1929.02,1950.707,"I think -- I think we restricted, if I understood you, the Court's decision to the specific situation before the Court, namely (Inaudible) and they would also -- unions present the employers but this flavor of majority, this have to very different (Inaudible) of this redundancy, wasn't it?"
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1950.707,1951.535,I think so.
1958.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1954.583,1957.482,You don't go by a flavor.[Laughter]
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1957.482,1958.176,"I'm sorry, sir."
1958.21,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1959.376,1962.514,"Well, you don't go by the flavor.[Laughter]"
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1962.514,1965.486,"Well, sometimes it may be important in tasting food."
1958.21,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1965.486,1969.268,You might as having flavor in this Court.
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1969.268,1969.369,The Court --
1958.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1969.369,1970.781,"Mr. Manoli, may I ask --"
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1970.781,1971.75,"Certainly, sir."
1958.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1971.75,1979.185,-- the administrative criteria would exclude how much of this industry if otherwise you want to handle hotel cases?
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1979.185,1980.279,The administrative criteria?
1958.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1980.279,1980.601,Yes.
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1984.44,1985.613,It excludes all of them.
1958.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1985.613,1985.916,"No, no."
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1989.45,1989.846,Yes.
1958.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1989.846,1994.495,"-- they would still be applied to individual hotels, your administrative criteria."
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,1994.495,1996.583,We don't have one that applies to hotels.
1958.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2002.868,2010.346,"Well, may I ask, aren't none of -- aren't none of the current criteria adaptable for application to a hotel?"
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,2010.346,2018.28,"Well, possibly we could use the one say dealing with -- with office buildings where the standard is 200,000."
1958.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2025.485,2025.991,Yes.
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,2025.991,2027.334,-- I'll give you those.
1958.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2048.65,2051.02,Something like 1200 hotels.
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,2051.02,2052.107,"That's correct, sir."
1958.21,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2053.103,2060.525,So we can also assume that this could not be a stupendous burden for the Board in its financial or personal -- or personal resources?
1958.21,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,2060.525,2062.84,"It may not -- it may not be, Your Honor."
1958.21,2,28949,j_w_brown,,3506.019,3507.245,"No, they were debates."
1958.21,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3571.81,3577.673,I just want to -- wouldn't it satisfy you that (Inaudible) the facts of the Board to give a more rational --
1958.21,3,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,3577.673,3579.587,"No, that wouldn't satisfy me, Your Honor."
1958.21,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3652.382,3661.033,"Mr. Brown, did the American Hotel Association or any organized hotel group join forces with you in the St. Louis case?"
1958.21,3,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,3661.033,3666.099,The American Hotel Association took the same position that we did in the -- in the St. Louis case.
1958.21,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3678.306,3683.783,"I gather since they filed the brief amicus here, that you pointed the company in --"
1958.21,4,28949,j_w_brown,,3683.783,3686.701,We've referred to company at least as far this Court is concerned.
