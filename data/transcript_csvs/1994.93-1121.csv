1994.93-1121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.218,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-1121, Ed Plaut v. The Spendthrift Farm, Inc.--"
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,22.536,25.828,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,59.171,63.054,You say... you say a final judgment.
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,75.212,81.707,"--Your Honor, I am referring to a final judgment in a case that is still within the appellate process."
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.249,103.36,Which are you calling which?
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,106.903,109.286,I'm saying that a case becomes final at that point.
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,109.286,109.946,Okay.
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,109.946,122.735,"Up until that point, the case is pending, although a final judgment may have been entered in that case, final in the sense that the court has issued its result in the particular dispute."
1994.93-1121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.108,177.461,If Congress intended the law to be retrospectively applied.
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,177.461,180.764,"Well, I think that that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1121,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.198,224.805,Has this Court ever upheld a legislative invalidation of final judgments of an Article III court?
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,224.805,228.018,I think that it has.
1994.93-1121,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,235.972,257.377,"Well, but in Sioux Nation it involved the Government and the opinion of this Court at least said Congress did not interfere with the finality of the court of claims judgments and went on to justify it on the theory that a new action had been created, so how does that support your position?"
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,257.377,268.175,"Well, actually, I think... I agree that the holding in United States v. Sioux Nation does not directly address the question that's presented in this case."
1994.93-1121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.242,316.588,"In another sense, Sioux Nation was an easier case, since the party defendant was the Government, the party who had the benefit of the prior judgment, and I think the Court opinion suggested that the Government as a litigant could waive rights but it might not be able to impose the same sort of waivers on other parties who are not the Government."
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,316.588,321.229,"Your Honor, I understand and agree that that language is in the opinion."
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.885,344.787,"Well, that's certainly not what Sioux Nation said."
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,379.11,386.406,"Well, Your Honor, I agree that that's what the Court said, but I do believe that this is a different case than Sioux Nation."
1994.93-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.456,485.251,"--Suppose Congress changed the statute of limitations and then added a second clause which said, res judicata shall not apply in any 10b-5 case that has been commenced after a certain date, and sets that date 5 years back, so that all cases can be reopened if they've been filed within 5 years."
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,485.251,491.686,That presents a little bit more difficult problem than is presented by this case.
1994.93-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,518.543,524.327,Is it just a question of straining our resources?
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,524.327,527.329,"Well, I'm saying that that might be an aspect of it, Your Honor."
1994.93-1121,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,530.373,545.734,"Well, isn't the whole story that the judgments of this Court and of the Article III courts ought to be rendered without fear of their being corrected in a supervisorial way by the political branches?"
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,545.734,563.695,"Well, Your Honor, that gets, again, back to the identification of the institutional interest that's being served by the rule that you're suggesting, which is that judgments are inviolate and that the rights that are fixed in those judgments are forever beyond the reach of Congress."
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.378,567.318,Let me suggest an institutional interest.
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,591.487,592.548,"--Well, I think there are some things that--"
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.548,597.549,"--They can... you can issue an opinion, but ultimately they can send it back and say, do it again."
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,597.549,601.553,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't believe they can just send it back without more."
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.558,667.54,"It can create whole new rights, couldn't it?"
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,667.54,668.451,"--Indeed, Your Honor, yes."
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.451,674.395,"So long as the Due Process Clause didn't prevent it, it could retroactively create a new right."
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,693.269,698.632,"Your Honor, I... I think that that... I understand the point that you're making."
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.474,762.654,No problem.
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,768.6,774.893,"And I think that's an important point, that upholding the statute in this case is not going to open the floodgates."
1994.93-1121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,785.47,789.233,--What would those limitations be as to the separation of powers?
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,793.595,794.797,No.
1994.93-1121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.927,814.502,"So you say, in effect, very likely the Separation of Powers Clause doesn't provide any limits."
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,814.502,816.703,"Well, I think it does."
1994.93-1121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.703,817.945,Then what are they?
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,817.945,827.711,"Well, the limits are that the separation of powers doctrine prohibits the direct exercise of the judicial power."
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.997,851.139,"No, but that can't be it."
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,869.029,869.837,Well--
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.837,871.509,The other two branches do that all the time.
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,871.509,872.29,"--Well, I--"
1994.93-1121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.29,874.724,So you've got to come up with something else that makes us different.
1994.93-1121,0,43817,william_h_allen,,878.785,890.983,"--Well, you can render final... you can render final decisions, and those decisions are final, but I don't think that they are forever immune from further congressional action."
1994.93-1121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.983,892.626,"Thank you, Mr. Allen."
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,894.348,904.843,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,986.318,989.1,"It didn't change the substantive law, did it?"
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,989.1,999.328,"--It did not change the substantive law of liability under Rule 10b-5, which is an important point that I think diffuses any possible due process concern in this case."
1994.93-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1014.308,1039.604,"Mr. Dreeben, let's assume that Congress stopped right there, and let's assume that it made it perfectly clear that with respect to the, we'll call them the blind-sided plaintiffs who suffered in the aftermath of Lampf, that with respect to them there was... the old statute of limitations was reinstated, and that, as it were, by definition this was intended to have retrospective effect."
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1056.106,1065.231,"They could have filed such a motion, Justice Souter, and some courts would have granted it on the basis of changed statutory law that would entitle them to reopen the judgment."
1994.93-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1065.231,1072.295,"Well, would there have been any invalidity in that ruling?"
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1072.295,1076.158,"No, I don't think that there would have been any invalidity in the ruling."
1994.93-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1076.158,1077.978,Would there have been a reason to rule otherwise?
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1110.96,1125.302,"I think that if Congress had manifested its intent to apply that new statute of limitations for the benefit of what you have called the blind-sided class, it would have been an abuse of discretion not to reopen the case and to provide for further proceedings on the merits of the claim."
1994.93-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1125.302,1125.81,All right.
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1152.937,1158.672,I am not sure whether in this particular case a Rule 60(b) motion was made.
1994.93-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1161.924,1186.27,"Well, I'm assuming for the sake of my question it probably wasn't made here, but shouldn't a court have said, shouldn't a trial court have said, in effect, I'm not going to reach the constitutional issue unless you somehow tell me that I've got to reach it because we can't get to the same point by applying the statute, by applying the statute of limitations under Rule 60(b), and shouldn't the Court have done that?"
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1186.27,1205.434,"Well, the reason why some courts may not have done that is, there is a line of 60(b) law that changes in statutory law does not justify reopening of an otherwise final judgment, and it may be in the view that that was the requirement under 60(b) that those courts wouldn't have chosen that avenue."
1994.93-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.434,1205.835,A rule--
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1208.927,1228.26,"No, I don't think that it is a rule suggested by the separation of powers, Justice Scalia, because what is going on in these cases is that Congress has acted legislatively to change a governing rule that was conceded by everyone when this Court... when Lampf was before this Court, namely, what should the statute of limitations be for a statutory cause of action?"
1994.93-1121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1228.26,1243.859,"But under your answer to Justice Souter, you indicated that it would be in that hypothetical that you put, an abuse of discretion not to apply the new law, but that means that the law is, in itself, a mandate to reopen."
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1243.859,1244.6,"Well, it--"
1994.93-1121,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1244.6,1246.232,And I don't see how you've cured the problem.
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1246.232,1247.944,"--I would agree, Justice Kennedy."
1994.93-1121,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1265.598,1280.939,"If we assume that there's no due process problem in the enactment of the new statute of limitations, then basically, doesn't the question of abuse of discretion turn on a kind of traditional notion of equity?"
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1304.905,1308.558,"--I don't think it's quite as garden variety as all that, Justice Souter."
1994.93-1121,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1368.01,1382.932,"Isn't this an effort by Congress to restore a doctrine that this Court abandoned, that is, the double whammy of Lampf and Beam?"
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1391.447,1396.419,I think that's essentially what Congress did in this case.
1994.93-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.701,1444.351,Did we announce in Lampf that we were changing the law?
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1450.475,1452.207,Lampf is probably--
1994.93-1121,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.207,1455.719,I thought we pronounced the law was this way and had always been this way.
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1455.719,1460.013,--That is generally the way that this Court operates when it interprets a statute.
1994.93-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1483.929,1488.494,"But Congress did not pass a statute of limitations for the future, did it?"
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1488.494,1489.085,That's correct.
1994.93-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.085,1489.375,All right.
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1547.575,1551.928,"Well, Justice Breyer, they're not... first of all, this law doesn't take away money--"
1994.93-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1551.928,1556.272,"If it has any effect at all, it takes away money, otherwise its null and void, isn't it?"
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1560.766,1565.839,"--Well, the... if money is taken away it's because the defendants committed securities fraud under then existing law."
1994.93-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1565.839,1566.0,No.
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1580.751,1586.717,"Let me explain why Congress believed that it was fair, rather than constituting any kind of a vendetta."
1994.93-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1591.301,1592.242,I don't mean abstractly fair.
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1615.569,1642.877,"--Well, any retroactive legislation will apply, necessarily, to cases that can be identified, and the Court has upheld not only retroactive legislation under the Due Process Clause, but has upheld legislation such as in Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society that was enacted with the specific purpose in mind of affecting a particular pending case, so I don't think that by itself, retroactivity constitutes a separation of powers problem."
1994.93-1121,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1740.399,1758.989,"It does seem to me we have to assume, for your argument, that this is all quite fair and reasonable, that what the Court did in its prior opinion was a surprise, that it did not declare what the law had been but, rather, that it changed law, and then I'm rather stuck as to how you can say... how this Court could say that, unless it said it in the opinion."
1994.93-1121,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1758.989,1761.962,"I don't believe, Justice Breyer, that the Court has to say that."
1994.93-1121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.549,1772.841,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1774.731,1779.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1826.846,1842.648,"Mr. Olson, you have no question that if one of these cases is still pending, if an appeal were lodged after Lampf and Beam, and it was just sitting there, that that case could go forward?"
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1861.992,1867.157,"There are two answers to that, or at least two that come to my mind, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.93-1121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1903.934,1905.544,Let me understand you better you what you said.
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1923.438,1930.181,"I... we submit, or we concede that the statute of limitations is a peculiarly legislative area."
1994.93-1121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1930.181,1938.669,And that's there are... there are many cases where a statute of limitations is extended while the claim is still alive.
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1938.669,1943.271,"Under some circumstances, the Court has permitted that to occur."
1994.93-1121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1957.822,1975.925,"Suppose... let's take this case, and Congress had reacted to Lampf and said, we don't think it should be the 90 limit, we think it should be a 5-year limit, so we're enacting a 5-year limit, and it applies to all cases to which it could lawfully apply."
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1975.925,1981.159,"--If the cases were open, it would be, I concede, a considerably more difficult case."
1994.93-1121,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2002.596,2007.111,I'm just trying to get an answer from you about Congress' power.
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2031.527,2046.049,"I submit that there is a spectrum, Justice Ginsburg, that when the Congress of the United States extends a statute of limitations, its power is greater where the cases have not been brought or the cases have not been litigated."
1994.93-1121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2110.413,2118.239,"And is that the key, because if the... if... I mean, is it... does it violate separation of powers always, to open up a closed judgment?"
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2134.604,2134.825,I--
1994.93-1121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.825,2143.6,"Now, that would focus it, because insofar as due process allows, you can't do it, but now, is there any objection to that--"
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2143.6,2160.941,"--I do believe, Justice Breyer, that as I believe Justice Scalia was suggesting in his questions, that if there is a... what the judicial power is is to... and I go back to Marbury v. Madison, is to decide the rights of individuals, and that it is fundamental to that judicial power--"
1994.93-1121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2160.941,2161.479,--This is a--
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2161.479,2162.761,--to render final decisions.
1994.93-1121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.761,2163.191,--The legislation is a class.
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2166.115,2166.315,Yes.
1994.93-1121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.315,2176.561,"Everybody, and now you're saying that separation of powers stops that legislation applying to a person with a closed judgment even if it doesn't violate the due process clause."
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2176.561,2178.744,"I believe that it may, Justice Breyer."
1994.93-1121,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2181.017,2182.748,Because... it does that because?
1994.93-1121,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2182.748,2186.5,--Well... to the decision of Federated Department Stores v. Moitrie.
