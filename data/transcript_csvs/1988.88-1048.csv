1988.88-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.997,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-1048, Robert J. Quinn v. Wayne L. Millsap."
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,10.879,15.561,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-1048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,124.111,128.075,"Mr. O'Keefe, how far does your theory go?"
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,149.819,157.644,"Your Honor, the circumstances, of course, are not that there is a requirement for a representative array of Board members."
1988.88-1048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.644,157.774,I understand that.
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,159.236,164.922,"I do not believe that property ownership would be a disqualification for service, as is the lack of property ownership."
1988.88-1048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.922,179.98,"Well, I'm asking whether it would be permissible under the Constitution, in your view, for a state to set it up with certain members having to be property owners... maybe so many civil engineers, and so forth and so on."
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,181.943,188.948,"Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that the ownership of property bears any rational relationship to the authority that a Board of Freeholders enjoys."
1988.88-1048,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.42,196.874,xxx their duties impact heavily on property ownership?
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,196.874,202.507,"--Well, there is a reference in Section 30(b) of the Missouri Constitution to the levying of the property tax."
1988.88-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.572,240.014,"Mr. O'Keefe, this Board, I take it, doesn't actually adopt anything itself, does it?"
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,240.014,241.586,It does adopt a plan.
1988.88-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.586,247.112,But it... but the plan it adopts doesn't have the force of law until it's ratified by the electors?
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,247.112,247.633,That is correct.
1988.88-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.891,262.956,"What... what case of ours comes closest, do you think, to supporting the proposition you're maintaining here?"
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,262.956,274.003,"Your Honor, I believe Turner v. Fouche is the most clear statement of the law that the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment protect the right of each citizen to an equal opportunity for service."
1988.88-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.652,297.17,"So, you... you don't base your argument then on our... the Kramer v. Union Free School District line of cases where we say that you can't discriminate among... property qualifications for voters?"
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,297.17,299.611,"--To the contrary, your Honor."
1988.88-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,312.48,316.484,"Well, but there are two quite different lines of reasoning I would have thought."
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,327.572,338.539,"Your Honor, first of all, the subsequent opportunity to vote does not overcome the discrimination which occurs when the Board is first put into place."
1988.88-1048,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.699,352.858,"Well, it may not overcome the discrimination insofar as the opportunity to serve is concerned, but it very likely would overcome any discrimination insofar as the adoption of the plan is concerned."
1988.88-1048,0,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,358.084,385.92,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the reasoning articulated by this Court in Bullock and Lubin which concerned candidate restrictions, qualifications restricting candidates seeking an access to the ballot in a primary election, recognized that when an identifiable segment of the voting public has their perspective artificially barred from the ballot, that they suffer a diminution of the right of franchise and suffer an abridgement of their right to vote."
1988.88-1048,1,40992,simon_b_buckner,,1314.697,1322.832,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-1048,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.473,1406.559,"When they did that, they didn't know that the Constitution prohibited your having a... a governmental unit like this composed only of property owners."
1988.88-1048,1,40992,simon_b_buckner,,1408.482,1412.813,"If the reference is to Turner v. Fouche, you're right."
1988.88-1048,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1437.842,1449.831,Is there anything in the lore... l-o-r-e... of Missouri that says that freeholders do not mean holders of property?
1988.88-1048,1,40992,simon_b_buckner,,1449.831,1455.885,--There is nothing in the Missouri Constitution that speaks to that point.
1988.88-1048,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1473.909,1477.371,Which says that freeholders don't mean freeholders?
1988.88-1048,1,40992,simon_b_buckner,,1477.371,1488.27,"--That says that when the word freeholder is used in this context, it should be understood in a public law context, as opposed to a property law context."
1988.88-1048,2,33932,kevin_m_okeefe,,2999.679,3001.229,"I do, Your Honor."
