2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.76,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-312, United States versus Sanchez-Gomez. Mr. Kedem."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,7.76,30.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An appellate court must have statutory, as well as constitutional, authority for its decisions, and, here, the Ninth Circuit had neither. Appellate review was not authorized under Section 1291, which applies only to district court decisions that are final, nor under the All Writs Act."
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,39.52,44.0,"On your first point, you -- you didn't mention the collateral-order doctrine."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,53.0,53.88,That's correct.
2017.17-312,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,71.76,72.56,Reviewed to do what?
2017.17-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,72.56,78.76,But -- but that -- that assumes that the trial would somehow have been affected.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,94.68,112.68,"Justice Kennedy, I don't think it necessarily has to affect the trial. Recall here, for instance, that the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case created a split with the Second and Eleventh Circuits, and in both of those cases, there were challenges to the use of physical restraints that came from -- came after the fact."
2017.17-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.68,121.96,But what are -- the -- the person is convicted and has a -- let's say that he does or she does have an appeal on -- on some different points.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,128.52,141.6,"Well, it wouldn't necessarily affect the outcome of the trial, but, for instance, they could have a claim that it affected some part of the pretrial process. They had a suppression motion that was affected because they couldn't contribute to their own defense."
2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,143.32,144.76,How did that -- I saw that argument.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,149.16,154.04,"Well, I would refer you to the allegations that Respondents have made throughout this litigation."
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.56,161.92,All right.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,178.64,179.04,So --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,179.04,180.72,That's certainly possible.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,180.72,181.08,Sure.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,181.08,188.0,"The first thing you ask or would be in that case, the appeals court says: What's the prejudice? There's no prejudice to his outcome."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,190.8,208.52,The question under the collateral-order doctrine is not whether a particular litigant or even most litigants who want to raise that type of claim should -- are able to get relief after final judgment because they can show prejudice. The question is whether the type of claim by its very nature is one for which a post-conviction --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,208.52,209.68,That's not the question I asked you.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,212.4,219.64,I think it would be very difficult in an instance in which there was no allegation that it had any effect on the way that the proceedings unfolded.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,219.64,219.92,All right.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,255.72,258.32,"The collateral-order doctrine wouldn't apply, but they could get --"
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,258.32,259.44,I didn't ask you that.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,259.44,260.6,"No, I -- I understand, Justice --"
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,260.6,261.6,"I asked you, what does apply?"
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,261.6,262.92,They could get mandamus in that case.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,264.8,283.2,"If they could get mandamus in that case, why can't they ask for mandamus in this case, where, after all, he has been bound without an opportunity -- they bind everybody, arms and legs? Now you can say: Well, he won't win."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,289.24,302.2,"The preconditions for mandamus are, first of all, that you have to show clear entitlement to the writ, which Respondents can't show, in part, because the district court complied with the Ninth Circuit's existing precedent and with precedent of this Court."
2017.17-312,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,302.2,302.44,Wouldn't he have --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,302.44,310.36,"But is that -- is that definite? I mean, is it -- is it the case that -- that where, for example, nobody ever thought anybody would do anything like this --"
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,310.36,310.48,Well --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,310.48,317.68,"-- to a prisoner, but they do something really terrible, but it isn't absolutely clear."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,323.6,326.8,"Let me push back just a little bit, Justice Breyer, on the premise of your question."
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,344.44,344.88,I know --
2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,344.88,345.2,But couldn't they --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,345.2,346.92,-- but my -- my question is procedural.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,346.92,347.08,Sure.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,347.08,348.52,I'm still trying to get an answer.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,348.52,348.96,So -- so --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,348.96,352.36,Many cases are not absolutely clear.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,355.84,363.24,"So, in a case where a litigant can't show or even allege prejudice, I think it would be very difficult to get a remedy."
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,373.92,403.12,"But, Mr. -- Mr. Kedem, I think that the question that's being asked of you is there are a set of -- of claims, potentially, that would not have anything to do with the outcome of a trial or the outcome of a sentencing or even the outcome of a pretrial proceeding but would implicate a person's interest in liberty. And, you know, whether you want to do, you know, shackling or we've had claims that have to do with forced medication or excessive bail."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,423.04,431.04,"So I take the point, Justice Kagan, but that is not the due process interest that Respondents have invoked throughout this litigation."
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,431.04,435.08,"I take that point, but it seems as though Respondents have changed their minds a little bit."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,435.68,435.84,Sure.
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,435.84,439.08,-- I think that that's the interest that they're now asserting.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,439.08,439.56,Right.
2017.17-312,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,455.8,456.32,Could a detainee --
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,456.32,457.2,If he were able --
2017.17-312,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,457.2,460.04,Could a detainee in this situation bring a civil action?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,460.04,461.12,So --
2017.17-312,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,461.12,465.48,Just as a detainee could challenge conditions of confinement in a civil action?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,465.48,477.48,"I think if what they were challenging was, in fact, just the liberty component, abstracted away from anything related to the way that their criminal proceedings actually unfold, then they might be able to bring a civil suit."
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,477.64,477.84,All right.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,503.8,504.48,That's correct.
2017.17-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,511.84,514.4,"Well, your answer --"
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,514.4,515.96,"Well, suppose --"
2017.17-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.96,523.72,-- your answer to Judge Alito indicated to me that you have some doubt whether the civil class action could work.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,523.72,524.0,Justice Kennedy --
2017.17-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,524.0,548.92,"Would you agree that if prisoners who were still in the pretrial phase of the proceedings brought a class action, and their case later becomes moot -- brought a civil class action, a civil class action -- and their case later becomes moot, that it would still be an existing class, because new people would be in the class, would the government object to that class action on grounds that it's an improper class action?"
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,548.92,549.08,No.
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,549.08,560.12,"There's a problem for these people with a class action, isn't there, because they are being represented by the federal defender."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,566.84,568.12,That's correct.
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,568.12,577.04,And these people are not likely to have the wherewithal to hire counsel on their own.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,585.08,586.84,"I disagree, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.52,594.16,Who do they say --
2017.17-312,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,594.16,595.24,"I'm sorry, how do they --"
2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,595.24,595.6,Is it --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.6,596.0,Who do they say --
2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,596.0,598.28,-- do they have an entitlement to attorney's fees?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,598.28,599.28,Pardon?
2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,599.28,602.84,Is there an entitlement to attorney's fees if the class action is successful?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,602.84,604.28,I think that they -- they might be entitled to attorney's fees.
2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,604.28,606.4,"So it doesn't even have to be pro bono counsel, right?"
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,606.4,608.16,Not necessarily.
2017.17-312,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,608.16,648.04,"Counsel, I -- I, frankly, have never heard of a class action that would interfere with the -- with a pending case, as this one appears it might be trying to do. Part of the claim here is that there's an automatic shackling and that district courts are not, pursuant to the -- to the statute, giving individualized consideration to whether people should be released or not. That second issue will not be susceptible to class treatment of any kind."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,648.04,649.52,That's correct.
2017.17-312,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,663.4,666.96,So it's only a partial -- it's only a partial solution to this problem?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,666.96,667.28,That's right.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,680.12,683.6,"How? Who do you sue? And -- I mean, it's not a 1983 action."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,684.68,684.88,Sure.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.88,689.16,"You sue the individual marshals, there may be an immunity, In re Neagle, et cetera."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,689.16,689.52,So I think --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.52,689.64,Who do you sue?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,689.64,690.44,I think it would be an ex --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,690.44,691.56,Do you sue the judge? The magistrate.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,691.56,693.32,-- ex parte suit against the marshal.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,694.56,695.28,Against the marshal?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,695.28,695.52,That's right.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,705.0,707.52,"Fine, but what is the cause of action? A Bivens action?"
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,707.52,712.56,"It's a -- it's a -- it's a cause of action, as this Court recognized in Armstrong, directly under the Constitution."
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.56,714.44,A direct -- so that's a Bivens action?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,714.44,716.24,It's -- it's an Ex parte Young type of action.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,716.24,718.08,So the lawsuit hasn't been brought before.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,724.84,725.16,So --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,725.16,731.56,So -- so are you sure that you can bring a Bivens action against the individual marshal? What is it?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,731.56,733.96,"Just -- just to be clear, Justice Breyer, it's not a Bivens action --"
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.96,734.12,What is it?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,734.12,735.48,-- in that you're not seeking damages.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,736.32,737.52,An Ex parte Young suit.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,738.4,740.96,"That's right, which is relatively well established."
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,740.96,741.52,Thank you.
2017.17-312,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,742.12,742.8,How strange there --
2017.17-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,742.8,744.56,One more question and you've had a lot of questions.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,765.8,769.56,It's not moot if Respondents keep their criminal cases alive.
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,848.24,859.24,You're -- you're suggesting a -- a civil rule amendment to take care of this kind of order that comes up in a criminal case only?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,859.24,859.84,Well --
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,859.84,867.6,"Let me go back to the collateral -- collateral order, because it seems to me that really does fit this."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,882.72,907.56,"So, in response to -- to the first thing that you said, the Rules Enabling Act allows this Court to make rules, not just in the civil context, but in the appellate and criminal contexts as well. But to your question about why the collateral-order doctrine doesn't apply, I want you to imagine, for instance, a criminal defendant who wants to represent himself, and he says: I know that this is not likely to affect the outcome of the proceedings."
2017.17-312,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,923.56,929.88,Is there any reason why we would have to address the question of statutory jurisdiction if there's no Article III jurisdiction?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,929.88,930.36,No.
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,933.92,936.64,Can I -- can I just ask you to finish what you were saying?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,936.64,936.68,Sure.
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,936.68,939.4,I didn't understand. You -- you have this hypothetical.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,939.4,939.76,Sure.
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,939.76,942.48,And what would we do with a case like that?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,942.48,951.92,"Well, my point is that there's nothing that differentiates the dignitary and autonomy and liberty interests that Respondents are asserting from similar interests that could be asserted."
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,951.92,952.16,I know.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,953.12,953.32,Sure.
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,953.32,955.48,Because it seems to me that he should have a way --
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,955.48,956.48,Right.
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,956.48,961.68,"-- of -- of getting that claim, you know, thought about."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,961.68,1046.08,"I think this Court has recognized that because the final judgment rule has its most ardent application in the criminal context, that it is extraordinarily reluctant to undermine the authority of the district judge to cause disruption, to invite gamesmanship from litigants who want to press pause on -- on their proceedings while they get an appeal, that it is extremely reluctant to allow a mid-stream interlocutory appeal. And remember that Respondents have been conspicuously silent about what should happen during this course of this appeal, whether they have to stop all the proceedings. But if what they're really arguing is that these are interests I can't get back if I'm forced to wait, then it strongly seems to suggest that you would have to halt all the proceedings. And I think it's very hard to imagine a case like Stack about bail claims coming out the same way if every time someone wanted to challenge bail, a denial of bail on appeal, you had to pause the underlying criminal proceedings. There are other differences between the cases that this Court has recognized under the collateral-order doctrine as well. First of all, going to the nature of the right, the right that Respondents have invoked -- and I understand that they've changed their argument a little bit -- but throughout this litigation, they have invoked the right under -- under Deck versus Missouri, which is a right that's grounded in the fairness and accuracy of the underlying proceedings."
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1118.32,1126.28,How about the voluntary cessation doesn't moot the case -- now this rule is no longer in effect.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1126.28,1126.92,That's correct.
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1126.92,1135.96,So -- but there's many situations in which voluntary cessation does not moot a case.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1135.96,1137.04,That's correct.
2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1200.44,1200.76,Well --
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1200.76,1201.36,What about --
2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1201.36,1207.04,"-- it turned out to be true, right? Two of the four were, in fact, arrested again and did go through the shackling again?"
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1207.04,1209.72,"That's correct, but it was true in cases such as Lane."
2017.17-312,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1212.56,1217.44,"What about -- what about Turner, the person who didn't pay, what was it, child support?"
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1217.44,1217.88,Sure.
2017.17-312,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1245.88,1250.24,There -- there is something a little bit different with respect to this crime than most.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1267.32,1273.0,That's -- that's right. But this Court has never relied solely on probabilities.
2017.17-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1318.4,1320.44,Just one -- one --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.44,1321.44,Is --
2017.17-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1321.44,1323.76,-- just one -- one small question.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1329.56,1331.2,He -- he might be.
2017.17-312,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1334.04,1334.76,Right.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1334.76,1337.2,I believe that they would be under this policy.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.2,1340.64,You've withdrawn -- the United States has withdrawn the policy.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1342.84,1344.56,I think the intention would be to reinstate the policy --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1344.56,1344.92,All right.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1356.6,1358.4,Bail denial under this Court's decision --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.4,1358.56,Yes.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1358.56,1360.04,-- in Stack can be immediately appealed.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1360.04,1361.4,Because it's collateral order?
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1361.4,1362.36,It's under the collateral-order doctrine.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1362.36,1364.12,"Well, why is this different?"
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1364.12,1365.68,So I think it's different in a few respects.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1366.24,1370.84,"You've said -- you've said several times, but if you would just summarize the main reasons why it's different."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1370.84,1371.16,Sure.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1394.08,1403.52,"I got that point, but the -- the analogy that I was thinking of is after all, you deny bail, the person's liberty is constrained, he is in a cell."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1403.52,1404.24,Right.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1404.24,1407.64,"And, here, the person's liberty is constrained."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1417.2,1419.52,So that -- that was the difference Justice Jackson emphasized.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.56,1430.6,"Well, I don't know there."
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1431.04,1431.32,Well --
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1431.32,1435.08,-- there the person's in a cell and here the person's in physical shackles.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1435.08,1435.32,Right.
2017.17-312,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1435.8,1436.8,I -- I'm not sure about that.
2017.17-312,0,56065,allon_kedem,,1436.8,1463.68,"The difference, though, is with a bail claim, you're talking about whether the litigant will be at liberty or behind bars for the entire duration of their criminal proceedings, which could be weeks or possibly even months. Here, we're talking about individual hearings which last minutes or possibly hours. So I think it is a very different -- the difference is -- is pretty significant. And, similarly, we -- we think, the nature of the right is very different."
2017.17-312,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1482.0,1489.36,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cahn."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1489.36,1490.04,Thank you.
2017.17-312,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1533.36,1537.6,Could -- could you speak to the government's view that this is kind of a new theory for you?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1537.6,1539.68,"Well, I think the government's simply wrong."
2017.17-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1588.32,1591.88,But that was -- that was during -- shackling during trial?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1591.88,1596.08,"Yes, it was during the penalty phase of a capital case, Your Honor."
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1596.08,1597.24,What about their --
2017.17-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1597.24,1613.28,"There was a -- a suggestion by Mr. Kedem that if the collateral-order doctrine were available, that would mean that the criminal proceeding would be stopped in its tracks."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1614.48,1618.96,"I think that's just wrong. I mean, there's no stay as a matter of right in these cases."
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1655.36,1663.08,"But the government has said, I think, if I interpret it correctly, that, of course, you have a right to challenge this policy."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1715.84,1745.6,"Well, let me see if I can -- if I can hit those seriatim quickly. So, in the first instance, this Court has said in Arizona versus Fulminante that when one attacks a final judgment of conviction seeking to overturn the -- the final judgment of conviction, the court will do that only for two reasons: One for trial error that occurs in the presentation of the case to the finder of fact, and the other is in cases of structural error having to do with the constitution of the trial process."
2017.17-312,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1775.32,1783.68,I don't wish to interrupt the seriatim because -- but are -- are -- is there any doubt that you as a public defender could bring a civil class action?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1783.68,1786.04,It's in my mind quite unclear.
2017.17-312,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.04,1786.76,All right.
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1786.76,1827.92,"So I -- and I'm not an expert on civil class actions and it's something that we're just unclear about based upon the statute and the rules. But in Stack and Sell -- in Stack, this Court specifically said that the bringing of a separate habeas action in that case was improper. In Sell, Justice Scalia in his dissent suggested that the forced medication order could have been challenged in another proceeding, an Administrative Procedure Act challenge, to the order of the Bureau of Prisons to medicate the individual there. And what the -- the Court said that wasn't relevant to the availability of collateral-order jurisdiction in that case."
2017.17-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1827.92,1839.12,"Well, all of these difficulties that you're mentioning, you'll have the benefit in all these that the government has said it's okay, right? I mean, you've made a lot of progress this morning already."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1844.6,1846.8,"Well, I think -- I think they've said that --"
2017.17-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1846.8,1850.44,"I mean, I know that doesn't mean it's -- it's done, but it certainly makes it a lot easier for you."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1850.44,1854.32,We certainly appreciate that concession and we'd certainly examine the alternatives.
2017.17-312,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1880.84,1886.64,"But usually when we think about writs of mandamus, it's -- it's not that we give them when an issue is super important."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1893.24,1908.4,"Well, there's two sorts of mandamus that this -- two sorts of -- types of mandamus cases where this Court has allowed or affirmed the issuance of mandamus. One are those cases where there's an absolutely clear rule and the district court seems to be violating that rule."
2017.17-312,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1933.64,1936.52,"So, counsel, why doesn't that take care of your problem?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1936.52,1943.28,"Well, the court of appeals did, in fact, go forward on the basis of mandamus jurisdiction."
2017.17-312,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1949.28,1951.6,So mandamus is -- is available you think in these circumstances?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1951.6,1951.88,Yes.
2017.17-312,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1951.88,1952.52,And not a problem?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1952.52,1955.8,We think it's -- it's a viable route to get review of these matters.
2017.17-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.8,1962.56,"Did the -- did the three judge panel -- they didn't -- they didn't go on mandamus, did they?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1962.56,1988.56,"No, there was established precedent in the Ninth Circuit that collateral-order jurisdiction existed to review this sort of claim, and the Ninth Circuit found -- and the Ninth Circuit panel found collateral -order jurisdiction. The court of appeals said that: We're going to leave that precedent undisturbed, but because we're not going to address the individual shackling decisions, we're only going to address the policy, we see mandamus as a better route to get at that."
2017.17-312,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1988.56,1995.76,"Counsel, the -- the government suggests that the functional class action theory to get around the mootness problem you've abandoned."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,1997.64,2009.0,"So I -- I don't know that I'd say we've abandoned it, but we fit squarely within a very clearly established exception to the mootness doctrine, that this matter is capable of repetition yet evading review."
2017.17-312,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2009.0,2014.8,"Well, before we get to that, if I could just -- if you haven't abandoned it, I don't see it briefed."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2016.68,2022.28,"Well, I think this Court's free to affirm on the basis of the Ninth Circuit's opinion without our briefing on the issue."
2017.17-312,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2022.28,2024.8,Do you think it's right? You haven't defended it.
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2024.8,2042.16,"Well, this Court did something very similar in Richardson versus Ramirez where there was no certification of a class action and the Court found that wasn't essential to Article III jurisdiction. But because we have a simple, clear route, we don't want to ask this Court to break new ground for us."
2017.17-312,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2042.36,2042.72,Okay.
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2044.04,2056.04,But you have a decision from the en banc Ninth Circuit saying that this case is not moot based on the fact that it is a functional class action.
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2056.04,2056.56,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2056.56,2066.04,"And it's pretty remarkable that, whether you've abandoned the -- the point or not, you certainly have not made any effort to defend it."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2066.04,2066.68,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2066.68,2074.6,"What does that say about this theory, which is adopted by the -- the en -- an en banc court of appeals?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2074.6,2084.28,"Well, as to us, it says that we're more comfortable staying within a firmly established exception to mootness that this Court has ruled on many times."
2017.17-312,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2084.28,2105.68,"But it -- it isn't, because capable of repetition, evasive review, I don't know of any case that has allowed: I'm going to do it again, that I'm a recidivist, therefore, I mean, it will be evasive of review because I'll do it again and again."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2114.72,2131.24,"Well, let me note that in Gerstein in Footnote 11, this Court said that pretrial detention is necessarily brief, speaking to the individual named plaintiffs, so that no one individual would have an opportunity to fully litigate their claim."
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.6,2218.88,"So we're -- at the moment, it's very interesting and helpful, but I'm thinking if we -- if we -- if we go with you on mootness, I don't know what door that's opening up because it's really not moot because there are other people that will be subjected to it, not your clients. Then I'm thinking: Well, if we go on the mandamus, I'm going to hear just what I heard, that there are a bunch of districts that have this and it isn't as far out as my imaginary example. And then, if I go on collateral order, I'm going to run into the problem that we just said, that this would delay the proceeding rather than his like being in bail."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2240.12,2246.32,"No, no, I think in a sense you're right that the government's argument is really that there is no way to ever obtain --"
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.32,2248.68,"No, no, they say Ex parte Young."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2248.68,2256.48,"They say that, but, you know, the truth is that doesn't obtain review of the decisions to shackle these individuals in their cases."
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2277.44,2297.36,"What is the difference between -- what -- what is the difference between a case involving allegedly unlawful shackling when a person is brought to a proceeding in court where there is no jury, on the one hand, and a case involving, let's say, allegedly unconstitutional shackling while in the jail?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2297.36,2298.76,Well --
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2298.76,2302.68,"In -- in the latter case, would that fall within the collateral-order doctrine?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2302.68,2317.72,"No, I -- I don't believe so because courts don't make decisions in criminal cases about what happens in detention centers. Courts do make decisions about how individuals come before them, about how they're presented in a public courtroom where they --"
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2317.72,2321.12,"Well, I mean, insofar as there -- there are two possibilities for your claim."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2353.88,2357.4,"Well, we think the fact that it occurs in court is meaningful."
2017.17-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2401.0,2407.28,"Well, there is the countervailing interest, which, of course, is the safety of those in the courtroom and the safety of the judges."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2428.8,2433.24,"Well, I disagree and I think that the record here shows that not to be the case."
2017.17-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2465.08,2470.56,"Well, but there are situations where in term -- for pretrial decisions, you do have more than one person."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2494.84,2495.12,"Well, it's --"
2017.17-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2495.12,2497.16,-- for every one of however many people are there.
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2497.16,2500.96,So it's just not a why he should or why he shouldn't.
2017.17-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2524.8,2545.0,"Well, I suppose -- I suppose there are many situations where people don't know much about the individual, right? The situation we have here where, for example, there are many people -- like the recidivist clients, obviously, you know something, but they arrest somebody and bring them in and the question is should they be detained, and they don't know anything about them."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2545.0,2548.44,"Well, in -- in our district, they know quite a bit about them by the time they get to court."
2017.17-312,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2604.84,2607.56,"Of the -- what are there, 99 districts in the country?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2607.56,2607.96,Yes.
2017.17-312,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2607.96,2613.4,How many of them have had a shackling policy similar to this one?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2613.4,2615.2,So we don't know that with certainty.
2017.17-312,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2635.64,2639.84,Is it fair to say that that's a small percentage compared to the whole?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2639.84,2643.2,"Certainly, it seems that way to me based upon the record we've got."
2017.17-312,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2643.2,2649.04,"And in -- in the whole, the individualized determinations are made?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2649.04,2649.24,Yes.
2017.17-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2655.76,2661.28,"You have a higher -- a much higher volume of people, don't you, in those -- that part of the country than elsewhere?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2661.28,2670.72,"We do, indeed, Your Honor, but we've had that same high volume for pretty much the entirety of -- well, I shouldn't say the entirety of the history of the district, but certainly from the '70s on."
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.72,2671.28,Is this -- What's the difference --
2017.17-312,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2671.28,2686.72,"Can you address the question about capable of repetition yet evading review? It's very difficult for this Court, as a matter of the dignity of the law, to say that, well, we're going to presume there's going to be another violation."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2698.64,2708.16,"Well, let me be clear, we're not asking the Court to presume anything, and that's simply because the most likely evidence that something can happen is that it has happened."
2017.17-312,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2727.28,2740.52,"But -- but that suggests if I look at somebody and he has a very, very, very long rap sheet, I'd say, well, you know, he clearly does this every month, he's just going to be here again, and give him a different rule from somebody who's a first offender."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2740.52,2762.2,"Well, the Court has always said that in applying the capable of repetition yet evading review exception, the court looks at the individual case and the individual litigant in determining whether or not it's likely to repeat itself. So the Court isn't creating some rule for all criminal cases in some way, courts looking at these cases."
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2827.32,2828.28,Go back to the merits for a second.
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2832.8,2833.44,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2833.44,2855.0,"And -- and there's a full page, more than a page, of citations that are not simply from Blackstone, but almost all of them are from American courts, and the conclusion is trial courts -- that what they show, for like a century, is trial courts may not shackle defendants routinely but only if there is a particular reason to do so."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2855.0,2855.72,Yes.
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2855.72,2858.48,Now were those all jury cases? I don't remember.
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2870.48,2884.6,"I -- I -- I don't know with certainty, and I don't want to answer, Your Honor. I would point out, though, that this shackling occurred not only before the magistrate judges in the initial proceedings but before district court judges in substantive motion hearings and evidentiary hearings."
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2885.68,2890.12,"Do you know if Blackstone was, in fact, just talking about jury cases or if --"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2890.12,2890.16,It --
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.16,2893.4,-- Blackstone was talking about cases in courtrooms?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2893.4,2896.88,"Well, I think it's clear that Blackstone wasn't talking just about jury cases."
2017.17-312,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2924.48,2930.16,Is it your experience that there's shackling during a pretrial motion to suppress?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2930.16,2935.24,"There was shackling at every proceeding, Your Honor, with the exception of one district judge."
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2982.64,2984.44,"I mean, suppose the rule --"
2017.17-312,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2984.44,2988.88,"In the Central District of California, does this policy prevail, do you know?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2988.88,2991.84,"Well, it prevails nowhere in the Ninth Circuit any longer."
2017.17-312,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2993.0,2994.0,Before the state.
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,2994.0,3014.08,"In the Central District of California, there was a policy of using leg shackles only in the initial appearances only, and that was the Howard case, which was the begin -- the first litigation ever concerning shackling that established the right to collateral-order jurisdiction in the circuit on -- over these matters."
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3014.08,3028.28,"If -- if there is no rule, there's no blanket rule, but an individual district judge orders that a detainee be shackled, do you think that could be contested via the collateral-order doctrine?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3028.28,3038.44,"Well, I think the only thing before this Court is a complete denial of an individual determination on the basis of violence or risk of escape."
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3064.56,3074.16,"But here there could be -- you could get an individualized determination, could you not? Couldn't -- I -- I thought under this rule any judge could order that the shackles be removed."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3074.16,3082.0,"Any judge could order that the shackles be removed, but no judge made an individual determination on the basis of danger or risk of escape."
2017.17-312,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3108.72,3125.12,"Counsel, going back to what the Ninth Circuit said in their majority opinion, they didn't deal with the mootness issue except through the class action argument."
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3125.12,3126.32,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2017.17-312,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3126.32,3141.08,"They do state in their opinion, however, the principle that was mentioned earlier, that we generally don't presume in their case law that someone will commit a criminal act. The government points to that --"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3141.08,3141.84,So -- So --
2017.17-312,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3141.84,3151.68,"-- in saying, absent the class action mechanism, you really can't get past that circuit case law --"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3151.68,3152.08,So --
2017.17-312,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3152.08,3160.24,-- if -- if -- it seems to me that shouldn't we let the Ninth Circuit figure that out?
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3160.24,3160.4,Well --
2017.17-312,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3160.4,3174.44,"If we don't accept the class action mechanism they use -- it's a big but, it -- hypothetically, if we don't accept that, shouldn't we just remand and let them decide whether this is capable of repetition or not?"
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3174.44,3179.36,So I -- I certainly think that this Court has done that in the past in its appropriate course.
2017.17-312,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3247.56,3258.36,"And do you think we could say: Well, we don't know whether we have jurisdiction under the Constitution, but we're going to write an opinion on various other interesting legal issues that are presented in this case?"
2017.17-312,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3258.36,3259.04,No.
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3259.04,3260.6,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2017.17-312,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3270.44,3274.44,May -- may I ask something? It might -- it's probably not legally relevant.
2017.17-312,1,38890,reuben_c_cahn,,3293.48,3296.32,"Well, there's no evidence in the record about this, Your Honor."
2017.17-312,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3321.72,3325.12,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem, you have six minutes remaining."
2017.17-312,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3325.12,3327.92,Thank you.
2017.17-312,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3441.76,3450.36,"Assuming your district, like most, doesn't have a waiver of appeal rights with all of their plea agreements."
2017.17-312,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3450.36,3451.56,It's routine --
2017.17-312,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3451.56,3453.24,Which it's routine to have the --
2017.17-312,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3453.24,3453.84,Sure.
2017.17-312,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3453.84,3456.2,"-- the waiver, which means this issue is not likely."
2017.17-312,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3456.2,3462.92,"Well, it's routine for litigants to preserve suppression objections and to challenge that on appeal."
2017.17-312,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3517.4,3519.68,Is that -- is that five-point restraints?
2017.17-312,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3519.68,3524.12,That's full restraints. It's both wrist restraints and also leg restraints.
2017.17-312,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3554.0,3555.16,"It was a civil case, wasn't it?"
2017.17-312,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3555.16,3557.6,That was a civil case. That was a mandamus case.
2017.17-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3633.24,3669.16,"Can you say -- I don't know -- but can you say if the government would -- I don't want to put cooperate, that's too strong -- but at least would not oppose an effort in any of those 150 districts by a defense attorney's organization to try to challenge this policy, either through, as you suggested, an Ex parte Young proceeding or, as you also suggested, an ordinary appeal where they haven't waived the right to appeal and it says explicitly like reserving the -- the suppression motion, we reserve the right to challenge the restraint motion?"
2017.17-312,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3669.16,3669.92,"Well, starting --"
2017.17-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3669.92,3670.84,Now -- now -- there -- yeah?
2017.17-312,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3670.84,3673.32,So starting with the last part of your question --
2017.17-312,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3673.32,3673.96,Yeah.
2017.17-312,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3673.96,3694.28,"-- the government didn't in Zuber or LaFond, which were the Second and Eleventh Circuit decisions that were from final judgments, didn't contend there that it was improper for the litigant to argue that they had been improperly restrained in those cases. With respect to your question about the civil suit, I can say only that the government would not oppose it in an appropriate case."
2017.17-312,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.28,3695.12,"Thank you, counsel."
