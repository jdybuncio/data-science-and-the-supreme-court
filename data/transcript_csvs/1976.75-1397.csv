1976.75-1397,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.158,"We will hear arguments next in 75-1397, Juidice against Vail."
1976.75-1397,0,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,56.165,59.483,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.395,168.061,"Well, are you saying that he District Court didn’t merely strike it down in its application as to these particular plaintiff would simply say the State of New York couldn’t enforce it at all?"
1976.75-1397,0,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,168.061,178.941,I say yes that and that was the effect that the State of New York could not enforce or punish contempts of Court.
1976.75-1397,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.384,255.44,Did the state file an answer?
1976.75-1397,0,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,255.44,266.987,"The state in this case or the appellant’s State Court judges, were at the time of the hearing before the three-judge court, moving to dismiss."
1976.75-1397,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,305.028,309.819,"But they did on page 20, it seems they did try to limit it."
1976.75-1397,0,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,319.288,319.964,But I wish to emphasises --
1976.75-1397,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,319.964,325.047,Then I interpreted that they were trying to cut back a little?
1976.75-1397,0,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,327.964,336.677,"I think the District Court realized, because we had a hearing after the first order came down, after the decision came down, which was in the form of an order."
1976.75-1397,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,397.249,400.278,Because they held it unconstitutional on its face.
1976.75-1397,0,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,400.278,400.748,Yes.
1976.75-1397,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,400.748,402.542,On their face.
1976.75-1397,0,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,405.934,422.729,"And when you excise seven Sections of judiciary law, which provide for the issuance of process, which provide for the hearing, which provide for the punishment, you are left with nothing."
1976.75-1397,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,477.679,493.603,"If a witness does not appear in response to a subpoena in an ordinary lawsuit under the New York code, is the procedure much like this that is to issue an order to show cause to that witness why he should not be punished for contempt?"
1976.75-1397,0,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,493.603,516.931,"I would say that it is basically the same that you see, disobedience of the subpoena is punishable as a contempt of court and indeed the subpoena here and pretty much any subpoena that’s issued states on its face that disregard of the subpoena is punishable as a contempt of court."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2032.789,2035.837,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2046.439,2047.728,"Well, now you said issued."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2052.114,2052.735,"No, it is not."
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2054.639,2055.563,Now --
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2055.563,2057.324,Whether these --
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2057.324,2072.94,"Is the clerk of the Courts as you see it for Due Process purposes, a different kind of an officer of the court room, a lawyer who was admitted to the bar under New York law?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2072.94,2073.958,"Yes, he is."
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2073.958,2083.018,"Hasn’t the New York statute delegated to a lawyer who is attorney of record in a particular case, the authority to issue that subpoena?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2083.018,2089.489,"Yes, and I don’t question his authority to issue it, and I don’t question the fact that the debtors in this case disobeyed the subpoenas."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2102.04,2104.956,He had an opportunity to pay up for a judge.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2104.956,2105.763,That’s correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2106.835,2110.627,"Well, is the State supposed to give more than an opportunity?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2110.627,2112.824,"I would agree, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.824,2115.422,Is that a catalog to bring him up and take him in?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2115.422,2117.069,"No, no."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2130.668,2143.277,"Well, suppose Judge Jones issues a subpoena to Sam Brown to appear in his Court tomorrow morning as a witness and the guy says “Well, he must be crazy."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2151.679,2153.946,"No, but we have a different situation there."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.946,2156.221,But didn’t he issue a cause order here?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2156.221,2157.697,"Yes, he did."
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2175.878,2177.332,Is he one of the named plaintiffs?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2177.332,2181.007,"He is one of the named plaintiffs, that’s correct."
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.327,2320.831,You say a contempt order at that point.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2324.581,2326.279,That’s correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2332.502,2334.945,"Now, the subpoena or the show cause order?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2334.945,2336.788,For not obeying the subpoena.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2336.788,2337.688,The original subpoena?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2337.688,2339.049,The original subpoena.
1976.75-1397,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.049,2343.894,"Of course he didn’t obey it in the sense that if he went to the place of the deposition, he refused to testify."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2343.894,2345.393,"That’s correct, he did not obey it."
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2353.388,2354.65,The original subpoena?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2354.65,2355.291,That’s correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2355.291,2356.141,"Well, he had obeyed that."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2357.645,2359.884,"Well, he had not technically given the information."
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2370.017,2371.984,"Well, and that’s what the subpoena required him to do."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2371.984,2378.86,"Well, under New York law, the fact that he got further notice to go to the attorney’s office is sufficient, and he couldn’t be held in contempt."
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2378.86,2383.661,Well as they adjourned the hearing or the appearance to another place.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2383.661,2384.921,"That’s correct, and under New York procedure --"
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2384.921,2390.836,"Under New York law, do the same as though they adjourned it from the third floor of the Courthouse to the fifth floor."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2390.836,2391.703,Exactly.
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2391.703,2398.123,"Where does appeal lie from the County Court of the appellant here, the appellate division?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2398.123,2398.91,The appellate term.
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.91,2413.301,"Well, are you saying that it’s inconceivable that the appellate term if your client had appealed that citation, would not have found some violation of state law in citing under those circumstances?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2413.301,2414.993,I am not suggesting that.
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.703,2458.145,Well doesn’t the appellate term have authority to grant a stay if it held that the man was being incarcerated by the County Court wrongly?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2458.145,2461.979,Yes they do.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.858,2493.105,"Well, don’t you think that the New York Courts could’ve given you relief without striking down the whole batch of statute?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2493.105,2493.996,"They might have, and that --"
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2493.996,2495.792,And don’t you think they would have?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2495.792,2498.137,"They certainly might have, and we --"
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2498.137,2503.031,By this action -- everybody -- there’s no more contempt in New York?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2503.031,2511.269,"Well, the Court still has an inherent contempt power and the only thing that they can’t do is to incarcerate individuals."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2513.759,2520.017,"Well, is contempt without the power of incarceration any good?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2520.017,2523.098,I don’t question that the New York Courts --
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2523.098,2527.351,Do you think that all of these statutes are unconstitutional on their face?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2527.351,2528.695,"Yes, I do."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2535.459,2541.5,We won’t settle for them being unconstitutional as applied to what class.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2541.5,2547.871,If you want to clear that my constitutionals applied that would satisfy our interests.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2556.262,2564.832,"Well, my case is that this man was subpoenaed by the judge to appear before him and he never showed up."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2571.206,2571.728,If that was the procedure --
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2571.728,2572.674,Is that right?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2572.674,2574.026,"No, if that was the procedure Mr. Chief Justice Marshall --"
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2574.026,2576.015,You mean the Court can’t do that?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2576.015,2580.094,If that was the procedure I would say that that comports with Due Process.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2580.969,2583.885,"What I’m saying, you don’t find anything wrong with that do you?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2583.885,2584.445,If the person is was advised by his attorney --
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2584.445,2590.204,He is incarcerated without ever seeing a judge.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2590.204,2591.531,"Alright, I misunderstood your question."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2598.811,2620.756,"No, he issued a subpoena and the man ignored the subpoena without ever seeing a judge, he ignored it and without seeing a judge, the judge issued a bench warrant and put him into cool and they’ll do it every day and there’s nothing I know of illegal about it."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2629.592,2632.228,They are two different situations in this case though.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2659.999,2664.088,But that is just the case that drawn here.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2674.322,2677.186,"No, if we look at the statutes --"
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2677.186,2684.99,"The order’s Court, the Court will make a final order directing that he be punished if he doesn’t return."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2687.973,2690.439,You are in 2 (a) of the decision?
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2690.439,2691.97,"Opinion, I mean once --"
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2691.97,2692.741,Jurisdictional statement.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2692.741,2706.28,"Once the Court issues the show cause order, doesn’t he have an opportunity to go in Court to show anything under the sun that would convince the Court not to put him in jail?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2706.28,2707.573,"Yes, he does."
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2723.464,2730.525,"You never finished telling us the sad story of Mr. Ward, because we interrupted you."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2730.645,2731.994,Let me return to that.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2747.17,2750.528,"Now, was that authorized by the statute or was that clerical error?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2750.528,2753.05,"Correct, that was authorized by the statute."
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2803.472,2806.984,"Since you recite that, do you suggest there was something wrong with that?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2806.984,2807.726,"Yes, I do."
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2837.897,2842.588,"Now, you’re saying that the additional cost cannot be allowed to the judgment creditor --"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2842.588,2842.833,No.
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2842.833,2845.443,-- and he is contend to take these extra steps?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2845.443,2853.771,"No, the judgment creditor under the statute is entitled to $250.00 without proving that he suffered any loss, meaning --"
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2853.771,2855.971,"But that’s credited against the debt, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2855.971,2861.435,"Well, if the underlying debt is $10.00, he can still get $250.00 and keep it."
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2882.87,2885.184,You haven’t quite finished Mr. Ward’s story yet.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2885.184,2886.389,I will finish.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2915.147,2916.699,Have you finished with the Ward story?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2916.699,2917.014,"Yes, I am."
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2917.014,2919.224,"What happened to him then, ultimately?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2919.224,2924.174,"Ultimately, a temporary restraining order was issued by Federal Court and he was not incarcerated."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2924.174,2938.958,"Before you leave Ward, what about on May he was served with a notice of motion for order finding defendant in contempt of Court and ordering him to appear in Dutchess County Court."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2938.958,2940.144,"That’s correct, and as --"
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2940.144,2942.336,Was that a valid order?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2942.336,2943.519,That was a valid order.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.519,2945.231,And he disobeyed it.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2945.231,2946.503,"Well, as I indicated --"
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2946.503,2947.574,"Well, wait a minute."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2956.014,2957.248,"That’s correct, he --"
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.248,2958.572,So he disobeyed the order.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2958.572,2959.16,That’s correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2960.21,2961.021,And he solely got punished for it.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2961.021,2967.153,"-- and he went to the attorney’s office and told the attorney that he would pay $10.00 a week, and failed to appear."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2967.153,2969.409,That’s number 11.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2981.198,2986.161,"Well, what happened in essence was that he did not appear at the required hearings."
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2989.518,2991.807,"Later, though there was this time span, wasn’t it?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,2991.807,2993.827,"That’s right, that’s right."
1976.75-1397,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3006.729,3015.358,"Ms. Bloom, in your recital of Mr. Ward’s tribulations, you mentioned the fact that he was subject to a support order."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3021.554,3043.04,"If he had ignored a support order and the support order was issued by a New York Family Court Judge, he would have had -- and if he did not appear at an initial show cause hearing, the Court would physically bring him before the Family Court, and ask him --"
1976.75-1397,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3043.04,3044.392,How is that accomplished?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3044.392,3051.955,"They issue what’s called a writ of attachment, and the Sheriff goes out, picks up the person and brings him before the Court."
1976.75-1397,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3067.383,3073.582,That same procedure followed in the divorce case where alimony is ordered?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3073.582,3079.203,It is followed only in support actions and Family Court.
1976.75-1397,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3100.798,3107.926,"But if the divorce was in an ordinary Court not the Family Court, what are the procedures with respect to alimony?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3107.926,3113.359,"Well, the procedures would be those found in the judiciary law in the challenge sections of the civil contempt statutes."
1976.75-1397,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3113.359,3118.136,The judgment in this case would invalidate that procedure as well as with respect that it was.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3118.136,3121.77,"Yes, it would."
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.77,3133.547,Have you ever heard of a law that’s been struck down by this Court on its face outside of the First Amendment area?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3133.547,3149.22,I believe that a law like this can be struck down on its face because the statutory procedures that operated with the respect to the plaintiffs in this case were permitted under the statute.
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3149.22,3156.815,"Well, but then it’s on as applied basis in the case of these particular plaintiffs even if your right on the merits, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3156.815,3164.241,I believe that he District Court could have held these statutes unconstitutional as applied to these plaintiffs or unconstitutional on their face.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3164.241,3168.328,"Well, these plaintiffs are whole class of people by the law, aren’t they?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3168.328,3169.072,"Yes, they are."
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3169.072,3176.46,"So, if you strike it down as applied to these plaintiffs, you’re striking down the whole law as applied to anybody to whom it applies --"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3176.46,3186.33,I would say that a statutory procedure that permits people to end up in jail without ever seeing a judge or an attorney can be declared unconstitutional on its face.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3190.136,3192.63,Even in the area of criminal law for person.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3199.754,3200.381,That’s correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3200.381,3201.209,-- misdemeanor case.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3201.209,3209.155,But the essential difference there is that that person has a right to an attorney and that attorney will explain to him the consequences that will result.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3209.155,3210.643,Now you’re shifting the ground.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3215.307,3215.826,That’s correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3215.826,3221.143,"And it was that his -- that he didn’t get a hearing, and the same thing in a criminal trial."
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3232.894,3240.318,"At anytime, when you come in to a Court and asked for the appointment of a lawyer on the basis of his indecency in order to protect himself?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3240.318,3242.757,"One plaintiff did, Rabasco."
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3243.293,3245.697,"But, I’m talking about --"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3245.697,3245.949,In this case.
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3245.949,3248.518,-- to stay on the same man.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3248.518,3250.224,This individual did not.
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3267.928,3279.223,"Well, was there anything wrong or were there have been any short comings in any possible state remedies or adjudications with respect to your constitutional issues?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3282.524,3285.699,We could have raised these constitutional issues in State Court.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3315.212,3322.037,"At some point in that process, he could’ve got a hold of a lawyer earlier."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3326.505,3330.028,"If he had counsel he could have, that’s correct."
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3330.028,3333.256,Or if he had known nothing or he had known enough himself.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3356.948,3358.462,That’s correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3391.139,3395.336,No matter how many times he refuses to show up?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3395.336,3400.986,"Yes, I believe that he doesn’t need to be given ten opportunities to show up."
1976.75-1397,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.694,3433.857,But when you’re talking about vindicating the authority of a State Court and you’re pretty close to the core of the state interest in this judicial process statute.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3445.543,3453.405,"Well, what happened here -- first of all I think that the statutes must be viewed as purely civil statutes.(B) --"
1976.75-1397,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.405,3455.549,"Well, I know you’d say that I don’t blame you."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3455.549,3462.07,"The statute says that, they play no part in criminal law enforcement."
1976.75-1397,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.07,3465.622,"Well, Huffman, his pursue wasn’t it strictly a criminal case, was it?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3465.622,3476.959,"No, it wasn’t but the statutes in that case were used in aid of criminal statutes and the essential difference is that the proceedings were initiated by the state."
1976.75-1397,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3480.53,3492.669,"Well, don’t you think the state has just as great an interest in seeing the authority that’s Courts vindicated as it does in pursuing a quasi-criminal remedy on an obscenity case?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3492.669,3495.822,I believe that there is an essential difference.
1976.75-1397,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3516.855,3527.887,"Yes, but they - the defendant cannot be held in contempt until they further disregard, a show cause order."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3543.981,3544.69,Correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3576.214,3587.941,"Well, -- but if he at some point showed that a Court that he broke his leg on the way, you don’t suggest that any Court would hold him in contempt for not appearing?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3587.941,3593.038,"He could be held in contempt in his absence, that is my point and because he has been held --"
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3593.038,3597.845,Do you think that would corrected as soon as it was shown that he broke his leg on the way to the Courthouse.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3597.845,3598.796,Correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3604.78,3608.628,Getting back to my Brother Rehnquist’s original question.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3632.884,3634.737,"Well, this is a statutory scheme."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3637.54,3645.192,"I mean, what interest do these people have other than their own rights."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3651.486,3654.415,"Well, they are representative of a class of individuals who are subjected to these statutes."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3654.415,3660.979,Which is obverse and all they need is a relief for that class.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3660.979,3661.748,That’s correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3661.748,3671.992,And they don’t need the relief for all of the other people in other situations governed by the same statutes.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3671.992,3672.175,You --
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3672.175,3682.661,So where does the interest come to this Court that in order to protect these people we have to knock down the whole world.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3688.257,3697.757,"As I said earlier, these people’s interests would be satisfied if these statutes were declared unconstitutional as applied or on their face."
1976.75-1397,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3697.757,3700.214,"Ms. Bloom, would you tell me, you have covered so much now."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3717.902,3721.229,"No, there are two essential violations."
1976.75-1397,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.829,3747.62,"At what point would you say the assignment of counsel should take place, before the arrest or after they’re brought into jail?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3747.62,3753.367,"I believe that the statutory procedure could work as follows, and I will insert when --"
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3753.367,3755.255,"I mean, I shouldn’t have said what do you think."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3758.182,3769.249,I believe that if the creditor is making an application for contempt that may involve incarceration that counsel must be assigned.
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3782.81,3787.0,Is this critical in this development that the Court know that the man is indigent or not?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3791.572,3795.54,That individual should be advised of his right to obtain counsel.
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3795.54,3797.208,How do you advise him if he doesn’t show up?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3799.649,3802.651,"No, I believe that what needs to happen is this."
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3808.98,3811.094,"Well, the show cause says he may be punished."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3811.094,3813.562,"Right, doesn’t say you may be incarcerated."
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3813.562,3815.993,But as a Harvard graduate would probably figure that out.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3815.993,3818.573,Let’s assume so.[Laughter]
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3826.02,3829.601,He maybe taken into custody before counsel is appointed then.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3829.601,3833.766,"He must be assigned counsel when he is physically brought before the Court, and --"
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3833.766,3837.498,Even though you don’t know whether he’s indigent or not?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3837.498,3839.055,"No, I’m sorry."
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3843.437,3846.555,And how can you make that determination till you get him before the Court?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3846.555,3850.354,It can’t be done and I don’t suggest that it needs to be.
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3865.158,3866.532,And he says “I’m indigent.”
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3869.65,3875.871,"Well, unless the creditor has further need for information that --"
1976.75-1397,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3875.871,3883.909,Seems to me that the need for counsel vanishes at the same time that it arises.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3883.909,3884.91,Not necessarily.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3902.649,3908.745,"But Ms. Bloom, the only way you get a lawyer appointed for you is because you’re indigent."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3908.745,3909.186,That’s correct.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3909.186,3912.781,"And if you’re indigent, you have a complete defense."
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3912.781,3913.21,Not necessarily.
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3913.21,3914.325,You don’t need these other ten defenses now.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3914.325,3916.316,You don’t need any of these other defenses.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3916.316,3916.777,Not necessarily.
1976.75-1397,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3916.777,3921.595,And by indigency do you become eligible for the appointment of a lawyer.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3921.595,3935.388,"You might not which would show that in many cases, the appointment of a lawyer is not going to be needed, but it will also ensure that the individual who does not need the appointment of a lawyer is advised that he has a right to a lawyer."
1976.75-1397,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3946.971,3949.628,Which are not before us?
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3949.628,3962.206,"Well, these are -- there was a support and alimony individual in Rabasco and he might have been able to assert some of these defenses to the proceeding."
1976.75-1397,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3962.206,3967.899,"Ms. Bloom, I’m afraid we haven’t given you much of an opportunity to make your own arguments, but may I ask you one other question?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3967.899,3968.569,Sure.
1976.75-1397,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3968.569,3971.496,I’m interested in the effect of the order.
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,3991.283,3993.643,"Well, I read the order differently."
1976.75-1397,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4008.514,4010.525,"That is not what the orders says, isn't it?"
1976.75-1397,1,28921,jane_e_bloom,,4010.525,4020.616,"No, it is not, but I believe that it can only logically be read in light of the decision."
1976.75-1397,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4020.616,4021.64,Thank you Ms. Bloom.
