1988.88-385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.808,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 83-385, Ofelia Rodriguez de Quijas, et al., versus Shearson/American Express."
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,11.808,15.86,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1988.88-385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.818,189.439,"Certainly we would have to reconsider some of our recent cases to adopt that view, wouldn't we, Mr. Downey?"
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,189.439,193.041,"Yes, that's unquestionably, unquestionably true."
1988.88-385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.205,228.63,"Mr. Downey, is there any evidence that Congress meant to treat claims under Section 12(2) differently than claims under Section 10(b)?"
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,239.57,249.294,"Well, I would say that, first of all, the fact that the 10(b) action, the civil part of it, is an implied cause of action."
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.938,329.413,"Perhaps there is, but is it an explanation that has anything to do with the difference between the two sections for present purposes?"
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,329.413,333.448,--I'm not sure I understand that question.
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.448,336.734,"Well, you say that the jurisdictional provisions are different."
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,349.493,364.669,"Well, I would say because perhaps Congress was less inclined to protect the sellers of securities under the '34 Act, as opposed to the '33 Act, which protects the purchaser; that perhaps Congress was less sympathetic."
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.669,370.157,"Well, no, you have to say less inclined to protect sellers and purchasers than to protect purchasers alone."
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,371.523,378.077,"Yes, but in kind of a subtractive sense."
1988.88-385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.592,483.33,"Mr. Downey, did you raise the adhesion argument below?"
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,483.33,492.186,We have made the argument consistently through the district court that in fact these are adhesion contracts and that there is overreaching.
1988.88-385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,492.186,494.138,Was that ever addressed below?
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,494.138,495.671,"It's never been addressed, no."
1988.88-385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,495.671,515.801,"You make another argument, don't you, that regardless of what this Court does, if we were to disagree with you about the validity today of Wilko and were to reject that now, I take it you argue that in any event it shouldn't be applied to your clients?"
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,515.801,517.517,"Yes, that's correct, Justice."
1988.88-385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,517.517,521.705,You think it would not be retroactive under a Chevron analysis?
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,521.705,534.946,"Well, I think that goes... I think the key issue on the retroactivity goes to the question of whether or not there would be manifest or substantial injustice to apply this case retroactively, and we think that that's a question that--"
1988.88-385,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,534.946,538.583,These agreements were signed before McMahon was decided?
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,538.583,551.407,"--These agreements were signed in 1982 and 1983, and owing to the criminal docket of the Southern District little progress has been made."
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.407,555.426,"Mr. Downey, could I come back to the adhesion contract point for a moment."
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,559.913,562.746,The lower courts really didn't address the question.
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.746,565.165,"Well, they had to address it, didn't they?"
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,577.625,578.241,Okay.
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,604.608,607.227,"Well, but that's applying a doctrine of adhesion."
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,612.779,625.206,"--Well, what they're saying is we will address only one question, whether or not there is fraud in the inducement of this specifically in the arbitration provision; we will ignore any other contractual issue."
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.589,629.074,--How can they possibly do that?
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,648.185,648.635,--That's right.
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.635,649.552,I can't believe they did that.
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,649.552,663.595,"Right, and the argument I made to the Fifth Circuit in fact was that if the broker held a gun up to the client's head and said, sign the contract, under the way that they've interpreted that we can't do anything about that, that has to go to arbitration, because he didn't hold a gun up and say, sign the arbitration term."
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.099,670.701,"Oh, I see."
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,676.854,677.288,Correct.
1988.88-385,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.288,679.973,"Well, what's the matter with that?"
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,679.973,694.233,"Well, in the egregious case where there is obvious overreaching, that means we go through the arbitration process, entertain that question, and go back, you know, to district court again."
1988.88-385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.106,712.612,But by hypothesis there was no overreaching or at least no fraud in the agreement to arbitrate.
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,712.612,713.128,Right.
1988.88-385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,724.002,732.775,"Well, but didn't the lower courts here at least find that the agreement to arbitrate was an agreement, a valid agreement?"
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,732.775,739.929,"Well, in essence they... it's an interesting question."
1988.88-385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.053,867.743,"The Fifth Circuit, Mr. Downey, in its opinion says that you didn't contest the arbitrability of your Exchange Act claims following McMahon."
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,876.181,883.787,"Well, of course our expectation is that at some point these will be held to be adhesion contracts."
1988.88-385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.226,902.999,But it sounds at least from the Fifth Circuit's opinion as if you didn't make any claim that there simply wasn't any contract under the Exchange Act claim.
1988.88-385,0,20782,denis_a_downey,,902.999,909.736,"Well, the claim, that claim, is made in the complaint but that was not a matter that was appealed to the Fifth Circuit."
1988.88-385,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1306.044,1307.211,"Thank you, Mr. Downey."
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1312.531,1313.817,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.182,1340.05,"Or not vindicated, as the case may be."
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1342.0,1342.65,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1988.88-385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.891,1410.528,Has the SEC formally suggested that Wilko be overruled?
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1410.528,1412.313,"In their amicus brief, Your honor, in the McMahon case."
1988.88-385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.313,1412.93,In McManon.
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1412.93,1413.682,Yes.
1988.88-385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1413.682,1415.565,They thought that Wilko should be overruled?
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1415.565,1424.288,"They did, and they took the position that their oversight jurisdiction would cause 12(2) claims to be arbitrated as well as 10(b) claims."
1988.88-385,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1424.288,1434.512,"The Petitioner takes the view, Mr. Krebsbach, that even if it is overruled that it shouldn't apply retroactively to these Petitioners."
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1434.512,1436.696,"We disagree, Your honor, for the same--"
1988.88-385,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1436.696,1441.666,"But this was signed, these agreements were signed, before McMahon was decided, were they not?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1441.666,1443.016,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1988.88-385,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1459.294,1462.246,"Well, that's a little hard to justify under Chevron, isn't it?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1462.246,1470.102,"--Well, under the Chevron test which Your Honor mentioned, we feel that the key test is whether or not there is any prejudice to the plaintiffs."
1988.88-385,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1471.469,1472.269,Let me ask you this.
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1478.791,1483.427,--It would take place usually in the venue closest to where the plaintiff resides.
1988.88-385,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1484.612,1492.765,"You would concede that it could occur under these agreements in Texas, notwithstanding the provisions of the agreement?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1492.765,1493.384,Yes.
1988.88-385,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1829.302,1833.706,Does the arbitration clause at issue meet all the requirements of the new rule?
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1833.706,1836.141,The arbitration clause at issue in this case?
1988.88-385,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1836.141,1836.491,Yes.
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1836.491,1838.408,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1988.88-385,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1846.664,1853.685,So it does not conform with the requirements that the SEC is about to adopt in the rules you were just indicating?
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1853.685,1854.385,"No, it does not."
1988.88-385,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1867.343,1870.879,So its rules will be prospective?
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1870.879,1875.599,They will apply just to future contracts.
1988.88-385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.001,1959.27,"Mr. Krebsbach, what does SRO> [""] stand for?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,1960.887,1963.155,"Exactly, Your honor."
1988.88-385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.244,2005.815,"Well, why should we overrule a statutory construction case?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2018.723,2019.407,"We agree, Your Honor."
1988.88-385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.155,2045.373,"Well, we must have thought that Wilko was different."
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2053.813,2056.478,"--It's unclear, Your Honor, because the 12(2) issue--"
1988.88-385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.478,2057.514,"Well, we didn't overrule Wilko, did we?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2057.514,2060.967,"--Well, the 12(2) issue was not before the Court in Wilko, Your Honor."
1988.88-385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.967,2066.286,"Well, I know, but if they were the same issues we would have overruled Wilko."
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2066.286,2067.42,"Well, it appears--"
1988.88-385,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.42,2070.906,You say there is no difference.
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2070.906,2085.665,"--Based on the rationale that the Court used in McMahon, we feel there is no difference, because if you look at the adequacy of the forum to resolve the dispute we feel that an SRO forum with SEC oversight jurisdiction is just as adequate to resolve a dispute under the Securities Act as the Exchange Act."
1988.88-385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.188,2096.556,What if we didn't treat the two the same?
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2110.566,2121.021,"No, I think the effect of not overruling Wilko, to the extent that McMahon also stays intact, would be that agreements under the Securities Act would not be arbitrated and agreements under the Exchange Act would."
1988.88-385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2140.335,2143.121,But it stood alone a long time.
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2143.121,2144.954,Until this Court's decision in McMahon.
1988.88-385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2144.954,2147.756,And Congress didn't act.
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2147.756,2159.713,"Well, what the Court said in McMahon was that Wilko meant that an anti-waiver provision will bar arbitration of disputes under the federal securities laws if arbitration is inadequate."
1988.88-385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2178.46,2184.364,"Why do you think Congress hasn't acted, in view of what you just said?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2184.364,2185.964,Why they have not acted?
1988.88-385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2211.265,2218.919,"Going back to the baseball cases, Congress didn't act and we chose not to."
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2221.304,2228.393,"Well, if you look at the whole notion of Congressional action by silence, clearly the cases go both ways."
1988.88-385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2237.165,2252.175,"Really, your argument is that the arbitration process is now a process of integrity, and that we should recognize that fact and incidentally take a burden off the federal courts, isn't it?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2252.175,2253.675,That would be the result.
1988.88-385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2259.496,2263.4,Maybe that's the real reason.
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2263.4,2266.768,--That it would take away a burden from the courts?
1988.88-385,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2267.268,2274.172,"You can't be too proud of some of the things that have happened in the Street in the past decade, can you?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2274.172,2279.075,"--There has been a lot of bad publicity during the past five years, there's no doubt about it."
1988.88-385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.178,2468.963,"Well, that depends on what other kinds of arbitration there can be."
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2476.467,2482.889,"Yes, conceivably a document could list virtually any arbitration forum whatsoever."
1988.88-385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.889,2483.789,So what do we do with those?
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2490.043,2491.326,"They would, you're absolutely right."
1988.88-385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.326,2493.512,So how predictable would that case be?
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2493.512,2501.351,I think what the Court should do to address that situation is in the first instance assume that the forum will be adequate.
1988.88-385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.903,2513.057,"You want us to interpret the statute so that only good arbitration is exempted from it, bad arbitration is not exempted from it?"
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2513.057,2520.044,"--I wouldn't use the terms ""good"" and ""bad"", but arbitration that's adequate to protect statutory rights should be allowed and arbitration that isn't should not be allowed."
1988.88-385,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.044,2531.851,"Well, I think any arbitration that would pass muster in judicial review as being rudimentarily fair and not being set aside by judicial review is good enough arbitration, I would presume."
1988.88-385,1,42922,theodore_a_krebsbach,,2544.778,2545.778,"I do agree with you, Your Honor."
1988.88-385,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.467,2632.919,"Thank you, Mr. Krebsbach."
1988.88-385,2,20782,denis_a_downey,,2637.038,2638.438,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-385,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.349,2813.483,"Thank you, Mr. Downey."
