1973.73-437,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,892.221,906.336,"What is to be the effect Mr. Gilliam upon the consumer, I take it they feel that the refund system will what, penalize the old consumer and help the current one?"
1973.73-437,0,18989,carroll_l_gilliam,,906.336,952.991,"Your Honor, of course Mr. Morrow will address this question from the viewpoint of the consumers, but in the District of Columbia Circuit opinion, the opinion notes that this is adverse both to the interests of producers in the area who are old producers such as Mobil and adverse to new entrants and adverse to the competitive structure in the area, and therefore, would be adverse to the ultimate benefits that consumers should expect in the sense of the two objectives of the statute which are reasonable rates and an adequate supply."
1973.73-437,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1278.058,1281.528,We will not ask you to put your argument on a minute and a half here.
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1284.086,1287.117,"I have one matter before my argument, if I might take it up with the Court."
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1287.117,1288.097,Yes.
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1288.097,1294.823,We have not yet filed a reply brief to the brief of the Government and the other parties because the Government’s brief was late.[Voice Overlap]
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1298.843,1307.468,"Yes, that’s of course at least one of the factors that entered into the sua sponte decision to give you a little bit more time."
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1311.449,1329.267,We appreciate that Your Honor.[Luncheon Recess]
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1329.267,1331.106,"Mr. Morrow, you may proceed."
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1331.106,1333.654,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1415.168,1416.95,"Mr. Morrow, may I ask?"
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1437.697,1444.412,"And they kept talking, yes, Your Honor and they kept talking about substantial evidence on the record as a whole without --"
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1444.412,1446.397,"Yes, but your argument goes beyond that, doesn't it?"
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1455.371,1465.673,"It challenges them as unsupported, but before we get to that, we challenge the right of the Commission to reopen its 1968 order."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1465.673,1472.058,And do you read the Fifth Circuit as expressly addressing that question or as --
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1472.058,1476.808,"I did not find anything in that question in the Fifth Circuit’s opinion, Your Honor."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1476.808,1487.355,"Well, if they were right, if they were right in thinking as the only question of judicial review as the shorthand Universal Camera question."
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1487.355,1487.749,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1487.749,1494.325,"Now that -- if they were right about that, then our review is even more limited, isn’t it?"
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1494.325,1517.47,"If there were no serious questions concerning the record in this case, concerning the substantive evidence on which the record is based, then obviously if the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, I mean, of the Fifth Circuit, decides that on a factual basis, this Court would not review."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1521.708,1528.337,"And you think those are open, assuming again we were to agree with the Fifth Circuit?"
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1528.337,1528.569,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1528.569,1530.724,"In this approach, do you still think those would be open?"
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1530.724,1534.222,"I think those would be open, yes sir."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1651.583,1671.408,"Mr. Morrow, in that connection, didn’t the Fifth Circuit say that, in its opinion on rehearing on the first order, it made it abundantly clear that it was not affirming, it was reading the Commission, all the authority in the world reopen everything if it wanted to, didn’t it say that?"
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1671.408,1673.581,"No sir, Mr. Justice Brennan, it did not."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1673.581,1673.742,Where did the --
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1673.742,1676.126,And that’s where we come to nub of the case.
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1676.126,1680.032,Where did they use the term “experimental?”
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1684.102,1689.252,"Your Honor, that was discussed by the Court of Appeals in Southern Louisiana 1."
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1705.615,1708.013,"They weren’t dealing with the same records, were they?"
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1708.013,1711.748,"They were dealing with an almost identical record, Your Honor, the same issues."
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.748,1714.887,"The same issues, but the same factual --"
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1714.887,1719.889,"Not the same numbers, but certainly the same issues, the same type of --"
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1719.889,1720.247,Let us go back for a moment.
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1720.247,1721.084,The same settlement.
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.084,1721.269,Yes.
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1737.012,1738.963,The 68 record?
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.963,1740.381,To Louisiana 1 --
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1740.381,1751.069,"Your Honor, it was using that for the purpose of excusing some very loose findings on the part of the Federal Power Commission."
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1809.244,1811.015,Where do we find it here?
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1811.015,1820.548,"Your Honor, this is in the first case and it’s not in the record here, I happen to have a record of the first case and -- sir?"
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1820.548,1821.434,Go ahead.
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1821.434,1830.945,"The Court said, since we have concluded that the Commission is on the right course now, our best course is to keep within the proper sphere of a reviewing court."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1894.569,1898.034,"Do you have, again, I am looking for it, I cannot find it."
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1912.146,1912.33,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1912.33,1918.235,I can’t seem to find that.
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1932.178,1935.338,I am looking in the appendices --
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1935.338,1939.151,"Well, don’t let me waste your time Mr. Morrow, I will find it."
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1939.151,1939.919,"Alright, sir."
1973.73-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.919,1941.176,Mr. Morrow.
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1941.176,1941.274,"Yes, sir?"
1973.73-437,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.274,1955.524,"If in that first proceeding, the Commission’s order had been open-ended or tentative so to speak, an affirmance by the Court of Appeals of that order wouldn’t destroy the open-ended or tentative character of the Commission’s order, would it?"
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,1955.524,1960.692,If it had not been a final order then I presume it would not have been a final order Your Honor that’s correct.
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2180.653,2183.433,"Mr. Morrow, I found finally what I had in mind."
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,2185.965,2186.35,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-437,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2186.35,2201.196,"In the petition, dealing with flowing gas, at the bottom of page 30, where Judge Brown says, after referring to the first order, the eighteen-and-a-half and then the nineteen-and-a-half cent rates."
1973.73-437,1,25708,george_e_morrow,,2222.936,2223.824,That’s correct.
1973.73-437,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2615.985,2620.61,Very well Mr. Morrow.
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,2622.004,2625.276,Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2925.059,2927.093,Where are you reading from now Mr. Forquer?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,2927.093,2929.21,"Sir, this is the order on rehearing --"
1973.73-437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2929.21,2930.34,Where is it in here?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,2930.34,2932.608,Page 5 of the brief.
1973.73-437,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2932.608,2934.006,Is it in the appendix too?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,2934.006,2954.151,"It’s in the brief that -- page 20, the bottom of page 20 of the Government brief."
1973.73-437,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3070.037,3074.95,As respect to SoLa number 1 or with SoLa number 1.
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3074.95,3075.853,How’s that Your Honor?
1973.73-437,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3076.42,3079.666,As respect to SoLa number 1.
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3079.666,3082.091,The issue as to SoLa.
1973.73-437,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3082.091,3088.714,"Concerning that, who stands -- Mobil does not stand opposed to that?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3088.714,3089.935,"No, I don’t think so Your Honor."
1973.73-437,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3089.935,3090.772,Any party [Inaudible]?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3090.772,3094.434,It is New York and MDG.
1973.73-437,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3099.626,3104.07,The party to -- who stand against SoLa or --
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3104.07,3111.298,"Against SoLa I are the, all the people who joined in the settlement proposal in SoLa II."
1973.73-437,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3111.298,3112.291,Except Mobil?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3112.291,3113.108,"Mobil, that’ right."
1973.73-437,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3137.658,3143.061,Do you know Mr. Forquer whether that question was raised on the petition for cert here from --
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3143.061,3150.576,"Indeed it was, Your Honor, it was the primary issue that was raised before the Court at that time under the petitions."
1973.73-437,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3396.491,3399.107,May I ask Mr. Forquer?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3406.12,3407.115,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-437,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3407.115,3409.302,And concluded that --
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3409.302,3409.532,They had met those tests.
1973.73-437,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3409.532,3410.999,They were all satisfied.
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3410.999,3411.528,That’s right.
1973.73-437,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3411.528,3417.035,"Now, what’s the scope of our review, of that determination of the Fifth Circuit?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3417.035,3418.48,"Well, if you followed it."
1973.73-437,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3418.48,3421.079,Are we to do the job of the Fifth Circuit did?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3421.079,3422.583,"Not in our view, Your Honor."
1973.73-437,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3422.583,3423.813,What do you think we should do?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3423.813,3447.252,"I think that you should look at the general result of the Commission’s rate order to find out that if the ultimate conclusions the Commission arrived at were appropriate and reasonable, but not to weigh the evidence as the Court of Appeals was required to do."
1973.73-437,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3714.419,3716.28,And how was that computed?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3716.28,3730.317,"It was a -- the figures, if I recall correctly Mr. Justice Brennan, were from approximately like 20 cents to 25 cents, 24 cents I think it was."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3839.805,3846.224,"Well, this was a reestablishment of just and reasonable rates that have been established in SoLa I?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3846.224,3849.491,For refund purposes Your Honor they were --
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3849.491,3850.752,And just for refund purposes?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3850.752,3853.204,"Yes, well they determine what the amount refunds would be."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3853.204,3859.505,There would be any anything that collected over that they had refund and that happen -- it ended up being a $150 million?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3859.505,3861.426,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.73-437,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3865.193,3869.396,"You mean they just didn't pick the 150 million out of the air, and say that was a fair figure?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3869.396,3898.181,"Well, what happened was that the 20.625 rate for the first period would generate so much and the 21 a quarter, the next period with so much and then the final period up to January 1, 1971 was placed in a percentage of the difference between the SoLa I rates and SoLa II two rates to equate to a $150 million."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3898.181,3908.955,"Well, it nevertheless, I suppose to have the authority to reduce the refund you had to raise -- the Commission had to raise the just and reasonable rate?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3908.955,3910.114,That’s correct.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3910.114,3912.476,"Now, what are you going to do with the work off?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3912.476,3914.604,Well that’s – that’s the point.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3921.165,3927.001,"Well, I know but does the right -- but you’re going to work off -- they can work off the remainder of the refund?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3927.001,3927.865,That is correct.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3927.865,3934.739,"And every time they work off for a little bit of it, I bet the just and reasonable rates goes up?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3934.739,3939.024,"There’s no change in the rate, but they [Voice Overlap] the effect I guess is that they get --"
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3939.024,3949.316,"I didn’t realize -- Are you asserting that Commission may find, may suspend rates or let rates go into effect subject to refund which they did in SoLa I, right?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3949.316,3950.604,That’s right.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3950.604,3959.822,And then establish just and reasonable rates lower than what the rates were and yet forgive a refund?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3959.822,3961.597,Lower than they were or a higher than they were?
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3961.597,3963.966,Lower than have been charged.
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3969.14,3969.948,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3969.948,3976.817,Then they have a proceeding and they establish what the just and reasonable rate is and it is lower than what has been charged?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3976.817,3977.592,That’s right.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3977.592,3987.308,Now do you say they have it -- they have discretion if they find that the just and reasonable rate is lower than what has been charged to forgive a refund?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3987.308,3990.607,I think that they do have authority given a proper --
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3990.607,3992.073,Where is the authority for that?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,3992.073,3997.487,"Well, first of all the Natural Gas Act itself says that they may order refunds."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4001.951,4007.668,So why did they even go to the trouble of resetting just and reasonable rate?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4007.668,4009.235,"To establish the refund levels, Your Honor."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4009.235,4011.268,"Well, they didn’t have to, they could just say --"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4011.268,4026.527,Well but they -- as a matter of fact the staff witness in the case suggested that no refund should be ordered that the -- those who had charged excessive rates would be better of if they retained these amounts and therefore had additional [Voice Overlap]
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4026.527,4043.115,"Well, do you have some judicial authority for the fact that they -- that the Commission may forgive refunds even though it finds that the rate has been charged -- that has been permitted to go into effect subject to refund is higher than what the just and reasonable rate is?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4043.115,4048.651,"In the Hugoton-Anadarko case, Your Honor, one of the Commissions area rate proceedings, the Ninth Circuit so held."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4048.651,4051.779,And that they could just need an order of a refund even though they --
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4051.779,4058.598,"Well, they did not require certain portions of them to be paid back."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4079.512,4088.936,"Well you certainly are -- you certainly are putting the – certainly, you are charging all consumers on all the money for a future exploration?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4088.936,4095.364,"Well they -- one of the -- if you don’t do that perhaps, Your Honor, they won’t have any gas."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4105.787,4109.879,Even though the Commission might have even set a higher price for new gas?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4109.879,4111.014,That’s right they --
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4111.014,4113.96,Or for flowing gas?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4113.96,4128.835,"They did include an element in flowing gas to encourage additional exploration and development, but they did not want to rest on simply the new gas rate as the sole incentive to bringing forth new supplies of gas."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4142.142,4143.368,This $150 million?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4143.368,4145.044,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4145.044,4146.151,Not the old amount?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4146.151,4147.145,Not the old amount.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4161.868,4182.072,"And anybody with flowing gas I suppose and with a refund obligation, the larger the better now, I guess has got to -- had quite an incentive, or quite an advantage in exploring for -- in bidding for a new gas I suppose?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4182.072,4199.97,"Well he -- the only why he is not getting any additional revenue by this he is not having to pay out something that he might otherwise, but he has a very heavy responsibility if he has large refunds to find very large quantities of gas and dedicate it to the interstate marketer, he who will have to pay this."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4199.97,4204.039,Yes but with -- forget the refund for the moment.
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4209.59,4212.274,It has been increased to 22 and three --
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4212.274,4215.666,For not discovering non-cost item -- exploration item?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4215.666,4218.027,"There is a small component in there for that, yes Your Honor."
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4218.027,4220.562,And that is going to be escalated for that purpose too?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4220.562,4244.007,It’s going to be escalated once because of the increase in cost that the Commission found were involved and then there are the contingent escalations to flowing gas rate in the event that additional dedications are made and these dedications do not count until the refund requirements are paid off for those producers who were involved in refunds.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4244.007,4258.616,"So your suggestion is that we -- that is perfectly alright for the Commission to tell all consumers, “well, you’ve been paying unjust and unreasonable rates, but nevertheless we are not going to order a refund because we think we should stimulate further explorations?”"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4258.616,4261.407,We think it they could say I think quite properly.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4273.887,4279.243,Why put it on just to people who have been buying old gas?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4293.78,4305.209,But Your Honor there was no other source to get these additional supplies of gas unless you are going to rely solely on the rate for new gas.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4319.512,4328.527,"Well, has it been a traditional function of rate making to finance expansion?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4328.527,4331.707,"Well, I think that this Court certainly --"
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4331.707,4335.649,And to build up internal sources of capital?
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4335.649,4337.763,This Court indicated in Permian that was entirely --
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4337.763,4339.569,[Voice Overlap] I said traditional.
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4339.569,4341.38,Traditional not in the utility stands.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4341.38,4344.941,"And I agree with you, I know what the Permian said?"
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4344.941,4348.304,Not in the public utility sense it certainly was -- is not traditionally true.
1973.73-437,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4348.304,4349.499,"Yes, true."
1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4349.499,4368.716,But this is a situation wholly different again as this Court pointed out in Permian where the gas producing industry is entirely different situation than the ordinary public utility.
1973.73-437,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4496.778,4500.027,I haven’t found that Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal case.

1973.73-437,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4502.234,4503.635,What was the name of it?

1973.73-437,2,34442,leo_e_forquer,,4515.806,4516.784,No --
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,4539.656,4543.53,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-437,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4563.986,4566.691,"It was a little more than that, wasn’t it?"
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,4576.547,4581.337,"Yes, indeed Your Honor, that’s quite true."
1973.73-437,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4779.121,4781.445,No company’s cost you know.
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,4781.445,4785.478,That’s correct Mr. Justice Douglas they are in fact the Commission --
1973.73-437,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4785.478,4788.944,You have found in this order some discrimination?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,4788.944,4789.481,That’s right.
1973.73-437,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4795.898,4804.723,Didn’t the Permian base in opinion indicate that there was either -- by inference that there was their potential for built-in discrimination?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,4804.723,4806.741,That’s absolutely correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.73-437,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4806.741,4809.627,By my arbitrarily drawing area line?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,4809.627,4828.735,Area lines and also the utilization of composite costs and this was thought by the Court there to be and simply an unavoidable aspect of group regulation that the agency itself was not required to look at the individual financial impacts on each entity being regulated.
1973.73-437,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4828.735,4831.998,Now the chicken has come home to roost?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,4831.998,4836.074,According to some parties.[Laughter Attempt]
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4897.68,4900.774,But the revenue would be somewhat higher [Inaudible]
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,4900.774,4901.694,"No, sir."
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4901.694,4903.462,Why not?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,4903.462,4910.799,The revenue under the order prospectively and I am speaking of prospective revenues only is higher.
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5076.822,5082.114,And who will get the refunds that are probably made in pipelines although they would be passed through?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5082.114,5090.85,"In general, if Commission provides for a passed through from the pipe lines to their distribution customers and then it is turned over to the local state agencies."
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5090.85,5096.158,"So you think, we really are talking about the consumers not just the pipelines in general?"
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5096.158,5096.835,That’s correct.
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5130.32,5135.813,But the Commission must presume and I suppose the Court assumes if you read the Fifth Circuit?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5135.813,5137.705,"Yes, sir I do."
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5137.705,5142.718,That the refunds are given in order to stimulate exploration.
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5146.111,5149.531,In fact one can go even further Mr. Justice White the --
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5149.531,5151.872,Well that’s my entire point?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5151.872,5155.651,"And unless they -- unless, you see here is the thing."
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5165.641,5171.026,But you can also not expend it for exploration at all and still not have the refund?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5171.026,5175.396,"No sir, that’s not correct they have to and each individual company has to make a commitment."
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5175.396,5180.079,But they already have their refund obligation because of that situation [Inaudible]

1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5188.123,5194.352,The Government are given the refund obligation if that is so what it wants.
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5194.352,5194.819,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5219.345,5222.777,You say the commission has conceded that there is error [Inaudible]
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5222.777,5224.127,No as Mr. Forquer was pointed out --
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5224.127,5225.826,What happens if they were quite right?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5230.449,5234.829,They use the word affirmance but they use many other words Mr. Justice White including its remedy.
1973.73-437,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5234.829,5243.932,[Inaudible] that it was an error?
1973.73-437,3,32565,john_r_rebman,,5243.932,5245.07,I don’t think I said that.
1973.73-437,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5361.209,5361.718,Thank you.
