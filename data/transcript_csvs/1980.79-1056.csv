1980.79-1056,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.404,We'll hear arguments next in Northwest Airlines v. Transport Workers.
1980.79-1056,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,81.452,83.154,Thank you.
1980.79-1056,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.795,155.849,I'm not so clear I see the distinction for what you're saying.
1980.79-1056,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,170.441,180.647,"--I think there are two fundamental aspects of the implied right of action cases, as this Court has been debating them over the past few terms that distinguish them from this case."
1980.79-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,245.24,252.327,"I wonder if that's a valid distinction, because it has not expressly created liability on the part of the union to the company."
1980.79-1056,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,252.327,255.631,"--But it has created liability to the employees, and that's the--"
1980.79-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,255.631,264.403,"Then, isn't it like Cannon and the other cases that the question was whether the particular plaintiff could get recovery, not whether the defendant might be liable to somebody else?"
1980.79-1056,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,264.403,266.02,"--But, Your Honor, as I will explain--"
1980.79-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,266.02,269.872,And most of those cases assume that there's some legal duty owed by the defendant to somebody.
1980.79-1056,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,269.872,299.826,"--Yes; what we have here, though, is a situation in which, if both defendants had been, sued together... that is, if the employer and the union had been joined in a suit, or if the employer had been sued alone and had impleaded the unions, there seems to be little question that under case law that this Court has developed as well as cases in the lower federal courts, that there would have been a right of allocation of that liability."
1980.79-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,309.432,311.082,You mean there would have been the right of contribution?
1980.79-1056,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,314.503,314.936,--Yes.
1980.79-1056,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,318.872,319.272,What is the case that holds that?
1980.79-1056,0,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,319.272,328.728,"--I am thinking, for example, of Justice White's opinions in Czosek v. O'Mara, and Vaca v. Sipes."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,1724.261,1730.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1861.715,1863.015,"Well, neither one has ever been sued."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,1863.015,1864.333,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1864.333,1873.189,"Although, certainly, the union could have been sued, clearly, under Title VII, I would say, at the plaintiff's option."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,1873.189,1877.325,"Your Honor, there is no question that unions can be sued under Title VII."
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1882.379,1885.497,And certainly no court's going to hold them liable if they're not sued.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,1885.497,1887.783,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.783,1896.638,"And if both the employer and the union had been sued in this case, it's possible that a judgment would have been entered against both of them."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,1896.638,1898.638,"Well, without getting into the facts--"
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.638,1901.154,I said it's possible; it's possible.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,1901.154,1902.673,"--It is possible, Your Honor; yes."
1980.79-1056,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.673,1925.788,"Well, under, the 46th change in the Rules where the defendant could no longer implead someone whom he said was equally liable and could only implead someone who he said was liable over to him, the plaintiff has its choice of defendant, in effect, does it not?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,1925.788,1928.323,The plaintiff has a choice of defendants here.
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1990.778,1995.515,"Which is to say, Northwest could not have brought the unions into the Laffey suit?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,1995.515,2005.205,We don't know; under our reading of the statute Northwest is not among the class of litigants who is entitled to establish another party's Title VII violations.
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2005.205,2007.157,"Well, that's what I said."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2010.692,2011.692,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.692,2013.977,And couldn't have submitted a claim to the EEOC.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2013.977,2018.613,"Well, they certainly could have asked the EEOC to bring the unions in."
1980.79-1056,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.878,2045.698,"If they have a right to file a charge, do they get a right to sue letter from the EEOC?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2045.698,2051.852,"If they have a right to file a charge, Your Honor, it would work just like any other plaintiff filing a charge."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.173,2065.51,They file a charge that the union has been discriminating against the employees?
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2065.51,2067.445,--We would take the position they could not.
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.445,2071.147,"Well, I know, but that's what's the kind of a charge you're suggesting they must file."
1980.79-1056,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.147,2073.313,"Well, is that right?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2082.335,2083.285,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2106.034,2109.486,"And what would the suit then be, if they get the right to sue?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2113.354,2124.679,"No, this is all predicated... unless I misunderstand the hypothetical... this is all predicated on the fact that a violation of (c)(3) can somehow be asserted by the employer."
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2124.679,2125.796,"Well, assume he can."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2125.796,2126.046,Okay.
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.835,2142.472,"So the right, to sue would be authority to sue, of Northwest, directly to sue the unions, is that it?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2142.472,2144.924,If this is all predicated--
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2144.924,2145.424,"For contribution, for contribution."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2145.424,2152.828,"--Well, this is all predicated under the assumption that the right provided in (c)(3) resides in the employer."
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2154.946,2161.367,The general way that contribution works the ordinary law... let's take two joint tortfeasors.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2182.28,2188.934,"The difference here, Your Honor, is that Northwest is seeking contribution... this is not a regular tort case."
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2190.453,2191.636,"Well, it is a contribution case."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2191.636,2192.921,--It is a contribution case.
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2192.921,2193.588,That's what contribution is.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2193.588,2194.521,"Right, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2194.521,2206.997,"It's not a claim by a defendant that the codefendant wronged him in any independent way, but only that the codefendant should share the liability to the plaintiff."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2206.997,2212.901,"Well, what I'm suggesting is that we have to look at what the substance of that contribution claim is."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.161,2233.03,"Well, that's a matter of defense, isn't it, on the merits?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2233.03,2234.482,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2234.482,2235.732,"Well, it certainly is."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2238.284,2246.54,"Well, it's a defense... oh, I'm sorry; of course, it's a defense on the merits, but it's not a question that has to turn on the merits of the particular controversy."
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2246.54,2247.256,--Controversy.
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.256,2257.43,Isn't it the complaint of the airline that they were willing to do right in 1966 and the union stopped them from that?
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2257.43,2258.28,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.982,2266.036,"I know, but if they get a chance that's what they claim they want to prove."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2266.036,2277.142,"The findings in Laffey... that's the underlying case... which, by the way... Mr. Lacovara neglected to mention that this Court denied certiorari to the underlying Laffey decision."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.142,2282.896,"Could I ask you... I'm sorry, you didn't finish your answer."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2283.896,2298.489,"The findings in Laffey point out that in 1966 what Northwest proposed was for the unions to equalize downing, to lower the wages, of the pursers down to the level of the female employees."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2301.524,2327.222,"Well, my point is that if two people, two joint statute violators get together and take it out on an individual worker, that the individual worker has a right to decide who he's going to sue."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2327.222,2330.857,"That is our position, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2330.857,2333.626,And that there's no remedy against--
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2333.626,2335.828,There is a remedy.
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.165,2344.534,--I don't care; is there a remedy?
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2345.517,2351.271,The remedies... if you're asking whether the aggrieved employee who chooses one has a remedy--
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.271,2355.575,"No, I mean, how does... if he only chooses one--"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2355.575,2356.342,--Right.
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.342,2359.277,--How does one have a chance to get a remedy?
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2359.277,2359.977,Okay.
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.48,2395.034,"What statute, rule, or regulation gives this remedy to the employer?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2395.034,2403.156,"--The remedy that I'm suggesting, the procedure that I'm suggesting is provided by Title VII, that the EEOC can file a charge."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2406.757,2411.995,"So he's... to use the vernacular of the street, he's stuck?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2411.995,2414.447,"Well, he may be stuck--"
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2414.447,2415.247,Is that right?
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2415.247,2416.747,--He may be stuck under--
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.747,2419.865,So he's stuck solely at the will of the employee.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2425.036,2434.059,"--Your Honor, when an employee sues for violations of Title VII, he's not solely bringing a private lawsuit, there are public interests involved here."
1980.79-1056,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.036,2482.023,"That wouldn't be true in a right-to-work state, would it, where the employee might not be a member of the union?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2482.023,2505.888,"Well, that might not be true for that situation, but what generally happens in these type of cases... for example, this is an example of the type of situation I have in mind: many of these Title VII cases are class actions and the plaintiff may be suing not only on its own behalf but on behalf of a large class many of whom may be union workers; union members."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.844,2528.003,Could I... I take it your submission is that at least before the employer should be able to get into court he should make his complaint before the EEOC?
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2528.003,2530.086,"Yes, that's quite--"
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.086,2537.459,"And if the EEOC then gives him a right to sue letter, I suppose you would say he could get into court?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2537.459,2542.763,--Assuming that the employer has the right to invoke the mechanisms under Title VII.
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.846,2547.298,"Well, it seems that... do you say he isn't?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2547.298,2550.184,"--Well, I have grave doubts that he is."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.238,2565.277,"Well, if he's... if he's got grave doubts about that, you wouldn't say, then, that the thing that bars this particular suit is his failure to file with the EEOC?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2568.396,2585.257,"--What I would say, under that circumstance, what bars this suit is the fact that nobody has been able to establish the union's liability under Title VII by the explicit procedures that Congress placed in the statute for establishing such liabilities."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2585.257,2596.065,"You mean, exclusive in the sense that the only person who is permitted to claim that the union violated the Act is the employee?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2596.065,2597.781,That's one half of the equation.
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.781,2598.6,"Well, what's the other one?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2598.6,2607.122,"The other half is, how a party's liability is to be established, first by filing a charge, first by submitting a claim through administrative process."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.122,2610.407,"I know, but you say that an employer can't do that."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2610.407,2624.565,"Well, whoever, can do it, a party should not be subjected to the potential for liability for violating this statute by means outside of the scheme that Congress decided to put into this statute."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.565,2627.767,"Well, if he can't file, it isn't outside the scheme."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2632.753,2634.688,"Well, then, if that is the--"
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.688,2635.255,If you're right.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2639.74,2640.676,--Right.
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.269,2667.177,"Well, I would think then that you... I don't see how you can then conceive that the employee could choose them both and sue them, and get judgment against both of them in one suit."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2667.177,2675.349,"The employee certainly has the right to go after whichever party it wants to, or both of them, if that's its desire."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.349,2700.731,"And suppose... do you think it would be... suppose there's a judgment entered against both the union and the employer, in a suit by the employee, after he's gone through the EEOC and got his right to sue letter, and there's a judgment entered against them both, and the judge says, each one of you is liable for the total amount, but I am going to order you two defendants to share the liability."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2704.952,2713.373,"In your scenario, if I understand it, in the hypothetical, both parties have been charged, both parties have been sued, both parties have been found liable."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.373,2726.115,"And can, then... each one of them is totally liable for the entire amount, but the judge then says to the two defendants, I am going to order you to share the payment?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2726.115,2736.304,"The federal courts have the authority at that point... in fact, Congress provided a procedure for the federal courts which is entirely consistent with the charging requirement."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.682,2765.49,"Well, both defendants say, neither one of us wants to have to pay this entire judgment and so they both, the judge orders them to share it."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2767.525,2772.061,That would be an appropriate order because the scheme had been consistently followed.
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.619,2786.404,"And they could litigate it, they could litigate their respective responsibilities."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2786.404,2786.57,That's correct.
1980.79-1056,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.57,2792.641,"Short of appeal, in Justice White's hypothetical case, each party had been found completely liable."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2792.641,2793.074,--That's right.
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2796.343,2802.514,"But what's the authority that a judge could do that, namely, say, you divide it?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2804.199,2809.65,"Well, Section 706(g) provides that the court can fashion remedies."
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2838.503,0.0,"Well, but are conceding that it does take a statutory authorization for a court to do that, and you're arguing, I gather, that 706(e), is it, some such statutory authority, gives such tests for it?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2849.494,0.0,--Yes.
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2856.748,2858.85,"Well, no, I was thinking as a general proposition."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2866.72,2870.907,You certainly have to have the statutory... know the statutory rulings.
1980.79-1056,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2870.907,2875.459,I'm talking generally about the law of contribution.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2878.161,2900.443,"If you're talking about whether or why a contribution can be recognized as a matter of federal law, and you're talking about a totally... first of all, there has never been a ruling by this Court that there is a right of contribution as a matter of federal law."
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2900.443,2906.914,"Do, you think it takes a statute to have a contribution in federal courts, at all, in any kind of a case?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2906.914,2909.965,If the controversy is between solely private--
1980.79-1056,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.965,2915.352,"That the courts aren't entitled to enforce contribution as a matter of federal common law, so-called?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2915.352,2930.862,"--If the litigation is solely between private litigants and there's no overriding impact on some kind of federal interest, then we would take the position that the Court would not have the authority at that point to fashion a federal common law of contribution, and it would have to await litigation."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2930.862,2935.766,What would you do under Erie if they were from nonresidents?
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2946.622,2949.924,And the sole basis for federal jurisdiction is diversity?
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.924,2962.333,"To order mutual help, could you say that we can order you to share the costs or expenses as joint tortfeasors?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2962.333,2967.701,"If we're talking about an Erie type of situation, okay, the rule to be fashioned would be a--"
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2967.701,2986.948,"That doesn't quite... what worries me... and I realize your time's up; just one point... what worries me is, I don't see why this case is completely controlled by either the Equal Pay Act or Title VII."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2986.948,2990.0,"--The reason, Your Honor, why we feel it is--"
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2990.0,2990.866,"I said, completely."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,2992.866,3001.472,"--The reason why we feel it is, Your Honor, is because we're talking about contribution for liabilities under those two statutes and under nothing else."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3016.664,3029.907,"Suppose a shipowner sues a stevedore company because they were found guilty and it wasn't maybe them, it was the stevedore company."
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,3034.359,3047.953,"--The way this Court has construed those kind of situations in the past is that it has applied maritime law, admiralty law, where the court's legislative powers of common law--"
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3047.953,3053.738,"--think you did something wrong, when you conspired--"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,3053.738,3057.142,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3058.492,3067.665,"--What if by putting on perjured testimony I was found guilty instead of you, can I sue?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,3067.665,3073.251,"If you're asking as a matter of federal law, I suppose--"
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3073.251,3075.52,Does it matter what kind of case it was?
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,3075.52,3078.972,"--Yes, it very definitely does turn on the kind of case."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.972,3081.424,If I say that your perjury caused me to lose a case?
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,3081.424,3088.594,"Well, certainly it would be an open question whether you had a federal remedy or whether you had a state remedy."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3088.594,3089.863,That's right.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,3098.469,3111.693,"Because the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain this controversy, the only basis of a federal interest in this particular controversy is the fact that we're talking about rights and obligations under these two statutes."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3116.43,3122.251,"At this time don't you agree that Northwest has no interest in these statutes at all, they're interested in $32 million bucks?"
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,3122.251,3125.203,"That certainly is their practical interest, Your Honor."
1980.79-1056,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.203,3125.986,That's right.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,3125.986,3133.04,"But our interest is the fact that we've never been adjudicated liable for violation of these statutes, and that's what has to be determined in this case."
1980.79-1056,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3133.04,3135.242,Your time has expired now.
1980.79-1056,1,41747,stephen_b_moldof,,3135.242,3135.592,Thank you.
1980.79-1056,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3135.592,3137.344,Mr. Wallace.
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3137.344,3141.646,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1056,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3229.104,3244.946,"Before you get further into your interesting argument, Mr. Wallace, could you tell me why the Commission has completely reversed its position between the time that this case was in the Court of Appeals and the time it's here?"
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3244.946,3249.315,It has thought letter of the position that it took.
1980.79-1056,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3274.133,3282.154,"It did so, the Court did so in a proceeding that was closed to the public despite demands of the representatives of the public to be there, by a 3-2 vote, didn't it?"
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3282.154,3283.604,"Well, that is correct."
1980.79-1056,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3287.975,3290.475,I just wondered if you were free to tell me why?
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3290.475,3295.796,"--they were deliberating litigation policies, the position to be taken in litigation, this very case."
1980.79-1056,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3300.283,3306.02,But... and so you are not at liberty to say why except you just think this is a better position?
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3306.02,3313.091,"Well, it's the position that the Commission is now taking on having reexamined the question."
1980.79-1056,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3319.495,3320.529,They didn't take any position.
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3321.763,3324.248,--The Commission appeared in the Court of Appeals on its own.
1980.79-1056,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3328.117,3331.485,And you weren't there when the Commission made up its mind?
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3331.485,3333.587,"We were not, at that time."
1980.79-1056,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3342.96,3356.787,"It seemed to me very... I read the excerpts from your brief and the Commission's brief in the Court of Appeals, which appear in the petitioner's reply brief in this court."
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3362.19,3367.677,--The Commission's position before this Court is the position set forth in our brief.
1980.79-1056,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3367.677,3370.26,And it's quite different from the one that was taken in the Court of Appeals.
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3370.26,3372.712,It's quite different with respect to Title VII.
1980.79-1056,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3376.866,3377.116,No.
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3377.116,3380.068,It filed a brief... Title VII.
1980.79-1056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3380.068,3389.941,"Mr. Wallace, has the United States taken a position with respect to whether or not the employer could file a complaint against a union in a case like this with the EEOC?"
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3389.941,3392.793,It has not.
1980.79-1056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3392.793,3394.959,"Do you have one now, or?"
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3394.959,3412.255,"Well, I can say that since there is now provision for commissioner complaints to be issued, any member of the public including an employer can bring to the attention of the Commission or of a commissioner an alleged violation of the statute."
1980.79-1056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3412.255,3426.197,You don't think the provision in the Act that... you don't think the employer on his own... could complain that he's been forced to violate the Act?
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3426.197,3429.382,Only in that manner.
1980.79-1056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.168,3434.803,"All right, let's... well, you say, yes, be could file a complaint."
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3441.357,3445.742,"--It's not a charge, when somebody brings to the attention of a commissioner."
1980.79-1056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.687,3474.911,"But the person, or including the employer who files the complaint or files whatever he files hasn't any right himself to invoke the Commission's action, like an employee?"
1980.79-1056,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3474.911,3476.297,Not so far as I'm aware.
1980.79-1056,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3476.297,3484.636,"So you do take a position, you do take the position that the employer has no right to file a charge with a commissioner?"
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3782.827,3783.044,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1056,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3834.01,3856.459,"If during your bargaining negotiations, and this is in substance what you allege, you were being forced by the union to enter into a discriminatory bargain, couldn't you then have invoked the provisions of 703(c)(3)... whatever it is, and then filed your charge that, don't let the union put this kind of pressure on us?"
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3856.459,3859.911,"--The answer, Mr. Justice Stevens, is I don't know."
1980.79-1056,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3868.117,3872.302,"But the statute has been there all the time, and one can read it, and it says that a person aggrieved can file a charge."
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3875.187,3884.994,"--As far as we've been able to ascertain, the Commission in the 16 years since that statute has been in effect has never entertained a charge from an employer."
1980.79-1056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3884.994,3887.028,"Well, maybe an employer has never tried."
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3887.028,3888.346,That's entirely possible.
1980.79-1056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3888.346,3895.084,"So that you just... you recited it, the Commission said for the first time we've been asked about it in the Court of Appeals."
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3895.084,3895.417,That's right.
1980.79-1056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3896.017,3898.452,"As soon as they're asked about it, they say yes."
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3901.988,3902.604,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-1056,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3917.347,3921.651,It's not irrelevant if we consider it a jurisdictional prerequisite to litigating under Title VII.
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3921.651,3922.367,--Yes.
1980.79-1056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3938.21,3940.162,"Except the Court of Appeals, in, this case."
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3940.162,3945.63,"Except the Court of Appeals in this case, which didn't reach the Title VII issue."
1980.79-1056,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3947.332,3960.39,"Mr. Lacovara, may I just ask you, does your brief cite any cases in this Court, or other, federal cases for that matter, which have held that there may be a suit for contribution unless there is statutory authority for it?"
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3960.39,3962.508,Yes--
1980.79-1056,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3962.508,3964.527,Even without statutory authority?
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3964.527,3964.96,"--Oh, yes, absolutely."
1980.79-1056,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3966.327,3966.729,All right.
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3966.729,3967.496,--Cooper Stevedoring.
1980.79-1056,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3967.496,3968.262,This is in the maritime?
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3968.262,3969.598,It's in the maritime field.
1980.79-1056,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3974.516,3977.502,"Well, maritime's a little unique, isn't it?"
1980.79-1056,3,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3978.168,3978.735,--Thank you.
1980.79-1056,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3978.735,3979.935,"Thank you, gentlemen."
