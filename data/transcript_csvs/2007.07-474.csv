2007.07-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.478,"We'll argument next in Case 07-474, Engquist v. Oregon Department of Agriculture."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,9.823,24.192,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit held that no discrimination against a public employee is prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause unless the targeted person is a member of the suspect class or exercises a fundamental right."
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,79.012,94.053,"Rational-basis review normally doesn't inquire into the actual motive, for example, of the State legislators who impose such a tax or impose such a restriction."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,101.77,102.706,"We are, Your Honor."
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,115.372,116.67,Listen to what I'm saying.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,148.576,157.089,"--Your Honor, we do agree that that last part, Justice Scalia, looking at could there have been a rational basis, is the proper test."
2007.07-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,177.393,181.987,So that what you do in this case... I mean the person is fired and that's all you know.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,190.921,197.73,"--Well, we do think that that can be enough; and, indeed, that's what the government had their opportunity to argue in this case."
2007.07-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,204.335,211.287,"So in that case... and then let's say you're at trial, and you ask: Did you fire this person because she punched in late a few times?"
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,215.768,223.185,"--Well, if it is a counterfactual... I mean, the plaintiff would have the opportunity to negate the facts on whatever that rationale."
2007.07-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,223.185,223.563,"No, no."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,225.7,232.384,"And if it has anything to do with government efficiency, the rational-basis test is that deferential to permit that to go forward."
2007.07-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,232.384,233.445,What about he didn't like him?
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,236.694,241.521,"Even that, Justice Breyer, is enough so long as it's related to government efficiency."
2007.07-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,241.942,242.425,All right.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,257.107,259.245,"--That, by itself, is not because the government has--"
2007.07-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,259.245,259.805,All right.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,301.76,302.384,--Okay.
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.425,318.86,What about on the Federal level?
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,344.507,351.597,"The answer is no, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason is at footnote 18 of our brief, and I believe the Solicitor General doesn't disagree in large amount."
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.873,370.216,And it doesn't matter that the State has civil service remedies that were not used--
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,370.216,370.653,Not--
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,370.653,373.761,--or there were union grievance procedures that aren't used?
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,379.228,380.429,--That is correct.
2007.07-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.699,460.865,"Well, I guess you begin with the proposition that the government must always have a reason for what it does?"
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,460.865,467.958,The government must always have a reason when it discriminates against individuals.
2007.07-474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,467.958,479.844,"Well, discrimination, when you say ""discrimination"", I take it you're meaning discrimination not confined to the discrete categories of racial, age, et cetera."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,503.131,510.486,"That is... that is correct as long as... as long as, Justice Souter, it is not related to government efficiency; that is, if it's like this case, in which--"
2007.07-474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,510.486,511.347,Right.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,514.171,514.83,--Exactly.
2007.07-474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,514.83,537.93,"Then it is the case, then, that if you prevail in this case, that the notion of paradigmatic, at-will employment within the government in any State that recognizes that now, that will, in fact, be eliminated to... to the degree that there is a... a class-of-one cause of action."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,537.93,539.256,"To the contrary, Justice Souter."
2007.07-474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,543.724,558.719,"I thought you just agreed that it would happen in the hypothetical because as I... and maybe I do not understand at-will employment, but I thought the concept of at-will employment was that the individual could be fired for a good reason, a bad reason or no reason at all."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,572.304,577.038,"--Justice Souter, as a practical matter it won't matter... as a practical matter it won't make a difference."
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.0,595.889,"No, no, no, no."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,602.794,606.198,--And if there isn't an efficiency--
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.198,606.666,Right.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,606.666,608.714,--and the State can't articulate an efficiency-based rationale--
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.714,609.088,Right.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,609.088,613.741,--there will be some effect on at-will employment in those rare cases.
2007.07-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,613.741,619.083,So you have a national for-cause employment system.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,623.192,636.684,"Well, except that the cause that the equal protection mandates, the Equal Protection clauses guarantee, is to deferential that as Justice Breyer said, virtually any rationale will suffice if it is--"
2007.07-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,636.684,641.419,But you're getting back to the point the government must always have a reason for what it does.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,643.964,645.696,--That the government must always have a reason?
2007.07-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,645.696,649.35,Must always have a reason for the actions it takes.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,649.35,661.567,"Well, I read this Court's decision in Olech as basically mandating that as well as... you know, as well as its long history on a class-of-one starting with Sioux City and Sunday Lake and Snowden versus--"
2007.07-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,661.567,676.058,"Yes, those are all tax cases, or in Olech, 30 feet as opposed to 15 feet, where there was a clear difference that was not... but there was also an allegation of an invidious motive."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,676.058,679.291,"--And here, of course, the jury found that invidious motive."
2007.07-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,680.855,685.276,It's just hard for me to get that sweeping provision out of Olech.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,685.276,696.518,"--If the Court were worried about at-will employment, it has available to it the possibility of requiring animus just as Justice Kennedy... or possibly in some--"
2007.07-474,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,696.518,697.365,What happens in this situation?
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,718.84,727.367,"--If... if the government articulates a rationale that is objectively based, budget or something like that, yes; the plaintiff can come back and try and rebut."
2007.07-474,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,734.051,742.189,How is it extremely deferential when the employee is going to say that's not the real reason; the real reason was simply spite and animus and personal dislike?
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,742.189,743.936,--Because if the government can put forth--
2007.07-474,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,743.936,744.954,And that goes before the jury.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,744.954,758.057,"--Yeah, I don't believe it goes to the jury, Justice Alito, because under this Court's decision in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, summary judgment stage will incorporate whatever the rationale basis test or review is."
2007.07-474,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,758.057,774.145,"The employee says... look, it seems to me, the employee says in an affidavit the supervisor doesn't like me, and here are the 20 things that the supervisor has done and said over the course of the last five years to indicate personal dislike."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,775.846,785.611,"Again as long as the employer can articulate a reason based on government efficiency, there is no way for that employee to rebut that."
2007.07-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,785.611,788.169,But you're going to have to articulate it in Federal court.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,799.93,801.041,"Well, there are two problems with that."
2007.07-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,807.834,812.676,"But Title VII, there's no... you know, there is no, ""because you don't like me"", it's not because I'm a particular race or--"
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,812.676,820.0,"But if we're positing a frequent filer plaintiff who's bent on trying to file a lawsuit, they can always make a Title VII."
2007.07-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,821.638,823.061,--I'm not worried about a frequent filer.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,826.84,832.713,"--And... and the empirical evidence, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, is that that doesn't happen."
2007.07-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,852.234,855.454,I don't know if that's... that's why I started this.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,890.702,891.423,The existing--
2007.07-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,891.423,893.654,So it seemed to me that's the standard you want to apply.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,901.637,903.995,"--Well, I don't think there is anything quite wrong with that."
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,940.215,941.278,Let's take this case.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,962.721,967.596,"Well, normally it depends on the rationale that's being offered."
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,983.682,987.726,I thought they withdrew from saying that it was a budgetary matter.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,987.726,989.649,"--Well, there were two different budgetary issues."
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.405,1034.536,"Suppose the government... suppose the government comes in and says, we don't want to take a position as to... as to what the reason was; it could have been any one of the following seven... you know, the wheat market collapsed; she came in late five days; some of the jobs she did she didn't do well; she dressed inappropriately on the job; her co-workers didn't like they are... you know."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1036.911,1039.3,--The government can offer those.
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.3,1041.236,How far... does it have to pick a reason?
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1041.766,1042.487,Absolutely not.
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.673,1047.279,"--So long as there is conceivable reason, the court would grant summary judgment?"
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1047.279,1048.812,We think that's right.
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1049.576,1051.811,I thought you did not agree with that in your brief.
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.279,1053.09,"That's what I thought, too."
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1053.09,1056.9,--you said no hypothetical justification is there.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1068.208,1070.068,--I might have misunderstood Justice Scalia's question.
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1079.579,1087.078,"All those facts are true facts, but the government isn't claiming that any one of them was the reason."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1093.622,1094.168,The plaintiffs--
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.168,1097.728,But here are seven perfectly conceivable reasons.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1097.728,1102.742,--The government has the ability to put that forth and the plaintiff has the ability to negate that.
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.852,1105.647,"What do you mean, to negate it?"
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1109.005,1110.818,As... to negate the facts.
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.818,1114.955,But the government is not purporting that... to say that it's the actual reason.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1114.955,1115.517,Justice--
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.517,1125.043,"The government is saying had she been dismissed for this reason, and we really don't know whether that was the reason or not, but had she been dismissed for this reason it would have been rational."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1125.043,1130.839,"--So long as, Justice Scalia, that rationale is itself grounded in the facts."
2007.07-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.386,1139.933,"Well, I didn't understand your position to be that, but that--"
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1139.933,1147.161,--The test here is... the test I'm trying to offer is one of objective... objective... whether the rationale is objectively falsifiable.
2007.07-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1147.161,1151.677,Can I ask you more... perhaps a more abstract question about this class-of-one?
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1179.836,1184.163,"That is a problem, I think, under this Court's decision in Olech generally."
2007.07-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1185.458,1186.991,Do you think Olech was wrongly decided?
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1186.991,1187.74,--I do not.
2007.07-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1190.66,1199.236,I don't find anything in Olech that says that every action that does not have a reason is constitutionally infirm.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1199.236,1203.701,"--Let me go back, Justice Kennedy, to answer your question more directly."
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1222.46,1225.522,All of those involved a group characteristic.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1253.603,1262.334,"--Justice Ginsburg, I don't quite think that describes the fact of Harrah v. Martin in which it was a challenge to an individual termination decision by the school board."
2007.07-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1277.53,1294.399,"No, but you could... you could take sentiment... I thought you could break the cases, for the most part, into two parts; one, what Justice Ginsburg said, and that's where the real reason is some kind of general characteristic, of a disfavored group."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1325.794,1326.699,"--Well, I will try."
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.317,1388.018,But you brought up... you said this is 1983.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1421.067,1433.529,"I don't quite think that... I think the Court has already dealt with that in Olech by affirming, essentially, a 1983 cause of action based on an individual person's claim."
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1441.855,1471.733,"Well, maybe because 1985(3) is in a discrimination context, The Court could say 1983... we know the classification to which Justice Breyer was referring, tax classifications, zoning classifications, but this group of claims we're cutting out."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1471.733,1476.151,"--But the statutory test... text, Justice Ginsburg, is the same."
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1477.714,1481.12,But it's a... it's a general statute.
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1496.285,1498.269,--I would agree with that.
2007.07-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1511.34,1530.086,"Well, it certainly opens a can of worms to say that you take every claim against the government, every claim of wrongdoing by the government, and make it an equal protection claim because you say other people were treated properly and I was treated improperly; therefore, I have an equal protection claim."
2007.07-474,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1530.086,1536.988,"--Except, Justice Ginsburg, we've had this cause of action now for 26 and 27 years in two circuits; we have it in nine."
2007.07-474,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1547.5,1548.531,"Thank you, Mr. Katyal."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1550.624,1568.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is consistent with this Court's recognition, in other constitutional contexts, that Federal court is simply not the forum in which to second-guess everyday decisions made by public employers."
2007.07-474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1613.877,1629.324,"The Ninth Circuit decision would rule out the case where an employee says: I was the most qualified person for this position by far, but the supervisors took a bribe from a rich uncle to promote somebody else."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1629.324,1630.12,Yes.
2007.07-474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1630.12,1631.449,That would be out?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1631.449,1633.668,That would be out as an equal protection claim.
2007.07-474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1637.93,1640.087,"The scapegoat case, too, would be out?"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1640.087,1640.539,--Yes.
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1643.429,1663.044,"Why... but we have said that... that there is a constitutional claim if the reason the person was not hired is that the person did not belong to the political party that the... that the hiring person belonged to, the current administration."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1663.044,1663.559,--And--
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.559,1668.683,You said you can't turn down somebody just because she's a Democrat or a Republican.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1668.683,1670.183,--That's correct.
2007.07-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1704.948,1718.771,"Let me ask, following up on Justice Ginsburg's question: Suppose it's not a class-of-one, but it's a class of two or three because, on two or three occasions they fired somebody because he wouldn't pay the supervisor a bribe."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1725.705,1730.782,"No, no, Justice Stevens, and again to be clear--"
2007.07-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.782,1732.018,If it's not a class of one--
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1732.018,1732.689,--I keep throwing up--
2007.07-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1732.689,1735.828,--Do you say no or yes to whether there would be a cause of action?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1735.828,1737.061,--No.
2007.07-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1767.535,1773.185,"No, but, as your friend points out, the constitutional provision says ""any person""."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1780.794,1782.7,"--Admittedly, Chief Justice Roberts."
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1789.945,1791.478,Do you think Olech was correctly decided?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1791.478,1792.617,"Yes, yes."
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1794.617,1797.881,And public employment is different just because it's going to be a big problem?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1798.411,1805.641,"--Not because it's going to be a big problem, but because the regulatory context is significantly different, we think, than the employment context."
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1814.17,1829.728,"--Well, but we're presuming that there is an objective reason for promoting or retaining... the person has a college degree and so forth... but that that person is rejected anyway because of dislike."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1829.728,1832.695,--But... but again--
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.695,1833.818,That's the hypothetical.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1836.505,1845.003,--You might have an unusual employment case in which an employer has drawn up a list of objective criteria.
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1851.92,1856.295,But then we say that there is a subset of unusual cases where we will allow the cause of action?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1856.295,1857.013,--No.
2007.07-474,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1877.957,1881.299,But there are areas outside of employment where there's a lot of discretion.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1899.978,1902.759,"Because it's regulatory and enforcing, law enforcement."
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1904.54,1906.961,I'm having trouble hearing both the question and the answer.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1906.961,1913.614,As I understand... I don't know if you want me to try to restate the question or if you want to do it.
2007.07-474,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1913.614,1920.501,"Well, the question was: Don't you run into the same problem of discretion outside of the employment context?"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1934.808,1943.414,"But, again, there I think the... hopefully, the norm in law enforcement is a relatively objective standard."
2007.07-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.368,1986.883,"Yes, but those are all considerations that would be an adequate defense to a claim."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,1997.251,2020.945,"Well... and certainly I'm somewhat perhaps surprised by Petitioner's argument today because I understand Petitioner's argument to almost concede the point that summary judgment should have been given to the... to the State's defendants in this case because in fact, with regard to each of the three employment decisions that are at issue in this case, the State and the defendants did proffer and--"
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2020.945,2037.486,"But we are concerned about the case... let's just assume, just take it as a hypothetical case... where there is an arbitrary and vindictive reason for hiring the employee and it has nothing to do with race, sex, or other recognized suspect or improper categories."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2041.671,2042.392,--No.
2007.07-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2065.676,2067.224,"Well, isn't that an odd system?"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2087.809,2095.527,"Well, the... often the real reason... and this Court has made this observation in particular in legislative contexts."
2007.07-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2109.425,2117.983,"Well, but that's with respect to legislative or regulatory action, where there are important reasons not to inquire into the motives of the legislators."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2122.141,2123.747,"Well, two points, Your Honor."
2007.07-474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2148.926,2152.378,That's not... you know that that's not the position they took in their brief.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2174.491,2177.1,"--Agreed, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2189.77,2196.702,It seems to me that you want us to write an opinion that says there are some instances where the government can act arbitrarily and unreasonably.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2196.702,2206.807,"--We would ask you to write an opinion, Justice Kennedy, that says that, within the public employment context, there are no class-of-one equal protection claims."
2007.07-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.807,2208.744,"Well, you think the answer is yes, I mean, because--"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2208.744,2209.259,Yes.
2007.07-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2209.259,2213.085,"--because the Administrative Procedures Act forbids arbitrary, capricious action."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2214.68,2214.961,Yes.
2007.07-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.961,2217.85,--does not constitutionalize all--
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2217.85,2218.287,Yes.
2007.07-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.287,2219.476,"--arbitrary, capricious behavior--"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2219.476,2219.85,Yes.
2007.07-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.85,2220.427,--of the Federal--
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2221.02,2221.519,And there--
2007.07-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.519,2222.054,--or the State government.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2222.054,2225.677,"--There will and probably are going to be other remedies, but not a Fourteenth Amendment remedy."
2007.07-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.677,2226.129,Yes.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2226.129,2226.893,Absolutely.
2007.07-474,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2226.893,2227.408,So the answer is yes.
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2228.001,2233.593,And that's because of existence of other avenues of redress.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2233.593,2234.75,Not solely.
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2261.099,2262.004,I understood that the argument--
2007.07-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.004,2268.377,--your opponent's statement that this really has not generated an awful lot of litigation.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2270.189,2275.216,"I think so far as anyone can determine, he's right to date."
2007.07-474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2345.235,2353.109,"In Oregon, is... would there be a civil service remedy available to someone in this situation?"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2353.109,2357.588,"There would be admittedly very limited remedies under the civil service laws, per se."
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.787,2418.655,"But as far as the Federal law claim is concerned, you'd urge us to come out the same way, even if this case came up before the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, right?"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2418.655,2419.233,--Yes.
2007.07-474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2426.607,2433.305,The Administrative Procedure Act doesn't apply to State... to State procedures.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2434.432,2435.025,--Right.
2007.07-474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2435.025,2436.117,--governing Federal agencies.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2436.117,2436.694,Right.
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.694,2439.287,"But as to Federal employment, you'd say the same?"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2439.287,2439.802,Yes.
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.802,2443.522,And you'd say the same as if there were no State remedies for--
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2443.522,2444.053,Yes.
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.053,2447.738,--employment discrimination by the State.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2447.738,2448.814,"Yes, we would."
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.814,2453.22,Because the State has a right to employ at will?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2453.22,2465.028,"Yes, subject to whatever limitations there may be and other affirmative sources of law such as a collective bargaining agreement or some other State or Federal statutory remedy."
2007.07-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2465.574,2468.558,What exactly is the analytic basis of that?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2484.552,2489.501,The former... the former within the context of public employment.
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2492.859,2502.23,--But what authority do you have for us to parse different governmental actions and say some are subject to the Equal Protection Clause and some are not?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2502.23,2503.855,"Well, again I don't know--"
2007.07-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2503.855,2514.071,Other than the convenience of the government... it might be more efficient for the government... you want us to say that the government can act arbitrarily with respect to employees?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2514.071,2519.925,"--And, again, I don't know that the Federal Government discusses peremptory challenges, and I'll leave that to them."
2007.07-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2532.626,2537.875,"--Oh, but that's very different, because those cases say that those individuals have no First Amendment rights."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2550.586,2553.976,--But... but... maybe I shouldn't say again.
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.761,2584.962,Why can't you simply say that they are not being denied equal protection of the law?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2593.848,2594.913,--And--
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.913,2597.162,That's certainly an equal protection.
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2600.489,2601.519,--Agreed.
2007.07-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2601.519,2603.862,Why isn't that equal protection of the law?
2007.07-474,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2603.862,2609.032,"Except this wasn't... this wasn't employment at will, right?"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2609.032,2611.185,Not precisely.
2007.07-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.613,2654.279,What proportion of your workforce is really hired at will?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2658.043,2663.962,"As a matter of fact, none of the assistant attorneys general, including me, have any protection."
2007.07-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.942,2681.97,"Don't have you some kind of civil service system, too?"
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2681.97,2685.25,Not precisely.
2007.07-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.936,2697.653,So that implies people who are employed at will are the exception rather than the rule?
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2697.653,2698.901,Absolutely.
2007.07-474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2745.415,2755.675,"What do you say to the argument that the conceivable-basis test is appropriate when we are judging legislation, because we don't know what goes through the minds of individual legislators."
2007.07-474,1,32056,janet_metcalf,,2769.265,2772.233,I think the difference is not that great.
2007.07-474,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2792.802,2793.769,"Thank you, Ms. Metcalf."
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2802.484,2812.012,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two types of class-of-one claims that should not be recognized in the public-employment context."
2007.07-474,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2836.737,2854.041,"Ma'am, the reason that we didn't say that same thing in Oleck is because in the taxation area or the easement area we simply don't have the great number of cases and also because animus is more easily established."
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2854.041,2854.901,It is similar.
2007.07-474,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2870.222,2882.514,"Well, I wondered if I was right, you know; that I thought that maybe, looking back, that there is something about zoning and taxation where it normally is alleged that it's rule-making activity."
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2907.627,2915.547,"There is some support in the case law, but what I think your concurring opinion was trying to do was to help local and State governments."
2007.07-474,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2939.521,2943.784,"Well, I agree with all of that, but... so the Equal Protection Clause doesn't apply?"
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2943.784,2945.172,"Sure, it applies."
2007.07-474,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2980.533,2982.657,So you think the Equal Protection Clause applies--
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2982.657,2983.878,--Yes.
2007.07-474,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2983.878,2989.248,--in any case of public employment... what... that's satisfied?
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2989.248,2991.374,It doesn't... no.
2007.07-474,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3007.209,3008.975,But the Equal Protection Clause doesn't balk about classes.
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3010.317,3017.176,"That's correct, and... and in First Amendment... and that's a different amendment, but in the Fourteenth Amendment there is the Batson context."
2007.07-474,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.153,3058.909,"It doesn't talk about equal protection, actually, it talks about equal protection the law; and if... if the law in the government employment context is that you can be dismissed at will, or for a number of reasons, so long as everybody is subject to that same law, it would seem to be no discrimination in the law?"
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3058.909,3062.515,"Well, we are not relying on the text of the Equal Protection Clause."
2007.07-474,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.515,3063.658,"Oh, don't rely on the text, certainly."
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3064.344,3066.782,What we are relying on are two principles.
2007.07-474,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3074.214,3079.885,When you do that with the two cases that I raised with Miss Metcalf?
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3093.52,3098.5,"Right, well, one is criminal conduct, and on the scapegoat case I actually don't think that's such a bad thing."
2007.07-474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3145.68,3147.696,Can we... can we meet your objection--
2007.07-474,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3147.696,3156.912,"In a mixed motives case, both ill will and a... some reason, she was also late to work... you would win that case."
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3156.912,3157.676,Well--
2007.07-474,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.676,3161.535,"If you have one good reason and one bad reason, the bad reason doesn't trump the good reason."
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3161.535,3162.643,--That's right.
2007.07-474,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3173.343,3187.402,"But a public employee applies for a 30-foot easement that he is entitled to, and doesn't receive it; and the mayor says and by the way I don't like you, so you're fired: A, you don't get the easement, B, you're fired."
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3193.383,3212.296,"Well, if the mayor doesn't give the employee a grievance, in her capacity as a citizen she has a suit under Olech; but in her termination claim, she... unless she can allege membership in an identifiable class, she doesn't have an equal protection right to be free from just pure arbitrariness... 16--"
2007.07-474,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3212.296,3213.278,But that just states your conclusion.
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3213.968,3214.327,--Why?
2007.07-474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3260.822,3289.342,"--Would it meet your concern if we held number one, yes, there may be a class of claim in the public employment context, but any reason that would be a lawful reason for discharge under the at-will rule is a... a reason that would satisfy the test; and therefore it would be the real outlier that would ever get to the jury?"
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3289.342,3303.026,"Well, in the at-will context, if an employer says you're fired and gives no reason, that's legitimate; but in their case at least by the time a lawyer is hired and the case goes to court, the State is having... has to articulate a basis that could be second-guessed."
2007.07-474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3326.235,3327.498,"Well, let me ask you this."
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3341.853,3342.368,No.
2007.07-474,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3342.368,3343.288,Okay.
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3347.678,3349.051,Yes.
2007.07-474,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3376.137,3378.492,So we should cite there is no constitutional right to be a policeman?
2007.07-474,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,3379.869,3381.885,"Well, no."
2007.07-474,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3405.531,3407.278,"Thank you, Ms. Blatt."
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3410.59,3420.179,"The Ninth Circuit in this case, Your Honor, has cut out all claims conceivable or otherwise, and that is contrary to the text of the Equal Protection Clause in this Court's precedent."
2007.07-474,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3420.179,3431.831,"Do you agree with me that if we adopted a rule that says that anything that goes for at-will employment goes for one-person-class equal protection, and that that in effect would eliminate any cause of action?"
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3431.831,3436.732,"It would, Justice Souter, under the formal rule; that is, no reason alone is sufficient."
2007.07-474,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3459.038,3461.833,You keep stressing the text of the Equal Protection Clause.
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3468.284,3469.61,No.
2007.07-474,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3476.764,3486.416,"It talks about laws, but it extends to situations where what's being... the unequal treatment is not stemming from the law, but from executive or administrative action."
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3486.416,3488.213,"That's quite right, Justice Alito."
2007.07-474,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3490.386,3497.881,"And in the other example, are there not situations where it's been held to apply that might not fall within the literal language of the clause?"
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3497.881,3500.864,"--I'm not sure I got that down, sir."
2007.07-474,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3500.864,3504.643,You think in all other respects it's read literally?
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3504.643,3519.433,"I'm not sure if in all other respects it is, but with respect to the relevant questions here... that is, does this clause apply to individual agency actions, this Court has held so in 1879 in Missouri versus Lewis, and has held so consistently ever since."
2007.07-474,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3550.735,3553.64,What is your answer to their Batson analogy?
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3553.64,3577.27,"Batson I think supports exactly what we are saying, which is this Court has said we don't review on rational basis, actions by a prosecutor that are motivated, strikes that are motivated by the trial, that are... that are for a good trial; but if the rationale of the prosecutor is I don't like the disabled person, or I don't like--"
2007.07-474,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3577.27,3579.251,"No, but you're adding the class aspect."
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3587.608,3596.091,--I don't quite think that this Court has confronted that specific issue about whether it's an individual class-of one juror case.
2007.07-474,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3608.257,3622.095,I thought if you have a peremptory challenge it means that you can't challenge on any basis other than the group... the groups that Batson has recognized.
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3647.35,3664.187,"Justice Ginsburg, the language in Batson and J.E.B. was qualified by as saying so long as it related to the task at hand; and the Seventh Circuit and indeed, the D.C. Circuit last year referred to that language and talked about an exemption if the prosecuter's motive was personal, as it is in this case."
2007.07-474,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3664.187,3678.023,Has there ever been a challenge to the exercise of peremptory challenge on the ground that the challenge was unrelated to the selection of an impartial jury?
2007.07-474,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3678.023,3681.568,In the Seventh Circuit decision the court said this would stay the cause of action.
2007.07-474,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3685.209,3686.519,"Thank you, Counsel."
