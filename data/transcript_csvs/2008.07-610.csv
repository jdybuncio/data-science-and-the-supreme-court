2008.07-610,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.292,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-610, Locke v. Karass."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,6.559,27.284,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case addresses whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments permit public employers to compel nonunion employees to subsidize the union's expressive speech of a political nature in a public forum, specifically litigation in courts and before administrative agencies not involving their bargaining unit."
2008.07-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,54.836,62.785,"But, of course, they wouldn't be subsidizing it if -- if, indeed, it is some kind of a -- essentially an insurance scheme."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,79.09,83.995,"I would respectfully disagree, Justice Scalia, but my answer to your question--"
2008.07-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.995,87.821,"It doesn't seem to me fair to call it ""subsidizing"" if, in fact, that's what's going on."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,87.821,90.789,"--Well, it is also not fair, Justice Scalia, to call it ""insurance""."
2008.07-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.316,98.315,I don't know because that wasn't inquired into by the court below.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,110.872,124.134,"--Well, I think we can rely, Justice Scalia, on the admissions contained in MSEA's brief, which clearly concedes that, in fact, SEIU has no enforceable obligations under its affiliation arrangement with MSEA."
2008.07-610,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,124.134,127.351,"Well, if we don't call it ""insurance"", can we all it ""pooling""?"
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,127.351,130.77,"Well, of course, that -- that is what they call it, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-610,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.423,160.212,"Mr. Young, I thought that in Ellis the litigation -- the Ellis Court said that that litigation did not have as its subject matter negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,160.212,168.116,"--I don't believe that's the case, Justice Ginsburg, because Ellis dealt with enforcing a bargaining agreement."
2008.07-610,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,168.116,171.443,I'm quoting from -- I'm quoting from that decision at page 453.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,180.751,193.058,"Well, of course, Justice Ginsburg, the -- some of the litigation did involve enforcing another bargaining unit's agreement in bankruptcy proceedings."
2008.07-610,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,195.463,197.526,"Well, are you saying the Court got it wrong?"
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,206.148,206.897,"--Well, that -- that--"
2008.07-610,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.897,211.144,That's the only thing that could be germane.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,215.035,220.717,"--Well, I'm trying -- I'm -- I'm trying to find the specific language, Justice Ginsburg, and I apologize for my inadequacy in this regard."
2008.07-610,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,250.926,264.107,"Do you want to stand or fall on the all-or-nothing argument that nonmembers can never be required to pay for any extra-unit litigation expenses, or do you have an -- an additional argument?"
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,264.107,265.905,"Well, no, Justice Alito."
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,287.503,294.047,"Well, do you take -- do you take that as -- as -- as meaning that the union couldn't buy litigation insurance?"
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,294.047,296.718,"Real insurance, Justice Souter?"
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,298.469,306.198,Some of those -- some of those premiums are going to subsidize the defense in -- in -- in cases beyond this bargaining unit.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,307.2,313.213,"--Well -- but the distinction, Justice Souter, I think is discussed in the brief, amicus brief, filed by Pacific Legal Foundation."
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,325.083,341.481,"So -- so in your view, then, even if the agreement with the -- with the parent union in this case involved an explicit obligation on the part of the parent to come in and defend in -- if litigation arose in this unit, that would still be bad?"
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,341.481,346.683,--It would add the -- the insult of the--
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,346.683,347.868,"Well, I'm not interested in insults."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,349.943,354.988,"--We believe it would not be if the international affiliate were the insurer, Justice Souter."
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,354.988,365.643,Then -- and -- and -- and you do take the position that a -- a genuine insurance policy issued by an insurer would not violate the constitutional standard?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,365.643,368.123,"That -- that is the -- that is our argument, Justice Souter."
2008.07-610,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,368.123,375.403,Even though -- even though there may be a great disconnect between the premiums and the needs of the particular unit?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,398.203,402.595,"I -- I don't think -- well, I don't think I would concede the premise of your question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,424.069,430.831,"Yes, but it's based on the experience of the whole -- the whole cohort of insureds."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,430.831,431.786,--It's also--
2008.07-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.786,460.724,And the Chief Justice's question says: Can a -- can a -- a local that is certainly on the basis of past experience not going to need this insurance nearly as much as other locals -- can it enter into an insurance arrangement with other locals to buy the insurance for all of the locals even though it knows that it won't benefit very much from that insurance policy?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,460.724,461.211,--I'm sorry.
2008.07-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.851,463.083,That was -- he was trying to help you.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,463.083,464.99,"And I'm sorry, Chief Justice Roberts."
2008.07-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.99,466.144,"You should have said, yes, Chief Justice."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,466.846,472.645,"And -- and I -- and I appreciate the help, Mr. Chief Justice, and your pointing that out, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,486.996,494.105,Does that mean that each time they buy an insurance policy they have to investigate which locals are going to get the most benefit out of it?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,494.105,497.025,"--Well, I don't think that's a -- that's a decision for the locals."
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,503.662,512.296,Would you give one answer to the Chief Justice on the facts he gave and a different one if the record showed that everybody got a proportional benefit out of the group policy?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,512.296,516.547,"I don't -- no, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,519.951,523.496,"So your answer doesn't depend, then, on the facts that he included in that question?"
2008.07-610,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,523.496,525.277,He is not trying to help you.
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.073,531.352,"I'm not sure he was, either."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,531.352,539.272,"--Well, one looks for it where one can find it, Justice Stevens and Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,551.159,553.265,Does that mean all insurance policies are bad?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,553.265,554.001,"--No, no, no."
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.598,597.575,"Well, there was -- there was mutuality of obligation in the hypothesis that I gave you in which the agreement with the parent union required an affirmative obligation of the parent union to come in and defend if litigation arose."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,600.34,601.357,And I -- and I--
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,601.357,605.884,"So the -- so the criterion has got to be something other than mutuality of obligation, right?"
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,605.884,607.12,"--And it assuredly is, Justice Souter."
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,607.12,608.524,And what is the other distinction?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,608.524,617.833,The other distinction has to be that it is not -- it is -- the problem also arises from the nature of the forced relationship.
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,627.656,631.433,"We -- we -- we start with that premise, but what is the other distinction, then?"
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,638.558,645.414,"Well, the mutuality of obligation coupled with true rate setting in the sense that there is a -- there is--"
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,645.414,648.771,What -- what is -- what has rate setting got to do with -- with your basic point?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,677.744,690.613,"--Well, the distinction, Justice Souter, would be that there is -- it doesn't seem to me that there is a -- there is a larger pool created than just a union litigation pool in the insurance context."
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,694.161,696.111,I don't know whether that's true or not.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,711.308,720.678,"--I don't know of an insurance company that's quite that specific, Justice Souter, nor have I ever heard of labor -- labor union insurance -- labor litigation insurance."
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,722.834,723.914,Neither do I.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,723.914,726.835,"Certainly there is not on this record that would suggest so, sir."
2008.07-610,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,726.835,729.066,I did want to understand your position.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,763.631,765.71,"Well, of course if the other union--"
2008.07-610,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,765.71,767.975,What -- what -- what harm are we trying to prevent here?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,767.975,772.284,"--Well, obviously First Amendment harm, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-610,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,775.392,778.812,The First Amendment can be -- can be a sword or a shield.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,786.545,787.465,"--Excuse me, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-610,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,822.155,823.325,What I don't understand about--
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,823.325,825.123,"I'm sorry, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-610,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,825.123,826.667,--Finish because there's something--
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,826.667,827.403,"Thank you, sir."
2008.07-610,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,868.996,870.509,That's not quite the hypothetical.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,895.142,896.874,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-610,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.874,904.528,"I don't see why the objects of collective bargaining the, objects of union -- of the union, are not being fulfilled."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,904.528,912.102,Because that goes beyond the free rider rationale which justifies the agency shop in the earlier cases such as Hansen and Street.
2008.07-610,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,962.926,964.674,--That's the part I don't understand.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1052.624,1060.419,"--Under Lehnert, Justice Breyer, the expenditures which you posit would be chargeable and are not at issue here."
2008.07-610,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1060.419,1060.902,Fine.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1083.187,1085.999,Because benefit has never been the touchstone.
2008.07-610,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1090.203,1091.747,I don't want you to tell me about cases.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1096.309,1100.603,--Because we are talking about public -- political speech of a public nature.
2008.07-610,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1100.603,1105.431,I said there is no politics in any of these expenditures.
2008.07-610,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1111.756,1113.46,Why does it have to be political speech?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1132.231,1134.119,And I may--
2008.07-610,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1134.119,1139.743,But that's the reasoning that you seem to accept and I guess all human activity is banned.
2008.07-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1146.727,1147.834,"Well, it isn't banned."
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.729,1177.54,I'd be interested in your comments on this dialogue.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1177.54,1180.804,"--I'd be happy to jump in here somewhere, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-610,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1207.246,1226.023,"But why isn't litigation -- what I don't understand is how you draw a line between the -- the negotiation of an agreement, where Lehnert said this kind of pooling is okay, and the enforcement of the agreement."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1245.731,1248.917,"For the -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-610,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1309.551,1319.842,"I don't understand why enforcing, one thing is making the agreement and there you agree as you must because of our Lehnert decision you can't have these pooling arrangements."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1325.858,1328.825,I think that would go back as far as Justice Marshall and Marbury.
2008.07-610,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1335.134,1337.868,"Begins begins that's, that's my point."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1346.674,1356.263,"The distinction is, Justice Ginsburg, that the negotiation of the agreement does not occur in a public forum, whereas litigation does, and that's the distinction we would draw."
2008.07-610,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1356.263,1361.699,I thought the distinction you were drawing was whether or not the collective bargaining agreement applies to the particular union.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1375.676,1381.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry if I was confusing."
2008.07-610,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1387.576,1388.469,Of the particular unit.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1388.469,1389.468,Of the particular unit.
2008.07-610,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1391.028,1410.506,"And I suppose you would also concede that if the bargaining agreement is exactly the same, you know a number of units have exactly the same bargaining agreement, which I would suppose is a not uncommon situation, but litigation with respect to the terms of the bargaining agreement even though it happens to involve a different unit is also chargeable to the particular unit."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1410.506,1412.553,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, we would not concede that."
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.126,1459.535,"Does that mean, because I want to be sure -- you exclude the librarian example of Justice Breyer?"
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1459.535,1465.453,The librarian I think would fall under the general Lehnert test.
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.453,1466.498,So which side?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1468.483,1471.026,"There were a lot of sides there, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.026,1476.774,I understand you to be saying they could not charge the nonmember for the expenses of the Hawaiian librarian.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1476.774,1485.677,"I think it was the Hawaiian commemoration that Justice Breyer referred to that I think I had to rethink, because it was a public speech in a public forum."
2008.07-610,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.878,1505.42,"The librarian in Hawaii researching something that the plaintiff has no interest in spending money on, would that be prohibited."
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1505.42,1512.495,"Well, here, Justice Stevens, we are simply talking about of course the international affiliate."
2008.07-610,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1520.71,1524.052,Could you tell us two hypotheticals.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1538.188,1539.202,"Well, of course they'd be allowed to."
2008.07-610,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1540.484,1542.341,Against nonmembers?
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1551.135,1555.038,"--The public celebration, no; the librarian, I believe so, yes."
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1555.038,1563.85,You have several times mentioned the public forum as having a significance in drawing the line and I'm not sure I follow you there.
2008.07-610,0,46653,w_james_young,,1565.192,1585.279,"Well, I think -- well, Justice Souter, that arises from the Court's determinations on things like public relations and lobbying and the distinction it makes, the distinction for instance in Lehnert between the teacher's voice articles and the reserve public education program."
2008.07-610,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1607.829,1608.878,Let me ask you this.

2008.07-610,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.24,1640.176,Thank you counsel.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1646.473,1668.26,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: When this Court in Abood described the kinds of expenditures that bargaining agents are are required to engage in and that necessitate a rule that requires all represented employees including objecting nonmembers to pay their share services of lawyers is what the court first mentioned.
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1690.861,1692.25,But that's not what we are talking about.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1709.587,1725.032,"--But the question Mr. Chief Justice whether that, I should add if that unit wants to not neither go it alone nor give a free ride to objecting nonmembers can they avail itself."
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1725.032,1735.167,If the litigation is not germane to the unit where people object to that unit's collective bargaining agreement they are not free riding on anything.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1735.167,1740.697,They are free riding on the same thing that Lehnert says they cannot free ride on.
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1788.473,1793.394,What if there is no -- I guess I'm getting into the Solicitor General's position here.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1816.195,1826.518,There are three problems with that contention by the Solicitor General which the petitioners have adopted for the first time in their reply brief.
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1890.972,1892.567,Exactly -- I'm sorry.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1897.863,1900.702,--It was raised in the reply brief in Lehnert.
2008.07-610,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1924.084,1940.921,But what did the Court mean in Lehnert when it said there must be some indication the payment is for service that may ultimately inure to the benefit of members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization?
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1940.921,1954.855,"--What -- what the Court meant by that, I believe, Justice Ginsburg, is that -- well, look at the examples the Court gave of what does not -- or the Court referred to certain kinds of payments a local union could make which are not part of an affiliation fee payment."
2008.07-610,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1985.372,2010.488,"Suppose, let's say, that one or more locals someplace else in the country are involved in very, very expensive litigation; and, as a result, the international assesses all of the locals a fee to pay -- to pay for that litigation but at the same time adopts a position that it is extremely unlikely in the future that the international will ever subsidize any other local union litigation expenses."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2019.141,2030.026,"If it were a special assessment for a specific purpose, I think under -- it is not embraced by Lehnert's rationale."
2008.07-610,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2059.778,2077.21,"Well, if you concede that, then aren't you conceding there has to be some standard by -- under which to assess whether the local union that is being required to pay the fee for extra-unit litigation expenses is getting something back in return?"
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2077.21,2081.381,"--I think not, Your Honor, for -- for two reasons."
2008.07-610,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2085.066,2091.688,It's not necessary for there to be any standard under which to assess that they are getting anything back in return?
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2094.546,2100.217,"--Not beyond -- and again the question isn't presented, but not beyond what Lehnert found necessary."
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2121.785,2143.185,"So if you have a situation where there is a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that the union thinks requires the employer to provide air conditioning in the plant, the local up in Nome, Alaska has to support that extra -- extra-unit litigation even though it will never have any benefit for it?"
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2143.185,2150.914,"Just as Lehnert plainly holds that local would have to support the negotiation of that provision in the first place in Nome, Alaska."
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2161.865,2168.906,I thought it meant -- I didn't think Lehnert held that the unit would have to support that type of extra-unit litigation.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2169.892,2173.843,"Well, I may have misconstrued your -- it was litigation over--"
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2173.843,2174.561,--Yes.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2184.231,2186.306,"--Well, I think my answer is still correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2206.095,2213.217,"Well, sure, because that negotiation is germane to the Nome, Alaska collective bargaining agreement, if they are negotiating it there for that unit."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2213.217,2215.731,But the litigation is equally germane.
2008.07-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2242.705,2244.456,"But aren't they, aren't they equal chargeable?"
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2295.746,2307.366,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and I want to make clear when the Court spoke in Lehnert of the essence of an affiliation agreement, an affiliation agreement is a contractual relationship."
2008.07-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2317.037,2318.785,"Which is a covenant, in effect, of support."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2318.785,2332.046,"That's correct, and it's actually quite analogous in that regard to the duty of fair representation that, let's say an unaffiliated local union owns to its objecting nonmembers."
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.576,2336.901,Do you think as a covenant of support you have -- however many -- about a thousand individual units.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2344.556,2348.272,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice, what I said was a covenant of good faith and fair dealing."
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2349.442,2353.287,"So it's quite unlike, for example, insurance."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2361.378,2363.438,"--That's -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2368.592,2370.342,"Okay, so there is no, there is no covenant of support."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2384.443,2386.6,"--No, Justice Souter."
2008.07-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2387.146,2388.538,Is this any obligation at all?
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2401.594,2402.624,--That the--
2008.07-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2402.624,2403.049,Right?
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2403.049,2403.548,--Yes.
2008.07-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2403.548,2404.141,Okay.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2404.141,2404.734,That the National Union--
2008.07-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2404.734,2408.105,And how do we articulate what that obligation is?
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2417.916,2423.349,"--The way I would articulated it, and then I would like to take a step backward and compare it to the nonaffiliated situation."
2008.07-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2440.562,2445.499,"Yes, but the trouble with saying that is exactly the point that the Chief Justice raised."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2461.022,2473.22,"They -- they don't have a First Amendment obligation, but, Your Honor, that is true in the case of agency fees all together."
2008.07-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2517.83,2526.671,"Well, it doesn't create a guarantee expressed like the terms of an insurance policy, but there is, in fact, a local practice to which one can refer."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2572.805,2602.387,"--I think, at most, the obligation is parallel to the duty of fair representation in the sense that the entity that's responsible for determining what services are going to be provided to the employees has to treat, in the case of the local union members and nonmembers in the unity plea, in the case of the national union it's a different affiliated entity fairly -- the reason--"
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2602.387,2610.916,"So we are talking about an infringement on the objecting members' first amendment rights, and your answer is trust us, we'll treat you fairly?"
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2633.954,2638.185,"--But I have two answers to that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2657.303,2657.88,That's different.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2662.517,2679.263,"--But we look at the -- but -- but we look at the national union typical affiliation type arrangement, as the court described it in Lehnert, and what we understand is this is a union that's not making a profit, it's not piling up fees and putting them somewhere."
2008.07-610,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2693.897,2702.066,"But couldn't it be, couldn't the national say, local, you have asked for assistance with such-and-such litigation."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2723.056,2728.192,"Absolutely, Your Honor, that's one thing a national union can properly do."
2008.07-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.065,2744.751,The issue is not whether that's a fair thing for the national union to do.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2777.861,2785.453,--What -- the value the -- the objector is getting is not have a guarantee of services.
2008.07-610,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2899.939,2916.695,"If certain -- if certain fees are are being assessed on the theory that this is a pooling arrangement, I don't understand why you're resisting any effort to impose any standards or any inquiry as to whether it's really a pooling arrangement?"
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2916.695,2941.874,"--Because, Your Honor -- and the reason I started my argument by saying there is really two choices, a local union goes it alone or has the arrangement that we have here, is that it simply would not be possible in the nature of things to have a set of standards and guarantees that would be meaningful in any way to govern how national unions provide services to locals."
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2975.53,2988.135,"So if we determine as a matter of First Amendment law that such a requirement is necessary, then you lose, because you're saying we can't possibly fashion the test?"
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2988.135,2991.211,Then we lose and so does the union in Lehnert lose.
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2994.931,2998.086,Lehnert didn't address the question of litigation.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2998.086,3020.465,"Well, but if -- but there has been no argument made that would explain why if you -- if one can pool -- if the union negotiates an agreement with a very controversial provision that a nonmember has a very legitimate objection to, Lehnert holds that can be pooled."
2008.07-610,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3022.746,3027.371,Your argument seems to be that the whole analogy of a pooling arrangement is invalid.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3049.952,3053.517,"--I have two responses to that, Justice Alito."
2008.07-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3094.138,3095.967,"Well, it doesn't have to do that."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3110.633,3144.836,"--Well, then it either has to allow for -- the union has to either conclude we are going to support all of our germane activities, all of our chargeable activities through our own funding and our own resources, and if that's just inadequate and therefore litigation needs to be conducted, we can't do it; the employer knows that so it can take advantage of us in bargaining; we are just going to have to live with it; or we can say our members will pay for that but the nonmembers won't, because the only solution other than using the local's own money is to pay a fee to the national."
2008.07-610,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3152.569,3158.94,"Well, one of the difficulties it seems to me is the Petitioner's position with the sort of all or nothing approach."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3181.853,3182.883,--Well--
2008.07-610,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3182.883,3185.554,I haven't heard from either side yet what that would be.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3185.554,3203.298,"--The -- the question, Justice Kennedy, is whatever the test is if it's satisfied as to expenditures within the unit where the services are provided, can those services be pooled or is there a different test that has to be applied to the pooling?"
2008.07-610,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3346.616,3364.046,"Is there a rule or a reg somewhere in the Labor Department that says if the national union takes its money from its local, spends it in a way that has nothing to do with politics whatsoever, zero -- but either wastes it or they build too big a building, or they do something that doesn't benefit Local Number 432, does 432 have any remedy?"
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3364.046,3366.308,There is no Labor Department regulation.
2008.07-610,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3366.308,3367.061,There is no remedy at all.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3367.061,3367.748,"No, and I--"
2008.07-610,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3367.748,3370.466,"So union members who are being gypped, they just have to put up with it."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3370.466,3382.647,--I would say there would be a breach of covenant of faith and fair dealing under the affiliation relationship in some of those situations; and of course if a union used an illegal basis for determining whether it would provide services to the--
2008.07-610,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3382.647,3383.053,Right.
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3384.725,3396.985,"--You could bring a lawsuit alleging that the union violated its covenant of good faith and fair dealing to its affiliates, if the union acted on the basis of say, race, for example, you could certainly bring a lawsuit then."
2008.07-610,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3396.985,3404.687,"So either -- in these cases everybody in the union whether they're forced or not, has this kind of remedy or nobody does?"
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3405.233,3406.013,Right.
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3427.534,3428.252,"Well, that's not right."
2008.07-610,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3441.714,3460.24,"But a -- a member equally with a nonmember would, Mr. Chief Justice, have the view that if it's predictable year after year that for some reason his local doesn't get services from the national union, the national union sends it elsewhere, that member is going to be no more happier -- happy than the nonmember."
2008.07-610,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3477.812,3479.263,"Thank you, Mr. Collins."
2008.07-610,2,46653,w_james_young,,3481.341,3483.279,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-610,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3555.966,3576.13,"And the case -- the case that says that a union member, person forced into the union agency shop -- and I guess a lawyer who has to pay to be an integrated bar and I guess a doctor who has to join a medical association -- the case that says that these people have a First Amendment right to get back money that's being wasted, is what?"
2008.07-610,2,46653,w_james_young,,3576.13,3579.19,"We don't suggest that there is such a right, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-610,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3579.19,3582.548,"So unless it's political in your view, you don't have that right?"
2008.07-610,2,46653,w_james_young,,3582.548,3585.126,"Unfortunately no, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-610,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3585.126,3587.61,"The test is not whether it's political, is it?"
2008.07-610,2,46653,w_james_young,,3597.62,3610.056,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's exactly correct, and -- and the test in determining whether or not it is a -- can be charged across bargaining unit lines is a bright-line test of whether it is a speech activity."
2008.07-610,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3610.056,3612.88,"Well, do you have a response to Justice Kennedy's concern?"
2008.07-610,2,46653,w_james_young,,3616.926,3622.549,I'm afraid you've got two principled advocates before you Mr. Chief Justice who are holding firm to their positions.
2008.07-610,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3659.095,3659.766,--Thank you counsel.
