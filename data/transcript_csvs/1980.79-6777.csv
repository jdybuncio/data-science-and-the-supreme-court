1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.272,We'll hear arguments next in Steagald v. the United States.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,54.485,57.27,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,93.76,96.728,Would it make any difference if there had been only two officers?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,96.728,104.667,"Your Honor, we... when we're looking at the degree of the intrusion, that is... that's the point I'm trying to make."
1980.79-6777,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,118.16,123.362,"It was his house, is that fixed in the record?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,123.362,131.651,"Your Honor, I refer to it as his house rather than calling it the premises in which he had a reasonable expectation of privacy."
1980.79-6777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,152.048,156.266,It is the entry into the home that presents the issue in this case?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,156.266,156.452,--Yes.
1980.79-6777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.452,158.318,Not what happened outside the house.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,158.318,161.92,"No sir, I'm just giving the factual background which includes that."
1980.79-6777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,161.92,162.503,Right.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,162.503,169.824,There was no search warrant and there were no exigent circumstances excusing the absence of the search warrant.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,182.749,186.635,How did they connect him with the 45 pounds of cocaine?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,190.92,192.522,Possession and for conspiracy.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,192.522,193.105,--of that cocaine?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,193.105,193.989,Of that cocaine.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,193.989,195.307,"Well, how did they tie him to it?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,195.307,213.369,"They did it, basically, Mr. Justice Brennan, with a series of pre-search contacts which the Petitioner had with the import company which had imported the brass lamps from Colombia in which the cocaine was secreted."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,220.69,229.462,"I was curious, since the government's position apparently is that he had no privacy in this home, whatever, and therefore no standing."
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,229.462,231.814,"--Yes sir, that's their position now; it wasn't their position--"
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,231.814,234.099,How did the government tie him then to the stuff they found in the house?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,234.099,242.122,"--They did it with circumstantial evidence, Your Honor, by... and it would take quite some time to elicit all the facts, but he--"
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,242.122,242.888,"Well, don't bother."
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,244.404,244.554,"--All right, sir."
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,351.007,359.263,"Now, at that time, what was... who was the object of their interest in their pursuit?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,359.263,361.715,"Allegedly... well, no one was the object of their pursuit."
1980.79-6777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.789,373.789,They did have an arrest warrant?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,373.789,374.205,--Yes sir.
1980.79-6777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.943,384.828,"Well, one was outstanding then?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,384.828,387.363,"Yes sir, there did exist an arrest warrant for Ricky Lyons."
1980.79-6777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.754,417.216,"And it's your position that in addition to this arrest warrant for Ricky Lyons, and a reasonable belief that Ricky Lyons was on the premises, they needed a search warrant?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,417.216,419.318,In the absence of exigent circumstances?
1980.79-6777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.318,419.668,Yes.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,419.668,420.701,Precisely my position.
1980.79-6777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.701,438.914,"All right, just what would one have told one of the magistrates on duty in Atlanta, in order to obtain the search warrant for... going on the premises of your client to arrest Ricky Lyons?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,438.914,469.001,"He would have told the magistrate, first under oath, that he had obtained information from a reliable confidential informer, upon whom he had relied successfully in the past, and that the information was credible, and that the information consisted of this: the informant provided the DEA agent with a phone number where he... where the informant said, Ricky Lyons and his partner, Jimmy, his partner in the drug business, Jimmy, could be found within a pertinent period of time."
1980.79-6777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.174,511.844,"You concede that would have been enough, had the search warrant been based on that--"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,511.844,522.218,"Had the search warrant been... well, for purposes of this appeal, it is assumed there was probable cause or at least reasonable belief to belief that Lyons was there."
1980.79-6777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.218,546.667,"--Well there really isn't a great deal that a law enforcement officer, who has an outstanding arrest warrant and believes that the subject of the warrant is on someone else's premises, can tell a magistrate if he's seeking a search warrant of the premises in addition to the kind of information that you're talking about, is there?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,548.703,550.419,That's true.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,594.565,600.385,"Now Mr. Young, did you say they did not in fact have the arrest warrant on them?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,600.385,600.801,No sir.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,603.118,608.122,"No, but they were acting on the authority of the arrest warrant, weren't they, when they made the entry?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,608.122,610.674,"--They were, precisely; yes sir."
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,610.674,613.443,"Does it make any different whether they had it in their pockets, or not?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,613.443,613.859,"No sir, no."
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,615.645,616.828,No sense spending time on that.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,638.241,638.907,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,641.859,648.597,"After they got in the house, if they saw marijuana or other contraband in plain view, could they seize it?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,648.597,650.899,"Yes sir, under Warden v. Hayden, they could."
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,650.899,651.749,And it would be admissible?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,651.749,652.315,Yes sir.
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,655.267,677.282,"From his point of view, the occupant of the house, whatever his right to be there may be from his point of view, why is it different whether the police got in there by... the agents got in there in hot pursuit, or got in there in cold, deliberate steps?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,677.282,695.678,"--From his point of view, Your Honor, it is that he has the right and the need, and this country has the right and the need, for an individual's expectation of privacy not to yield on the basis of the judgment of the police, but on the basis of the judgment of a neutral and detached magistrate."
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,719.443,735.988,"But from his point of view, I take it, you concede that he'd be in a very different position from the hot pursuit situation, he would have no basis for having the evidence, the plain view evidence rejected?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,735.988,737.055,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,754.682,766.424,"Now by hypothesis, what do you, if I may press this one on you, what should they have done: surrounded the house, since they had adequate manpower, and sent one of the agents down to get the warrant?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,766.424,777.415,"--No sir, when Agent Goodowens called to assemble this raiding party, he should have taken five minutes and gone next door and talked to the magistrate and gotten a search warrant."
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,777.415,791.039,"Well, would it have been adequate if... he, having failed to do that and arriving at the house, could they have secured the premises in the sense of surrounding it, and then got the warrant?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,791.039,791.189,Certainly.
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,791.189,796.876,"Would you say, that was the fallback position they should have carried out--"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,796.876,797.895,Yes sir.
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,797.895,798.595,--not having--
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,798.595,801.013,That's a fallback position could have carried out.
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,801.013,810.786,"--Assuming, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested, they had enough to present to the magistrate to persuade him to issue the warrant, the search warrant?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,810.786,811.319,Correct.
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.319,815.44,The search warrant necessary to execute the arrest warrant?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,815.44,826.045,The search warrant necessary to give them the right to enter Petitioner's home in order to execute that arrest warrant.
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.045,842.174,"You know, I have to raise the point that, I have been listening carefully but I have great difficulty in putting all this together until I find out on what basis you say that that's his home, emphasis his underscored."
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,842.174,843.507,"All right, sir."
1980.79-6777,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,843.507,847.392,"It really was the Gaultney's place of residence, wasn't it?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,847.392,857.767,"No sir, it was leased by the Smiths, or by Mr. Smith, who was the individual who was arrested as he came into the house and arrived in a truck."
1980.79-6777,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,857.767,862.92,"I think we'd all feel better if you'd call it the home, rather than his, because that issue is still--"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,862.92,863.253,All right.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,961.1,981.58,"--Well, Mr. Young, I take it, whether or not the government's omission to raise this below precludes their being heard on it here, is at least in part, isn't it, dependent upon whether or not this standing question is jurisdictional?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,981.58,987.401,"That may well be, Your Honor."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,987.401,998.792,"If it's in fact jurisdictional, and thus I expect they may raise it here and say you can't do it because you have no jurisdiction here, could that be it?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,998.792,1001.125,That... it could be.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1001.125,1002.244,"Well now, what is it?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1013.801,1016.151,Well I'm not sure I know.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1016.92,1018.936,Perhaps no one does--
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1018.936,1024.424,"--I'm not... I would be speculating, I think it's very difficult to tell."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1024.424,1027.192,--Do you think this is jurisdictional?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1027.192,1033.013,"Your Honor, I really haven't given that... I haven't evaluated that aspect of it."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1040.952,1046.022,"Well, except that what I'm suggesting is, they didn't raise it and they maybe deliberately didn't raise it."
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1053.176,1054.193,"I can't answer that, Your Honor."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1106.744,1108.18,"Are those the checks, or something?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1108.18,1109.713,"--Yes sir, two checks and an invoice."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1109.713,1110.03,Two checks.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1110.03,1111.382,Two checks and an invoice.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1123.106,1124.723,Was he washing it or cleaning it?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1124.723,1127.992,"--He was... there was apparently something wrong with the engine, Your Honor; they were looking at the engine."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1127.992,1128.508,Oh.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1128.508,1133.811,"Inasmuch as the record indicates that Steagald had an old, beat-up Volkswagen."
1980.79-6777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.603,1156.161,"Mr. Young, on the... I don't want you to go into the facts in great detail, but you indicated before that the proof of the substantive offense itself was largely circumstantial."
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1165.1,1178.776,"The way that they... I contended at trial that his connection with the house was too tenuous to even get to the jury, to withstand the judgment of acquittal motion."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1201.706,1203.058,And connected to the--
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1203.058,1204.308,--Other than that... sir?
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1204.308,1205.677,--And connected to the drugs?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1205.677,1207.01,"And connected to the drugs, yes sir."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1207.01,1210.061,"Is that the way they connected him, with evidence like that?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1210.061,1212.244,"That was part of the evidence, Your Honor."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1270.6,1279.621,"So at least to that extent, I gather here was a case or controversy between the government and him in connection with the drugs themselves, wasn't there?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1279.621,1280.471,--Oh yes sir.
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1280.907,1281.823,That they were his?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1281.823,1282.407,--Whether--
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1282.407,1284.959,Does that bear on whether this is jurisdictional or not?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1284.959,1288.144,"--Your Honor, I simply have to apologize."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1290.096,1295.667,"Well I know, but standing in a case or controversy sense is what makes it jurisdictional, isn't it?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1295.667,1301.119,"I believe so, yes, yes sir."
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1304.856,1309.658,"Also, I understand you to say that he had privacy in one room in that house?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1318.513,1319.465,"--One bedroom, yes sir."
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.465,1323.65,--And he... or do you say he had privacy in the whole house?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1323.65,1326.186,Well I say he had privacy in the whole house because he--
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1326.186,1326.536,How?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1326.536,1328.019,"--because he was living there, Your Honor."
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1328.019,1330.538,"Would that go for an apartment, too?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1334.042,1339.51,"No sir, I think that would be more... the equivalent to a hotel."
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1339.51,1341.696,I must have missed it.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1344.081,1349.802,"It was found in the front... well, it was found in several places, but it was first found--"
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1349.802,1351.902,Well that's why they say it was his house.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1351.902,1352.102,--in the front bedroom.
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1352.102,1354.504,I thought it was all found in his room.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1355.204,1355.872,No sir.
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1355.872,1358.172,Was any found in his room?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1358.172,1362.86,"Well again, the record doesn't clearly indicate which room was his."
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1362.86,1367.745,So does that mean that all of them are his?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1367.745,1367.945,So we don't know which--
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1367.945,1369.347,Or none of them are his?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1376.434,1383.623,"--We say on the basis of those... those facts I mentioned earlier, that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the entire premises."
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1383.623,1386.223,And the government says for that reason he doesn't have any?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1386.223,1386.991,Yes sir.
1980.79-6777,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1386.991,1388.941,"So what do we do, toss a coin?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1388.941,1394.645,"No sir, you find that the government has waived it, at least that's what I urge the Court to do."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1500.431,1501.364,Is Jimmy the Petitioner?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1501.364,1504.818,"--No sir, Jimmy is Ricky Lyons' partner."
1980.79-6777,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1504.818,1505.452,I see.
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1505.452,1506.068,All right.
1980.79-6777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1660.167,1675.427,"Mr. Young, ordinarily this Court does not canvass volumes of records to determine motivation where two courts have found something sufficient."
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1679.812,1681.414,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-6777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1767.954,1778.661,"Mr. Young, I notice in your brief... actually... that there's only one question for review?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1778.661,1782.113,"There's only one issue before this Court that was taken on certiorari, yes sir."
1980.79-6777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1782.113,1785.065,Did we give a limited grant of certiorari?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1787.6,1788.967,"No, two questions were presented."
1980.79-6777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1795.539,1797.273,--On that we did not grant certiorari?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1797.273,1797.456,--No sir.
1980.79-6777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1799.825,1800.658,On this single question?
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1800.658,1802.193,"On that single issue, yes."
1980.79-6777,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1802.193,1802.643,Thank you.
1980.79-6777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1802.643,1806.729,"Mr. Young, may I ask you two questions?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1812.233,1812.733,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-6777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.462,1833.628,"Right, I read that."
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1845.52,1855.625,"Well, but Your Honor, we say that probable cause is... goes hand in hand with one of two things: a magistrate, or exigent circumstances."
1980.79-6777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.549,1897.618,"Well you'd make the same basic argument even if it were the same, though, I take it, that there's still a warrant required?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1897.618,1898.202,Yes sir.
1980.79-6777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1898.987,1908.51,"On the basic argument, the government says that the common law is against you, and I don't think you respond to that; do you concede they correctly interpret the common law?"
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,1908.51,1908.993,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2033.091,2036.526,"I think you've used all of your time, Mr. Young."
1980.79-6777,0,33711,john_richard_young,,2036.526,2037.228,"Oh, I have?"
1980.79-6777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.228,2039.828,Mr. Frey.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2039.828,2045.546,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2132.385,2134.301,Well why do you think we have to hear you?
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2134.301,2135.17,--Excuse me?
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.17,2138.789,"Why do you think we have to hear you on the issue, since you never raised it before?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2138.789,2144.193,"Well, let me say first of all that we do not contend that the issue is jurisdictional."
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2153.549,2155.584,"Well why should we, when you didn't raise it below?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2155.584,2167.474,"--Now, there are two separate questions: one is, are we entitled to raise it in this Court; and the second question is, if we are entitled to raise it, must the Court consider it?"
1980.79-6777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.776,2175.378,"Well, you know we're not required to consider it under our cases, don't you?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2175.378,2180.382,"--Well, I am not... I have found the cases somewhat confusing, but I will--"
1980.79-6777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.382,2184.77,"Well, we've considered some, but we've never, nobody's ever suggested we had to."
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2184.77,2185.736,"--Well,--"
1980.79-6777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2185.736,2186.669,We never admit we do--
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2186.669,2195.592,"--Let me just cite the Court three cases in which points which are pertinent to this are made, quite briefly."
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2212.034,2216.505,"--But don't ordinarily, we qualify that, provided he's raised it below?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2216.505,2222.492,"I was interested to find, in looking at it, that it is not ordinarily so qualified."
1980.79-6777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.492,2230.098,But that falls considerably short of saying that the Court has to consider--
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2230.098,2233.967,"Well, I'm now answering Justice Brennan's question--"
1980.79-6777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.967,2235.919,--As to whether you're entitled to raise it?
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2235.919,2237.035,--Whether we're entitled to raise it.
1980.79-6777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.809,2255.796,"But Mr. Frey, you'd really get a different judgment, wouldn't you, if you sent it back for further hearing in the trial court; the Court of Appeals affirmed?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2255.796,2263.236,Well that's all... this would be a ground for affirming the conviction and a denial of the suppression motion.
1980.79-6777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2263.236,2269.406,I thought you said earlier that you thought the proper disposition would be to send it back for another hearing to give them an opportunity to establish--
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2269.406,2271.023,Well let me get to that in a second.
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2323.208,2325.66,--Well what about the checks and the sweater and those other things?
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2325.66,2328.929,"--Yes, there are indications, including the cocaine, that he was present--"
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2328.929,2334.165,"Is he right, that you used, or that the government used those at the trial to connect him with the cocaine?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2334.165,2335.732,"--Yes, that evidence."
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2336.048,2346.056,"Well why isn't it... if it's available to the government to connect him with the cocaine in the cabin, why isn't it also available to establish that he had a privacy at this cabin?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2346.056,2356.662,"--This is an issue that has been raised, we filed a petition last year in a case called Conway, which was sent back after Rawlings and Salvucci were decided."
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2377.777,2380.646,"Well I know but the sweater and the checks and those things, they weren't contraband."
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2380.646,2384.698,--Well I would say that on this--
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2384.698,2390.019,"As I understand it, the government used them at trial to establish that the cocaine was his?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2390.019,2391.385,"--As part of the evidence, there was--"
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2391.385,2393.804,"I know, as part of it, but that was the evidence you relied on?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2393.804,2404.262,"--Yes, but we don't deny that Mr. Steagald was ever in the cabin, or that he did not have some kind of guest connection with the cabin."
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2404.262,2408.147,I don't understand why you take the position that these are not relevant to the determination of whether he had a privacy interest.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2414.034,2419.688,Well I believe he could use this evidence if there were a remand hearing.
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2427.275,2432.179,"--Well, are you also saying that we might regard them as sufficient to establish that he had a privacy interest?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2432.179,2435.864,"--I believe, I would disagree with such a holding by the Court."
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2435.864,2437.066,But we might... but we could.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2437.066,2439.602,They are evidence that would be relevant.
1980.79-6777,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2439.602,2439.985,We could.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2439.985,2440.902,"Well, you could."
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.902,2445.839,"But Mr. Frey, you aren't abandoning the point that it wasn't litigated, are you?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2445.839,2448.708,"No, it wasn't... it was not litigated--"
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2448.708,2451.324,"You're not abandoning that, are you?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2451.324,2455.026,"--Well, we are charged with--"
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.026,2455.376,You raised it when you started your argument.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2455.376,2458.078,--having failed to raise the point by the Petitioner.
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2458.078,2459.328,"Oh, I see."
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2459.861,2476.772,"And our response, first, is that it was Petitioner's burden to come forward on this issue in the District Court and he overlooks the fact that this was... it's rather peculiar to charge us with waiving, when he has failed to meet his burden of coming forward, or his burden of--"
1980.79-6777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2476.772,2484.461,"Mr. Fray, you're spending a lot of time on a point on which... we granted cert on another point."
1980.79-6777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2484.461,2489.699,"You didn't raise it in your brief in opposition to the cert petition, either, so--"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2489.699,2496.019,"--We didn't, until... we did not understand the pertinent facts until we reviewed the record in connection with preparing the brief on the merits."
1980.79-6777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.279,2594.183,"--Actually, we cited Cravero in Dalia v. United States, did we not?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2594.183,2597.402,"I'll take your word for it, I'm not aware--"
1980.79-6777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.402,2599.102,"Page 258,--"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2599.102,2638.295,"--Now Petitioner does not dispute that Payton itself, which our argument heavily relies on the fact that Payton was decided... he does not dispute that Payton is a case that should not be applied retroactively to arrest entries into the defendant's or suspect's own premises, and I don't think I need to belabor the point, Payton clearly altered the settled law of the Fifth Circuit on the Payton issue and the opinion itself in Payton stated that the practice that it was overturning was a longstanding and widespread practice."
1980.79-6777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.295,2644.448,"--Mr. Frey, in this argument are you essentially arguing that in the Payton case we should have not applied the Payton rule to Payton?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2644.448,2652.971,"I will come to that point, because we have tried to be careful not to argue that and I will explain that point."
1980.79-6777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.985,2822.231,"Mr. Frey, so far this sounds like something out of St. Thomas Aquinas; perhaps it's our fault rather than yours that it does, but we granted certiorari on a particular question, and I would have expected to hear argument on that question, first."
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2822.231,2842.061,"Well, I believe, though that as a matter of logical precedence, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I will argue the other point now, if the Court prefers, but as a matter of logical precedence, the question is whether... it is a preliminary question whether you should reach the question on which you granted--"
1980.79-6777,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.061,2846.946,"I'm one of the nine members of the Court, so I certainly can't say the Court prefers it."
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2846.946,2852.148,"--Well, let me just make this point and then I will move on to the substantive Fourth Amendment issue."
1980.79-6777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.744,2878.231,"Well the one that it... the question you're arguing now is a constitutional question, isn't it?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2878.231,2882.619,The question I am arguing now is a jurisprudential question.
1980.79-6777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2884.419,2888.273,"What, about the exclusionary rule should not apply in this case?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2888.273,2895.86,"Well this is... yes, our argument is an argument that, as the Court has explained the workings of the exclusionary rule--"
1980.79-6777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.86,2897.129,What if we found that one tougher than the other one?
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2899.729,2908.668,"--Well, what you said in Bowen was that, and what you said in DeStefano and what you said in Payne and what you said in Stovall is that you would not do it."
1980.79-6777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2908.668,2911.602,Well your time is certainly running fast.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2911.602,2919.042,"Well, I just wanted to be sure that Mr. Justice Stevens understood my response to his point."
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3027.977,3029.595,May I ask a question?
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3034.647,3036.599,Excuse me?
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3036.599,3040.317,"Assuming I owned a home in Atlanta, Georgia,--"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3040.317,3040.934,Yes.
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3040.934,3045.538,--could you use this very same warrant and break into my house?
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3045.538,3051.24,If we had reason to believe that the subject of the warrant was present in the house.
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3051.24,3052.108,"If the police said that, right?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3052.108,3054.308,If the police had that reason to believe.
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3054.308,3055.71,He had to have that--
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3055.71,3057.429,"He had to have it, yes."
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3057.429,3058.496,--You could break into my house?
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3058.496,3059.962,Yes.
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3059.962,3060.881,You could get hurt that way.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3060.881,3068.301,"Let me just, I'd like to pass on from the history point."
1980.79-6777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.301,3071.669,"Well let me ask you one question on the history, because it really carries right down to date."
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3092.682,3092.882,No.
1980.79-6777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3093.399,3100.855,"--Let's say you had a search warrant for the gun in the owner's house, and also an arrest warrant for the owner, and he takes his gun to the house but he's not there; can you break in to get the gun?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3100.855,3101.788,"--No, of course not."
1980.79-6777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.526,3107.709,Why not?
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3114.08,3118.917,"You mean, why wouldn't... if Semayne's case were the history--"
1980.79-6777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.917,3119.584,Oh forget Semayne's case.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3127.84,3132.891,--That would be the substance of my argument as to whether they should or they shouldn't.
1980.79-6777,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3132.891,3133.174,All right.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3133.174,3153.99,"And as to the role of history, of course, there's much room for debate about what role history ought to play in a decision of this sort, it seems to me there is a limit beyond which the Fourth Amendment ought not to be construed to bar practices that were clearly permissible in common law, but this is a case which I concede is not as clear as Watson was, let's say, on the history."
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3319.278,3342.478,"Well under a general warrant, it does give them the right to go into any premises that he... which means any officer in Atlanta, assumes or has reasonable belief that that man is in there... he makes the decision as to the house that will be searched, not the magistrate."
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3342.844,3343.01,"--Well,--"
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3343.01,3344.093,--I think that's the problem.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3344.093,3361.822,"--he makes the original decision, but of course, he must have this reason to believe, the decision is subject to a post-entry judicial scrutiny in connection either with a suppression hearing or a civil damages suit, this is not simply the uncontrolled discretion of the officer."
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3378.433,3381.551,But the real injury comes in going into the house.
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3381.551,3396.561,"--Well, most of the cases that are going to happen where this... where the subject of an arrest warrant is on third party premises, his stay is going to be brief, there will usually be exigent circumstances, the warrant requirement will usually, I think, not apply."
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3400.263,3405.0,"But I don't read that any place in the Fourth Amendment, that, you know, these things don't usually happen."
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3405.0,3410.552,"--Well but what the Court is doing, I think--"
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3410.552,3424.062,"You still haven't... you admit that the official, the police official individually makes a decision as to which house he's going to search?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3424.062,3427.514,--Individually or collectively.
1980.79-6777,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3427.514,3429.116,Without any... without any supervision at all?
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3429.116,3445.208,Our position would be that the Constitution does not require him to submit the question whether the individual is in the house to the magistrate in advance of entering the house.
1980.79-6777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3502.747,3515.155,"Is it any part of your argument, Mr. Frey, that it would be more difficult and in some cases, impossible, to comply with the Fourth Amendment's requirement that the premises to be searched have to be particularly described?"
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3515.155,3517.505,No.
1980.79-6777,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.225,3530.581,"Because if it's just a transitory presence in a third party's house, there's no reason that the officers would know... be able to particularly describe the premises to be searched."
1980.79-6777,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3530.581,3539.87,"--Well, but if in the normal situation, if the officers learn that Ricky Lyons has just gone into an apartment at such and such a place, and they go out there with sirens--"
