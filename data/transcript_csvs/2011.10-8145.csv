2011.10-8145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.618,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-8145, Smith v. Cain."
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,6.784,9.92,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-8145,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,115.317,116.769,Wasn't there a picture?
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,123.673,125.025,--That is correct.
2011.10-8145,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,192.217,197.455,"Well, aren't you exaggerating a little bit about the value of the impeachment evidence regarding Boatner?"
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,230.577,231.461,--Yes.
2011.10-8145,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,231.828,233.913,And at that point he gave a description.
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,264.95,270.937,"Justice Alito, it is true that Boatner provided identifying details in the later statement that night."
2011.10-8145,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.318,351.789,"The standard is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different, reasonable probability?"
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,351.789,353.121,"Yes, that's correct."
2011.10-8145,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,437.358,478.768,"--That may be true, but if you were a juror and Boatner testified and he was cross-examined and they attempted to impeach him based on his failure to make an identification right at the scene and he said, well, that was because five of my friends had just been killed and I was lying on the floor and I thought I was going to be shot too and I had a big gash on my head, and then a couple of hours later when I collected myself and they asked me the same question at the police station I provided a description and didn't say I couldn't identify anybody, do you think jurors would just dismiss that and say, well, he couldn't identified him at the scene so he must have been lying when he identified -- when he provided a description later at the police station?"
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,478.768,484.356,"Justice Alito, I think that it's possible that a juror could credit that explanation in any retrial, though--"
2011.10-8145,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.356,489.743,Wasn't there -- wasn't there an intervening -- didn't he say 5 days after that he couldn't identify?
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,498.016,499.266,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-8145,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,522.764,523.281,Counselor--
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,523.281,527.618,--we don't think that it's our burden to show that no juror could credit the State's explanation.
2011.10-8145,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,530.737,548.365,"--Counselor, your argument now and in your brief suggests that you're relying most heavily on the failure to provide the impeachment materials of the only witness to this crime and the only piece of evidence that ties your client to the crime."
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,568.528,569.178,There were--
2011.10-8145,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,569.178,574.266,What's the best take on what the evidence showed that was presented on that issue?
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,574.266,578.468,--There was some degree of variation in what the witnesses said.
2011.10-8145,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,625.215,626.049,Could I ask you something?
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,651.849,664.24,"--The lower court did not make such a determination in this case on this or any of the other evidentiary issues that Respondent now advances, at least in part, because it does not appear that Respondent advanced any of those arguments below."
2011.10-8145,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,751.012,758.1,"Now, Mr. Mims was the neighbor who saw the two -- there were three assailants in total, right, and two left the scene?"
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,758.1,763.154,There is some doubt as to whether or not there were three or four assailants.
2011.10-8145,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,840.17,847.058,Does the defense have any theory as to why Boatner would lie about whether he could identify this individual?
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,847.058,855.663,"--First of all, Justice Alito, it would of course not be the defense's burden in any subsequent retrial to come up with a theory of its own."
2011.10-8145,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,862.769,874.327,"Yes, but -- but the impact of your impeachment evidence would be related certainly to if a juror would ask: Well, why would he lie about this?"
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,884.849,897.692,"As this Court will be aware from its recent consideration of eyewitness evidence, it doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that an eyewitness identification is mistaken that the eyewitness was somehow lying about it."
2011.10-8145,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,949.708,957.147,But the first time he -- he said that the person wasn't masked and provided a description was long before he saw any mug shots.
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,961.783,967.587,"Well, on the evening of the event he provided those limited details about the gold teeth and the low-cut haircut."
2011.10-8145,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,967.587,971.74,"Yes, but by doing that he's saying this person wasn't wearing a mask."
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,972.856,976.775,"Well, that may suggest that the person was not wearing a mask."
2011.10-8145,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1056.06,1056.226,Am I right that this--
2011.10-8145,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1056.226,1059.778,"In looking at the appendix, there are some asterisks."
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1080.175,1084.46,"First of all, none of those statements were given to the defense."
2011.10-8145,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1085.56,1086.345,I shouldn't have said statements.
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1087.979,1088.279,--Yes.
2011.10-8145,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1199.085,1201.037,"Can you just tell me, how does Brady work?"
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1205.822,1206.139,No.
2011.10-8145,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1232.39,1239.496,"--Counsel, is -- this group or gang, all of them had gold teeth and faded hair cuts?"
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1239.496,1246.566,There were five other suspects who had gold teeth or -- and low-cut hair cuts.
2011.10-8145,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1270.015,1274.817,"In short, faded hair cuts and gold teeth were not a unique characteristic."
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1274.817,1277.684,They were not uncommon in the 1990s.
2011.10-8145,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.684,1283.255,What were these--
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1292.594,1298.265,"I have to admit that my familiarity with this practice is perhaps not that much greater than yours, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-8145,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.534,1300.434,I'm sorry to hear that.
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1300.434,1315.043,"--My understanding is that these are gold teeth that are worn either as temporary or perhaps semi-permanent implants, and that in hip-hop culture in the 1990s this was relatively common."
2011.10-8145,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1370.944,1379.533,"Well, on that point, the State says that you're drawing a meaningless distinction between a hand -- a 9-millimeter handgun and a 9-millimeter automatic pistol."
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1379.533,1386.787,"Well, we don't think that that's a meaningless distinction, and we cite numerous sources in our brief that draw precisely that distinction."
2011.10-8145,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1447.094,1450.462,I'd just like to go back to that because I'm not sure that I understand the argument.
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1469.608,1471.376,"--Well, that's right with regard to Leary's testimony."
2011.10-8145,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1527.562,1528.146,"Mr. Shanmugam, just a quick one."
2011.10-8145,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1533.2,1534.283,Yes.
2011.10-8145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.354,1539.704,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1547.858,1548.358,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1611.098,1618.002,"Does this -- was this line-up, was this after Boatner saw the photograph in the newspapers?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1618.002,1619.287,"--No, it was not."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1635.547,1648.389,Could you tell me why Boatner waited 2 weeks to -- or never told the police that the face that he saw in the newspaper was the face of his assailant?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1656.143,1657.429,"Yes, he did."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1657.429,1663.899,It wasn't until they presented him with the line-up including Mr. Smith's face that he identified Mr. Smith.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1665.216,1675.457,"His reason, Your Honor, is -- it's contained most specifically on page 191 of the joint appendix, and it is frankly that he was afraid."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1683.276,1687.078,And so what turned -- what changed his mind once police showed him the line-up.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1687.078,1698.62,"--Well, I don't know that he changed his mind, but he was presented with a line-up and when he was presented with a line-up he very quickly identified Juan Smith and said: That is him; I will never forget his face."
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1699.155,1701.905,And that was before or after the picture in the paper?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1701.905,1702.557,--That was after.
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1736.345,1736.611,What is this?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1793.867,1794.65,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.65,1798.319,And so what -- you're saying that I guess it would have made no difference?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1798.319,1799.52,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.52,1811.678,"Then I'd like to hear that, because it seems on its face that it certainly could have made a difference, that if he had those notes that he could have tried to impeach him and said where did this sudden recognition come from."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1811.678,1814.197,And I can appreciate your concern.
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1826.088,1827.221,How could it not be material?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1829.29,1829.773,--Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1829.773,1831.909,--and we have inconsistent statements.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1838.979,1840.764,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-8145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1935.559,1942.129,"Well, and you could argue, presumably you did argue, that before the jury, and that would be compelling evidence for the jury."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,1948.033,1958.389,"You would like to have it, but it's not material because sandwiched between two descriptions -- and he is -- between two descriptions, he says: I can't identify."
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1960.841,1961.958,How does that make it not material?
2011.10-8145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.598,2001.168,And not only the only eyewitness but if I understand it correctly the only evidence against the defendant.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2006.988,2020.313,"--There was -- the identification of Juan Smith was bolstered by evidence, by testimony of the brother of Phillip Young, the perpetrator who was left at the scene as an aphasic amnesiac."
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2027.402,2032.037,"But just on the materiality point, I -- I just have to agree with Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2053.886,2054.602,But that's not--
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2054.602,2055.852,I just can't believe that.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2055.852,2057.421,--But that's not what he says.
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2063.158,2071.514,"I'm talking about the Boatner statement of 3/6/95, in which Boatner told police he could not identify any of the perpetrators of the murder."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2073.281,2073.581,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2073.581,2074.55,And you say that's immaterial.
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.283,2086.357,"Is it that you mean immaterial, or is it that you mean that, that it wasn't prejudicial, because there's so much other evidence, there was no reasonable probability it would have made a difference in the trial?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2086.357,2088.307,"That is what I mean, yes."
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.307,2088.607,Okay.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2098.248,2098.648,"Well, I--"
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.648,2099.731,I don't know if it's right.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2125.632,2138.473,"--The most important evidence in this case is the testimony, or the transcript from post-conviction -- the post-conviction relief hearing."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2195.326,2195.643,What if--
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2195.643,2196.011,"--Your Honor, can I--"
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2196.011,2200.813,--what if -- could the jury be entitled to reject that conclusion?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2219.543,2220.91,"--They would, Your Honor."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2221.16,2246.126,"And if they were entitled to do that, why would the absence of four statements that I can't identify someone not have been an argument that defense counsel could have used, number one, and that have a reasonable probability of making a difference?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2246.126,2255.798,"--First of all, there were not four statements that were made where Boatner said he couldn't identify anyone -- again."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2259.968,2260.801,At different hours.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2260.801,2261.335,--I'm sorry?
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2261.335,2262.32,At different hours.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2262.32,2263.487,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2263.487,2265.087,And to different officers.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2265.087,2265.789,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2265.789,2267.072,So that's two statements.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2268.474,2268.824,I'm sorry.
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2285.051,2288.453,But there is a description that other -- other suspects fit.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2299.16,2299.543,--Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2329.43,2351.561,"In -- in terms of prior inconsistent statements, and we can argue about whether there were more consistent statements than inconsistent statements -- to say that this was not Brady material, because what -- we are not saying that Larry Boatner made up a story on the stand that doesn't -- didn't conform to the truth."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2358.715,2368.221,--And this Court has said that Brady is a reflective -- is a reflective analysis.
2011.10-8145,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2369.09,2370.907,Could you explain how this -- how this took place?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2391.27,2392.705,--Absolutely.
2011.10-8145,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2392.705,2399.109,"They have to be examined, and if there's anything in them that's -- that is impeachable material, they have to be turned over to the defense."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2406.763,2411.25,"Under Louisiana law, prior -- statements of witnesses are not discoverable."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2422.074,2427.259,"But you have -- you have to supply statements by a witness when they take the stand, don't you?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2430.295,2430.697,--No.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2430.697,2432.813,--not in the State of Louisiana?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2435.882,2436.282,No.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2447.939,2455.027,So you are -- so are you claiming that the judge's failure to catch these inconsistencies excuses your Brady obligation?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2455.027,2455.545,Not at all.
2011.10-8145,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2461.196,2485.564,"Ms. Andrieu, if I could go back to Justice Alito's question, was the problem here that the prosecutors never received these statements from the police officers, or did the prosecutors make a determination similar to the kind of arguments that you're making today -- make a determination that these statements simply should not be turned over because they are not material?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2485.564,2490.885,--The prosecutor in this case actually turned them over to the trial court for an in camera inspection.
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2497.956,2512.715,"It's so odd that -- I mean look, it seems like here it is, 5 days after the shooting and well before, I guess, that this witness saw any mugshots or did anything."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2540.465,2540.984,"--No, what he--"
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.984,2542.15,What?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2542.15,2542.566,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2568.081,2576.204,"You know, all these -- all these statements that we have here, you're saying, all referred to people other than the Defendant."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2576.204,2576.621,--Juan.
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2576.871,2577.537,All right.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2579.423,2586.762,"There was -- the judge did not give express findings of fact or finding of law, but--"
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2586.762,2591.714,Perhaps the defense would have liked to say they did apply to the Defendant.

2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2596.718,2597.051,--Yes.

2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2603.038,2603.888,I'm sorry?
2011.10-8145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.888,2605.472,The one at the scene applied to everyone.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2605.472,2605.74,To everyone.
2011.10-8145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.74,2607.724,"""Can't identify anyone""."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2607.724,2613.644,March 6 applied to everyone -- everyone except Juan Smith.
2011.10-8145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.644,2614.294,Okay.
2011.10-8145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2615.663,2615.98,I'm sorry.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2621.416,2623.049,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2011.10-8145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2624.318,2624.951,Okay.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2624.951,2625.701,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2634.807,2635.524,You say like--
2011.10-8145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2635.524,2636.94,Excuse me.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2639.023,2639.306,--Anyone.
2011.10-8145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2641.406,2641.672,"--He says,"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2669.408,2675.645,--It was turned over to the judge under Article 718 for in-camera inspection.
2011.10-8145,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2675.645,2678.43,Where is that reflected in the record?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2679.247,2683.216,That's on October 31st of 1995.
2011.10-8145,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2684.501,2693.189,--What you said in your brief was that the judge determined that the supplemental report relating to the North Roman Street murders contains no Brady material.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2693.189,2693.523,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2694.539,2705.331,"I didn't understand the record to be that all of Boatner's statements, that all the statements of Boatner that we are concerned about now were examined by the judge before--"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2705.331,2705.731,--Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2705.731,2706.197,--Before trial?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2706.197,2706.731,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2706.731,2708.866,And the record reflects that in where?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2708.866,2712.151,"The transcript of October 31st, 1995."
2011.10-8145,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2712.151,2723.476,"Is it the view of the prosecutor's office that because those materials were turned over to the judge, assuming that they were turned over to the judge, that that obviates the Brady obligation?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2725.892,2726.725,Not at all.
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2728.927,2731.71,Did you concede there was a Brady violation in this case?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2731.71,2732.996,--Did we concede?
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2732.996,2734.362,Do you now concede--
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2734.362,2734.748,No.
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2734.748,2736.264,--there was a Brady violation in the case?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2736.264,2736.514,No.
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2736.514,2740.902,"Your telling the Court that this should have been kept from the defense, all of it?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2740.902,2743.854,Under this--
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2743.854,2744.337,Under Brady.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2744.337,2749.321,"--Court's decision in Kyles, I believe a prudent prosecutor would have disclosed it."
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2749.321,2758.363,"But Kyles is a decision saying what the prosecutor must disclose, not: It's a good practice."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2758.363,2758.863,No.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2759.646,2764.35,So is there a violation under our holding in Kyles?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2764.35,2764.75,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2764.75,2768.152,Is there a Brady violation under our holding in Kyles?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2768.152,2769.435,"No, there is not."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2769.435,2778.841,So explain why what is on its face seemingly inconsistent statements are not required to be turned over.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2778.841,2791.815,"With regard to the March 6 statement where Larry Boatner tells John Ronquillo at that point: I can't tell anyone, what Mr. -- Detective Ronquillo had to say about that is dispositive."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2800.087,2805.908,I don't understand how he becomes the arbiter of what's Brady.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2822.834,2843.414,"The post -- the post-conviction testimony is pivotal because there is a petition that's filed with attachments, with exhibits."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2871.934,2874.303,"The two components to Brady, should they have been turned over?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2879.521,2880.056,--There is not.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2880.056,2882.106,Should they have been turned over?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2886.443,2886.793,No.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2894.882,2898.251,"All right, now articulate what legal theory--"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2898.251,2899.084,--Because--
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2899.084,2905.655,"--would say these are not, these are not materials that needed to be turned over, when they say"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2933.841,2942.863,"--If Mr. Boatner could not identify anyone, Mr. Boatner would not have viewed 15 lineups."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2944.982,2945.732,--This is all the jury argument.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,2955.755,2969.264,"--Because if they had been presented -- if those statements had been presented to defense -- presented to a jury, the out -- the outcome would have remained the same."
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2970.48,2970.947,How do you know?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3001.752,3002.885,--Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3004.77,3005.22,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3005.22,3005.82,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3013.49,3016.926,I'm talking about Mims and -- what was the woman's name?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3017.509,3017.961,--Shaelita Russell.
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3017.961,3026.215,"And Young and the snitch, the one who said that -- his cellmate told him -- his cellmate was the perpetrator."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3026.215,3029.519,"Well, to be clear, Ms. Russell never made a dying declaration."
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3039.475,3044.195,Was it a determination by the judge that it wasn't a dying declaration?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3044.195,3050.782,--The judge again did not make specific facts of finding or loss.
2011.10-8145,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3052.132,3055.301,Because it was not -- because it was not turned over.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3083.737,3090.407,"And I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg, your -- Shaelita Russell did not give a dying declaration."
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3090.407,3091.29,All right.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3100.948,3107.369,And that information -- Dale Mims testified at post-conviction.
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3112.17,3132.483,"But isn't it most unlikely as your -- as what Mr. Shanmugam said, that robbers -- I mean, the people who are entering, intruding on another's premises to rob or whatever else they wanted to do, would wear masks going out but not going in?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3138.887,3148.993,--And it's plausible that Mr. Boatner -- I'm sorry -- that Mr. Smith masked himself upon escape after--
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3148.993,3150.029,But is that maybe--
2011.10-8145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3150.029,3151.862,I thought -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3157.516,3158.099,--Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3165.222,3169.942,"Ms. Andrieu, did your office ever consider just confessing error in this case?"
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3169.942,3170.675,I'm sorry?
2011.10-8145,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3170.675,3174.394,Did your office ever consider just confessing error in this case?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3185.035,3193.641,"Your Honor, we believe that we have an -- an argument that these statements of Larry Boatner are not material."
2011.10-8145,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3239.003,3241.622,--But you're taking that judgment away from the jury.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3255.162,3258.064,--And in this case--
2011.10-8145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3258.064,3261.35,--I -- may I suggest that--
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3261.35,3261.652,--Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.652,3264.987,--you -- you stop fighting as to whether it should be turned over?
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3270.474,3270.708,Made a difference.
2011.10-8145,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3271.958,3276.26,"And -- and that's a closer case, perhaps, but surely it should have been turned over."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3277.195,3298.858,"Well, I -- and I actually thought I had when I said a prudent prosecutor would, but in making a sort of over-the-shoulder, rear window Brady analysis, I don't think that these statements -- that the statements made to -- the statement made to Ronquillo at the scene where he is all shook up and he says, I can't describe anybody."
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3303.512,3305.312,"Counsel, my worry is the following."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3306.547,3307.664,--I'm sorry?
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3307.664,3308.397,--You read Cullen.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3308.397,3309.333,Yes.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3309.333,3310.449,You read the dissent in Cullen.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3335.414,3339.202,And I think I misunderstood your question -- I think I misunderstood your question.
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3344.672,3345.922,That's the second prong of Brady.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3366.003,3366.453,--Your Honor--
2011.10-8145,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3366.453,3367.853,--whether it caused harm or not.
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3367.853,3372.323,"--If -- if I may explain, I obviously misunderstood your question."
2011.10-8145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.191,3377.41,"You can, very briefly."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3377.41,3380.929,--We would have -- today we turn all of this over.
2011.10-8145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3397.189,3397.974,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-8145,1,20520,donna_r_andrieu,,3397.974,3398.924,Thank you.
2011.10-8145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3398.924,3400.224,"Mr. Shanmugam, 4 minutes."
2011.10-8145,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3400.224,3403.093,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-8145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3425.558,3426.858,I'm not surprised they are correct.
2011.10-8145,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3427.676,3430.778,It is quite clear that that statement applies to all of the perpetrators.
2011.10-8145,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3463.665,3470.903,"It is your understanding that the -- that all of Boatner's, all the notes about Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge before trial for in camera inspection?"
2011.10-8145,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3470.903,3475.307,"--Justice Alito, it is entirely unclear based on this record."
2011.10-8145,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3607.492,3608.66,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
