1967.482,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,48.747,"Number 482, United States, Appellant, versus Horace Johnson et al."
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,50.109,54.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors."
1967.482,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,232.489,239.656,"Mr. Spritzer, would the bill that just passed the Senate, without question, cover this?"
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,239.656,240.735,Yes.
1967.482,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,242.274,242.581,Yes but it would reach --
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,242.581,249.411,-- but it would cover an injury by a single person as well as a conspiracy and many other types of interference of course.
1967.482,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,249.411,251.814,But there's no question it does reach this instance?
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,251.814,256.94,"None whatever, no question, whatever."
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,725.017,730.014,Doesn't the the Act also present the appearance to the --
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,730.014,735.982,It authorizes injunctions against any person who violates the Act or interferes.
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.982,742.977,So people besides those who own the establishments have a duty not to interfere with this race?
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,742.977,744.905,"Yes, a duty which may --"
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.905,745.089,Created by the (Voice Overlap) --
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,745.089,745.923,-- be dealt with --
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,745.923,745.992,Created by this Act?
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,745.992,747.545,"-- by a civil remedy, yes."
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.545,747.631,Created by this Act?
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,747.631,749.268,"Yes, that is right."
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,757.206,757.933,So these --
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,757.933,760.666,-- violates the rights or duties conferred.
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.666,764.106,-- these people were owed a duty by the people who attacked them not to attack them under such --
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,764.106,797.068,"Oh, yes, yes, I don't question that for a moment and I would add that the facts of this case rather sharply illustrate however in our view the reason for the rule of construction which says that ordinarily a provision for the exclusivity of a civil remedy does not preclude a criminal proceeding in vindication of the public interest that may be involved."
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.548,865.113,(Inaudible) the question against them?
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,865.113,869.557,"Yes, the court found no occasion to reach it because --"
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.557,871.999,And the decision (Inaudible)?
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,871.999,886.556,"No, it isn't reached and guessed because the court agreed with the district -- that the District Court there had construed the indictment as defective and the statutory issue of coverage on that aspect of the case was never reached."
1967.482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,886.556,889.872,"Because of the doctrine of, what was it, Borden?"
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,889.872,893.422,"Yes, you said the appeal on that aspect of the case did not properly --"
1967.482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,893.422,893.688,So if --
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,893.688,894.625,-- (Inaudible) of this Court.
1967.482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,894.625,896.689,-- the question was expressly reserved --
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,896.689,898.328,Expressly left open in Your Honors' opinion for the court.
1967.482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,898.328,901.733,Right.
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.733,917.276,It was the only right that was exerted in the (Inaudible) conspired against the rights of the (Inaudible) --
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,917.276,926.982,The right is the right to the equal enjoyment to the free exercise of the right to enjoyment of public accommodations and that alone.
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,926.982,935.26,Question isn't opened here as to whether the right that was involved was a constitutional right?
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,935.26,947.417,The indictment which is at page 2 of the record is predicated directly upon Title 2 as Your Honor --
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.417,947.645,I see.
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,947.645,950.529,"-- will see about two-thirds all the way down, Title 2 of --"
1967.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,950.529,950.543,Thank you.
1967.482,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,950.543,953.86,-- the public accommodations law.
1967.482,1,40633,robert_b_thompson,,1752.868,1758.178,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, if it please the Court."
1967.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.15,2287.279,"Well that absent the exclusivity provision, there wouldn't be really any question about that, would there?"
1967.482,1,40633,robert_b_thompson,,2287.279,2288.929,That is correct sir.
1967.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2291.734,2305.27,And so the question is whether Congress by putting in the exclusivity provision ex -- intended to preclude what otherwise would be a right to resort to 241?
1967.482,1,40633,robert_b_thompson,,2305.27,2311.607,"That is our interpretation, our understanding and our contention here if it please the Court."
1967.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.298,2335.816,"And by the way, absent the provision for an injunction on this Act, would there be any other way of enforcing the right created by the Act?"
1967.482,1,40633,robert_b_thompson,,2335.816,2336.661,None other that what --
1967.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.661,2341.9,There's no other civil remedy that a party would have except the one that is provided by this Act.
1967.482,1,40633,robert_b_thompson,,2341.9,2344.458,There is none -- no other that I could refer the court to.
1967.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.144,2347.686,Except for the state law maybe?
1967.482,1,40633,robert_b_thompson,,2347.686,2352.769,Perhaps under state law.
1967.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2581.845,2597.978,"Mr. Thompson, you are good enough at the request to this Court to represent one of these defendants or one of these respondents who was not represented by counsel and I want you to know that we appreciate that."
1967.482,1,40633,robert_b_thompson,,2605.354,2608.16,Thank you.
1967.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2608.16,2609.54,Thank you very much.
1967.482,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2618.516,2621.807,I had -- don't wish to attempt to go over any of the same ground.
1967.482,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2808.672,2815.221,We'll adjourn.
