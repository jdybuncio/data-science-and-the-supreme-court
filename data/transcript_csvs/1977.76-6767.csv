1977.76-6767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,22.877,We hear arguments next in Scott against the United States.
1977.76-6767,0,32779,john_a_shorter,,26.912,28.277,Thank you.
1977.76-6767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,61.456,69.109,"I think the court requested counsel to address the problem of standing, is that correct?"
1977.76-6767,0,32779,john_a_shorter,,69.109,77.718,Yes there are three questions really before the court in this appeal.
1977.76-6767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,328.955,354.118,"Perhaps you are coming to this but let me put it to you know once it is determined from listening that approximately one third of the calls relate to not narcotics traffic, does not that have some -- give some impetus to continuing surveillance."
1977.76-6767,0,32779,john_a_shorter,,354.118,363.958,"The entire question of minimization is a very difficult one, it cannot be resolved we feel by reference to percentages of narcotic related call."
1977.76-6767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,363.958,365.744,Why not?
1977.76-6767,0,32779,john_a_shorter,,365.744,366.15,Not the question of minimization.
1977.76-6767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,366.15,378.933,"One third of the conversations relate to illegal traffic in narcotics, how can it not bear on the continued surveillance."
1977.76-6767,0,32779,john_a_shorter,,378.933,389.974,"We feel that the question of minimization is related to a number of factors, the least one of which we would urge would be the percentage of narcotic related calls."
1977.76-6767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,408.08,418.194,"Well do you say that the percentages are not important, but what percentage of the total calls here do you regard as unrelated to narcotics?"
1977.76-6767,0,32779,john_a_shorter,,418.194,428.357,"We did not undertake an identification in the district court or in the Court of Appeals, a percentile breakdown."
1977.76-6767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,428.357,430.782,Do you challenge the government's analysis of it?
1977.76-6767,0,32779,john_a_shorter,,430.782,459.314,"What we relied on was the testimony of the agent who supervised the Wiretap that the perception of the agents who were listening to the wiretap and the reports that were made to him and reports that he in turn forwarded to the Attorney in charge of the Wiretap that roughly 40% of the calls were narcotic related, this was his testimony."
1977.76-6767,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,505.578,520.897,"How would you go about minimizing that Mr. Shorter, once you have found that 40% were clearly narcotics related, 39% were so ambiguous they could not tell and how do you minimize from there on?"
1977.76-6767,0,32779,john_a_shorter,,520.897,558.433,"Well, when we say that some of the calls were so ambiguous that they could not be -- that you could not tell what they related to, we think that is the determination that was made by Mr. Kellogg, our adversary indicates, the agents who compiled daily records and reports of the calls that were being made over the telephone, using their own judgment, using their own instincts referring to the logs of the calls that they created at the time that the calls were made, passing the information along to Mr. Cooper, the supervising agent."
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1837.615,1840.773,Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1922.051,1926.3,"Mr. Allen, do you agree that every call is intercepted?"
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1926.3,1934.609,"Yes Your Honor, except for a short period of time when the agents apparently in a firm they hooked up to the wrong phone and we do not know how many calls were made during that time."
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1934.609,1942.942,"Well, does that seem to support this argument that there was no discretionary?"
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1942.942,1946.437,"No Your Honor, I believe it does not, I think all this --"
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1946.437,1948.947,"I mean, the every single call."
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1948.947,1953.999,"That is right, but I think all it reflects is that it was reasonable to intercept every single call."
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1953.999,1955.775,Why?
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1955.775,1966.756,"Well, for a number of reasons among other things, the agents at the time and after the fact that seems to be truth that 40% of the calls were clearly narcotic related --"
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.756,1977.944,"Well, that fact does not help me, because if you take a baseball bat and crack a man's ear and look at it and find dope, that justifies cracking the skull."
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1977.944,1982.145,"Well Your Honor, we are not engaging in that kind of an analysis."
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.358,1989.232,"My point is the statute says use some discretion, right?"
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1989.232,1990.063,That is correct Your Honor.
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1990.063,1993.731,And here they used none.
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1993.731,1996.342,"Your Honor, here they intercepted every call."
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1996.342,2002.433,"Well, does not that tend to say that no discretion was used?"
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2002.433,2012.756,"No, Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not think it does, there is a fundamental logical fallacy in that conclusion which is one that the District Court engaged in."
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2025.221,2027.659,It is nothing to do with my question.
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2030.112,2031.082,"There are 384 calls, all of which --"
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2031.082,2033.411,"That is right, it is lot different from one --"
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2033.411,2035.707,All of which in our analysis indicates.
1977.76-6767,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2035.707,2037.7,All of which had do dope.
1977.76-6767,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2037.7,2046.813,"No Your Honor, not all of which had to do with Dope, but all of which were reasonably intercepted on the anticipation that they might have something do to with those."
