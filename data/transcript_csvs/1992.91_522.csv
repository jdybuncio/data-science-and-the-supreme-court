1992.91_522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.03,"We'll hear argument first this morning in number 91-522, Saudi Arabia, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Royspec v. Scott Nelson."
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,15.06,17.473,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,98.558,108.516,Do you deny that there was any commercial activity in this country by your client?
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,108.516,118.49,"--Your Honor, the recruitment activity in this country by the client, if the acts of its agent, HCA, are to be attributed to it, would be commercial activity."
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,119.342,122.614,"Just recruiting, hiring is a commercial activity."
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,122.614,126.507,"--Recruiting and hiring in this case is a commercial activity I believe, Your Honor."
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,135.105,144.552,"So, it's just as though the... Saudi Arabia sent its own employees over here to recruit?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,144.552,146.725,"--No, I think it's not that, Justice White."
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,171.371,176.916,"So, what's your view on that, whether or not the acts of the... of your agent can be attributed to the government?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,176.916,180.229,"--I believe they should not be automatically attributed, Your Honor."
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,180.229,180.95,"Well, how about in this case?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,180.95,184.913,"I believe they should not be attributed in this case, and let me elaborate on that if I may."
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.591,212.286,"Well, was the contract signed in Miami?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,212.286,214.056,"--Your Honor, I believe the--"
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,214.056,215.448,The contract of employment?
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,215.448,219.71,"--The contract of employment Mr. Nelson alleges was signed in Florida, yes, sir."
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.71,224.652,"Well, and who signed it for... there just wasn't one signature, was there?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,224.652,225.303,That's correct.
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.014,226.274,Who signed it?
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,226.274,232.108,--It was signed on behalf of the hospital by a gentleman by the name of Donald LaFeu who was an employee of HCA.
1992.91_522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.108,238.033,"So, did he... and HCA had authority to sign that contract?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,238.033,238.644,"They did, Your Honor."
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,294.813,298.305,May I just ask this clarifying question?
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,313.126,315.449,"--Justice Stevens, if I may break that into two parts."
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.885,325.036,"Well, say they didn't pay his salary."
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,325.036,327.597,"--That could be based upon commercial activity, yes, Justice Stevens."
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,335.443,338.255,Let me be sure I understand your answer.
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,344.318,344.499,--Yes.
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,352.286,355.859,"Is your position on that particular question the same as the United States', do you know?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,355.859,364.945,"I'm not sure the United States has taken a formal position on the substantial contact inquiry in this case because it is, properly understood, a much more fact-specific inquiry."
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.087,371.439,I read one footnote in their brief as suggesting there would be jurisdiction in the case I posed.
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,371.439,373.912,"I'm sorry, Justice."
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,373.912,380.726,I say I read one footnote in their brief as seeming to me to suggest there would be jurisdiction in their view in the case I suggest.
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,380.726,383.328,"Well, I think--"
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.328,383.928,Do you disagree with that?
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,383.928,386.161,"--I... well, it depends on the underlying facts."
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.772,404.103,Do you--
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,408.146,412.4,"Well, of course, the in the United States is the question."
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.667,466.289,"Do you think commercial activity... a commercial activity, such as a contract, the signing and performance of a contract, is divisible so that the signing of the contract is one commercial activity, the performance of the contract in Saudi Arabia is a separate commercial activity so that if you don't pay for the service in Saudi Arabia, that is, indeed, a commercial activity, but it's not a commercial activity in the United States within the meaning of the act?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,467.331,470.313,"That may be cutting too fine a point, Justice Scalia."
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.145,484.263,I think that's even a finer line.
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,486.827,499.423,"Well, I... and I think these questions come together somewhat in this inquiry because the question is what is the cause of action based upon, and to be sure, the cause of action does not refer back to the recruitment activity."
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.42,520.727,"Even with respect to recruitment, why isn't the... why isn't... at least as to the negligence cause of action here, why isn't that gravamen based upon the activity in the United States?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,530.976,532.208,That's correct.
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.268,544.449,Wait.
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,545.821,552.834,"--Well, because, Justice Scalia, it's just a different theory of recovery for the same conduct, and the statute is explicit in at least this one thing."
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.153,616.699,"Suppose Saudi Arabia were engaged in the business of recruiting workers for Qatar, and the same thing happened here, only it happened in Qatar, and a suit is brought in Florida claiming negligence in failing to warn the recruitee about Qatar sometimes engaging in this kind of a governmental activity."
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,618.96,621.243,"--And Saudi Arabia, not Qatar, is the defendant in the lawsuit."
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.243,622.713,"Yes, Saudi Arabia is the defendant."
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,622.713,637.135,"Yes, that would not be commercial activity, as we understand it, Your Honor, because the underlying conduct about which they complain, albeit couched as a negligence cause of action... every injury has attendant to it a theoretical failure of a duty to warn if you can find a legal relationship with someone."
1992.91_522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,646.441,651.353,"But the duty to warn arises out of different circumstances, doesn't it?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,676.221,682.436,"Your Honor, if I may just disagree with you slightly about where the recruiting activity occurred in this case."
1992.91_522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,705.925,713.329,But there was... don't you admit there was any commercial activity amounting to recruitment in the United States?
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,713.329,721.015,"We do not contest, for purposes of this appeal, his allegation that he saw a newspaper advertisement while in the United States."
1992.91_522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.069,731.803,"Well, do you also concede that that is commercial activity carried on in the United States, the placing of that newspaper advertisement?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,731.803,731.953,Yes.
1992.91_522,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,743.771,756.821,"Going back to Justice Scalia's question, why don't you draw a distinction between a duty to warn about what a third party might do, on the one hand, and a duty to warn about what the person giving the warning might do?"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,778.317,781.92,"Well, I think it's unnecessary for the Court to go that far in this case, Your Honor."
1992.91_522,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,797.1,798.612,That's all you want us to recognize.
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,798.612,801.033,--The Court doesn't need to go farther than that in this case.
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.831,918.883,May I ask on that point?
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,935.606,936.347,--It would not be a different case.
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.347,940.54,"So, then the fact that you have law enforcement personnel involved really isn't a critical part of your--"
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,940.54,944.333,"Makes it an easier case I believe, but in your hypothetical, it would not be a different case."
1992.91_522,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,951.318,955.252,"--So, you don't draw a distinction between government-owned hospitals and government police forces."
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,955.252,955.773,--I do not.
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.773,971.482,"And you'd say, I assume, that if a private employer did the same thing and took one of its employees into the back room and had him beat up by some of the private employer's officers, that would not be a commercial activity."
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,971.482,974.885,"It might be a commercially motivated activity, Justice Scalia."
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.885,976.217,But the nature of it is not commercial.
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,976.217,977.318,The nature of it is not commercial.
1992.91_522,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.318,978.999,It has nothing to do with governmental.
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,980.1,982.692,It has to be commercial to be jurisdictional in this case.
1992.91_522,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,983.052,989.807,"Under that analysis, it seems to me you make irrelevant the injunction of the statute that purpose shall not be considered."
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,989.807,993.42,"--Justice Kennedy, I think just the opposite."
1992.91_522,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1027.148,1038.464,"Well, suppose in Justice Stevens' hypothetical of the security guards beating up the employee, they did it in order to punish the employee for transgressions on the job and to teach other employees not to do that in the future."
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,1040.855,1053.756,"Your Honor, I think your hypothetical aptly defines their motivation, their purpose, but I think what the Court said in Weltover is that that's irrelevant, and we look at the nature of the conduct itself, not what motivates the conduct to determine whether the activity is commercial."
1992.91_522,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1057.332,1064.615,I take it your criterion in answering Justice Kennedy's question is that what's commercial or not depends on what is commercial in the United States.
1992.91_522,0,22538,everett_c_johnson_jr,,1064.615,1065.937,"That's correct, Justice Souter."
1992.91_522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.931,1072.182,"Very well, Mr. Johnson."
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1073.27,1093.375,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.723,1201.236,"Mr. Minear, would you just clear up one thing to be sure I understand your position?"
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1207.841,1209.974,"Well, that claim would be based on the contract."
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.974,1210.215,Right.
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1210.215,1219.321,And the contract here had a forum selection clause that provided that any dispute arising from this contract shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Saudi courts only.
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.321,1230.28,"Well, assume you don't have a forum... just assume you have a naked contract without a forum selection clause in it, and a breach 10 months after was signed in the United States by failing to pay in Saudi Arabia."
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1234.342,1237.153,"In that case, the question becomes one of substantial contacts."
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.153,1237.363,"--Well, I understand."
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1238.665,1241.817,And our answer would be that the contract alone would not be substantial contacts.
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.888,1261.531,"Even following extensive recruitment activity, you'd still say the same thing?"
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1261.531,1268.504,"At some point, this becomes a question of the extent of the contacts that the Saudi Government might have--"
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1268.504,1276.812,"Well, say you've got enough contact to say that the commercial activity was in the United States, but then the breach is in Saudi Arabia by failing to pay."
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1276.812,1279.463,"--In that case, I think that it probably would qualify."
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.136,1305.701,"Well, if you admit that the failure to pay would be sufficient for jurisdiction, then what if by tortious means they took the money back from him in some way?"
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1312.997,1314.319,"Again, the question would be substantial contacts."
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1318.724,1318.904,"No, no."
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1320.494,1323.605,"But if it occurred abroad, the question here would be substantial contacts."
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.039,1335.415,"My assumption is you have the same substantial contacts, and they're enough to support a suit for failure to pay the salary 10 months after the man goes to work in Saudi Arabia."
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1344.66,1344.881,--Yes.
1992.91_522,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1429.641,1438.917,"--Well, Mr. Minear, they also claim a breach of a duty to warn at the time of recruitment."
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1438.917,1442.98,"Well, as we explain in our brief, the negligence claims may stand on a somewhat different footing."
1992.91_522,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.776,1472.149,Although the Government argues differently under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1486.5,1489.064,"I'm sure you'd not be able to, and I think the--"
1992.91_522,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.064,1489.813,Why is this any different?
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1489.813,1491.345,--It might not be different.
1992.91_522,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1508.908,1522.977,"But do you think the duty to warn referred to a duty to warn of anything but the activities, i.e., the potentially tortious activities of the Arabian Government itself?"
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1522.977,1527.73,"Well, the duty to warn... it's not clear, first of all, whether there is any such duty to warn."
1992.91_522,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1527.73,1531.132,"Well, let's assume just for the sake of argument there is."
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1540.249,1541.578,That's right.
1992.91_522,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1544.92,1548.513,"Well, does that fall within any recognized category of tort?"
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1548.513,1550.536,"--I would think not, but again--"
1992.91_522,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1550.536,1550.983,"So, why--"
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1550.983,1554.377,"--the respondents should have an opportunity to make that argument, we believe."
1992.91_522,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1554.377,1560.901,--It seems to me you're bending over backwards to give them an opportunity to make an argument that doesn't seem to be very plausible.
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1560.901,1572.26,"Well, ultimately our position here is based not on the merits of this individual claim, but rather, we're concerned with the broader principle, and that is the question of what we mean by based upon a commercial activity in the United States."
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.736,1671.775,"Mr. Minear, when we judge whether or not an activity is commercial in nature, do we look to the standards and practices of the international business community, or is it to what is a commercial activity here in the United States?"
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1671.775,1679.111,--I think Weltover indicates that we should look to the commercial activities as Congress understood them at the time it enacted the FSIA.
1992.91_522,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.088,1693.691,You mean we look to what is commercial activity in 1976?
1992.91_522,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1693.691,1696.012,"Well, what Congress would have envisioned at that time."
1992.91_522,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.536,1699.775,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,1702.456,1714.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.109,1787.121,"Mr. Stevens, you say there are three defendants."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,1794.316,1795.337,"Yes, it was."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.337,1798.65,And you want it retained in the case?
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,1798.65,1806.194,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are eight causes of action stated against Saudi Arabia."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1857.639,1870.806,"So, you do want Saudi Arabia, the state, retained as a defendant because you contend it's the alter ego of the hospital."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,1870.806,1872.879,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1872.879,1877.079,"So, when you say you're just talking about a hospital, you're actually talking about something more."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,1881.213,1886.606,"In its capacity as the owner and operator of a hospital enterprise, that is correct."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1889.498,1905.87,Suppose the recruiter for Saudi Arabia in this country affirmatively misrepresented certain critical facts that would obtain during his work in Saudi Arabia.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,1916.014,1928.193,"--First, Your Honor, we do believe it's unquestionable that the principal will be answerable for the acts of its agent and that there will be jurisdiction extended for those acts even if they're not performed directly in the United States."
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.15,1966.458,"Mr. Stevens, suppose the hospital supervisors had someone that they had hired beat up because he was dating the hospital president's daughter."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,1969.25,1977.605,"Justice Scalia, our view is that there is a very short menu that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act provides."
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.417,1993.557,It would?
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,1993.557,1997.62,--It may be an odd sense of the term commercial.
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.62,1998.779,It certainly is.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,1998.779,2003.524,But it certainly could not be considered governmental or sovereign or uniquely public in nature.
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.524,2008.639,"So, any tort committed against him by his employer is commercial."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2008.639,2013.912,"Well, the torts that we have alleged in the complaint against the hospital... and this is the key point--"
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.912,2014.133,No.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2026.691,2031.875,"--For purposes of a jurisdictional analysis under the statute, it cannot be uniquely governmental."
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.367,2039.771,I don't see the world as being divided into commerce and government.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2053.089,2059.344,The question under the act in our view is the outward form of the conduct.
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.699,2068.44,That isn't the question.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2083.454,2084.094,--That is our position.
1992.91_522,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2105.92,2112.334,What is that substantial conduct that you rely on here?
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2117.469,2134.179,"The complaint alleges, in a portion titled, Factual Allegations Against King Faisal Specialist Hospital, a course of dealing in the United States that goes well beyond the specific advertisement that was issued in the U.S. media or the specific recruitment of Scott Nelson."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.555,2228.301,"You wouldn't be making any different argument, would you, if Mr. Nelson didn't perform his job over there?"
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2240.819,2242.141,"--Precisely, we would."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2242.141,2242.351,Yes.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2246.805,2253.81,"Well, but the point, Justice White, is the United States contacts bracket this entire employment relationship."
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.826,2268.971,But the statute doesn't say bracketed by commercial activity in the United States.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2272.894,2277.809,"--I was addressing my remarks, Justice Scalia, to the substantial contact requirement."
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.589,2282.313,The two are the same.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2292.181,2293.533,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.388,2319.989,"Well, I don't--"
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2362.115,2366.188,"Mr. Chief Justice, this was Mr. Nelson's employer."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.109,2384.42,But not to prevent injury at the hands of the employer.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2384.42,2394.027,"--I would say, Mr. Chief Justice, to prevent foreseeable injury at the hands of anyone, to the extent that the employer can exercise ordinary care for that purpose."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2394.027,2405.306,"Well, you mean, when I leave the premises of, say, the store that I work at and walk home at night, my employer has a duty to see that nobody mugs me on the way home?"
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2405.306,2413.413,"Well, if your employer knows that there is a dangerous criminal lurking outside the entranceway, it may issue some kind of warning that you should take care."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.408,2437.912,But that doesn't depend on any duty of care.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2448.382,2469.484,"You're correct that it does not depend, in the way that we think about these things, on the articulation of a duty, but in our view, both in terms of the nature of the commercial activity and its substantial contact with the United States, you cannot look at these torts, these intentional torts, in isolation and rip them out of this commercial context."
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2485.235,2487.896,"In other words, you want us to look at the purpose of the act."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2487.896,2517.485,"Justice Souter, I think that the purpose of the act here, why it may be that this employer beat Mr. Nelson, that purpose is reflected in the complaint, but that an employer intentionally injures an employee in whatever association it may be, on the work place, in connection with the performance of his jobs, however that happens, is an action that any private hospital employer could have done."
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2521.148,2522.158,What's that got to do with the answer to my question?
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2525.432,2525.632,It is a commercial activity.
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2525.632,2529.713,"And that gives you a problem under the statute, doesn't it?"
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2529.713,2532.345,"Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2539.731,2541.133,And it makes a distinction between--
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2541.133,2541.222,--or a particular transaction or an act.
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2541.222,2541.642,--Excuse me.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2545.506,2546.287,"It does, Your Honor."
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2546.287,2550.161,"Okay, and you want us basically to disregard that distinction."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2550.161,2553.393,"No, I'm not arguing that."
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2553.393,2564.209,"Would your claim... would you have a cause of action, even on your own theory, if they beat him up because he had fraudulently misrepresented his credentials?"
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2565.16,2568.773,"Justice Souter, it's not a question about whether there is a cause of action."
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2568.773,2571.584,"No, but isn't the answer to my question no?"
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2573.536,2575.759,"You would not have a cause of action, but you might have jurisdiction."
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2575.759,2593.621,"But the fact is you wouldn't have a cause of action, and the only distinction between that case and this one and the only reason that there might be on your theory jurisdiction in one case and not in the other is by looking to the motivation for the act, and that is exactly what the statute tells us we can't do."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2593.621,2605.808,"The proposition is narrow and simple, and it is that torts committed by an employer in the context of an employment relationship are commercial, just as they would be if the employer breached a contract."
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2605.808,2608.76,"In other words, you don't have to look to the motivation to the act."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2616.998,2623.58,"That... we know more in this case, but that is all that you would need to know for our jurisdiction analysis."
1992.91_522,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2623.58,2624.802,"On the theory that you're now espousing, that's all you need to know."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2624.802,2625.063,Correct.
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.063,2625.513,Good.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2647.26,2651.082,"Justice Scalia, there may not be a cause of action."
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.874,2654.104,I'm not talking about cause of action.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2665.232,2669.676,"We would say that it provides the jurisdictional basis under the statute, yes, that it's a commercial activity."
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.676,2670.628,It is a commercial activity.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2679.013,2682.706,"Torts... as the employer against the employee, it would be a commercial activity in our view."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.706,2685.905,"That isn't a commercial activity in the United States, is it?"
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2685.905,2698.374,"Well, the issue of substantial contact is one, Justice White, that is not subject to the limitations as to nature and purpose that the analysis of whether an act is commercial in nature is subject to."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.374,2708.993,"Well, do you... I thought the statute said... I thought you... I thought your theory was that your suit was based on a commercial activity that occurred in the United States."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2708.993,2724.443,"Our theory is that the action is based upon commercial conduct, transactions or acts that have substantial contact with the United States, and nothing more is required in the statute by the express terms of the statute."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.443,2731.636,"And... but... and you say the... running a hospital is a commercial activity, and it has substantial contacts with the United States."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2732.708,2737.292,The conduct upon which this case is based performed by this hospital--
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.292,2737.7,Yes.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2737.7,2740.104,--is commercial and has such substantial contact.
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.104,2742.424,And what are the substantial contacts with the United States?
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2742.424,2746.867,There was an unbroken course of dealing with respect to Mr. Nelson.
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.867,2758.534,"So, rather than start with a commercial activity and going up the line, you start with the commercial activity of running a hospital and coming back down to... you have to trace it."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2762.237,2763.689,"Well, to the activity."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.689,2765.771,And the signing of the contract?
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2765.771,2779.678,"The recruitment, the signing of the contract, the definition of the job responsibilities, and all of those activities that occurred here in the United States that led to Mr. Nelson's accepting his employment and performing those responsibilities in Saudi Arabia."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.678,2783.892,"Well, of course, he... part of his recruitment went on in Saudi Arabia."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2783.892,2787.885,"He was interviewed in Saudi Arabia, Justice White."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.425,2794.098,I suppose he didn't ask any question at all about what his duties would be?
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2794.098,2802.673,"I'm certain that he did, but they were finely defined in the employment agreement, in the job description, and in the advertisement that was... that he first responded to."
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2839.638,2842.51,They're just getting more and more complete as they went on.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2844.34,2851.485,"The allegations in the complaint as true, and what does the complaint say."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2982.764,2994.982,"Mr. Stevens, you said earlier I think in response to a question from Justice Scalia that you thought the act divided conduct into governmental and commercial."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,2995.984,2996.174,"Yes, sir."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2996.174,3002.83,Do you rely on any of our decisions for that proposition or on some specific part of the statutory language?
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3002.83,3019.261,"Well, I believe that the Court's decision in the Dunhill case, which recently in the Weltover opinion this Court has said has authoritative explanation of the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, can be looked to to establish what is essentially the dichotomy here."
1992.91_522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3019.261,3023.422,"Well, Dunhill was not an interpretation of the FSIA, was it?"
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3023.422,3025.593,"It was not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91_522,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.202,3039.995,You mean a gloss in advance.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3040.396,3041.507,An advanced gloss.
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.759,3062.28,"I suppose it's doubtless true that when you have a Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act case in front of you, if you say... if you come to the conclusion that the act was not a commercial act, then for purposes of that statute, the act must be treated as an act of government."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3062.28,3063.202,Precisely.
1992.91_522,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3063.202,3074.489,"But in making the inquiry of whether it's a commercial act or not, I don't think you approach it with the mental attitude that everything in the world has to be either a commercial act or a governmental act."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3101.87,3113.407,"Well, we approach it in much the same way, and it is a conundrum that this dichotomy places one in, a dilemma, so to speak, and I would acknowledge that."
1992.91_522,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.32,3119.341,I suppose perhaps the question is whether piracy is commerce.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3119.341,3123.492,"Well, the law has resolved that question, Justice Stevens."
1992.91_522,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3197.371,3205.458,It's not clear to me the extent to which you base your complaint on a breach of the contract itself.
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3229.706,3232.09,We have no causes of action in contract.
1992.91_522,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3234.18,3234.921,Why is that?
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3234.921,3243.107,"--It is because of the way that counsel in the original proceeding wrote the complaint, Justice Kennedy."
1992.91_522,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3245.14,3255.776,"Do you at least use the contract or may you use the contract as setting forth the duties of the employer, which then gives rise to a tort cause of action?"
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3256.908,3268.586,"--Well, our theory with respect to the contract is that it is impossible to understand either the commercial nature of the activity or the substantiality of the contact with the United States without looking to the agreement."
1992.91_522,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3294.604,3312.756,"So, your theory is that by setting forth terms of discipline in the contract, that at least establishes that discipline was within the realm of commercial activity and that the employer exceeded permissible discipline and committed a tort in this instance."
1992.91_522,2,38296,paul_s_stevens,,3313.007,3316.198,That is precisely what we are arguing with respect to that portion of the contract.
