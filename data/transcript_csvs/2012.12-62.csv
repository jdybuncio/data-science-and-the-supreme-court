2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-62, Peugh v. United States."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,6.97,11.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,63.84,64.273,Excuse me.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,65.275,66.558,Excuse me?
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.558,68.81,"A mandatory schedule, you say?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,68.81,73.612,"No, it's a term of a -- of a mandatory statute, subsection--"
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,73.612,74.631,"Oh, okay."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,74.631,78.433,--(a)(4) of -- of 18 USC 3553.
2012.12-62,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,113.754,117.741,"Well, let's say you prevail and the case is remanded for resentencing."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,159.718,161.151,"No, it would not, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.161,181.381,It's not a change of the law if -- if the law does not require the guidelines to be imposed.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,198.776,200.295,Substantial -- significant risk.
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.295,201.195,Significant risk.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,234.866,240.084,"No, because the Ex Post Facto Clause only applies to laws where here are delegated lawmaking."
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,262.266,266.135,Is that what your definition of legal consequence is?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,266.135,268.503,"--Well, legal consequence refers to punishment."
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,271.472,281.561,"So you're taking -- you're disagreeing with the proposition of our older cases that to -- for there to be an ex post facto violation, you have to have a legal consequence."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,281.561,282.947,"--No, not at all, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,289.251,292.719,"Well, there's a -- there's the disconnect for me."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,303.658,319.084,"--Well, the Court said in Morales and in Lynce that -- and then when it was reconciled in two different formulations of the standard -- and in Lynce, the Court said it's the same test whether you increase the penalty or whether you determine that there's a sufficient risk of increasing the penalty."
2012.12-62,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,320.036,327.94,Your real formula is significantly increased the risk of perform -- of prolonging the defendant's incarceration.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,329.825,332.444,"--That's the standard of Garner and Morales, yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.444,352.841,"--And is -- is the heart of your argument that there really isn't much difference at all in what district judges are doing now that the guidelines are discretionary than what they did when they were mandatory, that is, most of them will start with and stop with the guidelines."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,354.574,356.392,Yes.
2012.12-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,381.008,395.018,"Your -- your -- your brief spent some time on statistics, how often this happens; but I take it you're not saying that our inquiry is a statistical one."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,405.725,407.442,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.557,439.127,What about the statutes allowing relatives and friends of the victim to testify?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,450.435,451.887,"No, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.875,458.225,Why?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,460.391,461.327,"Well, you have to--"
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,461.327,462.793,--if the defendant will get a higher sentence?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,466.295,472.198,"--Well, but -- you have to show -- I think you have -- this is a core sentencing law."
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,483.756,498.766,"What if you have a law that sentencing judges must consider these factors, and one of the factors is whether the defendant has strong family ties that will be, you know, jeopardized or whatever, if he's incarcerated."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,528.035,535.891,"I think if it is simply a change in the mix of factors, even the mandatory factors, it wouldn't necessarily create a significant risk."
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,536.991,545.664,"Well, under -- under our modification of the guidelines approach, isn't that just a list of factors that the Court should consider, or must consider?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,545.664,554.785,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the guidelines are distinctive, because they are the actual benchmark, and they must -- and the starting point for any sentencing."
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.125,569.16,Is that -- is that what -- who says that they're the benchmark that you start with?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,571.062,572.231,--That's in Gall.
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.933,578.218,A court -- a court must begin with that.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,578.218,578.735,Yes.
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,586.455,598.179,"So what if the -- what if the law said the court must begin with a comparison of what the average sentence is across the country, okay?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,614.308,619.628,"--I don't think necessarily so, but this is a -- a requirement to actually consider a range."
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,619.628,620.145,"No, no."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,638.339,642.041,I think it may be if you had the exact same Rita and Gall framework--
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,642.041,642.541,Yes.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,642.541,648.362,--and that -- that framework is that that range actually is the benchmark and the -- and the starting point.
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,659.503,660.62,And so the answer--
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,660.62,661.372,And it is then reviewed on appeal--
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,661.372,663.039,--And so the answer to my question is?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,663.039,674.862,"--It would be -- I think it would be likely if it were -- if it were within the same framework, if it's the mandatory benchmark with appellate review for substantive reasonableness, and a presumption--"
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,674.862,675.462,I'm sorry.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,675.881,681.618,--and a presumption of -- of reasonableness on appeal would attach to that standard.
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,681.618,687.772,So just getting more accurate information violates the Ex Post Facto Clause in the framework that you've set forth?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,687.772,705.151,"I think if it's -- if you could -- if it's an actual -- well, I don't know -- the distinction I was trying to draw is that if you actually -- if the statute has effectively delegated the specification of a specific range, as opposed to just a data factor that might change over time."
2012.12-62,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,728.314,740.389,"What if the -- what if the statistics showed that nationwide only, let's say, 25 percent of defendants were being sentenced within the guideline range; would that change your argument?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,740.389,744.443,"I think it makes the -- well, we have an argument that's specific to our sentencing."
2012.12-62,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,788.688,791.038,"Well, I think there's a fair chance that as time goes by--"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,791.038,791.421,--I think it's clear--
2012.12-62,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,791.421,795.258,--we're going to see fewer and fewer sentences within the guidelines.
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,821.159,822.875,You're assuming that's changed over time.
2012.12-62,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,822.875,835.817,"--Well, when I was on the court of appeals we thought it was our responsibility to ensure that the district courts were complying with the Sentencing Reform Act."
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,838.202,841.387,It wasn't.
2012.12-62,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,843.156,855.646,--Let's say this case comes back in 20 years and the statistics show that only a -- a distinct minority of defendants are being sentenced within the guidelines; would the case come out differently?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,855.646,861.2,"--Perhaps, but again this is an as-applied challenge, so we look to current data."
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.765,943.871,"Your -- your case depends, it seems to me, upon the proposition that significant risk is only applicable at the sentencing stage."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,984.015,991.835,"I think my response would be, Your Honor, that's not -- that particular change would not be in the third category of Calder, the increase in punishment."
2012.12-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1003.81,1007.897,And would it be ex post facto in -- in the hypothetical Justice Scalia gave?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1007.897,1016.3,"--No, I don't think so, because I think -- well, it may, depending on the circumstances, be within the fourth category, but not under the third."
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1017.569,1020.104,Can you tell me the narrow rule that you would propose--
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1020.104,1020.554,--Yes.
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1020.554,1024.656,--getting back to Justice Scalia--
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1024.656,1024.94,The narrow rule--
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1024.94,1028.294,--which is procedures change risks.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1050.374,1055.777,"--I don't think so, because the Court has generally excluded procedural changes even if you could show--"
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1055.777,1057.094,So why is this not procedural?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1057.094,1058.479,--Because the--
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1058.479,1071.221,"Give me the rule where I can draw a line between those changes that are permissible and those that are not, not the general statement you're making, because both increase the risk of a higher sentence."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1071.221,1071.687,--Right.
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1071.687,1072.437,So it can't be that.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1072.437,1072.756,No.
2012.12-62,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1087.164,1108.846,"--But that was in the -- that Florida case was the mandatory, almost mandatory guideline, and I think our starting point is -- your starting point, too -- is that when the guidelines were mandatory it was ex post facto because our decision in the Florida case said it was."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1116.583,1117.352,"No, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1146.871,1160.429,"But saying that the sentencer has to consider testimony from the victim or from relatives of the deceased, that -- that change in sentencing law is okay?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1160.429,1165.416,"Under the fact that it's considered a procedural law, not substantive."
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.416,1167.201,It pertains to sentencing.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1173.272,1174.455,Well--
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.455,1176.806,This is evidence brought before the sentencer.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1176.806,1177.573,"--Well, yes."
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1177.573,1182.977,I don't see any difference between that and saying that the -- the guidelines have to be considered by the sentencer.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1182.977,1186.496,"Well, I may have misheard your -- your hypothetical."
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1203.874,1205.41,You're answering me differently now?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1205.41,1206.01,--I'm sorry?
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1206.01,1207.876,You're answering me differently?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1210.195,1211.314,"I -- I may have misheard, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1211.314,1227.989,"--I said the sentencing -- the assumptions I made were the sentencing law changes, victims must testify, judges must consider what they say, and after 5 years it's proven that when victims speak the sentences are higher."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1230.358,1235.595,"Well, I think Miller did draw a distinction."
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1245.418,1246.737,I'm asking you to draw it.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1257.842,1262.162,--I think -- I think the Court could draw the line simply on substantive standards that are applied.
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1266.548,1268.233,"What does that mean to you, the number of years in jail?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1268.233,1269.016,--Yes.
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1269.016,1270.602,Is that as limited as you want it to be?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1270.602,1272.818,"Well, it could be."
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1278.006,1278.739,"Well, we know that's Miller."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1278.739,1279.374,--Right.
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1279.374,1280.491,This is not Miller.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1280.491,1286.378,"Well, but even the -- there are sentencing factors that are mandatory other than the guidelines range."
2012.12-62,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1286.378,1289.564,I would have thought you would have gone back to Calder v. Bull.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1302.387,1303.256,Right.
2012.12-62,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.256,1308.827,--and inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1320.616,1322.635,It is a law that changes--
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.635,1325.92,"Does it “ affix a higher punishment ”, in the words of Calder v. Bull?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1325.92,1326.47,--I think it--
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.47,1328.139,I don't think that's a question at all.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1333.109,1339.429,"--But -- but the Court in Garner, in Lynce, have equated that with increased risk of significant punishment."
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.833,1345.383,Okay.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1347.116,1348.135,--Yes.
2012.12-62,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1350.404,1351.787,I wouldn't concede that.
2012.12-62,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.787,1352.387,That doesn't help--
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1352.387,1352.737,--Okay.
2012.12-62,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1372.365,1383.606,"Could you remind me -- it's in the briefs -- if a sentence is appealed, what is the review authority of the appellate court?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1388.66,1394.73,The review authority is to review for both procedural and substantive reasonableness.
2012.12-62,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1406.038,1413.025,"But isn't the important point, Mr. Kinnaird, that there's a presumption of correctness that attaches to guidelines sentences on appeal--"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1413.025,1413.425,--Yes.
2012.12-62,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1413.425,1415.394,--that does not attach to non-guidelines sentences?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1415.394,1415.677,Yes.
2012.12-62,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1417.694,1421.798,"I mean, this is, one would think, great legal consequence."
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1421.798,1422.648,It is.
2012.12-62,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1439.259,1450.833,Do you know what the statistics are as to the number of below-guidelines sentences each year that are reversed by the courts of appeals on the ground that they are not reasonable?
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1450.833,1461.173,"Well, I think that they are fairly low -- I don't know the precise statistics -- I believe they're low for defendant appeals."
2012.12-62,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1466.243,1466.777,Yes.
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1467.31,1470.278,"--I believe the -- yes, it may be -- I don't know."
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1477.05,1477.417,"Counsel, who prevails?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1478.417,1479.836,--The government tends to prevail when it brings.
2012.12-62,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1491.025,1506.737,"Have you had -- are you aware of any circuit court case in recent time where a circuit has reversed the lower range than the guideline, basically because the deviation from the guideline was unreasonable?"
2012.12-62,0,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1508.82,1506.737,I'm not sure.
2012.12-62,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.579,1600.865,"--Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-62,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1611.137,1614.506,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-62,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1627.933,1631.384,Why are you fighting this proposition?
2012.12-62,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1644.958,1649.196,"--Well, Your Honor, we -- we opposed certiorari largely on that ground."
2012.12-62,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1671.443,1674.311,"Practically speaking, do you believe it makes no difference?"
2012.12-62,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1674.311,1684.369,"Your Honor, I freely believe that the guidelines are very influential to many district judges and district judges often agree with the guidelines."
2012.12-62,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1688.987,1700.362,"This is a change -- your position is -- is a change, at least in the position that the Government took in -- in the Seventh Circuit case that started all this."
2012.12-62,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1741.606,1756.531,"Your Honor, the Government changed its position in response to this Court's decisions in Gall, Kimbrough and Irizarry, because before those decisions came out, there was an argument that the guidelines still imposed some substantive legal constraint on a district court's sentencing discretion."
2012.12-62,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1787.051,1794.055,The guidelines range gets a presumption of reasonableness at the appellate level.
2012.12-62,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1794.055,1798.942,"That's right, Your Honor, and I think Rita actually supports our position, not Petitioner's."
2012.12-62,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1835.116,1843.387,What is the reason that miscalculating a guideline is considered a procedural error?
2012.12-62,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1843.387,1856.212,"Well, Your Honor, it's very clear from 3553(a)(4) that Congress wants district courts to start with the right mix of information, which includes the most up-to-date recommendation of the Sentencing Commission."
2012.12-62,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1856.212,1857.231,That begs the question.
2012.12-62,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1871.657,1884.381,"It has importance, Your Honor, and as I've said before, they can be very influential to judges, but the reason why it's an error to miscalculate the guidelines is not because the guidelines impose any substantive constraint on the district court's discretion."
2012.12-62,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1893.654,1911.866,"But what that suggests is that the guidelines serve as an anchor and are supposed to serve as an anchor, and that the reason why the miscalculation is error is because you've picked the wrong anchor and that's going to affect or -- or has a significant likelihood of affecting your ultimate decision."
2012.12-62,2,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,1925.923,1929.041,"Your Honor, there are two things you could mean when you use the word “ anchor ”."
2012.12-62,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1956.895,1959.097,I think I'm saying more than it's all in your head.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1990.116,2003.174,"Well, Your Honor, the Court made clear in Pepper two terms ago that the district court's overarching legal duty is to impose a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary to meet the statutory purposes of sentencing in section 3553(a)(2)."
2012.12-62,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.784,2020.469,"No, it isn't, but that I think is an undecided question at best."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2183.693,2185.36,"Let me start at the end there, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-62,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.36,2186.978,"I disagree with all that, by the way."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2190.613,2203.338,"Well, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, beginning with what you said at the end there, I think it would be inappropriate to untether the significant risk test from the requirement that there be an ex post facto law."
2012.12-62,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2232.775,2236.743,"But when it comes to the court of appeals, it's different."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2245.083,2259.156,"--Well, Your Honor, as I've explained, the reason why courts -- the only way in which courts of appeals can apply a different standard of review to a sentence, depending on where it falls in the guidelines range, is the presumption of reasonableness the Court recognized in Rita."
2012.12-62,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2275.968,2281.356,I know there is a lot of dispute now about the child pornography sentences.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2308.156,2312.375,"--Your Honor, it would depend on the individual circumstances of the particular case."
2012.12-62,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2312.375,2314.26,"No, I'm giving you exactly what the judge says."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2332.039,2339.044,"I think the court of appeals might say that it's substantively unreasonable because it's a very, very low sentence even in comparison to the statute."
2012.12-62,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.044,2342.679,"I assume that the statute is one that permits 10 days, right?"
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2357.856,2366.112,"And, Your Honor, in that case, it is possible a court of appeals would decide that that is substantively unreasonable."
2012.12-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2378.252,2388.208,"Do you disagree with -- getting back to what this case is about, the D.C. Circuit, in opposition to the Seventh Circuit said:"
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2427.0,2434.006,"--Well, Your Honor, there are two complaints that Petitioner could be making about his particular sentencing."
2012.12-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2446.447,2451.718,He's saying that -- the question is which guidelines in this case?
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2475.499,2485.039,"--And whichever set of guidelines the district court started with, it had discretion and in fact the obligation to impose the appropriate sentence under 3553(a)."
2012.12-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2485.039,2492.193,"Now, we know that this district judge, he didn't want to get into any philosophical things about what was better or what was worse."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2515.208,2523.647,"Your Honor, Petitioner argued in this case that the former guidelines range suggested a more appropriate sentence than the 2009 guidelines range."
2012.12-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2532.003,2539.573,It's not -- it's not a question of whether the judge thought that the one guideline was better than the other.
2012.12-62,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2553.583,2556.551,"Yes, I agree with Justice Ginsburg's follow-up question."
2012.12-62,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.676,2571.045,I think you are saying that it doesn't matter because they are advisory--
2012.12-62,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2571.045,2572.413,"Well, I'd like to finish."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2574.63,2590.958,"--Well, Your Honor, on the record, I think if you look at the full sentencing transcript, which is in the Joint Appendix, you will see that one of the questions the judge had to answer was which set of guidelines were provided -- were the set of guidelines that he had to calculate under 3553(A)(4)(a)(2)."
2012.12-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2613.055,2615.324,But the district court was following orders.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2621.393,2640.141,"Justice Ginsburg, it's -- as the Court considers these as two separate questions, one is which is the set of guidelines I'm required to calculate under Section 3553(a), and second, having calculated those guidelines, what sentence should I impose, with the guidelines as one of the factors that the Court consider."
2012.12-62,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2640.141,2646.295,"Mr. Feigin, you're sounding awfully like according deference to the guidelines counts as reversible error."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2646.295,2648.997,"No, Your Honor, that's not what I'm trying to say."
2012.12-62,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.406,2673.112,"--It is reversible error, is it not, simply to blindly apply the guidelines without considering the factors in 3553?"
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2674.212,2675.295,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2677.064,2685.92,"But surely, you do not want judges living in a world where they think that they cannot give deference to the guidelines; isn't that right?"
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2690.122,2693.959,"--Your Honor, we want them to find the guidelines persuasive and influential."
2012.12-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2758.551,2772.776,"Was Judge Randolph wrong when he said, quoting the sentencing commission, that within-guidelines range, even after Booker, is the standard?"
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2783.683,2788.237,"So, Your Honor, I think the post-Booker report refutes that in the respect I just suggested."
2012.12-62,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2793.807,2801.145,But this statement comes from Final Report on the Impact of the United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2801.145,2805.882,"Your Honor, the commission says many things in its report."
2012.12-62,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2826.112,2827.978,I see -- I see now where you're going.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2861.134,2862.619,"--That's exactly my point, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2862.619,2862.801,All right.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2863.636,2875.676,"I'd like to add two -- two observations to that, first of which is, as an empirical matter, it is extremely unlikely for a sentence to get reversed on substantive reasonableness grounds."
2012.12-62,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2891.471,2893.705,--But now I can narrow what the question I think is.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2893.705,2907.73,"And the second point I'd like to make, Your Honor, with respect to that is that I don't think this Court should assume that district courts are actually going to change what sentences they impose and not impose the sentence they believe is sufficient, but no greater than necessary to meet the purposes of sentencing just because they--"
2012.12-62,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2907.73,2910.932,"Well, but that -- that gets back to -- to your argument."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2943.088,2945.122,"--Your Honor, I absolutely--"
2012.12-62,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2945.122,2946.372,You don't want me -- you don't want me to say that.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2946.372,2950.343,--I absolutely do not want you to leave the bench with the impression that the guidelines are unimportant.
2012.12-62,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2960.282,2962.067,"Mr. Feigin, take this example."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2990.418,2990.918,--Yes.
2012.12-62,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2990.918,2991.503,Okay.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3028.258,3030.175,"Your Honor, I think I'm saying something slightly different."
2012.12-62,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3055.593,3066.449,"Mr. Feigin, I'm under the impression -- more than the impression I know -- that the Sentencing Commission can make a revision of the guidelines retroactive."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3078.542,3080.558,I believe it's only for revisions that lower--
2012.12-62,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3080.558,3082.244,"Only for lower, okay."
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3088.731,3098.004,"--And, Your Honor, getting back to how the advisory guidelines are working in practice for a minute, which again is I don't think what this -- what the focus should be."
2012.12-62,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3138.062,3147.269,But your statement to me was -- and to us earlier -- was that there is no legal constraint on the exercise of discretion.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3169.099,3170.968,"Your Honor, they are a factor."
2012.12-62,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3186.811,3190.862,Would you accept the fact that they define the discretion even though they don't constrain it?
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3190.862,3193.714,"Your Honor, I wouldn't say they define the discretion either."
2012.12-62,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3198.368,3199.784,What if -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3200.501,3202.403,"--I'm happy to be, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3205.438,3207.64,A good advocate.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3230.737,3238.676,"I think it might well violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, Your Honor, because in that case you have something we don't have here, which is that the decisionmaker has less discretion than--"
2012.12-62,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3238.676,3242.98,No matter how narrow -- no matter how narrow the original grant of discretion is?
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3250.717,3262.858,"--The reason -- the reason I said “ might well ” is I think at that point the Court would have to look at the significance of the increase or decrease in the sentencer's authority, and decide whether that was a significant enough increase or decrease to trigger the--"
2012.12-62,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3262.858,3263.358,How would -- how would a Court--
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3263.358,3263.541,--the Ex Post Facto Clause.
2012.12-62,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3263.541,3263.841,--Right.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3266.226,3268.343,I think that's where the significant risk test comes in.
2012.12-62,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3282.086,3286.388,So it's a statistical evaluation of the kind we were talking about.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3301.964,3309.086,--I think it's fundamental -- the decision in Garner doesn't precisely describe exactly how the significant risk inquiry works.
2012.12-62,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3383.133,3386.968,I think more goes into it than empirics.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3406.731,3408.75,"--So let me say two things in response to that, Your Honor."
2012.12-62,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.202,3415.404,--You can finish your sentence.
2012.12-62,3,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3415.404,3427.228,"--If you look at fraud and you look at child pornography, they deviate when they go in -- when the guidelines' suggestion goes up, the sentences don't go up in accordance with that at the same level of the chart you are looking at."
2012.12-62,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3428.428,3428.83,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-62,4,41591,stephen_b_kinnaird,,3430.713,3432.782,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-62,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3568.854,3569.971,"Thank you, counsel."
