1978.78-575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,99.01,"We'll hear arguments next in 78-575, Southern Railway against Seaboard and the consolidated cases."
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,105.299,108.511,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.923,323.217,"Am I right in thinking Mr. Evans that under Section 13 complaint, the Commission doesn't simply set as an adjudicator but it has an affirmative duty to investigate it?"
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,323.217,326.412,"It must investigate, it must begin a proceeding."
1978.78-575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.343,346.411,"Well, can it just seat back and say you two contestants bring your evidence before we will decide or does it have to participate in the investigation?"
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,346.411,348.767,"No, I think it's more the former."
1978.78-575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,375.906,380.004,So the investigation is the same under either 13 or 15?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,380.004,386.962,"Essentially the same, there are several procedural differences."
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,467.021,474.643,"Mr. Evans, can you help me in one perhaps it's an awfully narrow question but under a Section 15 proceeding, if folks see the word investigate."
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,484.117,489.06,It refers to the examination made after the suspension or after the decision to investigate.
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.971,520.179,"Well, doesn't it always follow that if the Commission has decided not to suspend, it is also necessarily decided not to investigate?"
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,520.179,523.03,"No, quite the reversed Mr. Justice is if it in order --"
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.03,525.178,Then -- then your answer was misleading.
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,525.178,525.453,I'm sorry.
1978.78-575,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,525.453,526.728,Or is it my brother --
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.728,527.438,That's got me confused.
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,527.438,527.828,I'm sorry.
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,551.846,556.405,So that an investigation may be for the purpose of determining whether or not to suspend?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,556.405,558.584,"No, maybe I'm not being clear."
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.253,563.419,Alright.
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,563.419,565.083,Pending a final decision.
1978.78-575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,573.386,579.081,But there must be some ready hallucination leading to a decision of whether or not to investigate?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,579.081,579.994,Yes.
1978.78-575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.758,594.155,And then protest come in?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,594.155,598.415,Protest come in with -- the tariffs have to followed with at least 30 days notice.
1978.78-575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,598.415,599.522,Right.
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,599.522,608.192,"A tariff comes in, it is -- protest must be in under the rules by 12 days before the effective date."
1978.78-575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,623.068,624.952,Or it has to be some sort of an appraisal.
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,624.952,625.899,There's an appraisal.
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,634.921,637.5,"But then, you still have me confused about one thing."
1978.78-575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,648.448,649.894,Yes.
1978.78-575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,649.894,650.272,Isn't it?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,650.272,654.289,"I'm not making this clear, I guess but the decision -- let me put it this way."
1978.78-575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,656.747,657.216,Without suspending?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,657.216,658.673,-- without suspending.
1978.78-575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,674.102,674.29,As you might --
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,674.29,674.677,There's no foundation for a suspension.
1978.78-575,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,674.677,674.957,But you may investigate without suspending.
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.957,676.401,There are two different kinds of investigation in other words?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,676.401,677.162,Yes.
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.15,682.094,Would that -- the word investigate under the statute can refer two different kinds of investigations.
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,686.597,687.971,"Without suspension, precisely."
1978.78-575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,695.788,709.23,"Since you analogize it to an injunction, is it the same, broadly the same kind of discretion to be exercised by the Board as a court would -- of equity would exercise?"
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,709.23,711.77,"Even broader, I believe Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,738.673,749.112,Do you say that the discretion is broader in part because they have absolutely feel a safe way of protecting everybody?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,749.112,750.167,"In effect, that's right."
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.543,807.849,May I ask one other question.
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,817.558,822.986,"It's a little bit narrower than that Mr. Justice, its -- the burden is on the carrier to demonstrate the reasonableness of the rates."
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.986,823.325,Right.
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,823.325,827.289,"Now, there are other issues embraced within the phrase lawfulness."
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.289,834.86,"But my other question was, in such a proceeding is, are reparations a possible form of relief?"
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,834.86,835.444,"Well, it --"
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.444,840.338,"It still the rate was -- at the end of the proceeding, it was determined that the rate have been unreasonable."
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,840.338,841.469,"In the Section 15, --"
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.469,842.635,In the Section 15 case.
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,842.635,844.847,-- the remedy normally is refunds.
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.107,847.814,"Yes, I see."
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,847.814,852.465,"If the Commission finds that the rates were unjustified, now that doesn't always happen."
1978.78-575,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.147,1048.868,"Mr. Evans, I assume that your position in the Court of Appeals that is the ICC's provision was different and not taken by the Department of Justice there?"
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1048.868,1057.066,"Yes, the Department of Justice argued there that the decision of the Commission was reviewable then."
1978.78-575,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1068.016,1071.346,The Government just developed its esoteric theory in this Court?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1071.346,1072.66,Yes.
1978.78-575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.66,1075.054,Quite different from its position below?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1075.054,1076.302,"Quite different, yes."
1978.78-575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.302,1081.467,I take it from your answer to Justice Rehnquist do you think its esoteric?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1081.467,1083.527,Right.
1978.78-575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1083.527,1085.188,"That's arcane, yes."
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1085.188,1092.523,I hesitate to embrace the adjective but it certainly has appeal.
1978.78-575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.389,1094.068,With yourself?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1094.068,1094.58,Pardon me?
1978.78-575,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.58,1095.769,You wish you thought of it yourself?
1978.78-575,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,1095.769,1098.007,"Yes, I have a few others."
1978.78-575,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1146.285,1148.462,Ms. Poynter.
1978.78-575,1,45881,wandaleen_poynter,,1148.462,1152.591,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-575,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1489.668,1499.999,"Very well, Ms. Poynter."
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,1505.045,1508.294,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-575,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1567.332,1569.793,Do we need to decide that in this case?
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,1572.223,1577.043,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, it is inevitable that you decide it or I think it is --"
1978.78-575,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1577.043,1578.097,In this case?
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,1578.097,1581.829,In this case.
1978.78-575,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.189,1763.104,You don't think that Arrow and SCRAP then are the cases that control this particular aspect of the case?
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,1763.104,1774.321,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we do not because we do perceive a distinction between the review of a decision not to investigate and a review of a decision not to suspend the rate."
1978.78-575,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.629,1790.96,But Congress just hadn't intended them to be?
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,1790.96,1809.366,Congress had not intended to be reviewable because the suspension power itself was enacted to prevent the practice that it previously occurred of district courts in joining rates and therefore creating a great disparity in rates contrary to the national transportation policy.
1978.78-575,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1809.366,1816.991,"Well, wouldn't it follow if Congress had not intended review of the suspension power?"
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,1826.253,1832.387,We believe not Mr. Justice Rehnquist as Mr. Evans explained.
1978.78-575,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.417,1877.505,I suppose there is something in nature of at least to analogous to probable cause and the -- that enters into their thinking at that stage?
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,1877.505,1879.242,Perha -- perhaps analogous.
1978.78-575,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.811,2151.862,"You have to equate action and non-action to sustain your position, don't you?"
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,2151.862,2154.029,"Yes, you do Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-575,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.922,2183.721,"Mr. Allen, is there a time within which a Section 13 (1) proceeding must be commenced?"
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,2183.721,2185.315,"No, not in this text."
1978.78-575,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.315,2203.699,"So your under analysis, a decision not to investigate never become final unless such a proceeding was some time of two or three years, some time rather commits because there will always be a potentiality that such a proceeding can be commenced and terminated then that would have the effect of making final."
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,2210.323,2220.628,"In a sense, I suppose that is true although it is very farfetched and unrealistic."
1978.78-575,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2236.727,2241.912,I suppose that's about equally probable as you say there's really little practical difference between your position and --
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,2241.912,2250.857,In -- in probably in most cases but it is by no means farfetched to imagine cases in which it might be a practical significance.
1978.78-575,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.365,2269.328,Why is it that they voilated the dispose of this case assuming either you are the ICC is correct.
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,2280.516,2282.24,"Yes, I think the Court could do that."
1978.78-575,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2282.24,2284.146,So it is necessary to decide.
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,2287.464,2290.578,It is not necessary to decide that question.
1978.78-575,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2298.259,2303.427,You just have to put you foot in the door for future's development.
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,2303.427,2310.018,Whether or not that would be appropriate is a matter of sound judicial administration is more of your question than mine.
1978.78-575,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2310.018,2314.445,"Or even if your foot isn't in the door, you'd like to have the door left open."
1978.78-575,2,38596,richard_a_allen,,2314.445,2317.528,"Well, certainly that's true Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-575,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2354.992,2360.251,Very well.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2361.297,2364.046,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2444.246,2453.512,"Is this something that this loud point that you just made not the one that it's just about me, something that will be apparent on the face of the proceedings?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2453.512,2454.557,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.483,2480.254,Is that allegation one capable of being resolved simply on the face of your protest without some sort of investigation?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2480.254,2500.722,It can be easily and could have been easily resolved by mere examination of the face of the tariffs that had been filed by the carriers with the railroads and should have been resolved when the allegation was made by our side that the rates on their face could not be allowed to take effect because they were substantively annullity and that they contain long and short haul departures.
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.135,2541.069,"But, okay, you use the word substantial examples that the tariffs on their face were invalid, is it your position that the ICC could simply by having looked at the tariffs and looked at the Section of the statute you rely on concluded without any further factual investigation, the tariffs were invalid?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2541.069,2543.05,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.665,2590.976,How many --
1978.78-575,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2590.976,2592.756,"Pardon, go ahead."
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2592.756,2597.774,How many pages did the tariffs consist of?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2597.774,2613.551,"I don't know, Your Honor, the exact number of pages but it was not a substantially difficult job for the Commission to evaluate the tariffs as a matter of fact the pleadings which were evaluated by the Commission in this case were about half the size of the yellow pages of the Washington phonebook."
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2619.408,2622.823,You mean the pleadings were half the size of the yellow pages of the Washington?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2622.823,2630.178,This is the approximate size of the pleadings that were filed and resolved and digested by the Commission prior to its action authorizing the tariff to take effect.
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2630.973,2633.445,They're supposed to do that in four days?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2633.445,2644.43,"They do it in -- in this case, Your Honor, they did it and I think a little more than four days but this is not an unusual Section 15 (8) kind of record."
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.122,2662.104,"Mr. Caldwell, do I understand the Commission still doesn't agree with you on that?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2662.104,2663.171,"Your Honor, neither the Commission --"
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.171,2664.757,"Well, do they or not?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2664.757,2665.925,I don't know what the Commission specifically --
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.925,2667.264,"Well, they have -- they haven't --"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2667.264,2668.223,They haven't agreed that there were violations --
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.223,2671.224,They agreed with you even after all this time.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2674.772,2678.209,"Because apparently, they never had their tariff people look at the face of the tariffs."
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.617,2690.993,"But Mr. Caldwell, if all that's clear, could you not file a 13 (1) proceeding and you get prompt relief?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2690.993,2691.467,"No, sir."
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.696,2704.195,There's no --
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2704.195,2711.595,We could not have obtained the sort of review we sought in the Court here by submitting the Section 13 complaint.
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2727.501,2740.43,"You say that it's perfectly obvious there's a violation but you're saying because the Commission exercises discretion not to suspend and not to investigate even though the patent violation were disclosed of the Commission, as a matter of pride, they wouldn't rule that way?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2742.064,2750.622,"As a matter of case history, the Commission takes a position that overcharges and refunds cannot be established in s Section 4 proceeding."
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2781.941,2788.65,But the United States and the Commission of represented to us that the issue you want raise would be open in the Section 13 proceeding.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2790.641,2791.422,"That's correct, they are."
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.114,2807.565,"Well, if this is your objection, the United States position would take care of you?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2807.565,2807.985,"No, sir."
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.006,2813.239,Because they would go back and say that they should have investigated.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2813.239,2823.388,"The United States position is that we would now have to file Section 13 complaints and then if we were unsuccessful, we would have to go back to Court and at that time obtain a review or the failure to investigate."
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.388,2832.02,They would say that the decision did not -- to investigate was wrong and they'll put you back in a position that as if the Commission had been investigating.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2839.948,2844.058,"If they had investigated and had not suspended, they would have been refunds available."
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2844.058,2844.5,Exactly.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,2844.5,2848.103,Assuming that the allegations have ultimately been established.
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2995.636,3001.799,Do you say this Court serve court intervention is permissible only when a violation of 4 (1) is claimed?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3001.799,3014.832,I'd say that it's permissible whenever there's a statutory violation and I'd say that the Court should have the power to intervene whenever the Commission is violating either its own regulations or an organic statute which occurred in this case.
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3014.832,3017.209,"Well, and you can alleged that anytime?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3017.209,3021.633,You could allege it and I'm not suggesting that the Court would intervene and it -- that but --
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3021.633,3023.499,Or it has the power to intervene if it thinks --
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3023.499,3025.509,Only in the event of valid showing as they may.
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3025.509,3028.524,"Well, valid, substantial, you know --"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3028.524,3033.582,"We're not -- no, Your Honor, we're not talking in terms of the semantics involved."
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3048.843,3048.967,But why?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3048.967,3050.502,The Commission had two alternatives.
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3050.615,3055.276,"Mr. Caldwell, let me ask this, what if the Commission thought the allegation were simply frivolous?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3055.363,3056.655,It could have said so.
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3057.321,3061.404,But what if it said nothing but they thought they were frivolous.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3061.404,3067.995,I could not do that under Section 4 without violating the congressional intent that rates of this type not be allowed to take effect.
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.995,3068.303,But what if --
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3068.303,3082.352,"The Commission was dealing with a different section then it normally deals within a Section 15 (8) case and that Section makes clear, the Commission has not discretion to leave unresolved allegations that there are facially invalid rates that have been filed."
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.936,3089.218,But what is its standard under your view?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3089.218,3091.621,The standard is a standard that Congress established in Section 4 (1).
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.621,3097.907,"Well, I know but would you say the Commission, when these allegations are made, should it say --"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3097.907,3100.075,"The Commission has a couple of alternatives, Your Honor."
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.152,3110.131,"But what if they say well, it's about evenly balance so they're arguable?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3110.131,3110.558,It's not.
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.301,3119.374,"Well, I know, I know but (Voice Overlap) sometimes things are not that clear about what the statute means."
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3119.374,3121.426,"Well, with all due respect in this case --"
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3121.426,3127.977,"And sometimes, the Commission and other agencies have changed their mind and have been upheld on both occasions."
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3127.977,3132.738,"Well, Your Honor, those cases, I'm unaware of would -- if they're under Section 4 (1)."
1978.78-575,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.532,3147.667,What about reparations?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3155.225,3179.655,"They do not, Your Honor, because as I earlier indicated in response to Mr. Justice Stevens, the Commission will not grant refunds that would grant reparations only in the event a shipper could establish unlawfulness under other sections of the Act other than Section 4 and the Commission's cases clearly show that it does not grant refunds or overcharges where illegally established rates in violation of Section 4 (1) have been filed."
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3194.371,3195.843,Excuse me.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3213.265,3221.743,Our -- the gentleman who did the checking of these tariffs for us called me at home last night and said that he stopped counting at 500.
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3221.743,3223.172,Out of how many?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3223.172,3226.618,Out of the all the various points involved and --
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.618,3226.911,Thousands?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3226.911,3227.906,How many?
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.906,3228.622,Hundreds of thousands?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3228.622,3233.956,"There may be but not hundred of thousands, possibly thousands, there's a good chance that were thousands of violations in the tariff."
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.956,3235.675,How many did you identify in your pleadings?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3235.675,3244.667,We'd -- we identified in our pleadings before the Commission five specific documented examples showing the tariff rate showing the points involved.
1978.78-575,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.667,3249.012,You identified five specific examples out of several thousands.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3249.012,3252.06,And we said they were illustrative of hundreds.
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.617,3288.572,"So that you say that anytime you alleged a statute, so-called statutory violation whether it's four or some other statutory violation that the Commission must adjudicated in its suspension proceeding."
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3288.572,3291.584,"Not our position, Your Honor, our position is that where --"
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.584,3294.135,You must investigate and then adjudicate it.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3294.135,3300.819,"No, our position is not if any allegation whatsoever is made that the rate might have some unlawfulness and that the Commission must --"
1978.78-575,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3300.819,3319.303,We'll resume at 1 o'clock.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3321.952,3323.081,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.58,3345.957,"However, have rulings on legal points?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3345.957,3354.699,"No, the point here Your Honor is that this is not just an allegation of unlawfulness that can be rendered or determined in a post effectiveness investigation."
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.984,3372.085,"Any allegation that would have that effect, you say the ICC would have to rule on?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3372.085,3375.33,Our case is based on the Section 4 prohibition --
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3375.33,3375.58,Yes.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3375.58,3384.326,"-- which is organic to the Interstate Commerce Act and to that extent, the Commission cannot let rates take effect which contain those violations on their face."
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3387.418,3396.752,"Well, are you saying that they could not -- are you saying they just have to investigate or they could not – that they could not refuse to suspend?"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3396.752,3400.605,Or sh -- where they should not have committed the rates to take effect.
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3400.605,3400.914,So you're saying --
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3400.914,3408.623,So it should have either rejected or suspended but at a minimum they should have ordered a Section 15 (8) investigation to determine if the allegations without.
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3408.623,3412.226,Their refusal to suspend then is reviewable for the same reason as well as --
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3412.226,3413.867,That's -- that's correct.
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.867,3414.479,"Well, I --"
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3414.479,3423.241,As far as but that issue need not be reached in this case because the lower court was not reviewing the no suspend decision but the no investigate decision.
1978.78-575,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.74,3432.647,What if you were wrong on your argument with respect to the refusal to suspend?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3443.617,3445.275,"Yes, we would say that Your Honor."
1978.78-575,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3463.979,3469.991,Isn't judicial review of refusal to suspend covered by Arrow and SCRAP?
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3469.991,3479.862,"Refusal to suspend in the sense that the agency is acting within its discretionary judgment, Your Honor or applying transportation judgmental factors to the record."
1978.78-575,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3493.066,3493.235,Right.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3493.235,3509.904,So what we're asking here is that the Court examine this case in light of the exception to Arrow and SCRAP recently announced in the TAPS case as well as left for remaining determination in footnote 22 in SCRAP one.
1978.78-575,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.361,3523.439,Now that would lead them against Congress in the way --
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3523.439,3524.781,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-575,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3647.736,3649.042,Your time has expired now.
1978.78-575,3,29658,john_h_caldwell,,3649.042,3649.892,I appreciate that sir.
1978.78-575,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3661.642,3662.978,Mr. Spencer.
1978.78-575,4,28137,harold_e_spencer,,3662.978,3666.345,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-575,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3836.855,3839.87,"But isn't the question, is when that access is granted?"
1978.78-575,4,28137,harold_e_spencer,,3839.87,3850.488,"Yes, and I believe it's very clear that in this type of situation, that access should be granted when the Commissioner refuses to suspend and investigate."
1978.78-575,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3987.593,3989.426,"Counsel, it's that clear, I think?"
1978.78-575,4,28137,harold_e_spencer,,3993.48,4000.221,"Because I don't -- because we want to settle this principle and I think in this case, what we had here was the seasonal rate."
1978.78-575,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4197.168,4200.357,Do you contend they should decide the question of law just on the pleadings?
1978.78-575,4,28137,harold_e_spencer,,4200.357,4200.678,Yes.
1978.78-575,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4200.678,4201.45,No evidence?
1978.78-575,4,28137,harold_e_spencer,,4201.45,4202.307,Yes.
1978.78-575,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4202.307,4203.645,Just on the basis of the tariff itself?
1978.78-575,4,28137,harold_e_spencer,,4203.645,4208.468,On the basis of the facts that we put up and request on the law that we submitted to the Eighth Circuit.
1978.78-575,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4215.424,4218.26,Very well.
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4220.942,4223.047,Thank you.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4348.253,4359.224,And suppose the allegations have been they said there are hundreds and they are as follows and they listed 500 of them and they were as clear as the bells.
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4364.08,4365.427,"Yes, the Commission could."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4375.857,4380.199,Is the United States and Commission's position the same in the Trans Alaska case?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4380.199,4381.431,Yes.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4381.431,4382.653,And you remember the footnote?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4382.653,4382.971,"Yes, I do."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4382.971,4384.627,You gain and the Trans Alaska case?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4384.627,4385.754,"Yes, indeed."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4385.754,4387.014,Is that still your position?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4387.014,4387.817,Sure.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4387.817,4400.846,If they say -- this footnote says in this Court the United States is modified that position and now apparently concedes that courts have jurisdiction in view of the suspension orders to the limit and extent necessary to ensure that such orders do not overstep the Commission's authority.
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4400.846,4408.912,Where the Commission has suspended a rate that it has no authority to suspend or at least the allegations that it has not authority to suspend.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4408.912,4414.073,Do you say it's different if you say it's alleged that you have no authority to refuse to suspend?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4414.073,4420.483,"Well, I say it's different if the allegation goes to the Commission's exercise of the suspension discretion and acknowledge discretion."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4420.483,4426.762,These allegations say they have absolutely no authority to suspend in the circuit --- to refuse to suspend in these circumstances?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4426.762,4426.947,That's right.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4426.947,4427.935,That's the allegation?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4427.935,4431.895,"Yes, I think that arguably is a reviewable issue."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4438.607,4445.258,Is this -- you say you've been absolutely consistent and are you remaining consistent?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4445.258,4446.742,I believe so.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4448.324,4459.771,"I thought you said that it didn't make any difference what you said how illegal it was alleged the rates were claimed to be under Section 4, the Commission could refuse to suspend them."
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4459.771,4460.359,Yes.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4461.275,4465.11,Without having any -- without their being reviewability?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4465.11,4466.438,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4477.861,4478.053,"Well, --"
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4478.053,4480.114,And the argument that the analogous argument --
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4480.114,4484.363,Do you think if they refuse to suspend it's reviewable or not?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4484.363,4485.333,I think if the argument --
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4485.333,4486.498,Then -- then reviewable?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4486.498,4490.583,-- that the Commission refused has declined to consider whether to suspend.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4502.984,4515.744,I know but it's alleged here that the Commission has absolutely no discretion to refuse to suspend in this case when it so clearly claimed that there's a violation of Section 4 on the face of the tariffs.
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4516.485,4517.221,That's the allegation.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4517.715,4524.937,And you don't think that is within the reviewability concession in TAPS?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4524.937,4528.981,"I expected, it could be argued that it's not but the point is it is not even before the court."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4537.904,4544.337,"Well, I would think you would make the same argument between investigation and suspension."
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4544.337,4553.231,"Well, the argument that the petitioners of the respondents have been making is that these tariffs were facially unlawful."
1978.78-575,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4557.018,4569.851,I take your argument to be -- to have an emphasis on the limited order of the Eighth Circuit related only to investigation.
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4569.851,4573.752,That's correct.
1978.78-575,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4628.918,4637.436,"Mr. Evans, do you understand the Court of Appeals to have ordered a complete investigation of the entire tariff or just to the five instances that they say were finally unlawful?"
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4637.436,4640.843,"It's -- it's ambiguous, quite frankly."
1978.78-575,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4660.752,4665.697,And do you take the position of these five examples are or are not unlawful.
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4665.697,4667.303,The Commission has not determined it.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4671.923,4683.14,"So your submission then that even if they are patently violative of Section 4, the Commission they reach is suspended?"
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4683.14,4692.656,"The Commission can -- yes, the Commission can make a judgment whether it agrees that they are patently unlawful and even so whether it needs to take the action that the respondents have asked for."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4692.656,4698.354,I know but they never -- there's not a murmur as to whether they think they are patently unlawful or not?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4698.354,4699.883,What in the --
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4699.883,4701.354,Do you think they are patently unlawful?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4702.68,4705.844,"The Commission did not ignore these violations, these alleged violations."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4705.844,4709.725,I thought you just answered my Brother Stevens that the Commission has not passed on it?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4709.725,4714.559,It has not resolved it but it alluded to the fact that there were alleged Section 4 violations.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4714.559,4715.994,But not patently?
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4715.994,4718.366,"Well, the allegations were that they were patent."
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4719.69,4723.391,"Suppose the Commission thought they were patent, could they still refuse to suspend?"
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4723.391,4724.052,Yes.
1978.78-575,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4724.052,4724.448,"Yes, that's what --"
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4724.448,4725.574,I dont think the language --
1978.78-575,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4725.574,4727.776,"Now, the language itself says “may” doesn't it?"
1978.78-575,5,35781,mark_l_evans,,4727.776,4730.249,That's right.
1978.78-575,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4730.249,4730.932,Thank you gentlemen.
