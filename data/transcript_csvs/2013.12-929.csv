2013.12-929,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.544,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 12-929, Atlantic Marine Construction Company vs. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas."
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,12.47,15.549,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,54.774,63.389,Is -- is it common in the treatises or in the cases to say that a forum selection clause is a venue provision?
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,67.476,71.238,"Your Honor, the cases do discuss it as a venue provision."
2013.12-929,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,111.178,113.979,"In the Stewart case to which you just referred, the court said,"
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,136.366,147.653,"Your Honor, I believe the correct reading of that language is what the Second Circuit has said in the trade comment decision and others have written on this, that Stewart and -- and the text read by that footnote."
2013.12-929,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,174.519,179.898,"Well, that's -- that's true, but it means that the entire discussion in Stewart is beside the point."
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,201.353,204.214,"Justice Alito, I respectfully disagree."
2013.12-929,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,240.888,243.08,I don't see how that would -- I don't see how that would work.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,263.557,264.799,"In exceptional cases, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,264.799,265.717,In exceptional cases.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,280.284,289.847,"And, Your Honor, the language of the statutes, particularly, the language you were just referring to about “ might have been brought ”, needs to be read in context of decisions from this Court."
2013.12-929,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,339.69,341.276,"Mr. Hastings, Section 1391 says the following,"
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,392.271,407.242,"And, Your Honor, the language of Section 1391, and the first part, I believe it's 1391(a) where it has the language of “ shall govern in federal courts ”, that's really no different than what this Court said in Stewart of Federal law controls venue in Federal courts."
2013.12-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.272,436.067,That's only -- what that tells us is that venue is a highly waiverable thing.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,487.852,491.537,"Your Honor, if there was no objection raised, yes."
2013.12-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,491.537,498.985,But it doesn't become -- it's a place of proper venue.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,517.348,525.463,"And, Your Honor, in response to that, first of all, the venue rights have always been, like many Federal rights, waiverable provisions."
2013.12-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,527.079,528.355,That doesn't mean it's improper.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,529.537,534.013,"--And, Your Honor, the language of the word “ improper ”, improper is a broad term and it has a broad meaning."
2013.12-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,601.3,602.28,So what--
2013.12-929,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,602.28,614.765,"Mr. Hastings, I wonder what you think of this analogy: Any party can waive a personal jurisdiction defense, but would you say that parties by contract can create personal jurisdiction in a court in which it otherwise doesn't exist?"
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,614.765,618.495,"Your Honor, personal jurisdiction is -- is also essentially a personal right of the defendant."
2013.12-929,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,624.356,626.083,"Well, as I said, anybody can waive it."
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,638.303,642.904,"--Focusing on personal jurisdiction, not subject matter jurisdiction, yes."
2013.12-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.657,655.466,Because consent is a basis for personal jurisdiction.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,655.466,656.492,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.207,673.827,"Could -- could I ask, what difference would it make to you if -- if I thought the venue here is proper, but I thought that there -- there was no cause of action in this circuit, and the case -- as one of the amicus briefs proposed."
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,677.326,681.088,"--And, Justice Scalia, that would -- Professor Sach's brief certainly makes that argument."
2013.12-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,700.926,702.93,Isn't that -- that's a problem with the argument.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,736.295,740.881,"Justice Ginsburg, that is one of the -- one of the concerns with the rule."
2013.12-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.211,753.864,Excuse me.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,768.011,774.027,"--Your Honor, under the current statutes I believe the court would have the discretion to transfer it based upon personal jurisdiction."
2013.12-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,774.027,778.971,Where -- it's -- 1404(a) and 1406 deal with venue.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,781.445,788.518,"Your Honor, many -- many courts have actually read 1406 to also allow for addressing personal jurisdiction."
2013.12-929,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,789.217,805.185,"Mr. Hastings, has 12(b)(6) ever been used to your knowledge to deal with a case in which the question is which court the plaintiff should have brought the suit in, rather than whether the plaintiff has a viable claim in any court?"
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,805.185,805.977,Yes--
2013.12-929,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,805.977,808.324,Because it seems to me a bit of a category error.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,824.758,831.522,"--Justice Kagan, the First Circuit has been using the 12(b)(6) approach to address whether the case is in the right--"
2013.12-929,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,831.522,833.356,"No, I know the courts have."
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,844.643,846.555,--Outside of the forum selection clause context--
2013.12-929,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,846.555,851.981,Or to deal with anything that's not an on-the-merits determination that precludes a case in any court?
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,851.981,858.59,"--And, Your Honor, I'm not aware of a court doing it outside of the context of the forum selection clause issue, as the First Circuit--"
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,858.59,860.316,I have one question here.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,914.0,916.582,"--Justice Breyer, I do have an answer to the removal issue."
2013.12-929,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.509,924.976,Where can -- where can I find that?
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,924.976,930.682,"--Chief Justice Roberts, it's 28 U.S. Code 1390(c)."
2013.12-929,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,930.682,933.993,"It's not conveniently set forth in any of the papers, right?"
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,933.993,935.284,"No, Your Honor, it's not."
2013.12-929,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.838,937.57,Fair enough.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,937.57,940.959,"With respect to 1390(c), Congress said--"
2013.12-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,940.959,942.856,--1390(c)?
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,942.856,943.929,"--Yes, sir."
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.341,985.16,You didn't really explain -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1018.041,1022.784,"--And, Justice Breyer, I would respectfully disagree about whether you can get to the Texas court."
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1022.784,1032.501,"Well, you -- in other words, you can remove to the Texas court even though it says you can remove -- you can remove to the district court despite the contract."
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1032.501,1034.134,"Yes, Justice Breyer, because--"
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1034.134,1034.895,Despite the contract.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1034.895,1038.207,--Because of the specific Federal statutes allowing for removal.
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1043.337,1055.945,"So what the court should say in Texas is: We have a contract which says you have to go to Virginia, but because of 1390(a) we forget about the contract and we remove it here."
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1055.945,1056.862,--That's no--
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1056.862,1058.339,That's what you're saying Texas should say.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1058.339,1059.039,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.039,1060.437,No?
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1060.437,1071.198,"What I'm saying if the State district -- if the parties were in the State district court and remove it to the Federal district court, under the statutes, under 1390 -- well, first of all, that was -- that's what the removal statutes require."
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1071.198,1071.82,Yes.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1071.82,1075.97,"1390(c), which say the transfer rules still apply."
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.07,1099.258,"Now, what about -- suppose the plaintiff says: Please dismiss this immediately because of 1406, or, you know, because 1406 says you have to dismiss it; venue isn't proper here."
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1099.258,1107.484,"And, Your Honor, under that circumstance, if it was a contract requiring a State court forum -- I think that's what I understand the question to be."
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1107.484,1108.075,No.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1109.94,1110.655,Okay.
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1110.655,1113.779,They filed it in Texas State court.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1116.968,1118.398,"And, Your Honor--"
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1118.398,1119.596,And they say: I'm very sorry.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1124.942,1133.758,"--And, Your Honor, the contract would not prevent the removal, but once the case was removed the contract would control where the case -- where the case would be allocated."
2013.12-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.758,1134.053,Can I ask--
2013.12-929,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1134.053,1137.006,May I ask about -- just go ahead.
2013.12-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1137.006,1138.251,--May I?
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1154.747,1161.65,"Justice Kennedy, that's an excellent question because the courts, when they usually rule on forum non conveniens, do not specify that."
2013.12-929,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1163.19,1164.976,"You just cite Gulf Oil, and that's it?"
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1164.976,1166.516,"--In many times, yes."
2013.12-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1172.813,1180.447,"That's if it's -- if it's a State forum or foreign forum, but 1404(a) is a codification of the forum non conveniens doctrine?"
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1180.447,1182.454,"For the Federal courts, yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1182.454,1184.771,Can I ask you this about the Professor Sachs' argument?
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1219.596,1234.32,"And, Justice Alito, we do think there is some tension between Professor Sachs' position and the Stewart decision, because if Professor Sachs is correct and the First Circuit's correct, there really would be no room for a 1404 balancing issue."
2013.12-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.356,1237.352,But why is that?
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1239.886,1253.768,"--Justice Scalia, if the contract -- if the contract elevated this to an issue on the merits, is essentially what 12(b)(6) does, then it becomes an issue not just about venue; it becomes an issue about merits."
2013.12-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.21,1262.739,If -- but it depends upon -- upon the defendant.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1267.963,1268.911,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2013.12-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.911,1272.612,"He wouldn't have to move under 12(b)(6), would he?"
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1272.612,1274.43,"--He wouldn't have to move under 12(b)(6), but--"
2013.12-929,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.43,1278.442,So it -- so it wouldn't necessarily overrule Stewart.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1278.442,1285.452,"--But there's a potential problem here, and this is one of the practical issues with Professor Sachs' issue -- approach."
2013.12-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1304.219,1305.322,I don't follow that.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1320.31,1322.596,"And, Justice Ginsburg, it would certainly have to be pleaded."
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.473,1336.697,"Well, what is the problem with this?"
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1360.405,1362.643,"That's our position, yes."
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1362.643,1363.358,"That's your position, fine."
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1385.575,1406.423,"Your Honor, the way this would work out is if -- focusing on the 1404(a) issue, the real issue gets down to where does the lawsuit need to be filed, what rules are going to be in place, and if a party can just file in Texas because they want -- they want to try to move it there for convenience, they can just file in Texas, what they're doing is they're requiring a party who just wants to live--"
2013.12-929,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1406.423,1407.403,It's a terrible thing.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1447.701,1455.367,"--Justice Breyer, first of all, I would agree with you that under this case, all three routes should have lead -- led to the exact same conclusion."
2013.12-929,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1492.306,1498.634,The law travels with -- the law of the transferring State travels to the transferred State.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1506.703,1508.973,"And that would be a problem in many cases, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1508.973,1512.828,And that would defeat the purpose of the venue selection to start with.
2013.12-929,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1514.134,1524.583,That would be taken care of simply by saying Van Dusen v. Barrack does not apply when a party is acting in violation of a contractual provision.
2013.12-929,0,44999,william_s_hastings,,1538.249,1547.638,"And, Justice Ginsburg, that -- that points out that if the Court were to not just strictly enforce the contracts, it raises many new issues that this Court has not yet had to address."
2013.12-929,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.66,1550.796,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1556.068,1559.707,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2013.12-929,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1575.171,1578.032,"But, Mr. Allensworth, where you agreed not to bring it."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1578.032,1578.95,Yes.
2013.12-929,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1578.95,1581.547,So I'm going back to what Justice Breyer says.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1617.397,1619.589,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1658.613,1665.887,"Well, the interests -- the interests of justice that the district court weighed almost all boiled down to the interests of your client."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1700.621,1711.519,"If I might, Your Honor, first off, the district court didn't give any shrift to our witness."
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1714.364,1719.432,"Well, if they're not your witnesses, then they're -- they're Atlantic Marine's witnesses."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1729.804,1732.679,--They were neither Atlantic Marine's witnesses nor our witnesses.
2013.12-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.217,1739.472,Just volunteer witnesses?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1744.914,1745.505,--Exactly.
2013.12-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.505,1747.589,"Surely, they're one side's or the other's, aren't they?"
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1747.589,1748.552,Your Honor--
2013.12-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1748.552,1751.956,What kind of -- what kind of proceedings do they have there?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1753.698,1759.155,"--Your Honor, our point is that if it's in Texas, they can get in their pickup and drive to the courthouse and testify."
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1763.834,1766.571,"Who -- who is going to call these witnesses, you or Atlantic Marine?"
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1766.571,1767.504,We'd be the ones calling them.
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1767.504,1768.842,"You do, so they're your witnesses."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1776.599,1784.31,"The law of Texas, which we think applies to this case, with which the district court--"
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1784.31,1790.186,Is -- Texas contract law is so arcane that the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia can't figure it out?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1792.862,1795.475,"--I wouldn't suggest that, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1795.475,1796.253,"Oh, okay."
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1796.749,1797.153,All right.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1829.786,1833.315,"Your Honor, in some ways that's exactly what we're worried about."
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.189,1841.633,So it's actually your expense because you would have to go to Virginia and you would have to file the motion.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1844.681,1845.614,We filed a motion.
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.926,1852.672,Yes.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1852.672,1853.559,--by their lights--
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1853.559,1854.148,Yes.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1854.148,1860.757,"--the court, as I think one of the Justices pointed out, couldn't transfer it back to Texas anyway because by their lights, venue is improper anywhere expect Virginia."
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1860.757,1862.762,"No, no."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1903.231,1914.627,"If there wasn't -- if there hadn't been a forum selection clause in the contract and we'd filed suit in Texas, it's inconceivable that they could -- they could have successfully moved the case to Virginia."
2013.12-929,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1920.131,1921.809,"Well, that's kind of a big thing, isn't it?"
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1923.956,1924.685,It's a significant factor.
2013.12-929,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.685,1925.65,It's a significant factor.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1966.741,1969.494,"It is in the -- Your Honor, it is in the contract."
2013.12-929,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1977.795,1979.303,"Well, that couldn't have come as a surprise."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,1979.303,1979.63,"--No, sir."
2013.12-929,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2000.929,2002.142,"Well, it does in this way."
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2002.142,2002.498,"Well, if 1404 -- if the court--"
2013.12-929,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2002.498,2003.277,It does in this way.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2052.172,2061.639,"--In most cases there wouldn't be, and that's why in most cases the clauses are enforced, and that's why I don't think you have seen one of these for 25 years."
2013.12-929,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2093.217,2093.526,No.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2135.13,2149.014,"Your Honor, I -- I don't view it as a wrench, as opposed to an opportunity or mandate from Congress to the -- to the Federal courts to exercise some discretion in deciding whether to enforce these clauses or not."
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2150.444,2153.352,But your -- your adversary is not taking that discretion away.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2225.987,2229.314,"--Your Honor, I would say that's a possibility."
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2243.152,2243.508,Well--
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2243.508,2246.743,--whether the arbitration clause ought to be enforced or not.
2013.12-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2246.743,2253.133,The -- the clause here allows suits in -- in State or Federal court.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2274.976,2278.366,The Court would have to dismiss our case.
2013.12-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2278.366,2279.656,And equally--
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2279.656,2285.423,Because he couldn't -- he couldn't transfer it to -- he can't force that into a Virginia circuit.
2013.12-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2285.423,2295.762,"--And the same thing if -- if the choice was of an arbitral forum, then you recognize in those two cases the result would have to be dismissal?"
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2295.762,2297.286,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2297.286,2301.25,--And what would be the authority for dismissing the case if it had specified the State court?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2301.25,2306.132,"I think it would be the same one as in Bremen, which didn't -- in The Bremen, which didn't mention court--"
2013.12-929,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2306.132,2306.676,No.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2311.091,2317.139,"--It -- it would be, and -- I've forgotten which Justice raised the question about this."
2013.12-929,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2324.276,2325.023,Yes.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2335.501,2338.284,With the same result.
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.612,2342.917,"That argues, then, it might be slightly against you."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2342.917,2344.317,--I'm sorry?
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.317,2357.997,"The -- if in fact you specify a State court, if in fact you specify a foreign court, if in fact you specify arbitration, you agree in those instances you are going to use forum non conveniens or you are going to use 1406."
2013.12-929,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2365.646,2367.885,"Well, it's not 1406."
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.518,2370.948,"Yes, it was forum non conveniens."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2377.464,2378.984,Because the 1406 wouldn't apply because the -- because--
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2378.984,2384.179,They say venue is a State court--
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2384.179,2385.127,"--Yes, sir."
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2385.127,2386.51,--use forum non conveniens in all those?
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2395.138,2398.621,"--You use 12(b)(3), not 1404."
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.621,2399.18,--All right.
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2399.18,2401.139,In those other cases you--
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2401.139,2402.103,"You use 12(b)(3), okay."
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2402.103,2404.14,--you use 12(b)(3).
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2404.14,2405.586,Yes.
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2405.586,2411.713,"But my point is you're using something else, so they would say, well, let's have it the same -- you know -- okay."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2412.63,2413.454,Justice Breyer--
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2413.454,2414.448,Forget it.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2414.448,2423.28,"--No, but that raises a larger question, and if I could -- if I could venture just a second -- and that's the systemic integrity of the -- of the system."
2013.12-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.685,2461.79,Don't -- don't put me in the group that thinks you can use forum non conveniens.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2500.859,2501.854,"No, sir."
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2508.818,2514.208,"Do you know the answer, this is another -- I keep thinking they should all come to the same conclusion."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2550.888,2554.496,Van Dusen said that the law moves with the -- with the--
2013.12-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2554.496,2562.004,Only because the Plaintiff -- the Plaintiff's choice of forum was to be respected.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2569.702,2570.835,--Your Honor--
2013.12-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2570.835,2574.317,It was to honor the Plaintiff's choice of forum.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2578.236,2585.543,"--Your Honor, the contract that Judge Higginbotham pointed out doesn't have a selection of law -- law clause."
2013.12-929,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2598.93,2613.358,That the only reason that Van Dusen came out the way it did was -- I think it was that Justice Black said the Plaintiff's choice of forum merits respect.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2619.871,2625.236,I don't recall.
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2626.68,2629.058,"In other words, that issue has not been decided by them."
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2629.058,2657.48,"If 1404 is the correct procedural route, why shouldn't the rule be something like this: Where there is a forum selection clause, the burden is on -- the burden of trying to establish venue in some other jurisdiction is on the party opposing the forum selection clause, not the party that's invoking the forum selection clause."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2707.153,2715.252,"First off, on the validity of the clause, we acknowledge we'd have the burden."
2013.12-929,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2734.779,2738.292,"Well, why should that -- why should that be, where there's a forum selection clause?"
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2738.292,2742.459,I don't think that it's even a matter really so much of burden as it is of weight.
2013.12-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.869,2784.171,"It should have been a Virginia court to make that decision instead of your friendly, down home Texas court."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2801.989,2803.823,--We can't confer venue.
2013.12-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2808.035,2811.333,So the -- the question is: Is it improper when it's been waived?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2890.824,2894.37,"--There's a couple of factors on that, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.387,2913.071,Why is that?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2920.097,2935.087,Another reason for that is that our contract has a one-way arbitration clause in it which they -- which the Petitioner claims not to have waived.
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2975.633,2976.333,Excuse me.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,2977.903,2978.774,No.
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3002.25,3005.079,So what's more favorable about Texas other than your convenience?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3009.074,3013.023,That's my--
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3013.023,3014.843,That's the only thing.
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3016.194,3018.356,--It's convenient for us.
2013.12-929,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3034.136,3035.036,--Are -- are you finished?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3085.069,3089.049,I think that that's going to unnecessarily complicate this.
2013.12-929,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3116.519,3124.152,"--Professor Sachs says that in the case of any disputed facts on a 12(b)(6), you would have to have a trial."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3125.085,3138.082,"Yes, Your Honor, and I think that he under -- underestimates the ability for resolute counsel to raise undisputed facts that would otherwise prevent the summary judgment practice that he suggested--"
2013.12-929,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3138.082,3143.059,"Well, what facts are -- what facts are -- in the normal case, what facts are going to be pertinent?"
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3155.884,3157.548,--I think there might be a question of materiality.
2013.12-929,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3159.21,3161.154,But what type -- what type of materiality?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3161.154,3169.767,--How material that clause was to the parties' contract or whether you were going to try to have severability and focus exclusively on that clause.
2013.12-929,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3169.767,3178.086,"Well, the venue provision -- I mean, if they go to the trouble of putting a venue selection -- forum selection provision in, I would say it seems pretty material."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3178.086,3191.486,"It might or might not, depending on whichever state law applies to -- and what -- because that would be under state law to decide on the materiality, what the effect of the prior breach is."
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3233.448,3237.77,"So they would be -- the only people collecting that $160,000 are going to be the lawyers."
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3238.764,3241.875,--I -- I wish.
2013.12-929,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3243.896,3246.119,You took a contingency case in a contract matter?
2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3246.119,3251.203,"And the other thing, as Professor Sachs points out--"

2013.12-929,1,43773,william_r_allensworth,,3253.161,3265.833,"--The -- as he points out, and Justice Haynes -- Judge Haynes did in the Fifth Circuit, whether they can file suit for us for breach of contract and the expense that we put them to."
2013.12-929,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3311.931,3313.826,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-929,2,44999,william_s_hastings,,3316.144,3319.782,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-929,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3477.38,3479.138,I think you mistook my point at least.
2013.12-929,2,44999,william_s_hastings,,3504.525,3520.4,"--And, Justice Kagan, following Bremen, the lower courts have recognized that what essentially Bremen is doing is saying forum non conveniens is not the right approach, and so instead of a common law vehicle to answer this issue, we submit that the right answer is right there in the rules already."
2013.12-929,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3533.94,3535.479,Can I ask you one last question about 12(b)(6)?
2013.12-929,2,44999,william_s_hastings,,3535.479,3536.242,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-929,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3536.242,3546.021,"Which is, you know, when 1404 is -- suppose a state which does not recognize these clauses, 1404 trumps that according to Stewart."
2013.12-929,2,44999,william_s_hastings,,3563.028,3572.404,"Justice Kagan, the only way I know how to answer that question is I do not know how the Professor Sachs approach can actually be reconciled with Stewart."
2013.12-929,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3579.727,3585.929,"If it's under 12(b)(3) then Stewart stays, and it's Federal law that controls and a judge decides, right?"
2013.12-929,2,44999,william_s_hastings,,3585.929,3590.858,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that's why we are asking this Court to follow the majority approach on this issue."
