2002.02-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.423,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-102, John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner v. Texas."
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,51.286,54.779,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2002.02-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.344,151.336,"On your substantive due process submission, Mr. Smith, certainly, the kind of conduct we're talking about here has been banned for a long time."
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,168.093,173.089,"The Court's cases, Mr. Chief Justice, say that history is a starting point, not the end point of the analysis."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.647,207.535,"Well, you're getting to your equal protection argument now."
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,214.928,215.178,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.178,218.066,So the same-sex/other-sex aspect doesn't come into it--
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,218.066,232.101,"--I think it does come into it, because if you're going to suggest that the state of the law in the books in the 19th century is the touchstone you have to take into account that in the 19th century at least on the face of the law married couples were regulated in terms of their forms of sexual intimacy that were created for them."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.101,234.785,"--It may well be, but so were same-sex couples."
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,234.785,235.035,"Indeed, they all were, Your Honor."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.035,240.729,So all same-sex couples could not... could not perform this act lawfully.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,252.412,266.613,"I guess I'm suggesting Mr.... Justice Scalia, that it's been conceded here by this State, it was conceded by the State of Georgia 17 years ago, that married couples can't be regulated as a matter of substantive due process in their personal sexual expression in the home."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.866,271.693,They conceded it.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,273.179,274.005,Your Honor.
2002.02-102,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.47,312.067,"Were you talking specifically about this Eisenstadt against Baird where there was an unmarried couple... while there was an unmarried person and the conduct in question would have been perhaps in the 19th century, early 19th century, criminal?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,314.046,314.668,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.222,409.958,"Well, it depends on what you mean by our basic American values, to revert to what the Chief Justice was suggesting earlier."
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,486.391,495.269,"No, Your Honor, but the Court's decisions don't look just at history, they look at the... at the function that a particular claimed freedom plays in the lives of real people."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.953,501.213,I don't know what you mean by the function it plays in the lives of real people.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,501.213,502.206,The Court has said that--
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.206,505.921,Any law stops people from doing what they really want to do.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,505.921,516.9,"--The Court has said that it's going to use reasoned judgment to identify a realm of personal liberty that involves matters of central and core to how a person defines their own lives, and relates to key other people."
2002.02-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.865,540.062,"Well, you say it's about procreation or nonprocreation, but none of the cases that you have talked about involved nonprocreation, did they?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,540.062,551.541,"They certainly involved the right to decide to engage in sexual relations with... while preventing procreation, that's what... that's what Griswold and Eisenstadt and Carey all say you have a right to do."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.901,586.752,It doesn't say you can't have... you can't have any sexual intimacy.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,590.217,601.613,"This particular law does that, yes, Your Honor, but certainly our... our submission is that fornication laws and... and laws involving sodomy regulation more broadly would be equally unconstitutional, because they involve--"
2002.02-102,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,601.613,634.428,"But your position, as I understand it, is even if you take the narrowest view of Glucksberg and even if you say there's got to be a positive historical sanction, that in fact there is no historical... no substantial historical evidence to the contrary because, A, the... the sodomy laws were not enforced against consensual activity historically and B, they were not aimed at homosexual as opposed to sodomy in general?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,634.428,635.171,--Right.
2002.02-102,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,635.171,639.136,"Is that... your historical point, you say even if I accept your argument, I should win?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,639.136,639.979,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,652.322,659.009,"What do you mean by the record of enforcement, that there were... that what happened in this case was an accidental intrusion of the police?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,690.671,696.532,The evidence we have is the... is the absence of reported cases discussing arrests for that kind of conduct.
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.532,706.563,"Well, that's because it's... it's an act committed in private, and... and the police respect the privacy of... of one's home, of one's bedroom, and so they don't investigate and find it."
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,717.792,724.767,"Certainly it seems to us there's a significance to the fact that it has never been treated as, for example, drug use in the home has been treated."
2002.02-102,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.024,734.593,To what extent can you characterize it?
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,771.251,786.772,"--The argument about 19th century enforcement is that they didn't prosecute anyone for private and consensual crimes involving adults, that they worried about children, they worried about public activity, they worried about coercion, but that they didn't worry about same-sex or different-sex sodomy."
2002.02-102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,813.399,816.371,"Well, what about a statute that covered both?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,816.371,819.222,"Well, I think that would be unconstitutional under my first point, Your Honor."
2002.02-102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,819.222,819.559,Right.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,819.559,825.503,"I think there is a multiple... multiply unconstitutional statute, because it does the second thing as well, it says that--"
2002.02-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,825.503,829.013,"Well, if the statute covered both, would there be an equal protection argument?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,829.013,843.502,"--If there was a record of enforcement almost exclusively as to same-sex couples, I think there would be potential constitutional problems there, but the statutory language itself would not involve an equal protection problem of the same sort that we're dealing with here."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.502,845.815,"Mr. Smith, aren't there a lot of statutes like that?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,860.798,864.307,"I don't know whether statutes actually are written that way, Your Honor."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,866.536,867.379,What about rape laws?
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,874.422,875.824,--That may be as well.
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.213,878.342,You think that they're unconstitutional?
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,878.342,880.117,--I didn't suggest that they're unconstitutional.
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.606,904.515,I don't understand that.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,923.191,925.526,--I think it would have to be justified by the State.
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.956,934.814,One step at a time?
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,943.98,961.07,"--Well, the one thing that I submit, the Court, the State should not be able to come in to say is we are going to permit ourselves the majority of people in our society full... full and free rein to make these decisions for ourselves but there's one minority of people don't get that decision and the only reason we're going to give you is we want it that way."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.788,993.558,"I mean you you can put it that way, but society always... in a lot of its lives makes these moral judgments, you can make it sound very puritanical, the... you know, the laws... the laws against bigamy, I mean, who are you to tell me that I can't have more than one wife?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1009.989,1019.649,"First of all, the first law that's appeared on the books in the States of this country that singles out only same sex sodomy appeared in the '60s and the '70s and it did not... and it does not go way back, this kind of discrimination."
2002.02-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.491,1093.171,But all... almost all laws are based on disapproval of either some people or some sort of conduct.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1094.945,1103.284,And what this Court does under the equal protection clause is... is... standard as a bull work against arbitrary government when the... when there is no rational justification for the line that is drawn.
2002.02-102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1103.284,1112.406,"Well, do you... do you... understood in order to win under an equal protection argument, do you have to apply some sort of heightened scrutiny?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1112.406,1114.719,"We certainly do not think we do, Your Honor."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.266,1145.312,"We said the opposite in bowers, didn't we?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1149.398,1153.092,"--Well, certainly bowers is not an equal protection case and it didn't involve this kind of discrimination."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.092,1154.828,The equal protection and on to the--
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1154.828,1158.376,"No I was still talking about the level of scrutiny under equal protection, Your Honor."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.376,1161.227,--Maybe you ought to hold up one hand so I'll know which?
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1161.227,1164.199,It's hard when you have these two points to shift back and forth.
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.199,1164.737,I understand.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1166.595,1168.452,"Three weeks ago, yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1219.145,1234.544,"--If you prevail, Mr. Smith, and this law is struck down, do you think that would also mean that a State could not prefer heterosexuals to homosexuals to teach kindergarten?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1234.544,1246.82,"--I think the issue of... of preference in the educational context would involve very different criteria, Your Honor, very different considerations, the State would have to come in with some sort of a justification."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.82,1253.203,"A justification is the same that's alluded to here, disapproval of homosexuality."
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1253.203,1257.456,"Well, I think it would be high... high problematic, such a custody case."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.456,1257.661,"Yes, it would?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1257.661,1266.085,"If that were the only justification that could be offered, there was no some showing that there would be any more concrete harm to the children in the school."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.085,1271.862,Only that the children might... might be induced to... to follow the path of homosexuality.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1274.091,1283.546,"Well, I... I think the State has to have a greater justification for its discrimination than we prefer pushing people towards heterosexuality."
2002.02-102,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1319.417,1323.132,Mr. Smith before you continue down to the equal protection line.
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1346.665,1347.53,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.245,1493.499,"--You probably say the same about adultery, you think adultery laws are unconstitutional?"
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1493.499,1494.613,I think that the state has--
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.613,1497.79,"I mean think people probably feel the same way about that, you know."
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1503.28,1505.592,"--Your Honor, adultery is a very different case."
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.644,1516.366,Why is the marital contract important to the State?
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1520.414,1520.869,"Sure, the State is--"
2002.02-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.869,1533.872,And you think that there's not some of the same thinking behind the conscious choice of the State to favor heterosexual and marital sex over homosexual sex?
2002.02-102,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,1533.872,1543.448,"--Well, I can understand a law which says we're going to attempt to channel heterosexuals towards marriage by making them... making it illegal for them to have sex without marriage."
2002.02-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.36,1585.559,"Very well, Mr. Smith."
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1587.5,1594.354,Give me just a moment.
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.164,1726.819,I... I don't understand what you mean by that.
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1730.823,1737.882,"No, sir, they're... they're asking for the right of homosexuals to engage in homosexual conduct."
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.882,1738.253,Right.
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1738.253,1743.166,But there's nothing in the record to indicate that these people are homosexuals.
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.42,1763.44,Why aren't... why aren't they seeking to vindicate the right of either homosexuals or heterosexuals to commit homosexual act?
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1764.388,1779.537,"The difference it makes is as the... as the record is set out, it does not really define the issues such that the Court can actually give the petitioners a... a specific form of relief."
2002.02-102,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1779.537,1784.821,"But the... the... the statute, Texas has already decided that for us."
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1800.303,1800.879,That's correct.
2002.02-102,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1800.879,1808.477,"You don't even have to get to the... as I understand it, you don't even have to get to the characterization of homosexual."
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1819.001,1819.456,"Yes, it is."
2002.02-102,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1819.456,1820.653,What more do we need?
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1820.653,1828.844,"We're... the class actually is people who violate the act, not classes of individuals based upon sexual orientation."
2002.02-102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1828.844,1839.435,"Well, I... I can see that your point may have some relevance on the equal protection side of the equation, some relevance, I don't think it may be controlling."
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1851.489,1852.688,I beg your pardon?
2002.02-102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1852.688,1860.777,"It doesn't meet the petitioners' argument with respect to Bowers versus Hardwick, which they say should be overruled."
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1860.777,1866.721,"Well, of course we... we believe that Bowers versus Hardwick is... is good law."
2002.02-102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1869.572,1872.339,But that question is certainly clearly before us.
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1878.045,1878.943,"--Yes, sir."
2002.02-102,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.607,1934.426,"Their basic argument, I think--"
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.426,1935.912,--I... I'm sorry.
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1957.582,1964.891,"Well, history... tradition does not matter in terms of whether or not it... it can be a protected liberty interest."
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.891,1976.901,Why... why do you think that the public perception of... of homosexual acts has... has not changed?
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1978.758,1980.699,The public perception of it?
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.699,1981.813,"Yes, yes."
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1984.042,1987.84,"Of homosexuals, but not of homosexuality activity."
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.84,1990.154,What do you base that on?
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1990.154,1991.018,I beg your pardon?
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.018,1992.466,What do you base that on?
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1992.466,1994.256,"Well, even--"
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.256,1998.077,I mean I think there ought to be some evidence which... which you can bring forward?
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,1998.077,1998.615,--Sure.
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.615,2016.903,"Like perhaps the failure of the Federal Congress to add the sexual preference to the list of protected statuses against which private individuals are not permitted to discriminate, that addition has been sought several times and it's been rejected by the Federal Congress, hasn't it?"
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,2016.903,2027.389,"Yes, sir, and... and in addition, what I was trying to say by the fact that various States have changed their position on sodomy, they've done it through the legislative process."
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.114,2039.687,"Yes, but I thought you were responding to the argument that the public perception hasn't changed."
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,2052.652,2064.002,"Well, I think it goes back to whether the... where... whether people in Texas and people in the other States that had this law on their books actually accepted through their representative government."
2002.02-102,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.179,2086.748,Might there be a difference between the people's willingness to prosecute something criminally and the people's embracing of that as a fundamental right?
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,2086.748,2088.438,"Well, certainly."
2002.02-102,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2100.411,2106.727,"But the argument of... of Bowers, to overrule Bowers is not directly related to sodomy."
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,2152.712,2152.712,All right--

2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,2155.191,2155.85,--Okay.
2002.02-102,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2178.225,2180.659,That I didn't bring in in my question.
2002.02-102,1,19861,charles_a_rosenthal,,2180.659,2181.03,"Yes, sir."
2002.02-102,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2181.03,2189.082,"My question was, getting those sort of three or four basic points, I would like to hear your... your straight answer to those points--"
