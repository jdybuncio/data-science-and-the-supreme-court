1988.88-226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-226, Benjamin R. Ward v. Rock Against Racism."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,11.056,13.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-226,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,75.914,77.082,How long ago was that?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,77.082,79.599,"Nineteen eighty-five, Your Honor."
1988.88-226,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,79.599,81.284,Just three years ago.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,81.284,84.57,"Yes, that is correct."
1988.88-226,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,88.022,92.824,xxx preceded the quiet area?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,92.824,95.442,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,141.907,144.459,"Mr.... Mr. Koerner, may I ask about the tension?"
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,150.012,156.249,There was a general guideline for all parks that prohibited excessive sound.
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,164.438,168.74,Were... were the... and the violation of that guideline is subject to penalties.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,168.74,169.624,That's correct.
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,169.624,172.342,And... and why didn't the city collect those penalties--
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,172.342,173.211,Basically they--
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,173.211,173.878,--If they had the right to?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,173.878,175.511,--The record does not show why.
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,175.511,181.565,But why wouldn't that be an adequate means of preventing excessive sound in following years?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,181.565,186.119,"Because we... as I understand it, we... they just went unpaid."
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,194.874,196.024,"Well, maybe you could deny them a permit."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,201.461,202.794,"Yes, that could be an alternative."
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.565,211.15,"Well, whenever you enforce a law, you get in litigation."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,215.102,217.987,"--Yes, We don't deny that there could have been other alternatives."
1988.88-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,220.589,225.327,Are you saying that the troubles with RAR was the reason for the adoption of the ordinance?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,225.327,225.727,No.
1988.88-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.644,280.744,"Mr. Koerner, the--"
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,288.983,292.519,"Precisely, Your Honor, indeed, if I can answer that in some depth."
1988.88-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,377.375,382.645,"So, the sound technician is not as important as, say, a conductor of a symphony?"
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,382.645,383.762,--That is correct.
1988.88-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,416.866,424.036,"I might have had some trouble with that proposition if it just depended on my own knowledge, but the record seems to bear you out."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,424.036,431.708,"Not only does the testimony confirm that, but the district court on two occasions reviewed that testimony."
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.987,485.276,"Well, if... if... if the city is going to reflect the mix a performer wants, why does the city want control of the mix?"
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,485.276,491.747,Because it's the only way to also control the sound to make sure that the bleeding doesn't occur to the--
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.747,495.465,"So, you say there's just no practical way of just controlling the sound?"
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,495.465,496.332,--Yes.
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.332,497.501,You have to do them both together.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,497.501,510.558,"Yes, because when the sound consultant was given the job of considering alternatives, they considered, one, just having the city technician, but having the sponsor's equipment."
1988.88-226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.676,565.228,He didn't really say only.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,567.145,568.697,"--Or painfully loud, he said."
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.697,569.497,--That's right.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,578.919,581.905,And the... the volume levels are right on the mixing board.
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,581.905,582.84,"Right, right."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,604.503,621.548,"That is a possibility, Your Honor, but the problem is it causes the same interaction between the sponsor's technician and the city's technician that creates the same confrontational atmosphere that the city had in 1983 when it tried to use the police to lower the sound."
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.548,627.785,"Well, here's the city with its own equipment sitting there with a technician control ling the mix and the sound."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,636.057,637.174,Yes.
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.724,639.426,Why doesn't that create the confrontation?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,639.426,650.984,"--That... that is a possibility, but by having the city technician alongside with the sponsor's technician, you have the same type of atmosphere that we were trying to avoid, which is this interaction which never worked."
1988.88-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,670.276,679.817,"But just before we leave that point, there is no finding that it is not feasible from a technical standpoint for one person to control volume and the other mixing?"
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,679.817,680.367,That's correct.
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.569,736.169,But may I... may I inquire?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,757.848,758.382,No.
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.382,758.965,Why not?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,759.784,762.736,Because in that particular case--
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.736,763.536,And he's good.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,767.288,769.74,--And the drummer is bleeding outside?
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.74,774.877,"Well, he just plays too loud for the... for the surroundings, and they keep saying to him, hey, you're too loud."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,777.177,780.012,"Then I... then, yes, we could control the excessive sound if--"
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.012,782.298,By... by putting in your own drummer.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,782.298,783.9,"--No, by controlling the sound--"
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,783.9,784.25,"No, no."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,805.996,807.265,"--No, because I think there--"
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.265,807.781,What's the difference?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,807.781,811.483,"--you would be substituting your judgment for that as the esthetic, the drummer himself."
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.233,812.617,"Well, no."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,817.971,818.823,"Well, but that comes close--"
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.823,819.689,And he's good.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,819.689,825.977,"--I agree, and that's a tougher case and it comes closer to substituting your judgment for that as the... the musical--"
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.977,826.793,"No, I'm not substituting."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,829.012,833.397,"--But a different performer takes away from the in effect, the quality of the performance."
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.333,835.433,"No, I'm assuming it doesn't."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,839.569,840.286,--I guess--
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.286,843.271,Like we'd like to have our own mixer.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,843.271,845.171,--But I think the mixer is different in that--
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,845.171,845.906,Why?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,845.906,850.858,"--Because with respect to the drummer, you're replacing the instrument itself."
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.858,851.46,"Well, yes."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,853.06,854.16,And maybe in that--
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,854.16,854.978,--Like you say you got to use city-owned mixing equipment.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,854.978,863.868,"--Maybe in that case, it would be unreasonable because the city would then be imposing it and substituting its choice for that of the actual instrument."
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,863.868,865.568,Which is exactly what's happening here.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,865.568,867.553,"I understand where that's a more egregious situation, but I don't think that's what you have here."
1988.88-226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.553,870.588,"You basically don't... don't believe that the drummer could be same, could be exactly the same."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,870.588,871.905,That's exactly right.
1988.88-226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.905,873.573,Whereas you do believe that the mixer could be the same.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,873.573,874.906,Here we... we did exactly--
1988.88-226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.906,877.508,"Just like replacing a ballet dancer, use our ballet dancer."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,880.243,880.71,--That's right.
1988.88-226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.71,882.429,But you can believe that a mixer might be just as good.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,882.429,882.929,That's right.
1988.88-226,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,915.048,918.199,Is there any such thing as quiet rock music?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,922.67,923.736,No.
1988.88-226,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,926.522,929.057,You're dealing... you're dealing with loudness.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,929.057,929.907,--Yes.
1988.88-226,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,930.657,932.726,And how loud is loud?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,932.726,933.476,--That's correct.
1988.88-226,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,933.476,935.228,"Well, that's a hard thing to do."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,935.228,942.015,But the Supreme... this Court help in Kovacs v. Cooper that you could establish standards for excessive sound and--
1988.88-226,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,942.015,946.352,Kovacs was the difference between a loudspeaker and an ordinary voice.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,946.352,946.986,--Yes.
1988.88-226,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,946.986,948.452,But this is not involved in this.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,948.452,948.721,No.
1988.88-226,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,961.442,962.794,Going back to Kovacs--
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,962.794,975.285,"--I don't mean to belabor it, but I believe it's significant that of all the other groups... and there was folk, reggae, other rock concerts... every person was satisfied with the way the city-designated technician made the mix."
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.633,1001.935,--Let me go back to Kovacs for a second.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1007.073,1007.473,Yes.
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.473,1010.858,Could the city have said we want our own driver on the truck?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1010.858,1011.558,I--
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1011.558,1013.06,We want our own driver on the truck.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1017.945,1020.38,--And he would have controlled the sound?
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.38,1021.998,"Sure, he'd control it and he'd follow all the--"
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1021.998,1023.882,So that it wouldn't bleed into other areas?
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.882,1024.615,--That's right.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1024.615,1027.481,And he wouldn't substitute his judgement for that of one group?
1988.88-226,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1027.481,1028.617,That's exactly right.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1028.617,1031.535,"Yes, I believe that's a method that may have been appropriate under your Court's test."
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.83,1054.884,"Well, you... and your... the government interest is controlling sound here."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1054.884,1055.95,To the unwanted areas.
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1056.367,1064.506,"And... but you not only control the sound, but you control the mix."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1075.664,1078.55,It's the most appropriate way to control the sound.
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.046,1118.725,"Well, I know, but... I know, but... but here your regulation is such that it... it by... controlling the mix doesn't necessarily serve the government interest of controlling the sound."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1118.725,1137.952,"--But... it... that's what... I would respond it does because we believe it's the only effective way of controlling the sound because to have two people side by side creates the same confrontational problem that we had before when the police tried to control the sound, as did the other park rangers, between 1983 and 1986."
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1137.952,1145.958,"Well, if you're going to let the performers' technician sit with the city's technician, I don't know why that isn't the same confrontation."
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1145.958,1161.818,"Because as a practical matter, whenever you have a... a group that doesn't recognize sound limits, and you have a large audience there, and you have the city there, some things happen in the heat of battle that don't follow a normal, orderly plan."
1988.88-226,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.633,1210.484,"Mr. Koerner, could I come back to the mix again?"
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1250.042,1252.244,--The record is... is a little unclear.
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1302.577,1309.848,But you... but you say that the city will let a... the performer's technician sit with the city technician.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1309.848,1311.683,"Yes, that is correct."
1988.88-226,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.166,1314.818,And dictate the mix.
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1314.818,1322.322,"--Absolutely, and the district court so found, and the circuit court upheld that particular portion."
1988.88-226,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1358.262,1362.381,How does the... how does the city technician know when it's too loud?
1988.88-226,0,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1362.381,1368.301,"What happens is Mr. Killian, who's a special events director... he attends every concert."
1988.88-226,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1457.858,1459.01,"Very well, Mr. Koerner."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1462.279,1465.531,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1537.094,1541.012,But there's no evidence in the record to bear you out.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1551.97,1552.37,No.
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1559.826,1562.778,"But that's not the finding of the district court, Mr. Kunstler."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1562.778,1576.955,"Well, I think that the testimony then is belied by the finding or the finding belied by the testimony because the court of appeals found that it was uncontroverted in the record, that the mixer is part of the band."
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1644.597,1647.882,"I should have thought that is true, but the record doesn't bear it out."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1647.882,1658.09,"Well, I quoted to you what was said both by Alan Thompson and by Gary Floyd and what the court of appeals said about that."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1750.465,1752.316,Is that feasible when you have a crowd?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1757.086,1758.153,--But they pull the--
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.153,1762.322,"You have a lot of people who are there for a rock concert, and the police come in and pull the plug."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1762.757,1764.44,"--Justice Scalia, they did it twice here."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.565,1775.865,"--Well, yours... yours might not be."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1781.052,1782.302,"Well, they aid it twice and it caused no problem whatsoever."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.302,1783.019,"Well, fine."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1785.421,1787.056,But that's the last resort anyway.
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.056,1787.756,"It certainly depends upon the crowd, doesn't it?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1787.756,1788.656,That's the last resort.
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.175,1792.609,"Well, I don't think that's a very feasible one, frankly."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1795.895,1799.513,"--Well, that's the last resort, but there are so many before you even reach that point."
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1809.069,1812.857,Do you concede the constitutionality o' a separate sound control?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1812.857,1817.159,"Yes, I do in... because I think they have a right to regulate sound."
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1844.726,1850.046,And you agree the record is ambiguous as to whether sound affects mix?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1850.046,1852.498,"Yes, I think I would agree with that."
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.98,1879.215,"Does... RAR is not a performing group itself, is it?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1879.215,1880.332,"No, it's a promoter."
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1883.584,1887.238,"And so... so, you actually want to use your mixer for other bands?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1887.238,1889.607,--For the bands that come to the RAR concerts.
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1889.607,1892.373,But aren't you doing the same thing the city is doing?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1892.373,1894.425,"Well, no, but they choose him."
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.062,1906.116,A hundred percent of the bands chose your promoter your... your technician rather than the city's?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1906.116,1910.185,"Oh, I don't know if there was a vote on it, but every year we get much the same bands."
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1910.685,1920.292,"Well, but it's important if you're saying each... each group has to have its own technician and it's like Zubin Mehta, and now you're saying that RAR does it for all the groups that appear."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1920.292,1920.609,--Yes.
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1921.109,1921.792,It seems to me quite inconsistent.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1921.792,1923.911,--They do it for all with the consent of the groups.
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1931.165,1936.069,"Well, is there testimony that any of the specific groups objected to the city's technician?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1936.069,1939.521,"No, they never had it, not these groups."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2025.643,2027.829,What do you do when they violate the decibel level?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2028.429,2032.649,"Well, there are... just what the Park Service says it does."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.563,2060.083,I thought that had been done with your group.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2071.974,2072.741,--That is that evidence--
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.741,2073.543,--xxx up and down.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2073.543,2077.995,"--That evidence is in the record, but there was no negotiated decibel level before the concert."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2077.995,2087.783,"Well, what difference does it make whether... whether they tell you're too loud, and you say, okay, I'll lower it, and then you get too loud again, or whether they say you're too loud because you're three points over this decibel level?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2087.783,2093.286,"Justice Scalia, a policeman cannot judge decibel level without an instrument."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.245,2108.614,"Well, are you contesting the... the accuracy of the evidence that they got louder again when the police left?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2108.614,2111.999,"Not at... not at all, but how do you know what the decibel level--"
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.999,2116.451,"Well, I don't know how much louder they got, but I know they got louder than they had agreed to reduce it to."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2116.451,2116.934,--No.
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.162,2133.762,"Well, I don't know."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2144.787,2146.037,Is this a confession?
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.037,2147.289,--An officer would come by.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2162.065,2162.615,I know.
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.615,2163.632,--This is just unrealistic.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2163.632,2166.967,"But, Justice Scalia, I think what you're saying is unrealistic."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.736,2199.255,No matter what instruments you're using?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2206.028,2207.278,"No, but 110 is the maximum--"
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.278,2207.878,--clarinets?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2207.878,2211.931,--is the maximum decibel strength that will bleed it into another area.
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.931,2212.897,And... and--
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2212.897,2213.781,Flutes won't do that.
1988.88-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.566,2229.893,"--Mr. Kunstler, as I understand the court of appeals' opinion here, they said that the city had to use the least intrusive means of regulating the volume in your opinion, is that the correct test under our cases?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2229.893,2230.826,I think it is.
1988.88-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.867,2246.503,"And what... what is the leading case from our Court, do you think, that supports that proposition?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2246.503,2262.547,"Well, I think that essentially one of the tests which I think was used in O'Brien, although I don't think O'Brien and that four-prong test applies here when they use the term ""least intrusive means""... I think in many of your cases... none are like this case."
1988.88-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2263.947,2271.803,But what is the principal case you would rely on here to us for the proposition that the city must use the least intrusive means?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2271.803,2289.965,"I think, essentially I would start with O'Brien and go through some of the other cases that you've talked about, Boos v. Barry, maybe--"
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.965,2291.465,What would you do about--
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2291.465,2292.549,--Maybe Frisby v. Schultz.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.049,2296.301,--What would you do... what would you do about Clark and Albertini?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2296.301,2297.601,I don't think they apply.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.601,2298.703,"Well, they said--"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2298.703,2301.322,Sleeping in a park has nothing to do with sound levels.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.322,2304.274,"--I know, but this is a time, place and manner question, isn't it?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2304.274,2306.24,"I'm not even sure this is a time, place and manner."
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.24,2306.807,Let's assume it is.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2306.807,2307.309,They keep talking about that.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.309,2307.842,Assume it is.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2318.515,2320.884,"But I don't think this is a time, place and manner at all."
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.265,2348.117,"Well, it's a... it's saying what you have to do if you want to make noise in a park."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2348.117,2352.505,"Well, parks are a place where you're supposed to have all sorts of controversy."
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.909,2361.811,I wouldn't think you would.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2361.811,2363.646,"It's community control, you know."
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.883,2371.65,"Well, it was the Court's opinion."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2371.65,2374.252,"--I understand, but you authored it."
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.732,2422.065,"But, Mr. Kunstler, let me interrupt."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2443.912,2444.362,No.
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.739,2461.573,"Oh, well, that's--"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2461.573,2463.423,I will not agree to the constitutionality aspect of it.
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.423,2464.525,But you don't agree that the--
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2464.525,2466.008,I don't want to give that--
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.008,2466.891,"--Well, I thought you had."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2467.81,2468.41,"--I thought I had, too."
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.762,2472.312,"Oh, okay."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2488.473,2492.442,"And, Justice Stevens, sound is an integral part of the artistic expression of rock groups."
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.657,2525.044,"Well, you... you mentioned that one of the possible alternatives was the automatic governor--"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2525.044,2525.544,Yes.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.544,2532.4,--that would just be attached to the machine and here would be a... here would be a state instrument.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2532.4,2533.833,"No, not by... run by the state."
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.833,2535.033,"Well, I know it wouldn't be run."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2536.018,2536.952,It's automatic.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.952,2539.554,"And so, when it gets too loud, it just turns it down."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2539.554,2540.37,That's right.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.37,2543.639,"Well, would that be constitutional?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2543.639,2548.36,"Well, I'm not... it's not unconstitutional because no state official runs it."
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.795,2553.814,I know but it's something that... it's something that the state insists on.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2560.301,2562.52,"No, that wasn't my point, that they would insist upon it."
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.526,2603.578,"But, Mr. Kunstler, I don't understand what the source of their obligation to negotiate is."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2611.501,2612.851,I don't think anything is wrong with it.
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.851,2615.618,"So, I mean, there really is no constitutional obligation to negotiate with you."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2617.887,2618.27,They can make the rule.
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.27,2619.52,--the citizens' interest--
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2619.52,2625.491,And the normal thing... National Park Service has made the rule that we will establish a decibel level.
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.93,2636.83,--Is there any testimony--
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2636.83,2638.032,I think that's the least intrusive.
1988.88-226,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2638.032,2638.498,--Excuse me.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2647.821,2657.343,"No, I don't remember any testimony about decibel level being feasible for rock music or unfeasible or nonfeasible for rock music."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2687.465,2689.898,"Mr. Kunstler, they say monitor the decibel level."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2695.301,2696.403,We don't know.
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2699.605,2700.288,"Well, I... I keep coming back--"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2700.288,2700.788,--monitoring it.
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2700.788,2711.413,"--to the fact, I am... I am not sure that you can just set one decibel level and that every mix of music that you get is going to carry the same distance so long as it is only at that decibel level."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2711.413,2711.863,Well--
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2711.863,2714.282,I... do we know from the record whether... whether that's the case?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2714.282,2717.4,"--No, but the Park Service says that they do it."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.4,2730.742,"Well, that's pretty important because if how far it carries depends not just upon the decibel level, but also upon what instruments are being played and what the mix of those instruments is, then all of your solutions regarding decibel level at the source are simply not solutions at all."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2730.742,2739.23,"Justice Scalia, I don't think it's hard to post someone at the Sheep Meadow who has ears and can hear if it's bleeding in."
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2785.294,2786.694,"I made it up, Mr. Kunstler."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2789.513,2792.948,But the point is it's easy to have someone stand at the Sheep Meadow.
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.427,2811.91,"Not only different instruments, but different--"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2811.91,2812.343,xxx.
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.595,2813.945,--No.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2816.863,2818.446,"And weather conditions, wind conditions--"
1988.88-226,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.446,2819.282,"--In one direction, you won't hear it in the Sheep Meadow."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2819.282,2819.765,--on a particular day.
1988.88-226,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2848.802,2857.239,"You'd certainly have a different decibel level for the Philharmonic and these rock bands, wouldn't you?"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2857.239,2858.407,I'm not so sure.
1988.88-226,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2860.609,2862.709,As loud as a rock band?
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2862.709,2866.513,"--Well, when those kettle drums go, it's loud."
1988.88-226,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2876.119,2876.852,Sorry I asked.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2876.852,2877.702,--where you have a rock band.
1988.88-226,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.189,2883.975,"That was the 1812, Mr. Kunstler, you were talking--"
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2885.225,2886.158,I guess that would be it.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.765,3084.353,But the finding is that... that the state would do whatever the... whatever your client told them to do about the mix.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3084.353,3087.488,"You can't do that, Justice White, because there are some times--"
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3087.488,3090.507,"Well, you did say... you did say the court... the finding was just wrong then."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3090.507,3096.511,--Remember the court's first finding was just the opposite when it issued the preliminary injunction.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.863,3102.398,"Well, after consideration."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3102.398,3110.819,"Well, but I think when it heard the words ""until their ears bleed"", I think that marked the change in Judge Haight's attitude toward this case."
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.104,3126.58,But he never... it's... I thought the way you judge this case on the basis that the state... the state employee will follow the directions about mix given to him by the performer.
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3126.58,3127.63,--But you can't do it.
1988.88-226,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3145.075,3147.427,"So, the judge just didn't know what he was talking about."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3147.427,3153.014,"--Well, I don't think you're under the... the purely erroneous rule here of National Gypsum."
1988.88-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3218.79,3219.806,"Very well, Mr. Kunstler."
1988.88-226,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3219.806,3220.69,"Thank you, Justice Rehnquist."
1988.88-226,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.69,3224.193,"Mr. Koerner, you have six minutes remaining."
1988.88-226,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3224.193,3226.726,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-226,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3302.627,3303.227,Where are you reading?
1988.88-226,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3303.896,3308.597,--At the bottom of page 100 to the top of 101 of the Joint Appendix.
