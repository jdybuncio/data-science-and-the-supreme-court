1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.272,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-2127, American Foreign Service Association v. Garfinkel."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,12.188,26.032,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.313,231.25,"When you say unmarked, that's material that has not already been classified?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,231.25,233.951,"--Generally, yes."
1988.87-2127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.882,264.554,"Ms. Goldman, isn't the dispute about the use of the term classifiable moot now?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,264.554,266.637,"Yes, in part."
1988.87-2127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,297.941,300.493,"Well, it's hard to see what's left of that at all."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,310.416,318.689,"--Appellee Garfinkel has placed a notice in the Federal Register, but Appellee webster has not as to the forms that he is responsible for."
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.802,341.47,So you don't agree that it's moot then?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,343.054,343.804,--Certainly not.
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,349.891,354.612,But don't you... don't you agree that we don't need to deal... we don't need to deal with that issue?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,354.612,355.312,--We certainly do.
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.314,357.714,"Well, we don't need to talk much about it then."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,357.714,364.384,"--It would... well, the remedy has been an important issue in this case because the Appellees have asked this Court to affirm."
1988.87-2127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.435,426.458,"Well, Ms. Goldman, does any of the language in the two new forms now in use actually conflict with any of the requirements of subsection (1) of Section 630?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,426.458,428.493,Yes.
1988.87-2127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.243,465.618,"Well, do you challenge the requirement in the new forms that the employees consult or confirm the classification status of material when they are uncertain?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,465.618,470.57,Our complaint has not reached the new forms since they weren't part of the--
1988.87-2127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,470.57,472.455,Do you have any problem with that requirement?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,472.455,474.557,--Yes.
1988.87-2127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.566,494.352,"Well, isn't that precisely what lets an employee know?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,494.352,496.72,Yes.
1988.87-2127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.72,497.839,Making an inquiry?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,497.839,503.124,But the employee doesn't know exactly when that obligation to make an inquiry arises.
1988.87-2127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,542.618,551.557,"Well, has the reason to know regulation or standard ever been applied to any of the members of your organization?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,551.557,553.843,--I don't believe it has.
1988.87-2127,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.843,557.311,Would you think it's right for a decision then?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,557.311,569.035,"--Yes, we do think it is right because these individuals have signed a contract that first said classifiable and now has been amended to say know or reason to know something is classified."
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.958,587.48,And you don't agree with the amici here that know includes reason to know?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,587.48,594.468,"Well, in the context of this case, Congress said know when a reason to know standard was before it."
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,614.881,625.605,"Ms. Goldman, what in your view is here on the merits or that ought to be decided either under terms of the statute or under terms of Constitution?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,625.605,636.211,At this point we're not asking the Court to decide any of the merits of either the statutory or constitutional argument.
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.308,663.147,Why is all that necessary if you're so sure that know... and it seems to make sense to me... that know doesn't mean reason to know?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,676.872,685.561,"Well, initially we had taken the position that it was clear on the face of the forms that there was a violation there and this Court should reach the statutory and constitutional issues."
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.561,686.763,But you've abandoned that?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,686.763,695.416,"Well, there's so much disagreement in all of the briefs that have been filed in this case, and confusion, if not on our part, on the part of many of the other people who have filed briefs that--"
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.416,703.272,"Well, it's scarcely a useful... a useful use of an hour of the Court's time simply to send a case back to the district court."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,703.272,713.58,"--Well, the reason that we're here, Your Honor, is because once the developments took place the Appellees asked this Court to affirm the district court judgment and not to vacate it."
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,733.291,735.076,"Well, why don't you challenge that ruling here?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,735.076,738.195,"Well, we have and we're prepared to argue that."
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.968,758.442,"Then, I must have misunderstood your answer of a moment age because I thought I'd asked you what on the merits, so to speak, either statutory or Constitutional, is before us."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,763.93,768.632,"It is before the Court, and we believe the Court can decide it."
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,776.32,782.057,"But you are suggesting we really shouldn't decide anything, we should just send it back and have the district court sort things out."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,784.593,790.163,You can certainly do... decide the case or send it back.
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.347,792.863,"Well, what's your position?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,797.234,802.388,--We initially urged the Court to decide--
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.388,803.621,"Well, what are you urging us to do now?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,803.621,808.309,--We think the right thing to do at this stage is to send it back and have the district court pass on all the recent--
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.309,809.142,And decide nothing?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,809.142,815.195,--I think this Court should decide two things about the district court decision.
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.107,888.927,"Ms. Goldman, we don't ordinarily correct district court opinions as if it were some sort of a test."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,892.863,899.468,"--Well, we believe this case is concrete, and there is a live controversy."
1988.87-2127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,918.113,921.815,May I just ask this?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,937.843,939.893,There are two violations that exist.
1988.87-2127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.795,943.847,Yes.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,943.847,946.782,And the other is the prior authorization requirement.
1988.87-2127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,955.971,957.755,And that's a violation of subparagraph (4)?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,957.755,958.205,--Yes.
1988.87-2127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,960.007,961.04,That it interferes--
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,961.04,971.065,"--the statute, but there are two subsections that prevent nondisclosure agreements from imposing a prior authorization requirement on disclosures that employees have a right to make to members of Congress."
1988.87-2127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.065,981.503,"--But, now, isn't it... isn't it argued by one of the briefs that such a prior authorization requirement already exists and that, therefore, the statute really didn't change the law?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,981.503,983.955,I think it's the reverse.
1988.87-2127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.071,1012.558,But then there may be no statutory violation... there may be no second statutory violation then?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1012.558,1013.592,There may or may not be.
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.125,1047.815,"Your jurisdictional statement presented just... question one was the constitutional issue, wasn't it?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1047.815,1048.865,"Yes, it was."
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.865,1051.267,And now you say we shouldn't decide it?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1053.719,1055.269,We--
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.269,1057.671,Have you changed your mind since you filed your jurisdictional statement?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1057.671,1058.42,--We believe--
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.42,1059.788,"That wouldn't be a crime, of course."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1059.788,1061.188,--We did change our mind.
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.188,1061.657,Yes.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1061.657,1064.057,In our opening brief we also asked the Court to reverse.
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1064.057,1064.407,Yes.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1064.407,1070.394,It was in our reply brief that we backtracked and we said the Court should either reverse or vacate and remand.
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.394,1070.861,[inaudible]
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1070.861,1071.377,Yes.
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.009,1098.294,"That's all a lot of confusion, and it's terribly inconvenient and all of that."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1117.173,1122.744,We certainly believe there's enough on this record for the Court to reach all of the--
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.744,1123.529,That's not what I'm asking.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1137.169,1141.407,"--Well, the Court would certainly have--"
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.407,1152.596,"To put it more specifically, if I think that know does not mean reason to know, there is a clear discrepancy between the forms and the statute and we're going to have to reach the constitutional issue."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1152.596,1154.131,--We agree with you.
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.131,1157.417,Why should I send it back if I think know cannot mean reason to know?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1159.785,1171.176,The only basis would be that the parties and the amici that have filed briefs have viewed that term differently and have relied on evidence that's not in the record.
1988.87-2127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1182.817,1184.834,You've still got ten minutes left.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1189.888,1190.838,Certainly.
1988.87-2127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.838,1193.34,Before you... I just wanted to say one thing.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1199.66,1201.779,"Well, that--"
1988.87-2127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.779,1205.648,"The district court didn't focus on Section 1, as I remember."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1205.648,1207.432,"--Well, that was the problem with the district court opinion."
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.523,1246.141,"But we could reverse that and send it back and say, look at it piece by piece."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1246.141,1246.975,And that's--
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.975,1247.759,If they're wrong about that.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1249.426,1251.378,--That is what we're asking this Court to do.
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.378,1252.478,That's what I thought you originally asked.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1253.83,1263.602,"That is what we want this Court to do, is look at the approach that the district court took and... and explain exactly why it is in error."
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1421.673,1426.958,"I know, but the requirement of knowledge means that the Executive Branch has to put up with the negligence of employees."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1426.958,1428.827,--Not necessarily.
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.827,1430.946,Not when they're dealing with classified information?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1430.946,1432.929,"Well, not necessarily for two reasons."
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.664,1434.998,"Well, not necessarily."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1435.581,1443.42,"--I don't believe so, because Section 630 only goes to terms in nondisclosure agreements."
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.821,1472.106,xxx you can't use these kinds of contracts?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1472.106,1474.975,Congress was very concerned about these contracts.
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.675,1480.343,"Why shouldn't... why shouldn't the government say, please be careful?"
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1480.343,1482.629,"--Well, that's not the question here."
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.549,1496.304,xxx Congress thought that the Executive Branch couldn't do anything about negligent employees who were dealing with classified information.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1496.304,1497.204,"Well, that's not--"
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1497.204,1499.34,Don't use any money to get after these people.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1499.34,1502.558,--That's not exactly correct because under Section--
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.558,1503.942,Is it partly correct or not at all?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1503.942,1509.696,--It is correct in that Congress limited certain obligations under nondisclosure agreements.
1988.87-2127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.6,1516.135,[inaudible]
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1516.135,1522.789,Then he or she can only be punished if the Executive Branch is using some other authority.
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.491,1527.758,What other authority if the person has already left the service?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1534.513,1536.096,"Well, there may not be--"
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1536.096,1542.333,There may not be any way to... to punish the negligent employee.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1542.333,1544.035,--If the employee has left.
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.035,1544.685,Right.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1544.685,1550.356,But the concerns that are raised in the Executive Branch brief here is access to the national security information.
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1550.356,1552.641,"Well, they've had access already in the past."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1562.231,1565.283,"Well, if they know, they have all the obligations of the agreements."
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1565.283,1565.716,If they know.
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1567.318,1577.923,"If... if the Executive Branch would have some other stick, for example, a new position, the Executive Branch would certainly have control over whether--"
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1577.923,1578.925,"Boy, that will fix them."
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1592.802,1599.806,"--Well, the statute does use the term policy but the legislative history in this area is clear that Congress was concerned with contracts."
1988.87-2127,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.96,1609.062,To construe the word policy by just erasing it?
1988.87-2127,0,37926,patti_goldman,,1609.062,1614.398,"--Well, it doesn't say rules or regulations or executive orders and it's not exactly clear on that point."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1705.772,1713.01,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.087,1754.537,So you don't want us to reach the Constitutional issue either?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1754.537,1760.157,--We don't think it's necessary to do so because in our view the forms that they have challenged comply with the statute.
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.978,1765.478,You want us to try the case right up here [inaudible]?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1765.478,1767.529,I don't think it's a need to try the case.
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.762,1770.631,You want us to do what the district court didn't do.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1770.631,1779.82,"--Well, this Court is accustomed, when a lower court decides a constitutional question, to first looking at a statutory question in reviewing the judgment."
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.82,1790.212,"xxx also, we aren't accustomed to having respondents ask us to affirm on different ground than saying I'm sorry but we think that somebody else should decide it first."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1790.212,1794.247,"Well, that's obviously within... within the Court's authority and discretion."
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.789,1836.907,How can a form be invalid on its face?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1836.907,1850.766,"Well, for, for example, with respect to the question of disclosures to Congress, the form states that unauthorized disclosures are barred and the employee undertakes never to make an unauthorized disclosure."
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1874.449,1877.401,The form just refers the employees to a law library.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1877.401,1884.055,"Well, it refers them... these employees are not... receive a lot of instruction as to what their obligations are."
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.743,1912.907,"Well, how does... how does the one thing you've referred to so far, that you're not allowed to make any unauthorized disclosures... how does that help anyone if... if... if that simply means that you check through all possible applicable laws and regulations and the Constitution and decide whether or not a particular disclosure is authorized?"
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1912.907,1915.776,"--Well, in fact, for employees it's far easier than that."
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.372,1991.609,But is Congress bound by the Executive's determination in that respect?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1991.609,1999.18,"Congress is not bound in several respects, but it is... let me explain my answer."
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.901,2031.134,"But suppose Congress says,"
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2037.055,2047.446,"Well, I think that's another way of saying that Congress doesn't like a national security or state secret privilege that has long been recognized in the Executive Branch."
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2047.446,2053.533,"But, you know, a privilege is not necessarily something that can't be overridden by Congress."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2053.533,2066.924,"In this particular case, we believe this is a privilege that cannot be overridden by Congress because it is a privilege that derives directly from the constitutional authorities of the President under Article II of the Constitution."
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.924,2082.703,"Well, then you do say that Congress could not by statute pass a law that's saying... that says any time we want something from the Director of the CIA if the appropriate committee votes for it by a majority, the Director is going to have send it over?"
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2086.571,2094.76,"No, that wouldn't be contrary to the Executive Order because if the Director of Central Intelligence determines that that information should be furnished, then it's an authorized disclosure."
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2094.76,2097.295,But supposing the Director determines it shouldn't be furnished?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2097.295,2106.984,"Well, that is... that is an example of the give-and-take between the political branches that frequently goes on."
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2106.984,2108.734,And supposing it gets to a point of impasse?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2112.305,2113.122,Not necessarily.
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.994,2122.811,--But who determines that?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2133.218,2134.051,"--Well, but--"
1988.87-2127,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.051,2135.151,Why shouldn't that be the last word?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2135.151,2140.372,"--Well, presumably the Director of Central Intelligence is not going to withhold information under the statute like that--"
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2155.565,2156.751,Wait a minute.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2173.443,2173.962,"--Oh, no."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2177.33,2178.997,Which is enforceable in the courts?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2178.997,2185.651,"--Well, there may be a political question, doctrine problem, or something if a lawsuit was brought in that circumstance."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.024,2195.459,Assume the dispute gets here.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2209.886,2216.622,"--Well, it may be on a particular case that this Court would hold that the President's claim of privilege is valid."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2231.132,2233.167,What happens in this prosecution that I just posited?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2242.19,2248.344,"--Our initial position I think would be yes, that the prosecution could not proceed."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.827,2250.444,I thought that's what this case was all about.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2250.444,2258.366,"--But... but no, I think it's not, because what we have at issue here is not... is not a statute by which Congress speaks to the Director of Central Intelligence."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.095,2354.461,Well--
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2354.461,2355.712,That it refers one to some other source.
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.712,2362.116,--The statute doesn't... wouldn't... it forbids using money to enforce these--
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2362.116,2362.566,It's written as--
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.566,2373.139,--That certainly wouldn't... it didn't purport to forbid the Central Intelligence Agency from firing a person who furnishes this information without authorization.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2373.139,2375.224,"--Well, again, it would depend on how the statute were read."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.184,2390.534,It takes money to fire somebody.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2390.534,2391.136,Yes.
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.816,2417.085,"Mr: Kneedler, can I... I understand the problem on Section 1."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2429.511,2431.878,Is this--
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.878,2433.88,Isn't there a need for some findings on that?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2433.88,2434.38,"--No, I think not."
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.652,2442.018,Right.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2442.018,2442.652,Not policies.
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2455.126,2463.982,"But even so, do these forms on their face interfere with the right of Congress to obtain Executive Branch Information in a secure manner, and so forth?"
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2463.982,2467.184,"--They do not... they do not on their face because, again, they only prohibit this--"
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.184,2469.886,"Well, then... then, on their face, their is no violation of 3 or 4."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2469.886,2470.353,--That's right.
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2474.124,2478.908,"But, at the very least, there is no Constitutional issue to decide with respect to (3) and (4) on the present state of the record."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2478.908,2480.027,That is... that is correct.
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.681,2486.131,Right.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2486.131,2487.881,--no furnishing of information is permitted.
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.685,2498.489,"So, if we were to affirm the district court on the theory, you say we would not affirm the district court's reasoning with respect to--"
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2498.489,2498.805,--No.
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.072,2501.024,--Because we don't agree--
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2501.024,2502.141,--that is before the Court.
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2502.141,2502.707,--I understand that.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2502.707,2521.687,"But, again, let we reiterate that this reading of the statute we think would properly be informed by the serious constitutional questions that would be presented if... if there were a statute passed that purported to allow any lower-ranking employee in the Executive Branch to take it upon himself to divulge information to Congress."
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.014,2570.335,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, I take it you must have urged the district court to take the action that he did."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2570.335,2571.12,No.
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.524,2580.143,Made that to the district court?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2580.143,2580.893,We made that to the district court.
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.593,2586.463,And in effect you're saying that anything about sections (3) and (4) are just not right?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2586.463,2589.415,--I don't think that's... I don't think it's a question of rightness.
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.486,2598.188,What about (1)?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2598.188,2608.96,"Well, as to (1) the only form... the only two forms that they challenged in this case, 4193 and 189, don't present this question."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.095,2667.999,"You say it doesn't address the... it does address the... it says if it's that kind of information, whether it's known to be or not."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2670.451,2681.341,"--Well, I think that... I think the information that is the subject of the forms is something that should be objectively ascertainable, and I think that's what... that's what paragraph 1 of those forms is directed to."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.232,2692.949,Whether or not he knows it.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2694.149,2697.184,"Well, the standard of care is not addressed in the form."
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2719.467,2731.291,"What about... did Congress in the... in taking action, did it require the knowledge issue to be put in the form?"
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2731.291,2734.476,"No, it's a negative."
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.082,2745.015,But they didn't put any knowledge limitation on it.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2748.883,2749.733,--That's our position.
1988.87-2127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2766.594,2774.248,So you just don't think the Constitutional issue as being here or... or on the knowledge part?
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2774.248,2775.634,The Court can affirm the judgment below.
1988.87-2127,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2779.069,2781.438,"And do we look at the old forms, not the new ones?"
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2781.438,2788.008,That's... that is actually all that's before this case because the complaint only challenges 4193 and Section 189.
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2848.832,2856.152,"Mr. Kneedler, I just don't understand the logic of your assertion that the regulation somehow alters the problem."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2898.063,2904.669,"Well, I think that's a question of enforcing the obligation under the form."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2948.346,2956.602,"Mr. Kneedler, if I understand you correctly, just viewing the judgment below very narrowly is just passing on the two forms challenged in the complaint."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2967.176,2970.194,"That is... yes, I think that's largely correct."
1988.87-2127,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.711,2979.883,"Then it really doesn't make an awful lot of difference whether... assuming we do one of the two things, whether we affirm on your theory or we vacate and remand on their theory, and let them litigate in this case."
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2981.835,2982.885,"--Well, they may."
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3009.153,3014.973,The only thing I'm suggesting is that your theory of affirmance does not necessarily put the litigation in a broader sense to an end.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3014.973,3018.425,"--Well, it... may or may not, depending on... depending on what happens."
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3043.891,3046.91,Because even in that word... we're interpreting the next year's status.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3048.445,3048.895,--Right.
1988.87-2127,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.313,3052.913,Yeah.
1988.87-2127,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3052.913,3059.919,"Which was enacted... or, it came into effect after these two forms that were challenged were superseded."
1988.87-2127,2,37926,patti_goldman,,3471.32,3481.426,I think it would be useful if I explained what we challenged and what's relevant now in this issue of compliance.
1988.87-2127,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3552.69,3554.373,"Thank you, Ms. Goldman."
