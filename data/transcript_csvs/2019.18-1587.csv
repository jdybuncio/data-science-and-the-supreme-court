2019.18-1587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.48,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1587, the United States Forest Service versus Cowpasture River Preservation Association, and the consolidated case. Mr. Yang."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,12.48,24.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether the Trails Act converts all federal, state, and private lands traversed by the Appalachian Trail into lands administered by the Park Service."
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,147.64,149.56,"Mr. Yang, may I ask you a preliminary --"
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,149.56,150.08,Sure.
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,150.08,181.8,"-- preliminary question? This issue of the Mineral Leasing Act is the third of the issues that the Fourth Circuit dealt with, and it was the one to which they devoted the least number of pages. This case, in any event, am I right, is going back for reconsideration of the environmental consequences, going back under the Forest Management Act and the National -- NEPA?"
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,181.8,182.08,Correct.
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.08,211.8,"So, since those reviews will be going on, is there the potential that the Mineral Leasing Act question will be moot because the decision might be that under that legislation, the environmental legislation, this crossing over of the -- the trail is impermissible?"
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,211.8,215.48,"Yeah, it -- the case -- that issue is not moot now."
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.64,270.24,"But then what do we make of the line in the reply brief that says ""no one doubts that the trail is in the National Park System""?"
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,270.24,276.4,I think what we're saying is that the trail is administered by the Park Service.
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,314.28,314.28,Well --
2019.18-1587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,314.28,315.28,"Mr. Yang, you --"
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.28,338.24,"-- is it inconsistent with the statutory provision that says the National Park System -- well, first we're told, yes, this trail is in the National Park System, and then the statutory definition of the National Park System says it consists of certain areas of land and water."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,345.12,348.4,What -- what part of the reply? I'm trying to -- I don't remember --
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.4,348.44,The --
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,348.44,349.24,-- it saying that.
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.24,367.6,"-- reply brief, 17, says, ""No one doubts that the trail"" -- I think it's toward the end of the page -- ""no one doubts that the trail is in the National Park System."""
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,367.6,370.12,I'm not seeing -- is this our reply brief?
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,370.12,371.24,"No, it's the other reply brief."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,371.24,371.28,Oh.
2019.18-1587,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,376.8,378.96,Then maybe we'll ask Mr. Clement.
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,378.96,380.52,Mr. Clement may be able to address that.
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,390.96,391.28,It's a --
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,391.28,392.92,-- Leasing Act.
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,392.92,405.28,"-- difficult distinction to wrap one's head around, Mr. Yang. You know, I -- I would understand -- if you said to me the trail traverses the forest, everybody would understand what that meant."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,423.12,424.48,I -- I don't know if that's --
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,424.48,430.92,"When you walk on the trail, when you bike on the trail, when you backpack on the trail, you're backpacking and biking and walking on land, aren't you?"
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,430.92,434.08,You're certainly sometimes walking on land.
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,466.04,469.6,"They might get relocated, but that just means that the -- now there's different land."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,470.12,472.12,But that means that the trail isn't --
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,472.12,500.52,"As a matter of plain English -- I mean, both of your briefs -- and you're great brief writers and you're great writers, and -- and the briefs are -- are strange to read because you can't ever just say what you mean, which is that the trail is a piece of land, so you find yourself wrapped up in these strange locutions about the trail traversing land. It -- it's like you're imagining some thing that goes on top of it somehow."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,500.52,501.56,I don't believe so.
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,519.36,529.88,"Let me ask you a question, Mr. Yang, because you said, and this would be very meaningful to me, you said you would call the Forest Service if there -- if a -- if a tree fell over the path."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,529.88,530.56,Yep.
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,530.56,566.2,"I -- I guess I -- when I looked at these regulations, what strikes me about them is that on the Appalachian Trail, it seems to me that the National Park Service -- it would be different on the Pacific Trail, which is a weirdness of its own, but -- but on -- in the -- on the Appalachian Trail, it's the National Park Service that regulates uses along the trail, vehicles on the trail, development and maintenance of the trail. In other words, it's the National Park Service that basically does land use regulation and the land is the trail."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,566.2,570.8,"The regulation I believe you are talking about is in a(i), this -- the authority that you're talking about?"
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,570.8,576.4,"This is -- this is 1246 -- it's the statute, 1246(c)."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,576.4,576.6,Right.
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,576.6,578.48,1246(f) --
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,578.48,578.52,Well --

2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,582.16,584.04,(i) requires that the --
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,584.04,584.84,Excuse me.
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,592.64,594.96,I don't think that's correct.
2019.18-1587,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,624.28,644.96,"I will just give you an example and you can tell me what you make of it because it would seem to me to cover the case where the tree falls on the trail. It says, this is 1246(h)(1): ""The Secretary charged with the administration"" -- which here is the Secretary of Interior -- ""shall provide for the development and maintenance of these trails."""
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,644.96,645.2,Yes.
2019.18-1587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,661.68,695.6,"Mr. Yang, before your time goes on, because it's inherent in how you're answering Justice Kagan, why is it that two agencies can't have simultaneous administration, and even possibly management responsibilities? I -- I'm -- was taken with the NRDC's amicus brief, and the Mineral Leasing Act has an entire provision devoted to when are two agencies responsible to administer a piece of land."
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,695.6,695.76,That --
2019.18-1587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,695.76,697.6,Let me finish my question.
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,723.0,726.76,"The answer is no, there needs to be more clarity."
2019.18-1587,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,728.96,736.36,"Well, it has, it has, but why can't two agencies have simultaneous or coexistent responsibilities?"
2019.18-1587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,736.36,740.16,Your -- your time has expired but I will allow you to very briefly respond.
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,740.16,742.96,There is three types of instances where that happens.
2019.18-1587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,772.6,773.12,Thank you.
2019.18-1587,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,773.12,776.08,-- different systems to -- to regulate the same thing.
2019.18-1587,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,776.08,778.28,"Thank you, Mr. -- Mr."
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,788.96,827.76,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Respondents' effort to convert all of the land traversed by a Park Service-administered trail into lands in the National Park Service fails for reasons of text, context, and consequences. First, as a matter of text, multiple provisions of the Trails Act draw a distinction between the trail and the land it traverses and makes clear that administrative authority is granted only over the former and leaves the latter jurisdiction over the lands themselves undisturbed. Moreover, the Trails Act itself makes clear that the trail can be moved."
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,887.12,893.04,"Where is the pipeline? I'm -- I'm trying to -- not in two dimensions, but in three."
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,898.12,898.44,Yeah.
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,898.44,900.08,-- and say it's going across a ridge.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,913.24,914.24,Six hundred feet.
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,914.24,915.64,Six hundred feet below.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,915.64,915.84,So --
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,915.84,922.36,"And where does it enter? Does it enter on -- on, you know, there is an easement or something for views and so forth?"
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,922.36,922.72,"Right, right."
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,922.72,932.4,Does it enter the ground within the area that is within that easement or before and it comes out after?
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,932.4,936.64,"It enters and exits on private land, not on Forest Service land."
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,936.64,937.0,I see.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,937.24,938.0,The problem with briefs --
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.0,938.2,Got it.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,938.2,938.64,-- is they're two-dimensional.
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.64,938.8,Got it.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,939.08,941.64,"But, I mean, the way to understand this, there is a ridge line."
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,954.04,954.48,And it enters --
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,954.48,954.96,-- on that --
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,954.96,956.8,-- before you get to the area --
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,956.8,957.44,Exactly.
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,957.44,960.68,-- and leaves after the area? Which is reserved to the trail or the views.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,960.68,961.32,Exactly.
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,977.04,977.12,Well --
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,977.12,977.96,-- of the trail or the pipeline.
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,977.96,985.0,"Now I had the same thought as Justice Breyer, but maybe there's something wrong with this simple way of looking at the case."
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1009.36,1050.4,"You could do that, Justice Alito, and I suppose my clients would be perfectly happy to win this case on that ground. I do think, though, that there is a critical difference between administrative authority over that trail up there and administrative authority over the lands. And it may be a little bit hard to square with your first reading of 1246(h)(1), but it is the case that when a tree falls in the national forest in Georgia or in New Hampshire, the nine or ten federal employees who are the entire total of the park unit in -- that administers the trail from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia do not get on a plane and fly up to New Hampshire and Georgia and deal with it."
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1050.4,1050.56,So --
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1050.56,1051.56,It's the Forest Service.
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1051.56,1059.72,"So what is the practical difference between viewing the case in those two ways, surface, 600 feet below, trail, land."
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1061.48,1068.36,"So for pipelines, I suppose, because most of them are going to go pretty far under, I -- I think you could draw that distinction."
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1082.28,1082.4,I know.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1082.4,1094.08,"-- to be conserved and unimpaired, so Park -- Forest land can be used for multiple purposes. One of the purposes that is allowed in New Hampshire is to tap the maple trees to get sap out of the trees."
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1109.92,1110.12,"No, but that --"
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1110.12,1111.32,-- be under the Park Service jurisdiction.
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1111.32,1113.08,I think that isn't quite the question.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1156.96,1161.24,"So, Justice Breyer, I represent the Atlantic Coast Pipeline."
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1165.44,1166.92,So I am not going to do that.
2019.18-1587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1166.92,1167.68,Mr. Clement --
2019.18-1587,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1167.68,1168.04,Yeah.
2019.18-1587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1168.04,1170.52,"Mr. Clement, I'm very grateful you said that."
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1190.68,1193.48,"That's not how we read that provision, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-1587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1203.44,1204.48,Then let me take a different --
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1204.48,1205.8,-- on Park Service land --
2019.18-1587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1205.8,1217.92,"-- tact. Generally, when you speak of land, surface land, you're talking about the land underneath it? That's what the cases mostly say, if -- almost always, unless you separate out the two?"
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1217.92,1223.84,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not going to spend too much time disagreeing with you because there is a reason we briefed the case the way we briefed it."
2019.18-1587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1223.84,1230.24,So why don't you explain that reason? Why -- there is a superficial appeal -- I -- after reading --
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1230.24,1230.52,Sure.
2019.18-1587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1230.52,1234.88,"-- the briefs and looking at the statute, didn't think it was viable."
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1237.68,1239.68,"Well, I -- I think it's viable."
2019.18-1587,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1240.16,1240.68,It's just --
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1240.68,1255.72,"If I could say one thing in limited defense of it, which is to say when you have -- and we have a case that we cite to this effect, and it's a case of this Court in our reply brief, that generally speaking if you grant a right-of-way, which is one way of thinking about the trail, it doesn't affect subsurface rights."
2019.18-1587,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1322.76,1362.28,"Mr. Clement, could -- if -- if we go back to Justice Alito's idea, which was also the way I thought about it, that that was the way to cut this -- but then I started looking around and the -- the mineral -- I wondered whether you can win under that approach. So here's is the argument that you can't win under the surface/subsurface approach, is that -- is that the Mineral Leasing Act gives the authority to do rights-of-way, including pipelines, to the -- to the -- to the secretary that has -- it talks about the surface."
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1384.96,1393.32,"So if I were going to warm to the topic of trying to win this case on the alternative ground, what I would tell you about that is I would say that's not how I actually read the provisions together."
2019.18-1587,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1546.56,1551.4,What do you do with your line that I asked Mr. Yang about?
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1551.4,1551.68,So --
2019.18-1587,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1551.68,1558.92,Because you have said that the trail is in the National Park System.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1558.92,1574.24,"So, Justice Ginsburg, with all respect, what I do with that line is I keep reading, because it says no one doubts that the trail is in the Park System to the extent that the Park System administers the trail. And to that extent, it is in the National Park System."
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1613.08,1626.4,"When the statute says that the Park System consists of lands administered by the Park Service, does it mean administered in full, administered exclusively by the Park Service, or administered in any sense by the Park Service?"
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1626.4,1632.84,"I think if it has to mean one of those things, it probably means administered in full."
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1658.16,1659.44,Let me -- let me ask you this --
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1659.44,1659.6,Sure.
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1659.6,1661.36,-- before your time runs out.
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1665.72,1667.08,Yes.
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1667.08,1671.32,Is that part of the -- is that part of the Park System?
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1671.32,1674.8,I don't think it's an area of land administered by the Park Service.
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1674.8,1676.76,"But the -- but it's administered by the Park Service, isn't it?"
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1676.76,1677.32,"No, you're right."
2019.18-1587,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1679.76,1680.48,It is?
2019.18-1587,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1680.48,1699.88,"Yeah, but I don't think they have to maintain that building in its unimpaired national state -- natural state, which just goes to show not everything that's in the Park System in some loose sense is subject to the restrictions of the Organic Act, which required the system -- the Service to keep them in an unimpaired state."
2019.18-1587,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1700.96,1704.72,"Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Kellogg."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1704.72,1715.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to go directly to the question of whether there's an easy out in this case by saying it's 600 feet under the ground, so it doesn't count."
2019.18-1587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.2,1833.52,Mr. Kellogg --
2019.18-1587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1833.52,1834.6,"Counsel, could you --"
2019.18-1587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1834.6,1849.36,"-- if you have an easement over land, is there anything unusual about that that someone, a separation, in other words, before traversing over the land and recognition that the land itself belongs to somebody else?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1849.36,1855.36,"Well, we're not saying if there's -- let's say we have an easement for the trail over private land or state land."
2019.18-1587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1858.48,1859.96,"No, no, I know, I'm not talking -- I'm speaking --"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1859.96,1869.12,"They can build a pipeline under private lands or under state lands and, in fact, they have done two of that under the Appalachian Trail in just the past five years."
2019.18-1587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1869.12,1876.8,"I'm thinking more, there seems to be a debate on some metaphysical level about whether you can have a trail, whether you can have land under it, or interests in land that are different."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1897.08,1901.68,"Well, that -- as we point out in the brief, there are two definitions of right-of-way."
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1944.16,1953.32,"When the -- when the trail crosses private land, what property rights do you think the Park Service has with respect to those private lands?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1953.32,1970.04,"I wouldn't say that they have property rights, but as with any in-holding of the National Park System or the Forest Service, which has lots of in-holdings of private land, there is still certain regulations that can be established for those lands."
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1970.04,1972.52,"Well, I don't think that answers my question."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1974.48,1975.44,They have --
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1975.44,1983.28,"Can the Trail Act take any property rights away from private landowners, other than the -- essentially an easement?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1983.28,1985.4,Essentially what they have is an easement.
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2005.4,2005.76,"Well, if you have only --"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2005.76,2007.4,So there is some restrictions.
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2007.4,2018.52,"If you have only an easement over private land, do you have anything more over land that is administered by the Forest Service?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2018.52,2024.12,The land is administered by the Park Service.
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2050.16,2050.36,Your --
2019.18-1587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2050.36,2057.32,"Once the trail is the trail, who regulates its use and who takes care of it?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2057.32,2061.24,"Well, authority can be divided."
2019.18-1587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2077.36,2087.72,And -- and -- and what -- what actually is the case here? Suppose there were a regulation that said there shall be no snowmobiling on the trail.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2089.48,2093.8,"It would be in 36 CFR, which is the Park Service regulations."
2019.18-1587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2112.44,2113.56,Mr. Kellogg --
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2113.56,2114.84,-- govern the Park System.
2019.18-1587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2114.84,2120.52,-- let's go back to -- let's go back to what the other side argued was the nightmare of this case.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2149.64,2150.88,Certainly not.
2019.18-1587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2150.88,2151.36,So --
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2151.36,2172.16,"But to the extent to which you can regulate, that's a question the Court left open in the Sturgeon case for in-holdings, how much -- if it's part of the Park Service, part of the Forest Service, how much can you regulate private in-holdings? And I think there's severe limitations on that, which is why the Park Service has said we're not regulating that."
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2172.16,2175.64,So is downtown Selma an in-holding in the Park Service?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2175.64,2176.08,I'm sorry?
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2176.08,2180.92,Is downtown Selma an in-holding on the Park Service in your theory of the case?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2180.92,2187.72,"If there's a -- for example, if there is a national historic trail through that area --"
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2187.72,2188.4,There is.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2189.52,2190.12,"Yes, there is."
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2206.64,2209.0,"Wouldn't -- go ahead, please."
2019.18-1587,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2209.0,2211.16,"Keep going, sorry."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2211.16,2218.2,I was going to say they said exactly the opposite in the Trails Act where they said that the Secretary administers the entire trail.
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.2,2220.2,What about the -- what about that?
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2220.2,2220.72,Please.
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.72,2224.8,Just take the same question and apply it to one of these kinds of trails.
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2224.8,2225.12,Yeah.
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.12,2226.6,"I mean, maybe it's not Selma."
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2229.76,2230.88,Or Kansas City.
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.48,2232.04,Kansas City.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2251.68,2252.0,Yep.
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.0,2252.4,Okay.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2253.24,2253.4,Okay.
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2262.6,2276.28,"Not the sidewalks. What happened is this is a -- a national -- a state park, and under the ground are some Native American remains, you know, and they would like to have access to those."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2284.48,2286.4,Unless there is another federal law --
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.4,2286.56,No.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2286.56,2291.88,"-- that applies to digging up Indian remains, then they could do it, because --"
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2291.88,2292.48,Why?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2292.48,2307.28,"They could do it because the Park Service has control over the trail on federal lands, but its regulations do not extend to the trail where it goes over state --"
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.28,2314.56,"As far as the statute is concerned, can they do it? We get a Park Service that doesn't like X."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2321.8,2322.64,If they are taking --
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.64,2323.32,"No, no."
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2362.28,2363.32,"Well, I -- I think that's right."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2452.96,2456.72,"Well, first of all, I don't think that has happened, Your Honor, because --"
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2456.72,2463.4,I -- I -- I knew you were going to say that. (Laughter.)
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2463.4,2465.2,If -- take the Pacific Crest Trail.
2019.18-1587,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2546.08,2547.08,What about the -- excuse me.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2575.8,2580.4,"You know, I would suggest that Congress used exactly language like that in the Rivers Act."
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2631.88,2638.32,Is there any reason why the Secretary of the Interior had to delegate this to the Park Service?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2638.32,2639.6,It did not have to.
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2649.44,2664.72,"So if Congress really wanted to bring about the result that you think the statutes commands, why wouldn't it leave that option? Why wouldn't it require that it be administered by the Park Service, rather than by the Secretary of the Interior?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2664.72,2674.44,"So the initial Trails Act decided the question about pipeline rights-of-ways, et cetera."
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2688.92,2702.84,"Mr. Kellogg, I think the question that Justice Alito is getting at troubles me too, and I'm not sure you quite got there. Could the Secretary of the Interior reassign these lands from the Park Service to the Fish and Wildlife Service and then allow --"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2702.84,2703.8,"At this point, I don't think they --"
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2703.8,2705.6,-- and then allow pipelines?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2705.6,2707.36,"At this point, I don't think so."
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2712.04,2712.52,"Okay, but it's --"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2712.52,2713.48,There's no authority --
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2713.48,2714.04,Could it -- could --
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2714.04,2714.64,-- to decommission.
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2714.64,2717.0,But the Secretary of the Interior could have done so?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2717.0,2718.16,"Could have done so, that's correct."
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2725.96,2738.04,"And why isn't that a strike against your interpretation? Because if Congress had wanted to ensure that these trails were left undisturbed, it could have simply made that assignment directly."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2738.04,2742.88,"Because the critical act, from our purposes, is the 1970 Act."
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2810.12,2810.32,So --
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2810.32,2811.56,-- with national parks.
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.56,2823.44,"So do you -- is this right that you think that -- think of Yosemite. I think that belongs to the federal government, and I think it belongs to the federal government down to the center of the earth."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2832.08,2834.24,It certainly --
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.24,2837.84,"And if -- that's -- that's really what I'm -- yeah, okay."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2838.36,2854.96,"Yes, it's -- it's my position, it's our position, that if -- whatever agency administers the trail also can award, decide right-of-ways across that trail, but only consistent with their own rules and regulations."
2019.18-1587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2854.96,2855.84,So that it --
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2855.84,2858.32,"Well, then why does the statute --"
2019.18-1587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.32,2872.16,"-- really does -- it really does erect a impermeable barrier to any pipeline from the area where the natural gas, those resources are located and to the area east of it where there's more of a need for them?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2872.16,2889.36,"Absolutely incorrect, Your Honor, I'm sorry, but the -- there's 55 pipelines currently running under the Appalachian Trail; 19 of those are on federal land pursuant to permanent easements granted before the Trails Act."
2019.18-1587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.92,2909.88,"I guess maybe -- maybe I'm not entirely incorrect, but that seems to suggest if it is not the Appalachian Trail land that runs through private property or were preexisting, that to the extent it is, I'll call, regular Appalachian Trail land, it does operate as a barrier?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2909.88,2911.88,Only on federal land.
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2911.88,2912.0,Why?
2019.18-1587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2912.0,2914.52,"Well, that's what we're talking about."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2914.52,2930.28,"Because the Mineral Leasing Act only applies to federal land, and it only exempts land in the National Park Service from the definition of federal land. So state, local, and private lands are unaffected."
2019.18-1587,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2930.56,2935.6,"State -- state, local -- state, local, private lands are unaffected."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2943.84,2963.2,"Is the trail, plus its protective corridor, which is about a thousand feet wide, and which the Park Service, despite their efforts in the reply brief to walk that back, if you look at page 97 of the Joint Appendix, they run through the numbers. You know, it's 2,190 miles long."
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2978.56,2979.48,But -- but you see --
2019.18-1587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2979.48,2980.44,Mr. Kellogg do you think --
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2980.44,2981.92,Go back for just a second.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3038.16,3039.04,"I do, Your Honor."
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3039.04,3041.52,And -- and -- and am I right?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3041.52,3044.76,That the subsurface lands also belong to the United States?
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3044.76,3044.8,Yes.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3051.4,3052.28,"No, you are not right --"
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.28,3055.24,Because of the statute or because of something else?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3055.24,3060.76,Because the Mineral Leasing Act applies only to federal lands.
2019.18-1587,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3060.76,3061.24,Well --
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3061.24,3068.48,"And the Park Service does not purport to regulate private, state, and local in-holdings."
2019.18-1587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3069.96,3082.52,"Mr. Kellogg, do you think it's possible that these trails are jointly administered, that there is some kind of joint jurisdiction over them? And if that's what is going on here, what would be the effect of that on this question?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3082.52,3109.04,"Well, first of all, if that were what's going on, the Court would have to reverse, because under 185(c)(2) of the Mineral Leasing Act, it says that if the -- if the surface lands are administered by either the Secretary of the Interior or by the Secretary and more -- and one or more other agencies, then only the Secretary of the Interior can grant --"
2019.18-1587,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3109.04,3113.16,I guess what I was suggesting is something along the following lines: You have the Weeks Act.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3150.2,3197.68,"Well, 1248(a) says explicitly that it's either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, as the case may be, and as the case may be, we know refers to the Secretary who administers the land. The government in its reply brief recognizes that's a fatal point for them, and so they try to say, no, it's not really mean that, but two provisions before in 1246(i) Congress uses the phrase ""as the case may be"" in a context that unmistakably refers to the Secretary administering the trail. So that means the Secretary of the Interior, and only the Secretary of the Interior can grant the rights-of-way in question here. So --"
2019.18-1587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3197.68,3198.64,Mr. Kellogg --
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3198.64,3200.4,-- the head of the Forest Service --
2019.18-1587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3200.4,3211.2,"-- I'm sorry, did you misspeak? You answered Justice Kagan by saying if we believed there was dual administrative powers, that we had to reverse, but I thought you won below?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3211.2,3213.76,"I'm sorry, then you'd have to --"
2019.18-1587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3213.76,3214.0,Affirm?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3214.0,3229.88,"I'm sorry, then the Fourth Circuit -- my apologies -- the Fourth Circuit was correct that the Secretary -- that the head of the Forest Service did not have authority to grant this pipeline right-of-way. So you would have to affirm on that basis."
2019.18-1587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3231.04,3279.72,"No, you were confusing me, so I -- I don't know that you have fully satisfied the parade of horribles that have been put forth. In my own judgment, the most serious one is the view that if everything the Park Department administers, the entire trail, that that means that it can stop pipelines or other things across the country, the -- the 200,000 or whatever miles that this is. And I -- I don't know that you have actually articulated concisely a -- a response to why that parade of horribles is not likely."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3279.72,3280.2,I can -- I can give you --
2019.18-1587,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3280.2,3282.64,I don't think it's enough to say that they haven't done it.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3282.64,3285.04,I can give you a very concrete example.
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3348.12,3358.04,Why would Congress allow pipeline under the Blue Ridge Parkway but not under the trail when those two run parallel to each other and are very close in some spots?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3358.04,3366.0,"That's actually a highly disputed point, whether they have allowed a pipeline under the Appalachian Trail -- under the Blue Ridge Parkway."
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3396.56,3397.8,For -- for pipeline purposes?
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3397.8,3399.8,For pipe -- for parkway purposes.
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3399.8,3402.36,Parkway purposes.
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3402.36,3411.48,And what you look for in the parkway is the Park Service regulations governing the parkway.
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3425.92,3426.88,"Well, if --"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3426.88,3427.52,-- or under the trail.
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3427.52,3438.0,"If the statutes allow it to go under the parkway, is there any reason why Congress would say: Well, you can go this far, but you can't go another thousand feet in some spots and go under the trail?"
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3438.0,3455.96,"Because they wanted to keep the Appalachian Trail, insofar as it's on federal land, where the most beautiful parts of the Appalachian Trail are to be found, through the national forest, through the -- through the Park System, Congress drew a bright line."
2019.18-1587,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3455.96,3466.36,"Well, I mean, that gets to the fundamental question I have about your argument. There may be all sorts of very good environmental reasons why this pipeline shouldn't be built."
2019.18-1587,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3489.96,3491.48,I think we do.
2019.18-1587,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3508.44,3512.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang, two minutes remaining."
2019.18-1587,3,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3512.08,3522.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you. The statutory regulation of in-holdings was addressed in Sturgeon, Section 10751."
2019.18-1587,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3581.76,3582.96,"Excuse me, Mr. Yang --"
2019.18-1587,3,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3582.96,3583.92,-- its exertion of land --
2019.18-1587,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3583.92,3589.64,"-- that's the problem, which is read that definition. Management and administration have two different meanings."
2019.18-1587,3,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3594.52,3595.04,I get the point.
2019.18-1587,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3596.12,3596.88,That's the problem.
2019.18-1587,3,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3596.88,3634.8,"-- Petitioner -- the first sentence says: ""Overall administration is administration and management of the trail."" If Petitioner is right that the trail is land, that includes management of the land. But that makes a hash of the second sentence, which says, ""no authority over the land management is transferred."" So Petitioner also -- or Respondent has a problem with Sections 1246(e) and (h)(1), both of which apply only outside the boundaries of federally-administered land, (h)(1) where the trail is outside, and (e) where the right-of-way is outside. There is no such thing under Respondent's theory because the right-of-way and the trail is federally-administered land."
2019.18-1587,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3654.04,3655.2,"Thank you, counsel."

2019.18-1587,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3655.84,3657.28,The case is submitted.
2019.18-1587,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3706.88,3708.92,-- appointed by this Court.
