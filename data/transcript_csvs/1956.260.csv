1956.260,0,41796,samuel_mezansky,,18.658,20.69,May it please the Court.
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2184.405,2195.856,"Let me first clarify the procedure here and explain why we think that the issue that we say is here, we think the Court can decide here."
1956.260,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2298.334,2300.657,They don't depend in any way on the other 200?
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2300.657,2301.68,No.
1956.260,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2475.307,2479.094,"Where is the -- where is the ruling, Ms. Rosenberg?"
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2479.094,2487.266,At pages of -- 15 of the record.
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2553.369,2554.678,May I ask you a question about --
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2554.678,2554.873,Yes.
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2554.873,2557.228,-- these questions?
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2565.664,2566.56,Or where was that.
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2566.712,2567.071,"Yes, (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2567.071,2568.1,-- who had custody and control.
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2568.1,2572.306,"Now, had he been ordered to bring those books the week before he failed to bring them?"
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2572.306,2572.843,That's right.
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2573.617,2578.22,"If he failed to bring them, was that a crime?"
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2578.22,2581.05,Without adequate excuse.
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2581.05,2592.534,"Well, if he admitted then that he had -- if he had answered these questions or assuming that he had violated the law and failed to bring them, was guilty of a crime."
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2597.008,2597.638,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2599.776,2599.904,Is about the book.
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2599.904,2600.542,And the issue --
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2600.542,2603.031,"I'm talking about the books, custody of books."
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2603.031,2604.239,That's right.
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2604.239,2615.684,"And your -- your contention is that even though it would tend to incriminate him because this was about the custody of books, he nevertheless could be compelled to incriminate himself."
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2615.684,2618.092,"Well, that goes that our petition is that --"
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2618.092,2618.611,That if -- wouldn't that be the result?
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2618.611,2626.47,"-- that this Court decided that in the White case, yes, Your Honor, and in the Wilson case because in that case, in both those cases --"
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2626.47,2627.661,How they had to bring the book?
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2627.661,2629.012,They had to bring the book --
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2629.012,2629.754,That's right.
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2629.754,2634.503,-- even though the book would show that they had committed a crime.
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2634.503,2652.014,But has it ever been held so far that a person who might be under suspicion of having violated the law and subjected himself for a criminal prosecution failing to bring those books could be compelled to incriminate himself about him and confess it?
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2652.014,2656.893,"There is one holding on this precise issue which is by the Second Circuit, in the Field case."
1956.260,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2656.893,2657.995,Has this Court ever held it?
1956.260,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2657.995,2659.562,"No, this Court has not."
