1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.536,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-1909, Murphy Brothers v. Michetti Pipe Stringing, Inc.--"
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,86.658,92.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.128,180.891,That's 1441(b)?
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,180.891,181.91,"Yes, sir."
1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.91,187.733,"And in what part of... it's a short section, but I didn't immediately follow where you were getting the language from."
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,187.733,204.704,"In 1441(b), the second sentence states that any such action, any other such action shall be removable only if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought."
1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.704,207.208,Do you think that's a definition of defendant?
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,207.208,213.45,I think it is... I don't think it is... was intended as a definitional provision.
1998.97-1909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.881,229.221,I don't see why it's being used in a narrow sense.
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,242.27,243.362,"Well, I--"
1998.97-1909,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.362,254.66,"It didn't... Congress didn't think that the word defendant automatically embraced those terms, and therefore it said, who... people who have been joined and served as defendants."
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,258.523,262.256,"--Well, I think it... I disagree with you."
1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.224,302.376,"But your argument has to be based on the proposition that Congress was using the term, defendant, in 1441(b) in the same way it was using it in 1446(b)."
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,302.376,319.587,"Well, our argument is that it suggests, by the use of the term defendant in 1441(b), it suggests that Congress was using the narrow term defendant in 1446(b) as well."
1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.889,331.734,"But then why didn't... if you're right, why didn't the Congress use all the qualifying language from 1441(b) in 1446(b)?"
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,331.734,348.205,"Well, in 1441(b) we're dealing with more than just parties who are named as defendants, because we're talking about parties in interest, and that could possibly be someone other than someone who has actually been named as a defendant in the complaint."
1998.97-1909,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,348.205,366.467,"Even if I... I'm not sure I agree with you, I think for the same reason that Justice Scalia's question suggested, but assuming that I do agree with you for the sake of argument, I still have a serious problem with your position, and it's because of the usage of defendant in 1448."
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,399.599,401.679,"Well, I think you're correct."
1998.97-1909,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,418.791,419.633,Or had not been served at all.
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,419.633,419.813,--who hadn't been served at all.
1998.97-1909,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,419.813,421.743,Or had not been served at all.
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,421.743,430.599,"I think it is a recognition that that can happen, but it just... it further demonstrates to me the ambiguity of the term defendant."
1998.97-1909,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,430.599,448.631,"Well, assuming that is the case, doesn't it also demonstrate that in 1446 Congress could not have been using defendant in the narrow sense, i.e., that which... sense that requires service, as part of the meaning of the term?"
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,448.631,467.253,"I don't think so, because even if we assume that a defendant can only remove, that there couldn't be an early removal by a defendant who received a copy of the complaint, decided to go ahead and remove it even though his time had not begun to run under a service interpretation."
1998.97-1909,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,484.164,498.994,"But it does use the word, the bare word defendant, and there's every indication in our Pullman case that we understand 1448 to apply to someone who is named as a defendant but not yet served, as it states on its face."
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,498.994,505.309,"I think 1448 does apply to someone who has been named but not served, but--"
1998.97-1909,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,505.309,511.432,How do you relate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 81(c)?
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,522.659,538.11,"--Your Honor, 81(c) is a... poses a real significant problem if the language, receipt through service or otherwise, means receipt without service."
1998.97-1909,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.11,539.85,It uses the same language.
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,539.85,540.261,"Yes, it does."
1998.97-1909,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,540.261,553.19,"Receipt through service or otherwise of a copy, and says that in a removed action in which the defendant has not answered, the defendant has 20 days to file a response, basically."
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,553.19,553.371,Correct.
1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.865,591.645,"If you're right, Ms. Smith, that there is an ambiguity, then how do you interpret the meaning of the word, or otherwise, after the word, through service, in 1446(b)?"
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,591.645,609.978,I believe that the idea that Congress was trying to set forth was that in a State where the complaint is served with the summons your time runs from receipt through service.
1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,619.034,621.805,The situation that obtained in New York at that time?
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,621.805,622.045,Correct.
1998.97-1909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,622.045,622.954,I'm--
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,633.022,633.603,Well--
1998.97-1909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.603,636.775,"And if that's true, there's nothing left for the other one."
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,636.775,651.204,"--Well, the second clause in 1446(b) was added to deal with a peculiarity in Kentucky where the complaint is filed in court, but it never has to be served on the defendant."
1998.97-1909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,651.204,651.364,Right.
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,651.364,666.033,"So if they didn't put in a specific provision, the defendant's time in Kentucky would never begin to run, because he never would receive a copy of the complaint or it could, that situation could occur, and that is the purpose of adding that language to the second phrase."
1998.97-1909,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.033,669.056,Or otherwise took care of the New York-type States.
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,669.056,669.316,Correct.
1998.97-1909,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,669.316,673.37,But you needed the further one to deal with this Kentucky State--
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,673.37,674.121,"The Kentucky situation, correct."
1998.97-1909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.121,678.205,"--Now, how does New York and Kentucky... what's the difference between those two?"
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,678.205,694.624,"In New York, the defendant... the complaint was filed and the... and service of process was perfected without filing or serving a complaint--"
1998.97-1909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.624,695.004,That's like--
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,695.004,698.167,--but ultimately a complaint had to be filed and served.
1998.97-1909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,702.481,716.89,"--But wouldn't the second clause cover there rather than the first, even in New York, because if the... oh, you're saying the complaint need not be served for a long period of time but must ultimately be served, but it would have been filed at the time the suit was filed, wouldn't it?"
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,716.89,717.581,No.
1998.97-1909,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,717.861,720.773,You mean you can file suit without ever filing a complaint?
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,720.773,720.953,--That's right.
1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,749.003,751.464,It wasn't even filed in the Clerk's Office?
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,751.464,755.537,"It did not have to be filed in the Clerk's Office when the case was commenced, that's correct."
1998.97-1909,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.537,767.675,"In trying to give some meaning to or otherwise, which I find difficult to do, does it help to construe it as covering cases by publication?"
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,770.127,793.231,"Well, I think that the problems in interpreting the or otherwise language are much less significant if service of process has already been perfected, because then you don't have the same kinds of concerns about whether the defendant has actually gotten notice that there is a formal proceeding against him."
1998.97-1909,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,793.231,798.015,"--Well, but I was wondering if the or otherwise covers that situation."
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,806.773,807.683,I--
1998.97-1909,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.683,810.914,--if you can find it if you said that it was to take care of publication.
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,810.914,816.678,"--I have not been able to come up with any narrow meaning of the phrase, or otherwise."
1998.97-1909,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,816.678,847.459,"There's not much disagreement, is there, that the or otherwise was inserted particularly to take care of the New York situation, where you start an action by filing... by serving the summons and unlike the Federal pattern, where they're served together, so they put receipt of the complaint or otherwise, not by process, but that you actually receive the complaint, and I think it's agreed that you have to actually receive the complaint to trigger, under anybody's interpretation."
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,847.459,848.14,I believe that's correct.
1998.97-1909,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.14,848.65,So--
1998.97-1909,0,21479,deborah_a_smith,,851.493,852.134,Correct.
1998.97-1909,1,32334,j_david_pugh,,1646.511,1657.828,"Justice O'Connor, yes, and I do agree that the requirement for filing the complaint is implicit in the terms and initial pleadings setting forth a removable cause of action."
1998.97-1909,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1657.828,1669.498,"What if the complaint in this case had been obtained not by the intentional act of faxing it, but by a different means?"
1998.97-1909,1,32334,j_david_pugh,,1685.447,1690.68,"Justice Souter, the position that the respondent would take would require more information."
1998.97-1909,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1699.956,1700.337,Okay.
1998.97-1909,1,32334,j_david_pugh,,1700.617,1701.618,So there would need to be a file stamp.
1998.97-1909,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1701.618,1701.979,--Okay.
1998.97-1909,1,32334,j_david_pugh,,1722.134,1725.476,"Again, Justice Souter, a few more facts--"
1998.97-1909,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.476,1725.506,Want some more--
1998.97-1909,1,32334,j_david_pugh,,1725.506,1725.876,--might be necessary.
1998.97-1909,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.876,1726.197,--Okay.
1998.97-1909,1,32334,j_david_pugh,,1730.19,1736.135,"Well, the facts in the case before the Court are the ideal situation for one reason, primarily."
1998.97-1909,2,21479,deborah_a_smith,,3399.954,3412.513,"Well, I certainly would not suggest that I am a drafter of statutes."
1998.97-1909,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3418.246,3426.021,"You want to say, after receipt by the defendant, comma, after due service, comma--"
1998.97-1909,2,21479,deborah_a_smith,,3426.021,3431.115,"I would have said, receipt or service, whichever is later."
1998.97-1909,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3593.621,3594.683,"Thank you, Ms. Smith."
1998.97-1909,2,21479,deborah_a_smith,,3594.683,3595.313,Thank you.
1998.97-1909,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3595.313,3596.229,The case is submitted.
