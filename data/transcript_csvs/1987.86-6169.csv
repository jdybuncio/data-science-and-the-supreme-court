1987.86-6169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We will hear arguments now in No. 86-6169, William Wayne Thompson v. Oklahoma."
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,12.308,15.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1987.86-6169,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,182.151,183.769,How old is he now?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,183.769,189.387,"He is 20 now, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.471,289.752,"Mr. Tepker, do you think that it would be a violation of the Eighth Amendment to execute a minor who has, for example, reached the age of 17 years and nine months, at the time the offense is committed, and who is found on an individual determination to have the moral culpability of an adult?"
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,289.752,292.804,"Your Honor, we argue for a minimum chronological age."
1987.86-6169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.804,304.096,"Yes, I know you do, but my question is, do you think that it is a per se violation of the Eighth Amendment under the circumstances I describe?"
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,304.096,305.798,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.808,337.067,"In the abortion context, this Court has held that a minor can and must be treated as an adult upon proving her individual maturity to be so-treated."
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,347.125,348.125,"I think not, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.372,404.128,"Well, did the Petitioner challenge the certification process in this case either at the trial or at appellate court level?"
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,404.128,407.414,"He did challenge it at the appellate court level, Your Honor, and his appeal--"
1987.86-6169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.414,412.083,On the grounds that it was constitutionally insufficient or inadequate?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,412.083,418.387,"--On Kent v. U.S. grounds, yes, but we are not relying upon those at this point."
1987.86-6169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.397,440.468,Did the Petitioner asks the trial court to instruct the jury to consider age as a mitigating factor?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,440.468,441.637,"--He did not, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,482.83,485.032,Is that your definite submission here?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,489.067,492.702,--That is the one that seems most logical to us based upon tradition.
1987.86-6169,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,493.452,496.654,"Of course, 16 would not save Mr. Thompson anyway, would it not?"
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,496.654,498.087,"--It would indeed, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,527.257,535.529,"Mr. Tepker, are there some states other than Oklahoma in which a minor below the age of 16 could be sentenced to Death?"
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,535.529,537.231,"There are indeed, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,544.968,548.955,"That is, 60 percent of the jurisdictions which provide for capital punishment?"
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,548.955,549.389,No.
1987.86-6169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.495,560.128,And half of them do not?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,560.128,561.28,"Yes, that is right."
1987.86-6169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.28,563.213,And half of them would allow it?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,563.213,583.526,"Half of them allow the potential for it, although I might add, if one takes into account the more general question of whether Youth bears upon the fundamental justice of the Death Penalty, Oklahoma is one of only three states that has neither a minimum line nor any special legislative declaration that Youth is a mitigating circumstance."
1987.86-6169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.014,595.484,Did the trial judge not say that the jury could take Youth into consideration as a mitigating circumstance here?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,595.484,596.686,"He did, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.565,651.405,You say that the jury should have been instructed that Youth is a mitigating factor and you should take it into consideration in your deliberations?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,651.405,652.106,Absolutely.
1987.86-6169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.016,702.103,Did the Petitioner object when the trial court told the jury that he had been certified as an adult?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,702.103,703.289,"No, he did not, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,703.289,708.526,And did he raise the point in the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,708.526,721.917,"On the issue of adulthood, no, but the Oklahoma Appellate Public Defender did raise the issue that more particularized guidelines focusing the jury on the mitigating circumstances was necessary."
1987.86-6169,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,775.552,778.77,Was the effect of those photographs raised below?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,778.77,780.505,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,781.991,783.774,On the sentencing phase?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,783.774,789.078,"--On the... well, there is an ambiguity in the Record on that point, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.712,827.603,"Do you think there is any constitutional difficulty, Mr. Tepker, in introducing a photograph that shows the brutality of a killing if in fact the killing was brutal?"
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,837.626,839.494,"Perhaps, Your Honor, although, I--"
1987.86-6169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,839.494,843.196,What is the source of your reservation?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,843.196,853.004,"--Well, I recognize it is an extremely difficult task to ask this Court to get into the business difficult and unpleasant of what photographs are too gruesome and what photographs are not."
1987.86-6169,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,863.109,866.228,Is this because of their submersion for almost a month?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,866.228,866.845,That is right.
1987.86-6169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.049,880.321,"But how... if the prosecutor had some other photographs that did not show the decomposition, but showed the brutality, that would be one thing."
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,883.34,902.334,"If the photographs were probative of the way in which the crime was committed, probative and relevant for those grounds, then I would think that would be an entirely different case, Your Honor, one that would bear upon the fundamental justice of the Death Penalty because of the aggravating circumstance of what is ""cruel, atrocious and heinous""."
1987.86-6169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.924,913.309,"But Mr. Tepker, no, but they said that in saying they were not relevant to the determination of guilt."
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,913.309,914.376,"Yes, that is true."
1987.86-6169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.376,920.815,So we do not really know whether they thought they were really relevant to the determination of the appropriate Death sentence... the appropriate penalty.
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,928.152,935.924,"Well, Your Honor, I would suggest this: The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals denounced the introduction of these photographs in very strong terms."
1987.86-6169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.763,951.434,"It gave no indication one way or the other on admissibility in the sentencing hearing, that is all I am saying."
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,951.434,953.953,"That is a fair characterization, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.368,1033.655,That is not what we are asked to do.
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1047.046,1048.998,"Your Honor, what percentage is that?"
1987.86-6169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.235,1063.174,"What jurisdictions that have criminal... that have capital punishment... it is, of course, irrelevant with respect to those jurisdictions that have chosen not to impose capital punishment at all."
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1070.078,1070.778,--That is true.
1987.86-6169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.746,1104.5,"We really have no idea what they would think about Youth as a factor, had they chosen capital punishment: they simply have not chosen capital punishment."
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1119.942,1132.169,"Well, let me shift then to trying to suggest that this Court has used international opinion and international law in order to assess what are evolving society's standards of decency."
1987.86-6169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.169,1137.537,"We would not have capital punishment at all if we were to be bound by that, would we not."
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1137.537,1139.089,"I am not certain about that, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.246,1185.304,Does the federal government place any limitation upon age with regard to the statutes in which it allows capital punishment to be imposed?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1186.737,1190.672,I am unaware of a federal death penalty that goes to the question.
1987.86-6169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1190.672,1192.624,That goes to the question?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1192.624,1196.16,"Yes, I guess I am unaware of the answer to your question."
1987.86-6169,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.848,1207.55,"Not of juveniles, but there are... there is a Death Penalty in the Federal Code."
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1214.087,1219.191,I do not know that there is.
1987.86-6169,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1271.826,1284.4,Do you have any statistics which could tell us how many juveniles have been prosecuted for offenses carrying the Death Penalty?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1284.4,1288.002,Prosecuted for offenses carrying the Death Penalty?
1987.86-6169,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1309.285,1324.794,"But we do not know actually how many under age 18, for example, of those now on Death Row, were prosecuted for offenses carrying the Death Penalty when they were... committed under 18?"
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1325.727,1326.21,Percentages?
1987.86-6169,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1336.268,1349.993,What I am trying to get at is how many have been prosecuted for offenses carrying the Death Penalty and how many of those prosecuted in fact were given the Death Penalty?
1987.86-6169,0,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,1349.993,1352.195,That is an extremely difficult statistic to come up with.
1987.86-6169,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1519.455,1520.622,"Thank you, Mr. Tepker."
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1535.047,1537.583,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-6169,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1705.509,1706.793,"I did not hear the last part,"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1708.145,1727.173,"That to announce in advance that, under no circumstances, regardless of the maturity the individual defendant displayed or irrespective of the viciousness of the crime that that defendant committed, we feel that would send the wrong message to other potential young murderers in this country."
1987.86-6169,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1727.173,1733.91,Then you would say the same thing to those states which do not have the Death penalty for adults?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1733.91,1739.647,"Well, we think that the individual states should be allowed the discretion whether to impose the Death penalty or not."
1987.86-6169,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1739.647,1748.603,I am merely saying that your argument would apply to states without the Death penalty equally?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1748.603,1768.083,"Well, of course those states have the right to choose whether or not they want to impose the Death penalty on a person of any age, and we think that if a state chooses to announce to the potential killers in that state, that in appropriate circumstances, if they commit a particularly vicious act, they too are subject to the Death penalty."
1987.86-6169,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1768.083,1771.451,What about... suppose Thompson had been ten years old?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1773.087,1785.961,Justice Stevens asked that question of me in the Eddings case in 1981 and I told him at that time in my view it would be a violation of the Eighth Amendment to impose the Death penalty on an individual that is ten years of age.
1987.86-6169,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1785.961,1786.761,It would be?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1786.761,1787.078,Yes.
1987.86-6169,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1789.997,1792.549,What about 12?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1792.549,1793.651,We do not think that this--
1987.86-6169,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1793.651,1796.769,"Then you see, what I am going to do is I am going up the ladder... where would you draw the line?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1796.769,1802.155,--We do not think that this Court should decide in advance what that minimum age should be.
1987.86-6169,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1816.814,1821.968,"But you would say that any ten-year-old, no matter where he is, may not be executed?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1821.968,1831.424,I think that there would be common and unanimous agreement among all people that that would be too young for an individual to receive the Death penalty.
1987.86-6169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1837.494,1848.369,"Mr. Lee, when is the last time that a state in this country has executed someone in this country that was under sixteen at the time of the commission of the murder?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1848.369,1855.122,In 1948 there was an execution of an individual who was sixteen years of age.
1987.86-6169,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1855.122,1858.157,Has Oklahoma ever executed anyone?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1858.157,1858.676,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1935.343,1954.971,"Mr. Lee, may I ask you, when you conceded that the execution of a ten-year-old for murder would be unconstitutional, are you resting that on a violation of the ""cruel and unusual punishment"" clause of the Eighth Amendment?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1954.971,1960.459,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that would violate anybody's sense of decency under the Eighth Amendment."
1987.86-6169,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1960.459,1965.779,"There is nothing in the Eighth Amendment that would suggest such an exception, is there?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,1965.779,1982.74,"Well, obviously, this Court is going to be the arbiter as what do constitute... what does constitute a situation that would violate the consensus of the public in this country that an execution of a person of a particularly young age would be unconstitutional."
1987.86-6169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.359,2064.409,"But you have accepted that, I thought?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2066.728,2068.596,"--Well, not at the age of 15."
1987.86-6169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.596,2069.013,"Well, all right."
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2073.132,2075.167,"Well, he is asking for 18."
1987.86-6169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.85,2076.3,I understand.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2086.725,2090.694,--I am saying that this Court does not have to say what that minimum chronological age would be.
1987.86-6169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2102.984,2104.436,We do not have to say it in this case?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2104.436,2107.571,"Yes, or at any time."
1987.86-6169,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2123.731,2133.306,"You say, Mr. Lee, that there had been four or six in recent years that received a death penalty under fifteen?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2133.306,2139.526,Since 1984 in my... according to my calculation there have been six individuals under the age of 16.
1987.86-6169,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2139.526,2140.876,Who were sentenced to Death?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2140.876,2142.561,"Yes, they were all fifteen years of age."
1987.86-6169,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2142.561,2145.096,How many of those were carried out?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2145.096,2157.671,"There have been none carried out and at the present time, there are three that are presently... of those fifteen, there are three that are presently on Death Row: Mr. Thompson, the individual in Indiana, and another individual in North Carolina."
1987.86-6169,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2157.671,2159.121,But none has been carried out?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2159.121,2159.94,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2159.94,2162.49,"Any significance to that, do you think?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2162.49,2167.427,There has been a problem nationally with imposing the Death Penalty on people of any age.
1987.86-6169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2231.952,2238.706,"In 1985 Congress insisted that the states raise the drinking age, did they not?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2238.706,2240.225,"Yes, and that is 21."
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.485,2268.142,"Mr. Lee, does it come down to the fact that you recognize that the Eighth Amendment would allow you to enforce the 15-year limit, but we cannot put it at the 18-year limit?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2270.761,2273.779,"I think it would be... I am sorry, Justice Marshall, I did not hear the first part of your question?"
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2273.779,2280.802,"That you can set the 15-year limit, but this Court cannot set the 18-year limit?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2280.802,2283.552,I do not think that 15 should necessarily be the limit.
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2288.123,2291.908,"Well, I thought you said you agreed that it could be done at 15?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2291.908,2292.777,"No, I am saying--"
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.777,2294.21,Did you not say that?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2294.21,2295.562,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2296.145,2301.799,Did you not say that you could understand that 15 years was good enough?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2301.799,2305.084,"--No, I did not say that 15 should be the minimum age."
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2305.084,2307.0,What did you say was 15 was for?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2307.0,2316.642,"Justice Blackmun asked me if 12 should be the minimum age, I think was the last age that he asked me, and I said at that point that I do not think that this Court needs to decide in advance what the minimum age would be."
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2316.642,2319.094,What minimum age would you give?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2319.094,2320.344,If I had to pick?
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.344,2321.244,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2321.244,2354.933,"If there was any bright line, and I have thought about this for six years since Eddings, and of course I thought about it before Eddings, if I had to pick a particular bright line, if there was a case directly before this Court, if there is any bright line, Age 14 is the age of common law age incapacity, and this Court in two previous cases, the Gault case and the Ford case, which you yourself wrote, Justice Marshall, you used the common law as the guideline for, in that particular case, for the imposition of the Death Penalty on somebody who was insane."
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2368.175,2378.549,I would say that our educational system and our government and everything else has sure progressed from Blackstone.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2380.083,2380.699,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.071,2389.771,Pointed out why we cannot do it.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2393.558,2397.344,"--I think it is unnecessary for the Court to do so, particularly in this case."
1987.86-6169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.123,2521.158,But you do not agree with that?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2521.158,2521.941,--I think that it--
1987.86-6169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.941,2529.447,You are really... it seems to me that you are arguing two different lines: your argument you are now supporting says that there cannot be any minimum age.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2529.447,2533.399,--Well... I am saying that there is a bottom somewhere.
1987.86-6169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2533.399,2534.116,All right.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2534.116,2537.537,"That there would... I am saying that, by age... by age, there would be."
1987.86-6169,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2561.235,2564.354,"Above ten, anyway?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2564.354,2565.17,Yes.
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.87,2571.524,"You are arguing that we should not set it lower than nay legislature has set it, I suppose is one thing that you have said?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2571.524,2582.232,"I am saying that, if there was a case that came up where the legislature had set the age at ten and a ten-year-old person was on Death Row, I think it would be appropriate under the ""cruel and unusual punishment"" clause."
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.232,2597.908,"You can argue statistics a million different ways, but... is it correct, I think you said that there had been no actual execution carried out of a defendant who was 15 or younger at the time of the crime since 1948?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2598.775,2603.729,In 1948 there was a sixteen-year-old that was executed in this country.
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.751,2618.489,"I understand, but it would not be a different case if it was fifteen and a half, instead of fifteen years?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2618.489,2619.322,"No, we do not think so."
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.691,2639.252,"But I am just wondering to what extent... there are statistics in these Exhibits and all about juveniles and so forth, but do we know how many, say since the turn of the Century, how many defendants who were under sixteen at the time of the offense had actually been executed in the whole, say, last 100 years?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2639.252,2643.437,"--I am unable at this time to recall what that figure would be, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2643.437,2645.556,"Is it more than a handful, do you know?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2645.556,2647.924,"In all honesty, I cannot remember."
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.924,2648.874,I could not figure it out either.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2650.976,2655.697,"I am unable at this time to recall what that figure was, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2657.43,2659.316,It might be zero?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2659.316,2660.449,--I cannot remember.
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.331,2719.954,One of the reasons I am trying to explore this is you express I think very appropriately the concern about sending the wrong message to potential offenders who are under 16.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2733.464,2741.22,"Well, as I have stated, we have only had 95 executions in this country since 1967, which means it is very rare and infrequent."
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.39,2753.96,There is a lot of difference between 95 in three or four years and none in 100 years.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2753.96,2754.893,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.893,2762.049,"I said there is a lot of difference between 95 in five or six years, whatever it is, and only one or two in a century."
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2762.049,2763.966,"Well, there has got to be a bottom somewhere."
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.835,2768.703,But I am just focusing on the deterrence argument at this point.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2768.703,2773.941,"--I think in this day... particularly the Petitioner in this case, that this was a ""street-wise"" individual."
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2786.915,2792.068,"I suppose if you talk about the particulars, there were several people involved in the killing here, were there not?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2792.068,2802.758,"--Yes, and I know that particularly Justice Blackmun has been concerned, like in his Dissent in the Burger case, he was concerned about the possibility that there might be domination by other individuals."
1987.86-6169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.64,2828.826,"Some of his family was involved in the crime, were they not?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,2828.826,2847.489,"--Well, there was one half-brother that was, but he made statements to a number of family, or at least close friends, to family members... there were certainly plenty of family members around that could have testified that he made the comment that he did this because he was afraid of Tony Mann or because they made him do it."
1987.86-6169,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3066.413,3069.548,"Mr. Lee, how many federal offenses carry the Death Penalty?"
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,3069.548,3075.618,"I think that is the only one, Your Honor, the Federal Air Piracy Act; that is the only one that I know of."
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3079.938,3081.874,Would that involve murder and rape?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,3081.874,3082.74,--Excuse me?
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3082.74,3085.342,Murder and rape are federal charges.
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,3085.342,3095.282,"Well, I do not know if at the present time that is a possible punishment for... if it is possible under federal law for receipt of the Death sentence."
1987.86-6169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3095.282,3097.55,Treason?
1987.86-6169,1,21166,david_w_lee,,3097.55,3100.336,"I think right now that air piracy is the only one, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3205.502,3206.835,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
1987.86-6169,2,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,3211.156,3213.089,Thank you.
1987.86-6169,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.644,3248.948,Every person under 18 is not sophisticated and calculating?
1987.86-6169,2,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,3248.948,3251.164,"--No, Your Honor, that is not what I meant to say."
1987.86-6169,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.335,3371.16,Do you... count the number of states who authorize the Death Penalty for people under 15?
1987.86-6169,2,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,3373.762,3376.047,"To my understanding it is 18, Your Honor."
1987.86-6169,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3388.822,3392.391,"Anyway, so your only apart by no more than one?"
1987.86-6169,2,28254,harry_f_tepker_jr,,3392.391,3392.891,--That is right.
1987.86-6169,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3536.568,3537.868,"Thank you, Mr. Tepker."
