1971.70-267,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.634,"Excuse me gentlemen, because of our changing the position on the calendar of the case just preceding you, I called the wrong case."
1971.70-267,0,44034,william_terry_bray,,46.302,49.972,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,1900.739,1903.372,"I think that would be true, Your Honor."
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1916.934,1933.95,How does the Board function or how do employees get to cases to the Board if any impediments are put in the way of having them freely give statements to government agents who come and call on them?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,1935.142,1945.28,"Well, the Board has foreseen this difficulty I think and they have and the Congress has as well."
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1979.156,1986.014,"Well, what's that got to with the need to interrogate witnesses before you call them?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,1996.169,1997.248,That is true Your Honor.
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2007.115,2010.64,"To determine whether a complaint should issue, is that right?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2010.64,2011.516,Right.
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2435.333,2440.271,"Mr. Jones, was -- did the trial examiner found it?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2440.271,2451.086,The card-examiner used words similar to what the petitioner uses here that say that Mr. Scrivener questioned the employees.
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2480.907,2483.675,"Well, then do you have any evidence that they were fired?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2483.675,2484.696,That there were fired?
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2484.696,2485.9,Yes sir.
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2485.9,2486.908,"No, Your Honor, there was not."
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.908,2487.875,No evidence?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2487.875,2489.685,"No, here is the situation on that."
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2489.685,2491.491,No evidence?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2491.491,2492.484,There was no evidence.
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.865,2510.303,What is difference in your contract and operating your claims between laid off and fired?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2510.303,2535.086,"Well, the lay off have a reasonable expectancy of recall and Mr. Scrivener told him as shown by the record, as found by the trial examiner, that it was a Thursday afternoon when the men came back that afternoon after having had this brief conversation with two of them about, Hey Bob, we have talked to the Labor Board man last night."
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2550.666,2553.585,"But you are now arguing Mr. Jones, the weight of the evidence."
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2574.384,2576.276,"Yes, Your Honor I do and now here is --"
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2576.276,2577.337,That is the legal question involved here
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2577.337,2578.99,"Yes, the legal question."
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2640.939,2650.432,"Well that evidence, would you have much difficulties supporting conclusion that in fact it was an interference with union activity?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2650.432,2652.615,The trial examiner so found.
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2754.02,2759.583,"Now, again Mr. Jones, I am looking at the petition for certiorari here."
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2777.936,2785.525,"Your Honor, I think it is very important for this Court to consider this case on the facts of this case."
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2786.501,2796.8,"Well, we will consider them and we will hear argument within the framework of the question presented by the petition and by the writ, but there is no use in spending time beyond that."
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2796.8,2797.78,Yes.
1971.70-267,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2800.435,2806.522,There was no classification here whether or not the company is in commerce?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2806.522,2807.789,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-267,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2807.789,2810.81,And the Court of Appeals is against you and the Board is against you on that?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2810.81,2818.165,"No, Your Honor, here is my position on that and I think that I am correct on this."
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2831.182,2834.885,"Well, whatever you have there, there is only one question here as in fact?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2834.885,2835.118,Well --
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2835.118,2837.397,They come back to?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2837.397,2839.597,I see what Your Honor is referring to.
1971.70-267,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2864.502,2868.218,As you said that you were marginally under the Act?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2868.218,2869.302,"Yes, and --"
1971.70-267,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2869.302,2872.532,They did not say your marginally outcome under the Act?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2872.532,2873.492,They did say that.
1971.70-267,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2875.787,2876.363,Right.
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2876.363,2897.999,"They did not review the constitutional question as to whether or not it is Due Process of law or a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act to prosecute an employer who is too small to protect under their jurisdiction standard, to use their jurisdictional standards in an arbitrary and capricious and discriminatory manner to prosecute the employer who is too small to protect."
1971.70-267,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.893,2916.349,You simply say that here you can just support the judgment of the Court of Appeals on any grounds that would support it?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2916.349,2919.621,I think that that is proper.
1971.70-267,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2932.195,2934.828,I thought you said they passed it only one ground?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2934.828,2936.383,They passed on only one ground.
1971.70-267,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2936.383,2942.745,"Our normal practice would be, if we disagree with you on the point is here, we would remand to the Court of Appeals (Voice Overlap)?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,2942.745,2945.871,"Well, I will go on to * (a) (4)."
1971.70-267,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3002.41,3016.729,"Well, then I take it then that - really what Chief Justice had suggest we ought to get to this 8 (b) (4) and if we decide against you, say that the Court of Appeals, now you decide the other questions, is that right?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3016.729,3019.607,I think that would be proper.
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3019.607,3022.584,You have just got about 10 minutes left to cover that.
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3022.584,3024.228,"Alright, thank you Your Honor."
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3117.158,3127.834,Was the purpose to ensure that the employee would have a right to give his information to the NLRB?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3135.675,3150.577,The -- I think the purpose was exactly what Congress -- I have to rely on finding the purpose of Congress upon exactly what they said.
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3199.318,3209.102,"But before you get to that, and how under the Sun does the Board get its charges if it does not talk to the employees?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3209.102,3212.04,That is true.
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3217.874,3223.131,Well how could the Board find out that the employees have a grievance?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3223.131,3238.205,"Well, it is clear under the law as this Court held in Nash versus Industrial Commission in Florida and another case, it is clear under the law and under the statute that the Board itself cannot initiate a charge which incidentally, that is another point."
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3238.205,3242.519,"That is not what I am talking about, but how will they ever know about it?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3242.519,3247.093,A charge has to be filed by some person and then the Board investigates as they deem --
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3247.093,3250.791,Well I guess I am back with Chief Justices original point.
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3257.057,3257.783,Oh!
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3278.683,3294.459,"Well how about if the employer says, You were talking to the Labor Board man last night and then this lady and says to him and oh, by the way, I am sure the business is going to lay you off, that is not protected?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3294.459,3306.594,"In Section 12 of the Act, Congress provides a criminal penalty for anyone interfering with Board processes or the performance of the duties of the Labor Board investigator or agent of any Board member."
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3313.734,3317.226,That is ample protection for the employee?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3317.226,3318.544,I think it would be.
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3332.816,3340.797,Is there much difference -- is there a lot different in the standard of proof under criminal prosecution in a hearing before and then allowed to (Inaudible)?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3340.797,3344.413,"Yes, there is obviously and --"
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3344.413,3348.255,Well why is this rule about the testimony for?
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3348.255,3349.668,"Well, it think it is --"
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3349.668,3356.008,"Because if you do not need the testimony provision, if you got the criminal provision?"
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3356.008,3370.218,"Congress says, provided -- I think Congress saw that an employee who appeared in open court against his employer when his employer was sitting there and listening to every word, cross-examining, the employer was present, I think that is what Congress meant to protect."
1971.70-267,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3370.218,3374.867,(Inaudible) wholly wasn't the case.
1971.70-267,1,21043,donald_w_jones,,3374.867,3382.226,"Well, if the employee had given testimony, he is protected for against any discrimination for that testimony once the employer heard."
1971.70-267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3470.976,3473.363,I think we have your points counsel.
