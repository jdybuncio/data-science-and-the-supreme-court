1974.73-2000,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.347,"We'll hear arguments next this morning in number 73-2000, United States against James Robert Peltier."
1974.73-2000,0,45815,william_l_patton,,44.378,47.277,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-2000,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,670.493,677.933,"That's-- for example, what other cases are there, if any?"
1974.73-2000,0,45815,william_l_patton,,677.933,683.68,"Other than Chevron, I don't think of any--"
1974.73-2000,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,683.68,684.929,"There aren't any, are there?"
1974.73-2000,0,45815,william_l_patton,,686.458,686.993,It was a civil case.
1974.73-2000,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,686.993,688.059,Involving him.
1974.73-2000,0,45815,william_l_patton,,688.059,697.326,"But in Linkletter, Mr. Justice Stewart, this Court indicated that it saw no difference between civil and criminal cases for purposes of retroactivity."
1974.73-2000,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.436,718.985,This issue was brought this Court a few many years ago in Carroll against the United States.
1974.73-2000,0,45815,william_l_patton,,718.985,721.222,"Well, we disagree about that, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-2000,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,902.756,906.192,Mr. Shapery.
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,906.192,912.28,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.696,965.014,Do you think the statute authorizes-- authorized the search and escape?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,965.014,971.42,I don't feel that any statutes of the United States are greater than the constitution.
1974.73-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.42,976.282,"That isn't what I asked you, is it?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,976.282,979.748,I-- could you possibly rephrase the question?
1974.73-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.306,989.849,I asked you whether a statute authorized the-- purported to authorize the search in this case.
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,989.849,995.036,"Read literally, the statute would purportedly authorize the search."
1974.73-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.036,999.368,Had it ever been held unconstitutional before Almeida?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,999.368,1001.91,I don't believe that the issue had even been presented in this Court.
1974.73-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.91,1012.714,"Let's assume a statute, in so many words, authorizes a particular kind of search, and the officers who had been operating under and performing in accordance with its terms."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1020.909,1038.53,"I think, to determine the retroactivity issue in that context, we should look at the statute itself, and whether or not the reliance on the literal interpretation of the statute was even reasonable and I feel that looking at this statute, 1357 Section a (1) and a (2)."
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1038.53,1041.762,"I don't think it was even reasonable, although the Courts of Appeals said it was."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1041.762,1042.694,I don't think it was.
1974.73-2000,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1056.627,1066.376,"Are you suggesting that one of the border patrol officers reading the statute should have known that on its face, it was unconstitutional?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1066.376,1094.05,"No, I am suggesting that the attorneys that wrote the statute for the government were perfectly aware of the problem and, where aware of it, they were treading on, so to speak, thin ice in regard to this but saw this was a viable alternative and that they may step forward and take their chances until the question is presented to this Court."
1974.73-2000,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1496.738,1497.915,Are you sure about that?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1502.41,1510.441,"It was parallel to the border, but I believe it terminated in Calexico or Mexicali which is the twin border town."
1974.73-2000,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1510.441,1515.036,"It was an east-west road, Route 90, as I remember, that at no time was it closer to 20 miles to the border."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1527.371,1538.249,It was further stated in Almeida-Sanchez that this highway is often used bec-- by smugglers of contraband and illegal aliens because it did not have a checkpoint.
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1549.195,1550.887,Is this the Sunol Opera?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1550.887,1552.577,"No, this is the Temecula checkpoint."
1974.73-2000,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.577,1552.825,Temecula.
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1552.825,1557.744,It's approximately the same location from the border but another major highway.
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.744,1559.657,"Yes, Temecula is inland from Sunol."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1559.657,1560.424,"Yes, it is."
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1582.19,1585.839,"What are you talking about, the second largest city in--"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1585.839,1586.287,San Diego.
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.287,1587.265,San Diego?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1587.265,1587.791,Right.
1974.73-2000,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.609,1620.43,"Mr. Peltier was, in fact-- he has a French name."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1625.653,1632.732,"Mr. Peltier is a United States citizen and he, as far as I know, had never even been to Mexico."
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.738,1652.96,"Of course, that's no guarantee that he might not have aliens in the backseat."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1652.96,1659.781,"That is true, but there is no guarantee that any person, any citizen in this-- in San Diego might not be having aliens behind the backseat."
1974.73-2000,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1659.781,1668.565,"And, in this case, there was no showing of any kind that either he or his car had ever either been to Mexico or had aliens in it."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1668.565,1675.212,"None whatsoever and, in fact, that is another distinguishing factor between Almeida-Sanchez and Peltier."
1974.73-2000,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1713.225,1720.097,Does the record show in this case the point of origin of the marijuana that he was carrying in his car?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1720.097,1724.502,"No, it does not."
1974.73-2000,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1724.502,1734.57,"Mr. Shapery, what do you perceive to be the principal purpose of the exclusionary rule?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1734.57,1753.79,"The principal purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful governmental conduct and, at the same time, insulate the Court system and maintain the integrity of the judicial system in determining its decisions."
1974.73-2000,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1753.79,1764.055,"I think, in Calandra, we said that the principal purpose of that rule was to deter future police misconduct."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1769.026,1783.398,"I think it would be relevant to that, in as much as-- I believe the conduct in this situation was one unreasonable in light of the fact that the statute had always required-- all the statutes have required probable cause."
1974.73-2000,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1805.142,1826.429,"But do you think that where there is a statute enacted by the Congress that, I think you conceded earlier, authorized this type of stop and search should be rejected by policemen on their own initiative before this Court decides it's unconstitutional?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1826.429,1840.962,"I feel that Congress has always recognized the Fourth Amendment, in that in passing this legislation they did not intend to completely abrogate the Fourth Amendment in this particular statute, as is shown in Section a (1) and a (2)."
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1856.602,1862.521,Are you suggesting the statute requires probable cause for a search at the border?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1862.521,1863.551,"No, I'm not."
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1864.165,1868.47,"Well, it's the same section that authorizes it."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1868.47,1870.203,I think there's a distinction that it's been--
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1870.203,1874.145,"It's the same section, isn't it?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1874.145,1880.053,I believe it refers to a search at the border of functional equivalent.
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1880.053,1884.945,"Well, it refers to a search with-- at the border or reasonable distance from the border."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1884.945,1886.007,"That is correct, but I meant--"
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1886.007,1895.949,"So, it's the same statute that authorizes these-- the examination at the border or authorizes an examination at a reasonable distance from the border."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1899.552,1904.003,I'm suggesting that the statute requires recognition of the Fourth Amendment.
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1904.855,1907.617,What about probable cause at the border?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1907.617,1921.031,I feel that the probable cause issue at the border is not brought up in as much as the government has a need to prepa-- protect the integrity of the entire country.
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1921.031,1932.478,"But the statute, on its face, purports to authorize the same kind of a search a reasonable distance from the border as it does at the border as you, I thought, indicated earlier in our conversation."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1932.478,1933.642,That is correct.
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1933.642,1950.315,"And, so that the border patrol officer does have or did have some thought that the statute authorized a warrantless and non-probable cause searches, although not particularly-- not exactly at the border."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1952.496,1959.063,I believe the statute was enacted in 1946 and then amended in 1952.
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1967.555,1970.551,But the point may be that it isn't a functional equivalent?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1970.551,1972.364,I believe that is the case.
1974.73-2000,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1972.364,1979.168,"That's another matter, but this-- if it were, it wouldn't have to have probable cause."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1979.168,1981.459,That is correct.
1974.73-2000,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1981.459,1993.842,Doesn't it come down with the proposition that you're saying that the officer should have known and been able to predict the ultimate outcome of the Almeida-Sanchez case?
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,1993.842,1994.924,I don't think that's the case.
1974.73-2000,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1995.103,2001.581,In terms of the deterrence that Mr. Justice Powell was asking you about.
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2001.581,2006.073,I think the point should not have been left up to the individual officer as such.
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.9,2136.209,"Well, what if they stopped him because he spoke Spanish?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2136.209,2140.523,I don't feel that they could tell that he spoke Spanish until they did stop.
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.523,2144.56,"Well, I didn't ask you whether they had in fact stopped him because he spoke Spanish."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2149.224,2160.074,"I have a little problem with the analogy because I couldn't understand how they would know that he spoke Spanish until they made the stop and, at that point, violated his constitutional right through this invidious discrimination."
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.074,2174.22,"Well, do you feel that speaking-- stopping a person for speaking Spanish is of the same order, and your apparent scale of values is stopping a person because he appear to be of Mexican descent?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2174.22,2197.65,"I think that the Courts have held that discrimination based upon apparent national origin is invidious discrimination and because a person speaks Spanish is justification for the stop, I feel that that is just one step away from Mexican descent and is just another justification for this invidious discrimination."
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2197.65,2213.926,"Well, isn't the job of the border patrol to figure out who are illegal aliens from Mexico and who are people either lawfully admitted aliens or United States citizens that they don't have any business with?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2213.926,2222.707,I believe that the decision in Almeida-Sanchez has established that the border patrolman cannot do this without probable cause.
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2222.707,2225.628,"Well, what I'm trying to get at, what are the elements of probable cause?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2233.254,2250.727,"I think that the Ninth Circuit has established that a person's national origin or his ancestry must remain a neutral factor and not be considered by the Court, as it would raise an issue of invidious discrimination."
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.727,2255.116,"Even if he is stopped at the border, they can't ask him his national ancestry?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2255.116,2259.332,"No, being stopped at the border I think is a-- quite a different matter, as I've stated--"
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.332,2264.573,"Well, I should think it would be as invidious there as it would be any place else."
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2264.573,2278.889,"Now, the government has a need and the public has an interest in maintaining the integrity of the country, in that integrity is maintained through controlling what is coming into the country."
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2288.942,2291.733,"Well, would it be invidious at the border?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2291.733,2292.706,I don't think so.
1974.73-2000,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2292.706,2296.509,"But it would be, say, 10 miles inland?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2296.509,2305.494,"If they had no reason to believe that this person had crossed the border, I would think so."
1974.73-2000,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2305.494,2310.399,"Well, then the same answer you would give if it were 1 mile north of the border?"
1974.73-2000,1,42063,sandor_w_shapery,,2310.399,2319.81,"I think that the proximity to the border has a lot to do with the reasonableness, using the reasonableness standard that's set out in the dissent."
1974.73-2000,2,45815,william_l_patton,,2543.579,2548.549,"Mr. Chief Justice, I just like to make a few quick remarks."
1974.73-2000,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2649.557,2657.608,"Well, why isn't he entitled to defend the decision below on any ground that doesn't expand his relief?"
1974.73-2000,2,45815,william_l_patton,,2657.608,2668.505,"Well, he would-- ordinarily, this Court would not consider an issue that was not raised."
1974.73-2000,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.505,2669.529,"Well, we would."
1974.73-2000,2,45815,william_l_patton,,2679.473,2680.355,Well--
1974.73-2000,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.355,2684.09,If he doesn't try to expand his judgment.
1974.73-2000,2,45815,william_l_patton,,2684.09,2705.37,"Well, let me assume, Mr. Justice White, for the purpose of argument that it can be raised now even so, as we've said, that under all the decisions in the Ninth, Tenth, and Fifth Circuits there is simply nothing to decline that the search was unreasonable under prior law, prior to Almeida-Sanchez."
1974.73-2000,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.37,2707.321,Could I ask you a question.
1974.73-2000,2,45815,william_l_patton,,2720.349,2733.246,"Well, Mr. Justice White, at Temecula, where this search was conducted, we did operate a checkpoint there for a period in 1974 under an area warrant."
1974.73-2000,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2759.444,2760.984,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
