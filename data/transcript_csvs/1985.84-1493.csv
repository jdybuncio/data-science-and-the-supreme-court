1985.84-1493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,115.541,"Mr. Come, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,115.541,120.593,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1493,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,414.353,415.67,Another three to two decision?
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,415.67,420.34,"Yes, it was another three to two decision, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,717.818,735.53,"Mr. Come, may I inquire whether it's your view that the Board will similarly require vote by all employees if the union adopted some controversial change to its own constitution of by-laws?"
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,735.53,766.049,"--That... putting the question the other way, I believe the argument is made that an affiliation decision is like a--"
1985.84-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,766.049,770.869,"Well, without putting it another way, could you answer the question?"
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,770.869,773.405,"--I was attempting, Your Honor."
1985.84-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.472,803.674,Or dues increases?
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,803.674,814.696,"--Or dues increases, as this Court recognized in Brown and particularly in your dissenting opinion, Justice White, are things that--"
1985.84-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,814.696,815.898,It's still a dissent.
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,815.898,870.699,"--Well, I think that Justice O'Connor's opinion also recognized the point, are matters that the union can confine to union members, but when it comes to selecting the bargaining representative, that right is more absolute and the way you come out on this issue, and I must acknowledge that reasonable people can differ as to how you are going to come out here, and the question is not whether another answer would be reasonable or equally reasonable but whether the Board is reasonable in--"
1985.84-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.699,878.972,"But in the Board's calculations, this particular change is not one that requires a Board conducted election, is it?"
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,878.972,882.924,"--Well, the Board is saying that--"
1985.84-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.924,891.03,The Board is saying that if the union is going to hold an election it should let other people vote?
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,891.03,926.286,"--The Board is saying that if we are going to accept a union election for amending our certification, we want to be satisfied that it has been conducted with... pursuant to democratic principles that at least ensure that all of the affected employees have had a fair opportunity--"
1985.84-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,926.286,937.761,"This isn't one of the changes... this affiliation wouldn't, under the Board's criteria, wouldn't precipitate a new certification election?"
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,937.761,941.979,--It may--
1985.84-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.979,944.165,"Well, that isn't what the Board says."
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,944.165,944.715,--Well--
1985.84-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,944.715,947.199,They would be satisfied with a union election.
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,947.199,955.769,--I started to say that there are two requirements before the Board will amend a certification.
1985.84-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.532,1027.501,Through certification?
1985.84-1493,0,37027,nopton_j_come,,1027.501,1054.901,"Through certification, so that we're only at step one of what is a... the inquiry that the Board will make before it determines that it can use the short-cut procedure or whether it's got to go through the long procedure."
1985.84-1493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1093.426,1102.115,Mr. Hutcheson.
1985.84-1493,1,36025,mark_a_hutcheson,,1102.115,1107.353,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1139.205,1151.798,"Well, wouldn't it be more... perhaps more accurate, it would seem to me, to inquire whether the Boards basic rule applying to all such cases, if that's the situation, is irrational?"
1985.84-1493,1,36025,mark_a_hutcheson,,1151.798,1152.565,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1159.969,1164.19,This wasn't an ad hoc decision on the part of the Board.
1985.84-1493,1,36025,mark_a_hutcheson,,1164.19,1165.056,That's correct.
1985.84-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1165.056,1168.575,It was pursuant to a general policy applying across the board.
1985.84-1493,1,36025,mark_a_hutcheson,,1168.575,1175.763,"Yes, sir, and that policy has been upheld by both the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and a few months ago by the Seventh Circuit."
1985.84-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.763,1182.651,"But the... all Board lawmaking, they don't make it by regulation, do they?"
1985.84-1493,1,36025,mark_a_hutcheson,,1183.817,1185.201,More often than not--
1985.84-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.201,1188.888,--the evidence of their policy is this particular adjudication?
1985.84-1493,1,36025,mark_a_hutcheson,,1188.888,1208.949,"--Yes, Your Honor, but in this case again, back in 1975 when the affiliation election took place involving my client's employees, the Board had adjudicated the same rule in a case called Jasper Section Company and the Board... and the union in that case, the union back in 1978 in this case knew it."
1985.84-1493,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1208.949,1212.586,"Jasper was a change in the Board decision, wasn't it?"
1985.84-1493,1,36025,mark_a_hutcheson,,1212.586,1213.27,Yes.
1985.84-1493,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1213.27,1220.49,How long had it followed a different policy before Jasper?
1985.84-1493,1,36025,mark_a_hutcheson,,1220.49,1231.132,"The Court first took a look at the so-called due process, or we would prefer to call it, the employee consent issue, back in 1963."
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,1741.234,1749.673,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2025.552,2033.908,"Well, you say, Mr. Gold, you're saying what the system is and intimating that what the Board has done now is contrary to what the system is."
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2038.876,2050.751,"No, I don't agree that any of the points about the system that I've stated evolved by Board decision."
1985.84-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.049,2077.834,--What about the contract bar rule?
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2077.834,2095.946,"Well, that is Board evolved, and there is no question here, either concerning a rule the Board has issued or in this particular case, about the contract bar."
1985.84-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.636,2105.902,"Well, let me ask you this."
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2105.902,2106.102,Yes.
1985.84-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2106.102,2126.664,"I have a feeling from reading the opinion of the majority of the court of appeals that they were saying, this is not rational because there are other Board decisions that cut the other way, and to me that doesn't make such sense because the Board can always modify, and if you're just talking about modifying one Board decision by another it's hard to say that it's irrational."
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2128.781,2134.185,"No, I don't believe that that is the test of irrationality."
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.462,2206.432,"Mr. Gold, you have to show, don't you, that this rule is contrary to the Act?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2206.432,2214.372,I think I have to show one of two things as I understand the law in this Court.
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.048,2232.75,"So, your submission is not that this is contrary to the Act?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2232.75,2233.267,--It's both.
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.267,2234.134,It is?
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2237.801,2238.703,Yes.
1985.84-1493,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2554.937,2573.998,"--On that point, Mr. Gold, the Board has to decide basically how broadly to define a particular bargaining unit, for instance whether craft and unskilled workers are involved, and that's a Board decision."
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2586.19,2587.492,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1985.84-1493,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2587.492,2590.86,That isn't expressly authorized in the statute.
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2592.729,2604.703,That is part of... the Board has taken that action as part of its method for running representation elections.
1985.84-1493,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2612.79,0.0,"Well, can it make the same argument here, that's part of our overall assistance in deciding whether to call a recertification election?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2623.248,2627.466,I don't believe so.
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2808.016,2818.789,"Mr. Gold, in practical terms what the union came to the Board for was to change its name, change the name of the certified union, and the Board said, no, we won't."
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2820.424,2823.526,"--That was the form of it, but it was against a--"
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.526,2827.495,"Yes, they said, unless you have an election we won't change your name?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2834.132,2835.518,--It can.
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.518,2836.851,On the certification?
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2836.851,2855.081,"It can, and in many cases, and this is why I say, the practical issue here is whether the Board can go outside its statutory jurisdiction and give the employer a basis of refusing to bargain."
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.981,2867.072,"I know, but the employer... did the Board say they won't change their name and therefore said that the employer doesn't have to bargain?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2867.072,2867.539,--Yes.
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.874,2877.261,"But if the union comes to them and says, look, we're the same old union, here's our name, now bargain with us."
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2879.03,2882.399,--Not under the present Board rule.
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2882.399,2886.366,"Because, as a legal matter you are now part of a larger unit?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2886.366,2897.241,"Yes, because the Board says that even though being part of a larger unit doesn't change you, the employer can say,"
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.241,2901.86,"So, what's involved here is a duty to bargain issue?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2901.86,2903.228,"Yes, absolutely."
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.501,2949.543,"In this case the Board has not said that, the result of this is, if you don't hold your own election we will?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2949.543,2950.376,--Correct.
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.495,2955.447,And it just says that the employer just needn't bargain?
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2955.447,2955.98,Correct.
1985.84-1493,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2958.482,2967.771,"And it's your position, if I understand you correctly, is that when the paper is filed saying, I want to change our name, it's at that point the Board should make the continuity determination?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2967.771,2968.604,--Yes.
1985.84-1493,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.604,2972.29,That which would then determine whether or not to hold a decertification election?
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2972.29,2974.658,It would determine--
1985.84-1493,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.658,2976.444,Either it is or it is not the same organization?
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2976.444,2977.094,--Yes.
1985.84-1493,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2983.013,2990.953,"Well, suppose they decide there's really more than a name change here, it's a fundamental change, it's too important to just approve, then what do they do?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,2995.238,3026.273,"--No, they would simply at that point dismiss the union's request to amend the certification, but under the law at that point the employer would know that he can say, you are a new organization, you have never received a vote from the entire unit making you the exclusive representative and therefore I don't have to deal."
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3026.273,3029.911,"So, then the union would have to petition for an election?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3029.911,3049.206,"That's right, and putting aside the question that I was discussing with Justice O'Connor, whether the Board can say that any old change destroys the effect of this first election, at least that way we would be within the statutory framework."
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.014,3301.821,I suppose that you must argue then that... suppose the union held this kind of an election and the majority voted against the affiliation.
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3316.331,3317.164,That's correct.
1985.84-1493,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3327.037,3336.293,"Yes, exactly, but as long as it says that this affiliation isn't really very fundamental, not in itself enough to hold an election?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3336.293,3337.995,That's correct.
1985.84-1493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3337.995,3349.069,"I guess for the same reason, Mr. Gold, you'd argue that this certainly doesn't fall within the category of a change to adapt to changing patterns of industrial life?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3349.069,3349.335,No.
1985.84-1493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3373.533,3382.722,"Incidentally, Mr. Gold, may come unions change affiliation as they attempted here, without any vote of their membership?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3382.722,3384.172,"Yes, there are many unions--"
1985.84-1493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3384.172,3388.543,"Well, does that require a constitutional provision in the union constitution?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3388.543,3389.393,--Yes.
1985.84-1493,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3418.145,3420.764,"So, this is by action of the Board of Trustees of the union?"
1985.84-1493,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3420.764,3425.132,"--Right, but only after the membership has agreed in the constitution."
1985.84-1493,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3428.668,3432.37,Mr. Come.
1985.84-1493,3,37027,nopton_j_come,,3432.37,3466.591,"The inconsistency that Mr. Gold has posed is illusory in the sense that as I pointed out earlier, the Board has not made a continuity determination in this case yet."
1985.84-1493,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3646.825,3647.575,"Thank you, gentlemen."
