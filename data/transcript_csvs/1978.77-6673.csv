1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,60.552,We'll hear arguments next in Brown against Texas.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,61.755,71.371,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,71.371,74.942,We need six to proceed.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,74.942,167.965,I don't know the quorom was.
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,167.965,173.102,"Mr. Caballero, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready now."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,173.102,176.68,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.863,331.066,"Oh, it has the word awful."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,331.066,332.279,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,332.279,355.939,"Well if you assume that the Texas Courts understood what a lawful stop was and convicted this person, you would have thought that that as a initial matter, they thought to stop was a lawful and that therefore there was at least a voluntary stop."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,355.939,364.008,"I think Your Honor that if you use the word lawful in a statute such as this, you can I suppose read in all kinds of standards."
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,367.406,368.696,"Oh, that's a vagueness argument?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,368.696,369.677,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.677,381.27,That's a vague -- you're making a vagueness argument but you were just making a statement that the Texas statute didn't have any standard in a -- different from the Michigan --
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,381.27,388.018,"What I'm saying is simply by reading unlawful, there's nothing to tell you whether it must be criminal activity for example."
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.31,403.113,Well then you -- you do are suggesting that neither the Texas legislature nor the Texas Courts knew what lawful meant?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,403.113,406.044,I'm suggesting they probably didn't consider it carefully enough Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,494.801,496.675,"Well, the answer to that is clearly a yes."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,496.84,498.135,I agree with you Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,501.536,503.062,It takes -- the police officer can.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,503.062,503.617,It is correct.
1978.77-6673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.77,508.509,"Well, at least those rights."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,508.509,513.263,Up to a point Your Honor where it becomes harassment or where you're --
1978.77-6673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.263,515.581,But to inquire what is your name?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,515.581,527.511,"Simply that point, for example, if I'm arguing the case up here and the police officer came up to me right now and asked me what is my name, I don't know if that would be a reasonable type of inquiry Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,528.525,531.07,"But Mr. Brown wasn't arguing a case here, was he?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,531.07,531.97,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.565,561.22,"Oh, Terry against Ohio said the same thing, didn't it?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,561.22,562.24,I believe it did Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,586.113,605.081,"Is this -- for hypothetical purposes, out of the criminal area and say that a police car called to an automobile collision and there are a number of people around."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,617.813,619.604,"Well, Your Honor I'm not suggesting that."
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,619.961,620.264,No?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,620.264,624.441,"-- with this case, it is not limited to civil or criminal incidents."
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,639.785,654.992,"Well then just to take one step at a time, the First Amendment is no barrier to a statute requiring a person to identify himself to a police officer at high noon with no criminal activity going on."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,654.992,658.71,"Your Honor, the statutes that I'm talking about does not make you identify yourself."
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,692.565,698.791,But then if you refuse to do that before the magistrate in this hypothetical situation then what?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,698.791,701.059,Then he places you under material witness bond.
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,706.886,713.224,May I suggest to you that that pretty well washes out the First Amendment arguments you're making.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,713.224,717.074,"Well, let me talk about the First Amendment then Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.347,783.691,"Wasn't that decided at least in part, to -- on the theory, the freedom to assemble and petition for redress of grievances?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,783.691,784.638,In NWACP?
1978.77-6673,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,784.638,785.292,Yes.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,785.292,787.356,They spoke more broadly than that Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,807.254,815.075,"Here, your client I take it wasn't engaged in any comparable activity to that -- in NWACP versus Alabama."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,815.075,815.502,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,845.163,847.476,"Yes, but that draw off from freedom of speech?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,847.476,849.751,I believe you just said it was protected activity.
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.297,855.805,"Oh, your man here is arrested for -- not what for what he said but for what he didn't say."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,855.805,858.687,"Well, he did say something Your Honor and he did pretty much the same --"
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,858.687,860.086,And he was arrested for that.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,860.086,860.303,Pardon me Your Honor?
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,860.303,862.682,Was he arrested for what he did say?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,862.682,864.93,They didn't -- he was arrested for what he did not say.
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,864.93,865.889,"Yes, that's --"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,865.889,866.271,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,866.271,866.939,But the fact was --
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,866.939,876.552,But he did say something and that was that he protested the right and reason of the officers to detain him under the circumstances in this case.
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.903,915.246,Now when is -- somebody is supposed to know when there is probable cause to arrest?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,915.246,918.965,"You're not -- you don't -- you're simply arrested, that's a fact."
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,925.468,926.315,"Well, let me ask you."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,941.634,942.047,Alright sir.
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.657,945.553,"Well, could you or not?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,945.553,947.188,"No, I don't think you can Your Honor because he's still protected activity."
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.188,948.585,Because it will be vague?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,948.97,949.015,No.
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.015,949.776,-- will be vague?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,949.776,950.121,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.623,994.012,"Mr. Caballero, could I just ask this, you didn't challenge the lawfulness of the stop in this case, did you?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,994.012,995.96,"By following the motions to suppressed, I did not."
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.534,1003.408,So that the lawfulness then we assume?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1003.408,1012.079,"I think that my client's activity, let's say in this case if they did have probable cost to stop my client, I could still challenge the statute."
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.435,1023.99,"Well, you didn't challenge it."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1023.99,1026.357,I did Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1045.185,1054.396,"Well, you go on and say I am assuming the state here through its police officers had some reason to make an initial stop."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1054.396,1055.704,"That's great, that point I didn't know Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.784,1069.049,"Well, let's go up a step further, what about after the trial?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1072.826,1074.566,"Your Honor, I have all -- no I did not."
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.159,1078.91,"Well, I understand that its face is bad but --"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1078.91,1079.598,"No, I --"
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1079.598,1086.253,What do we do with your argument if we should view the -- there's no element of dangerousness in the situation as I remember the fact.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1086.253,1086.899,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.899,1089.992,What if our view would be that this did not come within Terry?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1091.647,1111.553,"The reason I have attacked it on its face Your Honor, I can see -- I can -- eye to eye, my position before this Court, this is the same kind of case as See versus Seattle and Camara versus Municipal Court of San Francisco and that is in those cases they're attempting to make criminal a person's implication of his rights under the Fourth Amendment."
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.743,1133.17,I'm not sure you answered my question but maybe that's --
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1133.17,1133.911,Well --
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1133.911,1137.701,Does it make any difference when we in fact view the stop is lawful or not?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1137.701,1138.266,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.399,1138.625,You mean --
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1138.625,1139.715,-- you're looking at the state statute --
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.715,1143.987,"So you concede -- for the purpose of our decision you concede it's a lawful stop, is what you're saying?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1143.987,1150.033,"This case here may have been a valid stop, may -- you can assume that it was."
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1152.396,1165.324,And then you'd also -- can assume for first a decision that every judge who has to read this statute would know what the Terry standard is and what limit the application of the statute to those cases which followed in the Terry standard.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1166.825,1169.138,You would have to assume that but for purposes of --
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.138,1171.029,Then it doesn't seem very vague anymore --
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1171.029,1171.123,For purpose --
1978.77-6673,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.123,1174.764,For that part of the vagueness whether we didn't really know whether they limit it to Terry stops or not.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1174.764,1182.103,"Well, my understanding of the term vagueness Mr. Justice Stevens is a person reading the statute would be able to tell whether his conduct was criminal or not."
1978.77-6673,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1194.133,1199.197,May I come back to the question you've just been discussing?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1274.26,1284.713,"In this case, if you were to -- if I were to -- had said my conducts -- the conduct of my client in this case was protected, it was not criminal, that would be correct Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1290.048,1305.982,"Well, I understand that perhaps but why do you have to get to the constitutional issue if an element of the statutory offense is by concession absent?"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1307.667,1315.121,"You don't have to get to the constitutional issue or you can simply, the court below could have entered a judgment of acquittal and I suppose this Court --"
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.121,1320.505,"No, we have to have some constitutional basis for setting aside the state conviction."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1326.41,1326.805,"Well, then that's the --"
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1326.805,1332.176,"And are you suggesting that there wouldn't -- that it was without any evidence and whatsoever, is that it --"
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1332.176,1332.599,I'm not to be just--
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.599,1334.105,-- or to be a Fourth Amendment or what?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1334.105,1343.335,"Your Honor, the constitutional grounds would be basically Fourteenth from the due process which would also bring in the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments."
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.716,1368.593,"But I'm -- I take it that whatever level of suspicion there might have been in this case, in the state courts have apparently said it under the statute it's enough and so that poses at least the constitutionality of the statute as applied."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1368.593,1369.051,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.831,1390.617,"Well, on its face Mr. Caballero I know -- in your index of authority, its in front of your brief, the only Texas case you cite is one saying that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction only where the fine level is over $100.00 and it very likely is not your fault that you can't get to a higher Texas Appellate Court."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1397.098,1399.531,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.065,1423.182,"There have been -- Mr. Caballero, it's because you brought it here."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1423.182,1425.402,"Well, Your Honor I was only just defending my client."
1978.77-6673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.402,1426.868,Exactly.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1426.868,1434.834,"The only thing I can say is that at that point, the prosecutors are simply not interested in prosecuting someone for the mere refusal to give his name."
1978.77-6673,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1453.615,1458.915,And unless you get a fine of over $100.00 you will never get a case to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals under this case --
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1458.915,1460.855,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1460.855,1468.338,"Now, somewhere in your observations you said that the police officer gave no explanation except that he wanted his name."
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1490.939,1492.78,He gave that explanation Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1505.352,1510.235,You're going to a legal argument which is your privilege.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1533.697,1535.166,That's -- that was his submission --
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1535.166,1537.914,-- (Voice Overlap) of frivolous or whimsical idea.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1537.914,1548.486,"If that were the case though Your Honor, I would imagine that he wanted to stop the other party to the drug transaction and also ask him a question or two which they never did."
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1562.261,1564.896,Is there any evidence what happened to other man?
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1564.896,1572.047,"The only thing in the record was, he was never stopped or questioned Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1572.047,1572.974,Very well Mr. Caballero.
1978.77-6673,0,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,1572.974,1575.167,Thank you.
1978.77-6673,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1575.167,1581.316,Mr. Hicks.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1581.316,1584.723,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-6673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.407,1682.193,"But what if the State of Texas passed a statute saying that every citizen when he left home during the day had to call the local police station, tell them he was leaving and where he was going or when he'd be back and made a vio -- made a pros -- a violation of that command or criminal offense punishable by a fine?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1682.193,1685.641,I don't see that that would be a First Amendment problem.
1978.77-6673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.188,1712.559,What is the general due process?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1712.559,1717.09,"Well, by that I meant the Fourteenth Amendment due process question."
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1731.658,1751.169,"To pursue Mr. Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical, under this kind of an ordinance the really only safe way that is -- this can avoid embarrassment at least is to carry some form of identification on him at all times, isn't that true?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1751.169,1752.269,I don't think that's so.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1752.269,1752.622,You don't think so?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1752.622,1767.404,This statute is different than many of the other statutes that are similar to this in that there is nothing on the face of the statute that says someone has to carry identification to support what they speak to the officer.
1978.77-6673,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1810.645,1830.577,"Well, counsel, I take it then you're suggesting that we should judge this case on the grounds that the validity of the statute on the grounds that the statute permits an officer to stop any person at any time regardless of the circumstances and ask his name and if the person refuses to arrest him."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1830.577,1831.077,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1835.705,1835.867,"Well, I'm --"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1835.867,1836.132,"Yes, but they --"
1978.77-6673,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1836.132,1844.408,"Well, I'm just asking though, I'll ask you then, is it a lawful stop to just stop any person indiscriminately and ask the name?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1844.408,1857.474,"Well it may not be an unlawful stop but I do think that the word lawful stop in this instance has -- carries with it a certain technical meaning, the Terry versus Ohio type of stop."
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1857.474,1862.761,But the Court in this case held that this was a lawful stop.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1864.867,1866.712,That was implicit in the judgment of conviction.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1866.864,1869.553,"And therefore that's the way we have to read the statute, isn't it?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1869.553,1871.055,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1871.195,1872.041,But why not?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1872.041,1873.52,"Well, for it -- there is --"
1978.77-6673,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1873.52,1875.561,I'm just trying to help you out.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1875.561,1877.476,I understand that.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1887.522,1892.225,It's the highest court in which we have any construction of this Texas Statute.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1892.225,1892.279,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1892.279,1896.659,And whereas my Brother Rehnquist suggest we're not likely to get it from any higher court.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1896.659,1897.985,"Well, it is possible to get it from the higher court."
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1897.985,1899.72,"It's possible, we haven't yet."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1899.72,1899.976,Correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.976,1912.789,And this is the sole construction of the statute we have that the stop by this policeman of this petitioner was a lawful stop or else there couldn't have been a conviction.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1912.789,1914.057,I think that's correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1914.057,1920.292,"And if you assume they knew what the law was, do you -- you would think it was at least a Terry stop, is that it?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1920.292,1922.907,That is my argument before this Court.
1978.77-6673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.923,1946.438,What if the El Paso County Court says lawfully stopped under the statute means lawful for purposes of federal constitutional laws as well as Texas law and I conclude this was a valid Terry stop.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1958.293,1968.633,"Well, I don't think that it's -- the issue of the lawful stop has constantly been pushed to the background by Mr. Brown or his counsel."
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.141,1984.335,Doesn't even have nothing.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1992.445,1992.947,I understand --
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.947,1996.479,But you don't think -- you say that issue wasn't presented in that.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1996.479,2007.061,"It was not -- it was covered by the fact that Mr. Brown's attorney said that he assumed that there was a lawful, there was a reason to stop."
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.061,2015.616,"Well, if he assumed that -- if he assumed the reason then one of the constitutionality passed on he didn't present the lawfulness of the stop."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2015.616,2018.284,That's my argument.
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2018.284,2019.971,Can I just ask you a question on that?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2039.059,2040.5,I think that's very possible.
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.721,2042.422,No.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2064.291,2066.621,"Well, there is but there wasn't in this case."
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.621,2068.505,"Oh, there -- oh, I thought because they weren't involved."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2069.493,2074.375,"There can be an appeal because under a class -- in a class, say, misdemeanor there can be a fine over $100.00 --"
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.375,2075.283,"Oh, I see, if there had been a --"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2075.283,2076.199,-- up to $200.00.
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.262,2078.958,But in -- but the judgment here is not reviewable by any Court.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2078.958,2081.773,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.831,2104.377,But then isn't Mr. Brown's counsel -- don't we then have to assume as a matter of Texas law that the Texas Court which is the final court construing this statute has held it applies more broadly than Terry does.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2104.377,2108.664,Its -- there are two conclusions that -- two possible conclusions that could be drawn I think.
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.436,2135.824,"Are you -- are you conceding that, you say?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2135.824,2146.299,I'm saying that this Court very well might find that there was not a lawful stop in the Terry versus Ohio if it was independently reviewing the evidence and if the issue was clearly presented to them.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2149.959,2152.639,There's no indication in this case that it does.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2159.543,2166.248,"Well, again I think that the other -- there is another conclusion that can be drawn and that is that it was misapplied, the Terry Doctrine was misapplied."
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2166.248,2176.98,"Well, but you have no basis for submitting that this law requires at least in -- a justification equivalent to the Terry against Ohio --"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2176.98,2177.034,I -- I think --
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2177.034,2179.724,Isn't it -- no basis on this case for saying so?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2179.724,2202.782,"In this case, but in Texas statutes for instance in the Texas Code Construction Act which governs to the Texas Penal Code, there is provision in the Texas Code Construction Act which says that if terms of the statute have a technical or special meaning through some means such as a Court decision such as Terry versus Ohio -- doesn't specifically meets in Terry versus Ohio."
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2206.25,2214.237,"Well, Terry versus Ohio in that case the Court upheld what the police officer did."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2217.756,2219.758,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2219.758,2225.143,"It didn't say that he couldn't have done more or less, it just simply upheld what he did."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2230.017,2231.381,I'm not saying that that's the limit of what a police officer could ever do.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2231.381,2232.824,"Well, you just did."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2232.824,2233.106,No.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2249.455,2260.636,"Well, that's telling us that Terry against Ohio represents the limit of what a lawful stop would be, isn't it?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2260.636,2266.823,I don't think that that's a necessary conclusion from what I just said about this construction that would be given to the statute.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2279.0,2287.408,Is it your view that the Texas Courts concluded that there was a lawful stop here?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2287.408,2288.262,Yes.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2291.534,2294.057,"Otherwise he couldn't have convicted, could he?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2294.057,2295.034,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2295.034,2311.875,"Now, in reaching that conclusion, it's certainly a hornbook that the whole record is viewed by that judge, necessarily by us but by that -- the judge reaching that conclusion."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2344.941,2351.724,I believe that that is one of the factors on which the judge based his conclusion implicit in the judgment of conviction --
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2351.724,2356.204,Is that -- then is that decision reviewable here?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2356.204,2358.279,I don't believe it is Your Honor.
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.954,2447.851,But you are not contending here then that they -- that you can make a crime up to -- as to that a state could make it a crime to refuse to give your name whenever you're stopped for whatever reason or no reason.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2447.851,2451.403,I'm not contending that it can make it a crime.
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.25,2455.698,"Oh, I know."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2456.5,2458.739,-- to do that.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2458.739,2480.464,"Suppose there were no reference by the policeman in this record to the fact that he was observing two men in an alley, in a high drug area and that there was nothing in the record except that he just wanted to find out the man's name."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2488.106,2489.631,No.
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.483,2506.701,"Well, there would've been plenty of evidence to support a conviction refusing to give your name if he refused to give his name."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2506.701,2511.25,But the -- one of -- that is only one of several elements in the statute.
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.641,2517.978,There wouldn't be any evidence of a lawful stop.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2517.978,2518.591,That is correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2520.152,2520.456,But the -- did say --
1978.77-6673,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.456,2538.79,But the difficulty with your case is that we don't have an opinion from the Texas Court and so we don't know whether it's a question of interpretation of the state statute that maybe troublesome constitutionally or whether it's an evaluation of the evidence under a perfectly permissible interpretation of the state statute.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2538.79,2544.528,I -- I think that that is one of the main problems in this case.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2597.588,2598.006,Norwell against Cincinnati?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2598.006,2599.511,-- because of something that he had said.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2599.511,2600.109,"Cincinnati, not --"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2600.109,2601.101,"Cincinnati, I'm sorry."
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2601.101,2602.309,Yes.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2602.309,2611.484,It was because -- it was a First Amendment question because it -- the record reflected in that case that he was convicted for what he had said not for violation of the statute.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.178,2703.513,"But that presuppposes -- that presupposes that there is a valid obligation to answer the question, ""What is your name and identify yourself?"""
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2703.513,2706.064,"Well, I do believe that is a valid obligation and I don't --"
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2706.064,2708.937,"Well, is this statute makes it an obligation?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2708.937,2714.932,"Yes, and I'd -- as I say I believe it is a valid statute and the obligation is fair."
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.157,2730.007,If there's a reasonable suspiciousness doctrine.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2730.007,2731.146,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.146,2732.767,But if there is not?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2732.767,2737.13,If there is not reasonable suspicion I believe that is a different a case than this one.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2753.998,2754.517,"Well, that's --"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2754.517,2755.304,"Again, I don't believe that that's the issue before this Court."
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2755.304,2762.009,On the contrary I think -- what I understood you to answer a few minutes ago that you didn't think a state could validly do that?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2762.009,2763.215,I don't believe I said that.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2763.748,2765.451,"Well, I misunderstood you then."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2765.451,2767.14,I believe it may be possible.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2768.808,2771.382,But you're telling us that this statute doesn't go that far.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2771.382,2772.628,"Alright, that's correct."
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.628,2783.103,"Well, if we happen to think the issue of the lawfulness of the stop was properly here in the sense was there a Terry grounds for stopping?"
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2799.207,2800.383,That's right.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2800.383,2805.213,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2805.213,2815.2,"In Byers against California of course did require a man to identify himself but that was in relation to the driving of an automobile, wasn't it?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2815.2,2821.811,"That's correct, and it involved the Penal Statute but it did involve a situation where there had been an accident of some sort."
1978.77-6673,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2827.029,2835.831,"I take it there's a -- it's probably unlawful in Texas for an eyewitness to a murder to refuse to identify himself, I suppose."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2835.831,2836.471,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2848.128,2850.043,We'll resume at 1 o'clock.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2850.043,2865.379,Thank you.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2865.379,2868.821,Have you completed your argument?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2868.821,2870.425,"Your Honor, I wish to have one more minute."
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2870.425,2875.633,"Alright, very well, you may resume then."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2875.633,2878.574,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-6673,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2993.935,2997.246,Of course the crime wasn't committed until after the question was asked?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2997.246,3001.162,"Well, that's true, this particular crime was not."
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.578,3028.712,"But Mr. Hicks, wasn't that because the person just generally on the scene wasn't necessarily in custody and Miranda starts when the person being questioned --"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3028.712,3029.509,"Well, that's true."
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3033.254,3034.501,That's what I was actually going to ask you.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3041.644,3043.241,I do not think so.
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3043.241,3043.56,But he is --
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3043.56,3046.535,He has been detained in the Fourth Amendment I agree.
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.406,3049.741,"If you arrest him, you say I place you under arrest, it would be --"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3049.741,3051.775,He is in custody when he's placed under arrest.
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3052.303,3058.345,But you say there's a distinction between a stop on reasonable suspicion for necessity warning and an informal arrest?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3058.345,3058.828,"Yes, correct."
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3062.094,3065.568,"When a man was stopped, is he free to move about at will when he's been stopped?"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3065.568,3066.344,I'm sorry I didn't hear the first part of the question.
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.344,3070.175,Is he free to move about when he's been stopped by the police?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3070.175,3071.347,"No, he is not."
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3075.865,3076.226,What's --
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3076.226,3076.652,The person is in --
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3076.652,3082.543,"What's the reason for a distinction in terms of Miranda, the reasons behind the Miranda rule, why would you draw that line, I wonder."
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3082.543,3100.131,"Well, again I'm relying on cases like the Rosco and Miranda and the situation in Oregon versus Mathieson where the Court -- Oregon versus Mathieson law situation where a person was under suspicion and had been asked to voluntarily come down to the police station."
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.581,3104.676,"He voluntarily came but you don't voluntarily agree to be stopped, that it's a --"
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3104.676,3109.719,"Correct, but he was in a policeman's office for two hours or so locked up in there."
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.719,3110.497,Voluntarily.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3110.497,3113.019,And this Court held that that no Miranda warnings were required.
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.019,3113.542,But isn't it --
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3113.542,3113.658,In that --
1978.77-6673,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.658,3117.016,-- my hypothesis isn't there -- isn't a Terry stop involuntary?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3118.466,3123.807,I -- I think there's no doubt that there's some element of involuntariness in it that the person is detained.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3128.933,3134.044,When you're certainly restrained if someone is searching you for weapons.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3134.044,3135.39,That's true.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3135.39,3143.045,But isn't the genesis of the voluntary concept that it's part of an investigation for a possible criminal activity?
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3143.045,3146.515,"Well, that -- that's the point I was making that the person -- the --"
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.515,3150.76,It isn't just to see whether the man has got a gun.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3165.329,3166.105,That's correct.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3172.305,3175.499,So that there is a -- there is an element of detention very clearly.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3175.499,3179.404,"Oh, I'm not arguing that there isn't under Terry in situation like this but it is not --"
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3179.404,3189.76,But it has never been thought in the -- it has never been suggested in any opinion that that detention or custody whatever it may be figures the Miranda warning.
1978.77-6673,1,39562,renea_hicks,,3189.76,3194.042,I've -- I'm not familiar with any suggestion that it would be applicable.
1978.77-6673,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3200.654,3201.634,Very well.
1978.77-6673,2,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,3204.241,3211.962,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-6673,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3274.082,3288.268,"But don't many statutes in fact do that, for instance, criminal test which statutes doesn't -- oh, unlawfully on the premises and -- it may be a question of considerable doubt in that particular case whether a person is or is not lawfully on the premises."
1978.77-6673,2,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,3288.268,3290.71,I agree with you sir.
1978.77-6673,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3415.258,3420.55,"Well, aren't you confusing probable cause with incriminating?"
1978.77-6673,2,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,3435.634,3437.336,Isn't that also incrimination?
1978.77-6673,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3513.593,3518.96,Well he did more than that. He verbally and negatively protested.
1978.77-6673,2,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,3521.884,3523.429,"Yes, we do Your Honor."
1978.77-6673,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3529.055,3537.822,"Yes, but he's being arrested for not speaking to with -- identifying himself."
1978.77-6673,2,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,3543.187,3544.629,Alright.
1978.77-6673,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3565.004,3568.239,"Well, of course it protects speech, that's the First Amendment."
1978.77-6673,2,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,3571.686,3572.727,"Alright, then you get closer to the --"
1978.77-6673,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3572.727,3578.519,What I'm saying is I think you have much stronger arguments on other amendments than you do on the First Amendment and I think you're spinning your wheels here.
1978.77-6673,2,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,3578.519,3591.264,"Well, the First Amendment claim I see is a very real problem not so -- aside from the Norwell case, the case of a person who wishes anonymously to protest goes to a meeting but doesn't want anyone to know that he is there."
1978.77-6673,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3592.602,3594.769,Do you want to pin your case in the First Amendment?
1978.77-6673,2,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,3594.769,3597.355,"I think it ought to be pinned on the First, Fourth, and Fifth."
1978.77-6673,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3606.766,3612.199,"But maybe one of the troubles of the case you have a shotgun approach you, then everything possible."
1978.77-6673,2,39022,raymond_c_caballero,,3612.199,3621.784,"Well, it may be a shotgun approach but I legitimately believe that the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments all protect the conduct in this case."
1978.77-6673,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3622.947,3623.677,Thank you gentlemen.
