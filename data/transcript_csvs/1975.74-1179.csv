1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.446,"We will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Miller, 74-1179."
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,15.551,19.169,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1179,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,166.051,172.835,"These subpoenas were issued at the behest of the agents of the Treasury Department, was it?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,172.835,174.196,"They were issued, yes."
1975.74-1179,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.198,181.72,This was --
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,181.72,184.91,Because this was non-tax-paid whiskey that had been discovered.
1975.74-1179,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,184.91,190.69,And is it the area of the Government that this was a criminal investigation or an income tax investigation?
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,190.69,205.96,"It was an investigation -- what they issued were subpoenas on behalf of the grand jury, a criminal investigation, a grand jury investigation and the subpoenas were issued out of the United States Attorney’s office."
1975.74-1179,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,227.067,231.254,"They were (Voice Overlap) agents though, Treasury Department Agents?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,231.254,242.212,"Who were -- yes, they were assisting, as FBI agents often assist the US attorney in the conduct of investigation on preparatory to grand jury proceedings."
1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,250.656,268.33,"Is there anything in the rule, Mr. Wallace that requires a member of the bar to request the subpoena, that is to physically receive it from the clerk or a member of the bar send a messenger for a grand jury subpoena?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,268.33,271.22,"The rule does not specify, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,271.22,273.277,But it does authorize the issuance?
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,273.277,274.229,Of the subpoenas to --
1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,274.229,275.921,To lawyers?
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,275.921,277.227,To attorneys.
1975.74-1179,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,302.143,309.681,"Mr. Wallace, (Inaudible)"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,309.681,312.161,"To issue a trial subpoena, yes."
1975.74-1179,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,312.263,315.449,"In the investigation, yes. (Inaudible)"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,315.449,318.209,That is the normal method used.
1975.74-1179,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,318.209,320.814,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,320.814,329.138,"The case may not go to the grand jury, but the idea is seeking information that can be presented to the grand jury."
1975.74-1179,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,336.698,343.574,"(Inaudible) this man, in this case, his lawyers want to dispute about that."
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,346.204,348.115,Not until proceedings have been brought.
1975.74-1179,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,348.115,350.426,If he does not reply you can invoke a --
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,350.426,356.42,"It does, it does at -- in its application to trial subpoenas, but not a --"
1975.74-1179,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,356.42,357.64,(Inaudible) proceed.
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,360.183,362.41,"Well, it is the grand jury subpoena."
1975.74-1179,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,366.102,367.843,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,367.843,369.553,"No, not anybody."
1975.74-1179,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,384.827,389.32,It dose not go to the grand jury unless he decides to?
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,389.32,390.267,"Well, that is correct."
1975.74-1179,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.61,409.864,Did the grand jury itself direct or asked the U.S. Attorney to subpoena a particular witness that it wanted to hear?
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,409.864,431.86,"It certainly could or it could issue a subpoena on its own, but in a situation like this one in particular where the grand jury is not in continuous session, in fact, it is infrequently, and this is a non-urban area and the grand jury sessions are infrequent and of short duration."
1975.74-1179,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.609,826.555,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,826.555,833.546,There was also a Fourth Amendment claim in Couch which the Court rejected and discussed.
1975.74-1179,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.41,962.865,"But what if the state law recognized such a privilege, would that have to be conclusive as to the disposition of a federal question such as this?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,962.865,986.969,I do not believe so Mr. Justice because whether such a privilege would be honored in the Federal Courts or with bar of the testimony of bank officials as to their transactions with an individual would be a question of Federal Law and the Federal Rules of evidence will of course bear on it.
1975.74-1179,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1030.128,1040.541,"Mr. Wallace, would you make the same answer if there were a contract between the bank and the customer that the bank would detest at the most?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1040.541,1042.482,The answer would be the same.
1975.74-1179,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1061.246,1068.099,"Mr. Wallace, was the customer of the bank notified in this case of the issuance of the subpoena?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1068.099,1074.607,He was not notified by either the United States Attorney or by the bank or by either bank?
1975.74-1179,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1074.607,1099.295,I suppose a bank could have got the policy of notifying customers whenever a customer’s record is subpoenaed and that I take it your position would be that the customer would have no standing to go into court at that point and attempt to enjoin the implementation of the subpoena and say on the ground that it was a fishing expedition or otherwise invalid?
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1099.295,1102.579,"No standing under the Fourth Amendment, Mr. Justice."
1975.74-1179,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.427,1131.813,Suppose the bank exposed the depositor (Inaudible)
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1131.813,1134.108,It was not required to do so.
1975.74-1179,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.125,1141.218,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1141.218,1151.253,Whether that kind of a contractual remedy would be a proper way of interfering with the execution of federal process is something that does not have to be reached in this case and I do not --
1975.74-1179,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.253,1154.756,"At least the depositor would have standing to do so, to raise the issue (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1154.756,1166.021,"He would have standing to bring such a suit, but he may not have a cause of action there."
1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1328.619,1348.14,"What case was it Mr. Wallace if you remember, within the last year or eighteen months in which Senate Committee in conducting an inquiry had subpoenaed bank records of an organization which it was investigating, that is they were investigating the organization and the sources of its --"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1348.14,1349.15,United Servicemen’s Fund against Eastland.
1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1349.15,1353.372,"Yes, I believe (Voice Overlap) you have not cited that, have you?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1354.799,1356.499,"Well, I do not recall whether we did have --"
1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1356.499,1360.521,"Well, do you think it has any bearing here?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1360.521,1363.992,It is not one of the cases most closely on point because it --
1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1363.992,1369.377,"Was there a standing issue of the organization, of the depositor there?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1369.377,1386.699,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but the case was primarily about the scope of the debate clause and it was a case which raised First Amendment claims rather than Fourth Amendment claims so it seemed to us not as --"
1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.699,1390.511,"Privacy issue would be common to both, would it not?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1399.74,1416.189,"Well, that would put in the context, that was their claim, but in the context of the First Amendment claim and here we are dealing with the Fourth Amendment claim which as I said earlier we do not equate with the claim of a right to privacy."
1975.74-1179,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.262,1435.968,"Mr. Wallace, can we go back to your standing argument for a minute."
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1443.923,1453.439,"Well, under Couch even if they were the respondent’s papers, if he had relinquished possession of them to the bank --"
1975.74-1179,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.439,1461.263,What I am -- would your argument be -- your standing argument be precisely the same regardless of who owned the papers?
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1461.263,1502.231,"Well, it just adds to the fact that there is no -- it is a sort of an a fortiori argument since the papers are not in the respondent's possession, in actual or constructive, there is no basis for asserting a possessory interest and Couch disposes of this claim on that ground alone, but we never took the position in Couch that Mrs. Couch could not be heard to assert the claim that she still had constructive possession over her records."
1975.74-1179,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1523.673,1532.409,"As was my Brother White pointed out earlier, Couch was a Fifth Amendment case, at least it was both a Fourth Amendment and a Fifth Amendment case?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1532.409,1533.623,"That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1975.74-1179,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1533.623,1540.048,And it might be resolved differently under the Fifth Amendment from (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1540.048,1541.655,They might well.
1975.74-1179,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1541.655,1546.387,"Since we rejected the Couch, the Fifth Amendment case, claim --"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1546.387,1551.186,"As well the Fourth Amendment claim, that was also rejected in Couch."
1975.74-1179,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.186,1567.32,"But the Fourth Amendment claim in Couch considered the nature of the records, the deal not just ownership or possession and indicated that these papers were not private papers anyway?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1567.32,1568.36,That is correct.
1975.74-1179,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.36,1570.529,Even if you owned them?
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1570.529,1570.864,That is correct.
1975.74-1179,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1570.952,1576.682,"And that is somewhat a different approach, some rigid rule about not having possession or ownership?"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1576.682,1600.022,"Well, because in that case they were the complainant’s records, there was ownership and we have in our brief analogized to those considerations in Couch by pointing out that the checks here are cast upon a sea of commerce over which the respondent has no control."
1975.74-1179,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1607.499,1611.523,"Mr. Wallace, when you say that, that does not apply to deposits or --"
1975.74-1179,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1611.523,1611.769,No.
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1649.361,1649.859,Thank you sir.
1975.74-1179,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1650.293,1651.221,Mr. Rampey.
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1651.221,1653.084,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1179,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1718.862,1728.893,Is it your point that it makes some difference whether the United States Attorney did it personally or it was an FBI Agent or a United States Marshal or one of his secretaries?
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1728.893,1737.977,"Your Honor, I think Rule 17 is cast in terms of a party requesting a subpoena in blank and it being used in that matter."
1975.74-1179,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1782.389,1785.445,"Is this agent, a part of the United States Government?"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1785.445,1788.746,"Yes sir, he is an Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agent and a --"
1975.74-1179,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1788.746,1792.301,"So is the United States Attorney an agent of the United States Government, is it not?"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1792.301,1794.891,"Yes sir, but I do not think the agent is necessarily."
1975.74-1179,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.167,1833.712,"Mr. Rampey, would you say your client’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated if the Government lawyer had written a letter to the bank and said, please turn over the following documents and if you do not turn them over voluntarily, we will get a grand jury subpoena and the bank had responded to the letter by doing just what it did here?"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1833.712,1860.577,"I think they still would have been, yes sir, I do because I do not think a depositor, I think that a depositor has even under this Court’s rulings and more recently the Supreme Court of California has ruled under their Constitutional Provisions that a bank depositor has a reasonable expectation of privacy under their equivalent of the Fourth Amendment to the sanctity of those documents."
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.577,1865.169,(Inaudible) the action against the Government or the bank?
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1865.169,1875.238,"There are some cases cited in my brief Mr. Justice, where a right of action and contract is available."
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.602,1889.308,"Well, is it the right time to move along voluntarily?"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1900.867,1903.532,Not if he does it on his own without any Governmental --
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.532,1904.938,That is what I said?
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1904.938,1906.214,"Yes sir, that is true."
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1906.214,1908.657,It is not about the Fourth Amendment?
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1908.657,1911.236,"That is true, but there is no Governmental --"
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1911.236,1916.321,"Well, now, what he did not dream (Inaudible) does not pursuant to subpoena?"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1916.321,1922.103,Our point is that these subpoenas number one were invalid as a process of a grand --
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1922.103,1926.636,"(Voice Overlap) standing now, not by the validity, not by the standing?"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1926.636,1953.772,"Because if the Government intervenes to some extent in the procurement of these records and documents in which we content the depositor has a reasonable expectation of privacy that is justifiable, then this gives -- this is the same situation as where, for example a Secret Service Agent asked an airline employee to search a piece of baggage and he does so, I think this Court has ruled --"
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1953.772,1967.528,"As long as the alcohol, tax and beverage, whatever that guy is, goes to the man’s auditor and says I want to see this man’s records, would that be valid reason for --"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1967.528,1968.578,His accountant?
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1968.578,1972.655,Yes.
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1972.655,1973.024,But that is not --
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1973.024,1974.481,"You have a little trouble there, have you not?"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1974.481,1976.703,"Yes, I do your Honor, but that is not the case here."
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.322,1983.309,You think an accountant is less obliged to protect the secrecy than the bank?
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,1983.309,2000.268,"I think banks are more obliged to protect the secrecy in this instance because number one, the records are compelled to be kept by banks under the Bank Secrecy Act and number two, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy as to these records and documents."
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2006.496,2014.223,"Well, suppose it gives the Agent the exact check and not a copy?"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,2014.223,2016.286,The bank would have no right to do that.
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2016.286,2018.514,"Suppose they did, what would you do about it?"
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,2018.514,2021.81,The bank should be sued because they have no right to the check in the first place.
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.81,2025.013,Could U.S. Attorney’s Office use it?
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,2025.013,2028.863,They could if it were voluntarily handed over.
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2028.863,2032.09,And you do not think this was voluntary?
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,2041.025,2057.231,"But this Court has also held that, for example a landlord cannot go in on his own and allow the law enforcement officers to go in and search a house where a distillery is located."
1975.74-1179,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.231,2062.9,Is that the first day of the bank (Inaudible)
1975.74-1179,1,21456,d_l_rampey_jr,,2062.9,2063.08,But we are contending that --
1975.74-1179,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3240.951,3245.306,Just briefly Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-1179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3326.484,3330.027,(Voice Overlap) standing argument please.
1975.74-1179,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3350.437,3353.086,I think it would be different.
1975.74-1179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3357.826,3367.782,"And so when you are talking about standing attack a subpoena, the question of ownership would not be relevant or is it might be relevant when you are talking about standing to raise a Fourth Amendment objection?"
1975.74-1179,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3367.782,3377.826,"Well, I think anyone who is unduly burdened by the need to comply with the subpoena has standing to complain about the subpoena."
1975.74-1179,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3377.826,3379.002,And no one else is your position?
1975.74-1179,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3379.002,3379.883,And no one else.
1975.74-1179,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3410.384,3418.305,"But even at the turn of the records, you might have quite a different question in the trial of a case when the motion is to exclude evidence?"
1975.74-1179,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3418.305,3419.65,It is a different question.
1975.74-1179,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3419.974,3423.6,It is a different question (Voice Overlap) different standard?
1975.74-1179,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3423.6,3424.61,That is correct.
1975.74-1179,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.61,3434.619,"Your standing argument sounds like, when we are just saying this -- what I really mean is there is no violation of the Fourth Amendment here with respect to the owner -- with respect to the depositor?"
1975.74-1179,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3434.619,3444.888,"Well, it is a different question, but the answer to the question has been that the Fourth Amendment in the context of seeking to exclude evidence does not protect just tertiary interest."
1975.74-1179,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3487.008,3487.843,Thank you gentlemen.
