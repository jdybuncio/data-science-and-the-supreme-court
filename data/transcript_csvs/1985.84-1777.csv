1985.84-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.184,We will hear arguments next in International Union v. Brock.
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,20.04,28.036,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.722,150.299,"Well, Ms. Berzon, you are speaking generally of what you call procedural issues."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,162.653,163.716,--No.
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.448,180.053,"Well, I don't know how you define subject matter jurisdiction, but at any rate, address yourself to the question I asked you."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,180.053,208.666,"--I think I am, and that is whether in fact there is review under federal question jurisdiction of federal questions concerning Trade Act benefits, or whether the Trade Act itself requires that all such questions be decided in state court, and our answer to that question is that what the Secretary of Labor keeps asserting, that there is something in the Trade Act that requires that the questions be decided in state court, there is simply no such provision."
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,297.474,303.457,"Yet, it is clear that any individual applicant who wants these benefits has to go through the state system."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,305.315,316.934,That is true unless and until the applicant wishes to challenge a federal policy directive which would govern the--
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.934,326.087,"--Yes, but he still has to go, to get the money amount of benefits that the statute provides, he has to go through the state system, doesn't he?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,326.087,349.672,"--In this instance, the relief did, for reasons related both to the fact that the UAW was the plaintiff and I think took proper regard for the state system and for the administration of the district court, decide only the single federal question and remand all claims back to the administrative system."
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.483,366.837,"Yes, but what you're saying is that these players can split off one issue in the question of whether they are determined to get benefits, all the other issues going through a state court, and have the federal court decide that by a declaratory judgment."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,366.837,369.18,--This is not a declaratory judgment.
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.335,371.553,"Well, okay."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,375.271,379.519,--Because the reason for that is that what we are challenging is not an action by the state.
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.709,463.688,"Well, do you... are you suggesting that the validity of the Secretary's directive just wasn't... that just wasn't an open issue in the administrative proceeding or in the state courts?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,463.688,473.387,"--I'm saying as a functional matter in the administrative proceeding it was not an open issue because the Secretary's own regulations, as exemplified by those extraordinary--"
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,473.387,475.604,"Well, that may be so, but what if you... you can get into the state court, can't you?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,475.604,477.869,--We could get into the state court.
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.869,488.99,And wouldn't... couldn't you say to the state court this administrative denial of benefits should be overturned because the Secretary's directive is invalid under the statute?
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,488.99,490.209,But there is no--
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,490.209,491.645,What... just answer.
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,491.645,491.895,--I'm sorry.
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.895,496.066,Would that be... would the state court entertain such a claim?
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,496.066,499.612,The state court would entertain such a claim at the same time--
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,499.612,505.734,"Well, why shouldn't you, why shouldn't you pursue your remedies through the state system, like 239 suggests you ought to?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,505.734,510.715,"--Because, because the statute does not say... our position is the statute does not say that we ought to."
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.026,518.259,"Well, that's your version of 239, I agree with you."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,518.259,519.868,I think the language is really quite clear.
1985.84-1777,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,550.824,565.568,"Ms. Berzon, may I ask what you think the district court had in mind by telling the litigants that the state courts then would reprocess the claims?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,571.863,572.472,"--No, not at all."
1985.84-1777,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,572.472,583.858,"--or are various defenses open, and do you envision that the Court had in mind then an application in individual cases of the requirements to obtain benefits?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,583.858,590.325,"Absolutely, that what the Court had in mind was that this issue was now to be decided in favor of the claimants."
1985.84-1777,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,590.325,593.01,With individualized adjudications.
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,593.01,594.9,"Exactly, and that's why we make the--"
1985.84-1777,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,594.9,600.819,And statutes of limitations being applicable and administrative procedure exhaustion and so forth and so on?
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,600.819,615.939,"--As to administrative exhaustion and to statute of limitations, in both cases, our basic position is that there is nothing about the joint litigation here that, the organizational representation that changes the rules that would otherwise be applicable."
1985.84-1777,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,617.22,622.076,So those defenses would be open in the individual adjudications?
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,622.076,662.217,"--With one comment, and that is that in this instance the Court of... the government expressly waived an exhaustion defense, and we would maintain that the district court's finding of futility is one that would have to be respected, for the circumstances that I outlined earlier with respect to what in fact happened here on exhaustion, and with respect to the statute of limitations, there was a waiver there as well because there was no affirmative defense pleaded in that regard."
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,677.07,690.924,"Well, what about those who had exhausted, if they went back after this judgment, Court of Appeals judgment, went back to the state system, might they be met with a res judicata defense?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,690.924,699.343,"--The only individuals to whom that is... with respect to whom that is the case, and which we agree is the case, are the very, very few individuals--"
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.343,701.56,"Well, anyway, they did... there are some who exhausted."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,701.56,703.154,"--Well, exhausted administrative remedies."
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,711.604,717.069,"Well, there are some states who apply res judicata to their administrative proceedings if you don't appeal."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,717.069,732.533,We would maintain that this case would have to be recognized as adequate to satisfy any appeal requirement if it were in fact applicable.
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.533,734.515,"Well, that is down the road, I suppose."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,734.515,741.123,"My very point, Justice White, is that it is down the road, and that what we have here is an extremely threshold issue."
1985.84-1777,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,778.075,793.46,"Ms. Berzon, are there cases you can point to on which a union has been granted associational standing when it challenged conditions that are not on-the-job conditions of employees?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,793.46,793.617,Yes.
1985.84-1777,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,816.248,830.79,"Well, but I think that conditions of safety on the job or health standards or discrimination are job, on-the-job conditions, and I'm curious how this fits in."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,843.065,863.48,"I think it would depend not on whether the name of the organization was union, but on what the organization, whatever it was called, defined as its own purposes, and in this case we have an explicit declaration of purpose in the UAW constitution, we have a long tradition of involvement with this particular program and with government benefits for unemployed people in general."
1985.84-1777,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,868.024,869.055,"Well, then, how about Food Stamps?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,873.522,890.218,"--I think it would depend on whether that could be construed as being within the purposes of that organization, as governed by its history and by its governing documents, and not by whether the name of the organization was union."
1985.84-1777,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1220.146,1221.474,--May I ask you question before you do?
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1231.128,1231.798,It did.
1985.84-1777,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1265.005,1281.263,"Well, if we thought that 239 was a jurisdictional bar to federal court jurisdiction, of course, concessions by the government or you or anybody else wouldn't matter, would it?"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1286.636,1311.048,"That's certainly true, but as I said before, I think there is no doubt that there is no jurisdictional bar to this case, and in particular, I note that this Court in cases such as Ohio Employment Security Division v. Hodory, New York Telephone Company v. New York Department of Labor, and a slew of other cases, both in this Court and lower courts, have in fact adjudicated state unemployment insurance cases."
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1329.432,1332.773,"Of course, Christian didn't raise the question at all of whether--"
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1332.773,1335.257,Christian did raise the question of whether there was federal court jurisdiction.
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.429,1341.379,"--Yes, but it didn't raise the question of whether this is a proper use of federal court jurisdiction."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1341.379,1352.812,"It seems to me that if this case is not governed by the language of Section 239(d), that it certainly is a proper use of federal court jurisdiction because it has been done repeatedly in--"
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1352.812,1361.84,"Well, we have a number of cases that say you can't use a declaratory judgment, you can't use an injunction every time there is federal court jurisdiction under 1331."
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1363.809,1366.323,--But--
1985.84-1777,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.323,1368.385,You can't split up a claim.
1985.84-1777,0,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,1368.385,1373.507,--In this instance it doesn't seem to us that we are splitting up a claim.
1985.84-1777,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1418.927,1419.567,Ms. Kuhl?
1985.84-1777,1,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1419.567,1422.847,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1777,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.403,1484.09,Wasn't Christian a mandamus?
1985.84-1777,1,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1484.09,1487.212,"That's another basis for distinguishing it, Justice White."
1985.84-1777,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1685.037,1695.347,"Well, Ms. Kuhl, are you suggesting that there is not a single member of the union who would have a potential claim of this kind--"
1985.84-1777,1,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1695.347,1696.752,That's correct.
1985.84-1777,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1697.783,1698.08,--that would be valid?
1985.84-1777,1,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1698.08,1699.297,I'm sorry?
1985.84-1777,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1699.297,1714.854,"It just seemed to me that that was a rather extreme position to take, and that surely there were some members of the union who themselves individually would still have a valid claim to make--"
1985.84-1777,1,19351,carolyn_b_kuhl,,1714.854,1715.385,Well--
1985.84-1777,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3233.444,3233.725,"Yes, I do."
1985.84-1777,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3411.466,3416.106,"Well, they could seek certiorari here from an adverse decision of the highest court in the state."
1985.84-1777,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3416.106,3417.714,"--They certainly could, they certainly could, but there is--"
1985.84-1777,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3417.714,3428.304,"Well, are you suggesting that there is some requirement in simple litigation that one who has a federal question somewhere involved in their claim automatically have access to a federal district court?"
1985.84-1777,2,35507,marsha_s_berzon,,3428.304,3466.647,"--No, I'm suggesting that it is at least unlikely, in light of this long line of federal cases treating other government benefit programs in exactly this way that I am describing, that Congress in 1974, when writing 239(d) of the Trade Act in some very inefficient and inarticulate way, because the language does not say this, intended to set that requirement to set up a situation in which the only recourse in a purely federal benefit program is the chance of this court with your certiorari, and also to set up the situation in which 70,000 separate claims have to be litigated in order rather than one."
1985.84-1777,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3604.092,3605.107,"Thank you, counsel."
