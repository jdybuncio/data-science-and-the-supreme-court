1987.86-1415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.293,"We'll hear argument now in Number 86-1415, Evelyn Marino v. Juan Ortiz."
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,13.247,15.667,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,67.224,74.173,The calendar year 1983 and not the code number 1983.
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,74.173,74.673,No.
1987.86-1415,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.154,204.792,"Well, Mr. Podolsky, why didn't the Petitioners intervene in a Title VII litigation?"
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,204.792,222.332,"The Petitioners did not intervene in the Title VII litigation, Your Honor, because Congress has provided a remedy of 42 USC 1983 to deal with alleged violation of equal protection."
1987.86-1415,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.332,230.048,"Well, certainly the point that you argue on the merits could have been raised in that litigation."
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,230.048,234.093,It was an alternate remedy and not a required remedy.
1987.86-1415,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.046,240.123,"So, why didn't you?"
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,240.123,240.622,--What?
1987.86-1415,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,240.622,245.761,Why did the Petitioners not intervene in the Title VII litigation?
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,245.761,264.082,They did not intervene because they chose as their remedy a plenary action under 42 USC 1983 which is a remedy provided for Congress specifically addressed to enforcing the equal protection component of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1987.86-1415,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.082,267.112,I think Justice O'Connor is trying to find out why.
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,272.05,277.813,"Yes, indeed, there are a number of reasons cataloged in my reply brief, Your Honor."
1987.86-1415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,520.449,522.729,"Mr. Podolsky, where are you reading from?"
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,522.729,523.323,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1987.86-1415,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.052,536.317,Page 3 of that brief?
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,536.317,537.426,"Yes, indeed."
1987.86-1415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,646.865,648.443,May I ask one question?
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,648.443,649.317,"Yes, indeed."
1987.86-1415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,649.317,655.565,Are you telling me that... you say that you didn't know whether you would support or attack the settlement if you did go in.
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,657.721,665.686,"I do not attack the settlement, except that it is not narrowly construed to prevent unnecessary exclusion."
1987.86-1415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.385,677.87,Are you saying--
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,677.87,678.589,Qualified people.
1987.86-1415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.589,682.963,--there are 400 vacancies after the consent decree was entered?
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,682.963,689.305,"Not only after it was entered, but after it was employed and put into effect."
1987.86-1415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,689.898,690.695,So that the--
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,690.695,692.209,This is an unusual case.
1987.86-1415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.209,697.395,"--So, the consent decree does not... you're not claiming the consent decree harmed your clients in any way then."
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,697.395,701.222,"They benefitted the clients, my clients, and I'm the first to say it."
1987.86-1415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.222,705.156,I must confess I'm a little puzzled about what's going on.
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,705.156,706.109,"It's a puzzling case, Your Honor."
1987.86-1415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,706.109,710.436,"But, then, we start from the proposition that you're perfectly happy with the settlement?"
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,710.436,714.169,We are perfectly happy with the--
1987.86-1415,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.169,715.293,The consent decree.
1987.86-1415,0,40173,ronald_podolsky,,715.293,733.332,"--finding that the minority beneficiaries of the settlement were qualified to fill the rank of sergeant and that there are sufficient vacancies beyond that where people who outscored them can also be accommodated, and if you don't accommodate them, they are being unnecessarily excluded."
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1204.604,1213.07,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.544,1313.262,May I interrupt?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1322.134,1323.978,"--Probably not, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1323.978,1324.993,Thank you.
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1324.993,1340.346,"The question, though, is should that question be asked of someone who doesn't intervene, and we would suggest that it would be inefficient to create a rule of law of that sort."
1987.86-1415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.58,1383.127,But they had to do that to decide whether to file the lawsuit.
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1383.127,1385.501,"Well, they did, but the question is when."
1987.86-1415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.688,1400.465,"Well, normally, you start the time clock running when you get notice of whatever it is that hurts you, and presumably as soon as they found out about this settlement, they realized that it adversely affected their interest, and they must have been intimately acquainted with what was going on."
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1404.712,1406.975,"--That's true, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1488.647,1499.315,When did it become clear that the interests of... these interests would be threatened?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1499.315,1515.7,"Well, when the complaint was filed, the city defendants clearly understood that it would affect the interests of individuals who were already on the eligibility list because they pled and asked that the case be dismissed for failure to enjoin."
1987.86-1415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.313,1544.485,When was the consent decree?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1544.485,1564.757,"--Well, the consent decree itself was not entered until June of '86, but there were provisional promotions entered pursuant to interim orders of the court, and that was the first instance at which race-conscious relief was entered, and that would have been at the first time at which the equal protection rights of Mr. Podolsky's clients could have been implicated."
1987.86-1415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.757,1571.114,Couldn't the consent decree as finally entered been implemented in a way that wouldn't have hurt his clients?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1571.114,1586.562,"This particular consent decree had already hurt his clients because they had already been not given a promotion that other individuals were given a promotion, only because of their race."
1987.86-1415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1594.935,1598.589,"When was this action brought, the 1983 action brought?"
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1598.589,1605.867,"The initial 1983 action was filed, I believe, in December of 1985."
1987.86-1415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.867,1607.538,That's before the final consent decree was entered?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1607.538,1607.945,Right.
1987.86-1415,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.066,1618.425,It became clear in November and they sued in December?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1618.425,1618.847,Yes.
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1618.847,1644.29,"Well, Mr. Nager, assuming not this case, but in an ordinary case and I'm not worried about lawyers, they have lawyers, the parties have met and they decide to ride along on a class case and ride along until something happens, and the consent decree comes on board, do you take the position that they could intervene at that stage?"
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1644.29,1645.679,Yes.
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1645.679,1649.694,But rather than start a new lawsuit so they could consider more problems.
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1649.694,1651.239,We take the position--
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1651.239,1653.145,Do you think that's what Congress meant?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1653.145,1654.879,--We think that--
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1654.879,1656.301,Do you think that's what Congress meant?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1656.301,1660.503,"--We think that's what the federal rules allow, but the federal rules also require--"
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.503,1661.128,I didn't say allow.
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1662.298,1664.11,"--I'm sorry, Justice Marshall?"
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1664.11,1665.017,I didn't say allow.
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1669.514,1671.998,"When Congress created two separate rights,--"
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1671.998,1673.513,--two bites at the cherry?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1673.513,1675.199,--Not two bites at the cherry.
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1686.009,1689.617,Wouldn't that have been accomplished by intervening?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1689.617,1692.32,"Yes, they could have intervened."
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1692.32,1697.129,Wouldn't they have gotten everything by intervening that you would get by filing a separate lawsuit?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1697.129,1700.564,"I believe so, yes, they could have."
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1700.564,1702.485,Then why file a separate lawsuit?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1702.485,1719.728,"Because if you create that rule, you will be creating a system in which people have to continually monitor litigation and intervene at the first instance that they have any reason to believe that it may affect their interests because if they by-pass that opportunity--"
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1719.728,1730.194,Are we supposed to give assistance to anybody for anything they might believe might possibly happen under any circumstance in the future?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1730.194,1731.038,--No.
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1739.69,1742.503,I think one suit is more economical than two.
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1743.281,1745.609,"--You are absolutely right, and we agree with that."
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1761.086,1766.397,What do you think the answer would be if you asked me would I rather try one suit or two?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1766.397,1768.162,You'd rather try one.
1987.86-1415,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1768.162,1770.051,I thought you'd say that.
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1806.912,1820.61,"That occurred some time after, I believe, some time after the implementation of the provisional promotions, which would have been some time after November of 1985."
1987.86-1415,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.679,1843.693,And they would have made the same claim if there had not been these extra 400 slots?
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1843.693,1844.585,Yes.
1987.86-1415,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.585,1846.724,"No, they wouldn't have made that claim."
1987.86-1415,1,25826,glen_d_nager,,1853.3,1867.155,"As I say, as we read the complaint, I can only tell you what I think they're claiming from their complaint, and Mr. Podolsky is their lawyer, he may take a different view now than he did then or he may have had a different view all along, I can just tell you what we read from the complaint."
1987.86-1415,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.155,1868.982,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1871.293,1873.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.189,1910.732,"But, Mr. Koerner, you could get finality once the rules are established just as surely by using the procedures of Rule 19 as by using the rules of procedure 24, couldn't you?"
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1910.732,1931.598,"--Your Honor is quite correct, and what we are urging is that there are policy considerations in this type of litigation that make the literal application of Rule 19 inappropriate, in that we believe Rule 19 is not to be read in isolation, that it must be considered along with other rules, including the rules of intervention."
1987.86-1415,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.826,1954.746,How do we know when they decided that they really wanted that?
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1996.401,1996.854,No.
1987.86-1415,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.556,2042.132,Why have to intervene when there is any interest--
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2042.132,2043.085,In any case?
1987.86-1415,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.085,2045.084,"--In any case, what is the test?"
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2051.91,2066.593,"In this particular case, we would say in answer to your question that you have to intervene from that moment in time when you believe that a consent decree could be entered in that case and when your cause of action arises solely from the consent decree."
1987.86-1415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2182.545,2187.918,"Well, Mr. Koerner, that action was brought before the consent decree was filed, and--"
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2187.918,2188.793,"Your Honor, that is correct."
1987.86-1415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2188.793,2207.739,"--it seems to me that given the mandatory language of Title 19, it's difficult for me to see at that point why the burden shouldn't fall on the parties in the Title VII litigation to force a mandatory intervention if they wanted it."
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2212.423,2213.235,"Your Honor, in answer--"
1987.86-1415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2213.235,2214.22,You had notice.
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2214.22,2215.876,--We had notice.
1987.86-1415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.876,2217.906,"So, why didn't you force them to join?"
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2217.906,2225.95,Because we believed that all the people that had a substantial interest in the litigation were already there.
1987.86-1415,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2266.653,2274.993,"Yes, but you had under Title 19 language, the duty, to get them to intervene and get that settled if that was your concern."
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2274.993,2275.618,--That is correct.
1987.86-1415,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.743,2326.456,"You are just saying that their interest is not a valid one, but Rule 19 says that you should join if feasible a party if the party claims an interest relating to the subject of the action."
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2337.358,2346.261,"We're also telling you that in cases like this, it ought to be up to the participants in the collateral attack to determine where to go."
1987.86-1415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.437,2418.825,"Mr. Koerner, you've used the term ""collateral attack"" several times."
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2430.883,2432.336,--No.
1987.86-1415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2449.627,2452.47,And what case from this Court most closely supports that--
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2452.47,2459.872,"--Provident Bank and the PennCentral Merger and Inclusion cases, and that philosophy was upheld by three circuits."
1987.86-1415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.872,2462.028,--I asked you about cases from this Court.
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2462.028,2462.73,Both cases.
1987.86-1415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.28,2501.888,Doesn't part of your answer depend on the correctness of the 2nd Circuit's rule in Prate?
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2501.888,2502.435,"--No, no."
1987.86-1415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2528.719,2535.623,Would the rule you're urging here be different if the 2nd Circuit had come out exactly the opposite in the Prate case?
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2540.839,2541.23,No.
1987.86-1415,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.382,2637.614,That's because courts don't write statutes; they decide controversies between two people.
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2648.671,2656.73,It's only remarkable in the context of the facts of Title VII litigation and the public policy which supports consent decrees.
1987.86-1415,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.527,2661.26,But public policy can't say that courts are going to write statutes.
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2661.26,2672.101,"--No, but public policy has caused courts to construe procedural statutes in a way as not to do an injustice to the policies set forth in the statute you're trying to interpret."
1987.86-1415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.882,2713.285,"But, Mr. Koerner, you don't know a lot of times during the course of litigation that it's going to end up in a consent decree, do you?"
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2713.285,2713.801,--No.
1987.86-1415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.801,2718.705,"So, what judgments do you make before you know how the suit is finally going to be disposed of?"
1987.86-1415,2,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2718.705,2730.059,"Our argument, Your Honor, presumes the parties who are aggrieved have actual notice of the litigation and the consent decree problem and had an opportunity to intervene."
1987.86-1415,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.059,2737.042,"So, does this mean that their lawsuit must have been filed after the consent decree?"
1987.86-1415,3,25826,glen_d_nager,,2737.042,2739.744,In this case?
1987.86-1415,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2739.744,2740.337,No.
1987.86-1415,4,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2754.504,2754.535,Yes.
1987.86-1415,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.736,2808.013,"Well, it doesn't interrupt the consent decree judgment, but the consent decree doesn't bind people who are not parties to the suit."
1987.86-1415,4,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2808.013,2832.847,"Your Honor, I understand your position, and in private litigation, that is the case, and in public litigation, that could be the case, but there are circumstances under which, because of the nature of the interests and because the parties are so numerous, that it could be the understanding of all the parties and the court that if people believe they had a sufficient interest in the controversy, they would intervene under the circumstances."
1987.86-1415,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2997.719,3000.624,"Thank you, Mr. Koerner."
1987.86-1415,5,40173,ronald_podolsky,,3008.168,3009.543,"I don't believe I have the time, Your Honor."
1987.86-1415,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.543,3010.51,Thank you.
1987.86-1415,5,40173,ronald_podolsky,,3010.51,3012.9,I'll take it if you give it to me.
1987.86-1415,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3012.9,3013.305,"No, no."
