1983.82-1772,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.087,We will hear arguments next in Heckler against Ringer.
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,72.362,75.731,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.106,242.808,"Mr. Kneedler, can the claim be made before the surgery?"
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,242.808,253.866,"No, under the Medicare program, as under most insurance programs, the claimant files a claim for payment which can be made only for services that have already been rendered."
1983.82-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.866,263.055,Then how it is possible for someone who wants the surgery performed to get a determination about reimbursement before having the surgery?
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,263.055,267.589,The Act does not provide for this sort of procedure.
1983.82-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.853,295.091,"Well, under your view, is there any way at all that a person could get that kind of determination--"
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,295.091,328.18,"Well, the person could request, I suppose, the Secretary to perhaps offer advice, but for part of the reasons, I suppose, that were developed in the preceding case for one of the intermediaries to suggest the particular service might be covered before the person has even had the surgery might create problems, and ordinarily the intermediary would decline to do that."
1983.82-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.18,340.888,"--Well, for someone looking at elective surgery, something that isn't going to done no matter what, and of modest means, it does put them in a difficult position, doesn't it?"
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,340.888,342.924,"Well, it might."
1983.82-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.574,370.674,"Oh, well--"
1983.82-1772,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,370.674,375.061,"--Of course, this is Mr. Ringer's position, the one that Justice O'Connor refers to, isn't it?"
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,377.411,379.097,That he is entitled to review now?
1983.82-1772,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,379.097,389.468,"No, that he... he is in a position where he wants this procedure, but can't afford to pay for it, and how does he find out?"
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,389.468,393.336,"Well, as I say, there is no established procedure for that."
1983.82-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.215,519.603,"Mr. Kneedler, as to surgery performed after the Secretary's new regulation, and under the regulation it provides that this particular procedure would never be reimbursed, approved for reimbursement, why doesn't it fall under the Mathews against Diaz exception as a waiver of exhaustion requirements?"
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,519.603,536.295,"Well, the basis of the Court's decision in Mathews versus Diaz was the same as that in Salfi, and that was... first of all, those cases both were limited to a very narrow situation that is really somewhat unique, and that is where the claimant is challenging the constitutionality of the Act itself."
1983.82-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,589.161,592.781,"But, Mr. Kneedler, in Diaz, the Secretary did raise the exhaustion point."
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,592.781,595.817,"--Yes, he... the Secretary raised it on a motion to dismiss."
1983.82-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,605.755,608.605,Subsequently rejected in Salfi?
1983.82-1772,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,610.59,611.573,"No, the District Court's decision."
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,1769.756,1773.124,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1772,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1830.228,1833.496,I will put to you the question I put to your friend.
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,1846.672,1850.891,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not believe the government can."
1983.82-1772,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1850.891,1854.593,"Then they might be spending a lot of their time spinning their wheels, would they not?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,1854.593,1884.612,"That might be the case, sir, but I think that this is a different situation, in that the policy, the ruling in this instance precludes recipients from obtaining treatment which in ten out of eleven cases, that is, ten out of eleven Administrative Law Judges have held that they are entitled to, and I think that that is an aspect of this case which makes it unique and distinguishes it from the situation which you suggest."
1983.82-1772,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1887.397,1896.003,The holding that they are entitled to it has nothing to do with whether the recipient or the claimant is going to go ahead with the surgery.
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,1896.003,1912.032,"--That is correct, but in this case the complaint alleges, and in fact there was an affidavit presented to the District Court that Mr. Ringer would in fact have the procedure if coverage were available, but that he was unable to do so solely because of the Secretary's coverage determination."
1983.82-1772,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1912.032,1914.816,What is the medical opinion on the subject?
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,1923.672,1939.097,"First of all, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that that is a question which has already been resolved by the Secretary's Appeals Council and by her Administrative Law Judges, and that is something that has not been presented to the District Court, and which we frankly believe the District Court should not have to address in this case."
1983.82-1772,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1960.361,1962.547,Are there any segments outside southern California?
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,1962.547,1974.438,"--There have been, and there is evidence in the Appeals Council record of other doctors, one in North Carolina, for instance, one in West Virginia, and in some other areas who have used this treatment in given cases, sir."
1983.82-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.838,2013.23,"Who in this case has standing, can, you say, invoke 405 jurisdiction?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2013.23,2019.483,"First of all, the question of standing, as far as I am aware, has not been raised in the case."
1983.82-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.266,2023.768,It is a jurisdictional question.
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2023.768,2024.453,--Okay.
1983.82-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.559,2038.511,Are there any of the named plaintiffs who are in that class?
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2038.511,2039.797,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.797,2048.153,"Then the class can't possibly include them, I would think, since if none of the named plaintiffs have that characteristic, they couldn't represent a class that had that characteristic."
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2048.153,2053.288,I think that that may be a question that the District Court needs to address in the first instance.
1983.82-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.162,2065.928,Maybe you should go back to answering Justice White's question.
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2065.928,2066.447,Okay.
1983.82-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.386,2082.938,"Well, standing to challenge it, but he certainly wouldn't be invoking 405 for jurisdiction, would he?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2082.938,2084.223,I'd like to come back to that.
1983.82-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.756,2086.242,"Well, how could he?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2092.729,2094.696,"I don't think so, sir."
1983.82-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.649,2110.523,You can get judicial review under 405 without ever having an operation or filing a claim or anything of the sort.
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2111.157,2113.825,--I don't think so.
1983.82-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.915,2202.117,What constitutional question would that be?
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2202.117,2212.656,"As to whether or not 405 as applied to these facts discriminates against people like Mr. Ringer solely on the basis of their poverty, because--"
1983.82-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.656,2216.708,"Well, we have held that poverty is not an invidious basis of discrimination."
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2216.708,2232.118,"--But in this instance, Justice Rehnquist, I realize that poverty itself is not an invidicus basis of discrimination, but I think that the Court should interpret 405 in a fashion that avoids the need to address that constitutional question."
1983.82-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.118,2238.954,"But in view of the fact that poverty is not an invidicus classification, what substantial constitutional question would there be?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2238.954,2259.101,"I think that the question is one of denying access to the system, denying access to both administrative review and judicial review, solely because of Mr. Ringer's indigency, particularly in these facts, sir."
1983.82-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.101,2266.874,You are suggesting that the Constitution requires Congress to set up a system of administrative declaratory judgment proceedings?
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2266.874,2293.941,"No, sir, I don't think it has to set up a system of administrative declaratory judgment proceedings, but I do think that there has to be some route through which, consistent with the purposes of the Medicare Act, that people like Mr. Ringer can obtain some kind of determination of their eligibility for coverage, that they are not, as this case illustrates, put in a position of being denied benefits solely because they can't even get into the system in the first place."
1983.82-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.941,2298.826,May I ask you a question about what might possibly be a solution?
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2317.889,2326.412,"The problem with that, Justice Stevens, is that as we have set forth in our brief, and as the complaint indicates, Mr. Ringer is a person who is suffering right now."
1983.82-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.362,2361.682,But the case has been going on... How long has the case been going on?
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2361.682,2364.032,"Since about 1980, roughly."
1983.82-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.032,2371.288,"And couldn't someone have the operation just a few weeks later than this complaint was filed, and we wouldn't have all these procedural problems?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2379.458,2381.56,"Among the named parties, that's correct."
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2428.808,2431.077,"You are not going to amend up here, are you?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2431.077,2432.577,"Pardon me, sir?"
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2432.577,2435.028,"You are not going to amend in this Court, are you?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2435.028,2437.563,"No, I don't think we have to."
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.765,2442.565,"You don't think it's him, do you?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2442.565,2443.298,"No, sir."
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2443.298,2454.673,"Do you think you can argue that what you are arguing, you will have any member of the class eligible to argue the point that you are arguing?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2454.673,2456.108,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2457.808,2458.809,Is that your position?
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2458.809,2460.059,"--Yes, it is, Justice Marshall."
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2460.059,2461.928,By what right do you make that argument?
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2461.928,2472.05,"Because there are two subclasses in our case, the one that we have been talking about for some time with Mr. Ringer, who has not had the treatment and therefore not filed a claim."
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2478.788,2481.056,They had the treatment before the regulation.
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2481.056,2481.842,That is correct.
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2543.48,2549.736,"If we just vacated, sent it back, you could amend and do all of that, couldn't you?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2549.736,2554.271,"Yes, we could, and I suspect that we would be back here in short order, sir."
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2554.271,2557.406,"Well, why are we spinning our wheels right now?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2557.406,2567.412,"Because, as I say, I don't think that the underlying issues are affected by the ruling, except that the ruling exacerbates the situation."
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2567.412,2580.838,"Well, why upset a clear ruling of the Court just to meet a situation that can be corrected without a decision of this Court on a point that is not before the Court?"
1983.82-1772,1,36036,malcolm_j_harkins_iii,,2580.838,2598.8,"The only answer I can give you, Justice Marshall, is that we are satisfied with the Ninth Circuit's ruling at this point, and we don't think that amendment, even if it were necessary, would present any problem."
1983.82-1772,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2598.8,2603.335,"Well, it is difficult for us to write an opinion and cite you for an authority."
1983.82-1772,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3625.428,3628.864,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1772,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3778.912,3779.895,"Thank you, gentlemen."
