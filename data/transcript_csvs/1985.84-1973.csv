1985.84-1973,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.118,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Three Affiliated Tribes against Wold Engineering Company.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,12.95,16.483,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.645,274.909,Unless--
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,274.909,288.29,"Unless, Justice, the consent to the full extension... that is unless the tribal Indians either collectively as a tribal group or individually consent to the full extension of state civil jurisdiction over the pertinent property."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.806,303.8,"--And, the waiver... the condition is not only for this case, but for all cases?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,303.8,304.371,That is right.
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.611,346.289,"Would you have the same objection if the state conditioned its consent to use its courts just to the waiver of any objection to proceedings in connection with that particular case; for example, a counterclaim and making the tribe subject to discovery orders and contempt sanctions and so forth, in connection with the particular case?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,346.289,360.558,"Justice O'Connor, as we conceded in this Court in the previous hearing in this matter, the Three Affiliated Tribes would be subject to the counterclaim of the Respondent, Wold Engineering, up to the extent of jurisdictional--"
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.558,362.771,"I thought you said as a setoff, but not--"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,362.771,363.168,--As a setoff.
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.168,366.892,--as a counterclaim that would result in additional liability.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,366.892,369.302,"That is right, Your Honor."
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.302,372.255,How about the discovery procedures and so forth?
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,372.255,383.542,The Three Affiliated Tribes believe it would be proper in the interest of justice that they would be subject to discovery proceedings and to proceedings that would insure a fair trial to the non-Indian defendants.
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,383.542,396.883,"Well, could the state adopt a statute just requiring consent by the tribe to jurisdiction for all purposes in connection with that particular suit?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,397.534,418.446,"I think, Your Honor, if the statute had the purpose of insuring that a fair trial would be provided to the non-Indian defendant and that if the plaintiff, the tribe, would not conform to such requirements, then, I think, yes, the state court would be entitled to dismiss that suit in the interest of justice."
1985.84-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.446,426.824,"Mr. Cross, in this case, are there any individual Indians who are plaintiffs or is it just the Three Affiliated Tribes?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,426.824,429.004,Just the Three Affiliated Tribes.
1985.84-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.004,435.69,Then these tribes themselves have refused to consent to state court jurisdiction?
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,435.69,446.445,The consent issue did not finally become crystallized until the final decision by the North Dakota Supreme Court.
1985.84-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.465,484.239,"But, at any rate, it is clear that if Wold Engineering had wanted to sue the Three Affiliated Tribes in the state court, it could not have done that?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,484.239,485.26,That is correct.
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.26,505.985,"Suppose in this case the tribes comes into sue for breach of contract, for failure to perform, and Wold says we didn't fail anything, we performed and now we are counterclaiming for the amount you promised us for building this structure or whatever it was."
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,522.134,530.091,"Justice White, the present law on tribal sovereign immunity should be respected and the--"
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.091,532.652,"So, your answer is, yes, that judgment should not be entered?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,532.652,538.376,--The counterclaim can be heard up to the extent of a recoupment or equitable setoff.
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.376,540.727,"Well, there isn't any equitable setoff."
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,553.626,557.517,"Not under the law of tribal sovereign immunity as it now stands, Justice."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,557.517,564.281,At least that is your view of tribal immunity.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,564.281,569.186,"Yes, that is our view of the doctrine as explained by this Court."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.186,576.289,"And, you would say that even if that is the case, the state could not dismiss the action in the first place?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,593.162,606.459,"If a state statute was drafted that narrowly and it had that purpose and intent to make sure that the tribal governments were subject to counterclaims, then that would present a different issue."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.311,610.642,"Well, it may present a different issue, but how would you resolve it?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,610.642,623.941,"--I believe that that requirement, requiring the tribes to waive their tribal sovereign immunity is the bases for maintaining a damage of action should not be allowed under the present doctrine of tribal sovereignty."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.941,632.198,"So, in your view, the state could not dismiss the action for failure to waive the counterclaim?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,632.198,633.448,That is correct.
1985.84-1973,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.52,645.736,Suppose a state has a provision that any non-resident must post a bond before filing an action.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,650.278,662.977,"--If that statute was applied to non-residents and required such a posting to make sure that the case could be conducted fairly, then I think they may be able to do that, Your Honor."
1985.84-1973,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,662.977,663.999,They could do that?
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,663.999,664.359,Yes.
1985.84-1973,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,664.359,665.949,You would have no objection.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,665.949,675.575,"The statute at issue here bars all tribal Indians, not just tribal governments, from access to state court."
1985.84-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,748.243,751.535,"Mr. Cross, you used the term ""overly broad""."
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,772.448,793.643,"The reason, Justice Rehnquist, that I think this Court should go further and examine the case of individual Indians is because if this statute is allowed to stand as construed, will bar in the future until the statute is either amended or rescinded all tribal Indians from access to state court."
1985.84-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,793.643,811.784,"We have adopted that approach in the First Amendment, that overbreadth approach that you say, that if a state court adopts a very broad construction of a statute, that interferes with First Amendment rights, a person who could have gotten it under a narrow construction could still challenge it."
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,817.969,836.15,"I believe that this is an equal protection and due process case as well in that the rights of the tribal people had to maintain damages actions in state court have now been taken away from them, not just tribal governments, not just a reasonable constraint on the exercise of--"
1985.84-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.15,838.453,"But, your clients aren't individual Indians."
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,838.453,845.144,"--I think it is even more compelling in this case, Justice, because the Indian tribe acts on behalf of its tribal people."
1985.84-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,857.165,863.697,Do you think your case is stronger if you can bring in the rights of individual Indians as opposed to just the right of your own client?
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,863.697,876.236,I think the case is stronger in the sense that the construction of the state statute bars all tribal plaintiffs and if the statute stands it will continue to bar the plaintiffs in the future.
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,897.0,913.59,Would you explain how the tribe and non-Indian citizens are similarly situated for purposes of an equal protection analysis?
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,932.743,944.461,"The tribe and Indian individuals, when they filed in state court, are subject to the procedural restriction, and, as I mentioned before, the reasonable procedural restriction that insures a fair trial."
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.317,995.924,"Well, if two non-Indian parties, plaintiff and defendant, were suing in the state court of North Dakota, the plaintiff in the case would be subject to a suit for a counterclaim in that suit by the defendant and you have told us this morning again that in your view the tribe would not be subject to a counterclaim--"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,995.924,996.415,--The tribe--
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,996.415,1005.861,--and as a result they are not similarly situated for purposes of equal protection analysis is how it appears to me anyway.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1005.861,1023.041,"--The tribe as a governmental entity is similarly situation, I believe, in the sense that they are willing to go into state court and be bound by all the reasonable procedural restrictions, just as the United States when they sue in state court will be bound."
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1047.177,1056.714,"Well, but we do have in this case a defendant wanting to make a counterclaim, don't we?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1056.714,1057.984,--Yes.
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1065.07,1070.202,"But, not to the extent that would be available if the defendant were not an Indian tribe."
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1070.202,1071.424,--That is correct.
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1071.424,1074.967,"So, how could they be similarly situated then?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1074.967,1092.278,"For purposes of equal protection, I think there may be difficulties in comparing Indian tribes to non-Indian plaintiffs, however, the other facet of the due process claim requires the court be open on a reasonable basis."
1985.84-1973,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1115.362,1128.86,"Mr. Cross, since the case was here before, has the tribe now altered its laws so that a suit would be possible in tribal court today against Wold Engineering?"
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1128.86,1140.407,The tribe has altered its laws and a suit would be possible in the sense that the tribal code now recognizes jurisdiction over non-Indians.
1985.84-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1173.49,1178.224,Could the tribe have sued Wold in federal court?
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1178.224,1180.505,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1973,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.053,1213.905,I thought there was a special section of 28 that said what an Indian tribe is is a plaintiff that can sue.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1214.936,1223.993,"Your Honor, there is a special section that allows Indian tribes to sue, however, that does not address the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.395,1264.99,"Well, what if it was a... Federal courts hear state law questions all the time in diversity cases."
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1264.99,1267.073,"There is no diversity here, Your Honor."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.073,1271.407,"Well, there may not be, but there is a statute that says Indians can come into court."
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1283.793,1300.693,"Based on the decisions that I have read, Your Honor, 28 U.S.C. 1362, I believe, that allows tribes to sue in federal court relates only to their personal right to sue free of some limitations."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.554,1306.239,Free of the problem of diversity.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1306.239,1309.191,"--I don't believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1309.191,1311.935,The provision is completely useless then.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1311.935,1315.386,The provision allows Indian tribes to come in and sue and--
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.386,1322.371,They didn't need that statute to come into federal court on a federal question.
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1322.371,1331.387,--I think in a sense that the federal statute opening the federal courts to the Indian tribes simply confirms existing law.
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.11,1342.753,"So, you say then the statute just wasn't needed at all."
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1342.753,1354.822,"I think the statute within the limits that it functions is important, but I don't think it would allow the Indian tribes to come and sue in federal district court on matters of this kind."
1985.84-1973,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.822,1358.995,On a state law question?
1985.84-1973,0,38953,raymond_cross,,1358.995,1363.107,On solely a state law question except in a diversity situation.
1985.84-1973,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.224,1554.233,Very well.
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1559.098,1562.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1662.967,1665.107,"Mr. Lee, let's take a little easier one."
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1680.276,1684.8,"In that situation, Your Honor, I believe both litigants would be allowed to sue."
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1691.265,1693.426,"No, no, he sold the car on the reservation."
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1693.426,1695.487,--The car was sold on the reservation?
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.487,1696.048,Yes.
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1696.048,1697.29,To a reservation Indian?
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1697.29,1697.528,Yes.
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1697.528,1699.831,"In that situation, Your Honor, yes, that is correct."
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1708.667,1712.799,"Wouldn't somebody at least say oophs, sorry, or something like that?"
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1712.799,1736.164,"--Well, I would hope that somebody would recognize the problem and that is a problem that has been in existence in the State of North Dakota for well over 20 years and everyone has known that that problem has existed, yet, in that period of time, not one effort has been made to resolve the problem except this case here today."
1985.84-1973,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1812.455,1814.406,Or the same non-access?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1814.406,1816.226,"Or the same non-access, that is correct."
1985.84-1973,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1816.226,1823.713,Do you think non-access to this tribe to the state courts is a denial of federal policy?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1823.713,1827.974,"No, I do not, Your Honor."
1985.84-1973,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1827.974,1828.635,Why not?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1828.635,1840.372,"Federal policy has long recognized access by Indian courts to state courts, but it has never been required of a state court to take that jurisdiction."
1985.84-1973,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1841.474,1848.848,"Yes, but you end up with a situation where there is no forum available for the resolution of this dispute."
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1848.848,1850.08,--That is not correct.
1985.84-1973,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1853.302,1854.331,What is the forum?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1854.331,1864.89,"It would be either a state court, if the Indian people chose to follow the rules laid out in Chapter 27-19 and agreed to have their case brought."
1985.84-1973,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1876.708,1878.547,What about the statute of limitations?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1878.547,1892.307,"There may be a statute of limitations question, however, given the nature of the litigation here today, and the fact that this has been going through the procedure, those limitations, statute of limitation problems may be tolled."
1985.84-1973,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1892.307,1893.478,"Well, maybe."
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1896.148,1901.472,"It would be speculation for me to try and guess either way, sir."
1985.84-1973,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.472,1905.105,Do you have another suggestion for a forum?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1905.105,1907.376,"Yes, Your Honor, tribal court."
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1916.723,1919.383,Can they enforce it outside of the reservation?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1919.383,1925.888,--If the people of the State of North Dakota are going to refuse to entertain this type of case--
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.888,1928.372,I am talking about what you have now in North Dakota.
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1935.706,1940.939,"--That is the rule right now, but I would submit that that rule is incorrect."
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.939,1942.611,"Well, that is what we are talking about right now."
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1942.611,1964.344,"That rule is incorrect, sir, and I would say that if the courts of North Dakota are not going to recognize jurisdiction on the reservation and there is a forum which is set up to fill that void, that the decisions that come from the forum that has been created to fill that void, would have to be recognized off the reservation."
1985.84-1973,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.344,1969.349,"Well, is Wold subject to service by a tribal court?"
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1969.349,1973.619,"Yes, I would submit that they would be."
1985.84-1973,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.619,1978.332,The tribal court can serve a summons state-wide?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,1978.332,2011.805,"Perhaps not at the time this action arose, but at the current time I would... If they have taken affirmative steps to create a forum to fill the void and they provide reasonable rules of procedure which guarantee that reasonable fairness and equity is available to all litigants coming into a tribal forum, I would submit that those processes and services off the reservation would have to be honored by Wold Engineering and any other non-Indian litigant."
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.805,2013.978,"Well, is it in existence today?"
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2014.927,2017.879,The forum is--
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.879,2023.022,How is it going to help this case if it is not in existence?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2023.022,2027.746,--The forum... I will plead ignorance on this.
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2040.586,2040.963,To enforce?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2040.963,2042.706,--To enforce on the reservation.
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.706,2044.906,Off the reservation.
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2044.906,2045.177,Off the reservation.
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2046.387,2049.91,"How can the Indian enforce off the reservation, how?"
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2049.91,2060.458,"--The State of North Dakota, if it is going to refuse to entertain this type of jurisdiction in its own courts must recognize that the jurisdictional void has to be filled somehow."
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2060.458,2061.968,Has it done so?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2061.968,2063.169,Not at this point.
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2063.169,2065.099,Is it thinking about doing so?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2065.099,2066.672,Not that I am aware of.
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2066.672,2068.342,"Well, why not forget it?"
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2083.602,2086.895,"At the present time, I don't believe that there is a mechanism for collecting it."
1985.84-1973,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2618.514,2641.298,"Well, Mr. Lee, it is certainly understandable, I suppose, why the Indian tribes wouldn't want to submit themselves to jurisdiction of state courts for all purposes, isn't it, because they might well not want to have the state court handling domestic relation matters of tribal Indians and things of that kind?"
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2652.264,2668.016,"--If the fears are that the people of the State of North Dakota are going to ignore the wishes of the Indian people, that would be a factual problem that would develop on a case-by-case basis, but the law, as it is written, would solve that problem."
1985.84-1973,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2699.316,2709.262,"How about matters of adoption or child custody or marital dissolution, inheritance, things of that kind?"
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2709.262,2737.73,"--I believe inheritance is specifically carved out, but in those other areas which could be included, the North Dakota law also includes a provision which answers that question, Justice O'Connor, and it states that the tribal customs and tribal traditions of the Indian people should first be examined by the North Dakota courts and where possible that those customs and traditions should be given credence, should be given effect."
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.242,2795.13,"Mr. Lee, getting back to your point about the Indian should have been negotiating all along these 20 years, how many Indians do you have in the state legislature?"
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2795.13,2799.521,There are no Indians that I am aware of who are members of the state legislature.
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2799.521,2801.073,"Well, how could they negotiated."
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2801.073,2805.095,"They could negotiate, sir, I believe, the same way they negotiated last time."
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2808.346,2811.39,You mean negotiate and come up with the same thing they have got now?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2811.39,2822.758,"--Justice Marshall, in 1963, the people of the State of North Dakota had initially drafted a jurisdictional plan which would have crammed the state jurisdiction down the Indian people's throats."
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.885,2837.958,But they had no clout.
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2841.028,2844.37,--They had clout in 1963.
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2847.052,2850.074,How many legislators did they have in 1963?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2850.074,2852.688,"--Again, sir, I don't believe they had any, but in--"
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2852.688,2856.118,Have you ever heard of one in South Dakota ever?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2856.118,2857.41,"--In North Dakota, sir?"
1985.84-1973,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2859.27,2860.212,Ever?
1985.84-1973,1,25629,gary_h_lee,,2863.855,2867.375,"--Mr. Cross, has there ever been an Indian legislator?"
1985.84-1973,2,38953,raymond_cross,,2867.375,2873.632,I believe that there has been one or two in the history of the state legislature.
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,2873.632,2875.893,Thank you.
1985.84-1973,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.112,2922.753,"May I ask this question, Mr. Lee?"
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,2946.329,2950.673,"--I would submit, Your Honor, we have to concede the issue of sovereign immunity."
1985.84-1973,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2995.282,2999.075,How can it be the same if they have sovereign immunity?
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,2999.887,3000.527,--If--
1985.84-1973,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.527,3003.109,If not the same rules except they can't lose.
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3003.109,3020.269,--The people of the State of North Dakota recognize that its own state has sovereign immunity to the extent that it hasn't been waived and the State of North Dakota has not waived its sovereign immunity except in contract actions.
1985.84-1973,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3039.811,3045.225,"But, the condition that your legislation imposes, as I understand it, is that they must waive their sovereign immunity."
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3050.35,3062.559,The Indian people have to subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the State of North Dakota to the same extent that those rules would be applicable in actions involving private citizens.
1985.84-1973,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3100.593,3109.778,"You are not suggesting, are you, that if this suit were brought by individual Indians rather than by the tribes that the result would be different in your opinion?"
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3113.219,3120.695,"Not under these facts unless they first agree, either individually or collectively, to consent to state court jurisdiction."
1985.84-1973,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3120.695,3131.352,"Well... I don't quite understand your answer, but Indians themselves individually can't waive sovereign immunity, only the state can do that."
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3131.352,3139.169,The Indian people wouldn't an individual sovereign immunity and the individual Indian would be subject to execution levy and the like.
1985.84-1973,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.761,3188.161,Neither am I.
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3195.716,3196.837,"Yes, they can, sir."
1985.84-1973,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3218.882,3228.099,Is it your submission... I want to be sure I understand you... that they could give that kind of consent for the purpose of a short period of time and retain their sovereign immunity?
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3228.099,3232.122,Their sovereign immunity from liability.
1985.84-1973,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3232.122,3234.033,And from execution?
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3234.033,3235.512,"And, from execution judgment and the like."
1985.84-1973,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.512,3238.374,It seems to me they have a pretty simple solution then.
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3254.076,3254.547,No.
1985.84-1973,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3254.547,3267.285,It is my understanding that the consent has to be for all purposes and can only be removed after going through certain time requirements and posting and notice and so forth.
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3267.285,3274.138,"That is correct, but there is the possibility to remove the consent once... You know, if...."
1985.84-1973,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3274.138,3284.325,"Yes, but the consent has to be given for all purposes and it is in effect for a certain period of time until statutory procedures are complied with to terminate it."
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3284.325,3285.036,That is correct.
1985.84-1973,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3383.183,3383.814,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1985.84-1973,3,25629,gary_h_lee,,3383.814,3386.035,"Thank you, sir."
1985.84-1973,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3393.37,3396.022,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Cross?"
1985.84-1973,4,38953,raymond_cross,,3396.022,3413.784,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, to point out that the tribal courts are open to non-Indian plaintiffs and many non-Indian plaintiffs for debt collection and other purpose take advantage of the tribal courts to maintain actions precisely of the kind that are at stake here."
1985.84-1973,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3496.087,3502.141,Can an individual waive Indian sovereignty?
1985.84-1973,4,38953,raymond_cross,,3502.141,3508.877,"Under the doctrines of this Court, Justice Marshall, the individuals have a right known as the Williams v. Lee right."
1985.84-1973,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3531.142,3535.113,"Well, how can an individual waive a state sovereignty?"
1985.84-1973,4,38953,raymond_cross,,3535.113,3538.135,I may not have answered your question Justice Marshall.
1985.84-1973,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3538.135,3538.706,No.
1985.84-1973,4,38953,raymond_cross,,3538.706,3545.07,The answer to your question is that the individual Indian cannot waive the tribal governmental sovereignty.
1985.84-1973,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3587.667,3593.601,I am talking about under your tribal government how can an individual waive sovereignty?
1985.84-1973,4,38953,raymond_cross,,3593.601,3599.206,"--The individual, Justice Marshall, is that they cannot waive tribal sovereignty."
1985.84-1973,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3646.356,3647.258,"Thank you, gentlemen."
