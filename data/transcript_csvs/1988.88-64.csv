1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.826,"We'll hear argument now in No. 88-64, Missouri v. Kalima Jenkins."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,14.916,21.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.269,273.954,"But one of your problems, it seems to me, is to show that this no-interest rule attaches to state sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,281.513,282.184,That's correct.
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,326.604,329.899,"Of course, Mr. Farmer, this is not really strictly prejudgment interest, is it?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,349.189,364.088,"--Well, it is mixed up in the Judge's calculation, but it was separately calculated in terms of a, he specifically found that current hourly rates used were $15 or $20 higher than the historical rates, and that was done to compensate for delay."
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,368.758,371.788,Except you don't have an interest rate factor.
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,381.223,382.067,That's correct.
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.278,401.479,"Well, it's retroactive just since, until the suit was filed."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,401.479,410.664,"--Well, it's retroactive in the sense, to the time the attorneys' fees were incurred, and attorneys' fees could be incurred before the suit was filed--"
1988.88-64,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,410.664,411.943,I see.
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,422.737,425.284,"--Obviously, the fee is going to be a little bit less."
1988.88-64,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.748,443.431,"Well, another way of saying it is a reasonable attorney's fee, in your view, is less than full compensation for the attorney's time reasonably expended."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,443.431,450.71,"--But under fee-shifting statutes, attorneys are typically, the standard is not fully compensated."
1988.88-64,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.317,459.551,So your position Is that a reasonable fee is less than full and fair compensation.
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,459.551,463.284,"--No, your Honor."
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.006,520.731,"Mr. Farmer, if you prevail In this case, do you think it would be permissible for a judge to follow a practice that sometimes Masters would follow, to say require the parties to make a deposit to cover future liability for cost, and then stick the money into an interest-bearing account to earn interest, and then If the State prevailed they get the money back plus Interest, whereas if the plaintiff prevailed they could get their interest in that manner?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,523.605,538.24,"I think there would be serious questions involved in whether you could require the State, prior to any Judgment, to deposit a certain amount in escrow to satisfy any future liability for attorneys' fees."
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.045,554.435,"What if the State at the outset admitted liability and said,"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,574.304,578.411,"--Certainly the statute, I think, Section 1988 allows for interim fees."
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.458,592.326,"No, no, I say put in on new ground knowing that there was going to be a lot of litigation over the form of the decree and things of that kind, and which end that the plaintiff is ultimately going to prevail, because it's been determined that it's the prevailing party."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,610.273,624.376,"Well, in substance, it's different than what's done here because here there was no judgment on the attorneys' fees until long after the liability order had been issued and the judgment took into account the delay in payment."
1988.88-64,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,742.751,753.529,"Mr. Farmer, may I ask whether you concede that recovery for paralegal services is Included In attorneys' fees recovery?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,753.529,760.415,It's not necessary for me to concede that in this case.
1988.88-64,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,761.9,763.508,"Well, you didn't challenge that."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,763.508,765.07,--We did not challenge that in this case.
1988.88-64,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,765.07,767.539,You just want to quibble over actual costs or market.
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,774.083,781.266,"Well, to be honest, your Honor, In looking at this issue in front of the District Court, we litigated the issue that we felt we could win on."
1988.88-64,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,792.731,794.261,"Well, what is your position?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,807.069,809.348,--And I think that's what has been shown here.
1988.88-64,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,819.064,827.592,"So you do concede, in effect, that they are recoverable under those circumstances as a separate item on the bill for attorneys' fees."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,827.592,828.762,"Under those circumstances, they could--"
1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,828.762,829.856,Why do you concede that?
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,829.856,834.199,"--Well, in this case, the attorney's fee, the market rate--"
1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.199,845.694,"You're conceding the fact that when it says, when the statute provides for the award of a reasonable attorney's fee, it includes not only a fee for attorneys but for paralegals, too?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,845.694,846.536,--No.
1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,846.536,848.63,"Well, then what are you conceding?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,848.63,859.703,"I think I'm... the statute includes attorneys' fees, includes compensable items in two separate categories: attorneys' fees and costs."
1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.448,880.696,"And you're conceding that costs and expenses, as used in Section 1988, includes charges for paralegal time?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,880.696,882.74,We didn't raise that issue in this case--
1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.74,883.897,"Well, but are you conceding it?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,883.897,888.098,"--Well, I will not concede it as a matter of law."
1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.097,892.128,"Well, why don't you make it?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,892.128,897.954,"--Because, in this case, we felt the equitable resolution, and under the particular--"
1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.954,899.515,"Well, why don't you make it in this Court?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,899.515,904.655,"--Well, in this Court, I will make the argument."
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.35,929.174,"But, Mr. Farmer, could that argument be made in this case when it wasn't made in the lower court and you're seeking a reversal of the judgment?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,929.174,931.424,"--That's why we are not making it in this Court, your Honor."
1988.88-64,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.746,957.804,"What's the practice, generally, around the country, do you think?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,962.427,965.317,"Well, I think the practice varies."
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.435,1064.825,"--Mr. Farmer, can I ask a factual question?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1080.521,1081.769,"--well, the record isn't clear on that, your Honor."
1988.88-64,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.954,1176.436,Should this be any more so than compensating attorneys at a market-based rate?
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1176.436,1180.544,We believe that the attorneys are treated differently under the statute.
1988.88-64,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1201.083,1209.564,"So it depends on whether we treat the paralegal fees as attorneys' fees or separately as costs, under your argument."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1209.564,1212.579,"--Separately as cost or expenses, that's correct."
1988.88-64,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1212.579,1219.577,"Well, let me simply say it can't be an attorney's fee, under the statute, if it's work done by non-attorneys."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1219.577,1220.374,"That's correct, your Honor."
1988.88-64,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1225.153,1236.258,"But doesn't work by attorneys normally include an amount of overhead for secretarial services and all kinds of things that aren't ""work by attorneys"", that's incorporated in attorneys' fees."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1240.929,1249.3,"--Well, we believe it's part of costs and expenses, an expense to the lawyer that he has to pay for, In, concerning the particular case."
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.751,1331.595,"Mr. Farmer, can I interrupt you a second?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1347.058,1354.96,"--Well, yeah, it was not included in what the judge called ""costs"", but it was included separately from the award that concerned fees."
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.645,1363.846,"I thought the judgment gave a big lump sum for fees which had, as a part of it, all the paralegal hours and law clerk hours and attorney hours."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1363.846,1365.112,--Pardon me?
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1365.112,1378.841,"Well, I thought there was one figure for fees for each of the two firms which included the paralegal time and all that, and that the costs were a separate item, covering things like transcripts and witness fees--"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1378.841,1379.06,Oh.
1988.88-64,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.417,1385.917,--I see.
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1385.917,1403.393,"The interesting thing about that is the cases relied on by Congress in enacting Section 1988, the one case... and only one case even referred to law clerk fees or paralegal fees... that is listed in a whole string of items, of costs."
1988.88-64,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1418.091,1428.977,"Your position is that our decision will not affect the way attorneys use paralegals in their practice, in these cases?"
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1428.977,1431.648,"We do not believe it will, your Honor."
1988.88-64,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1431.648,1447.688,"If you're wrong about that, then your position means that the cost, or the legal bill may ultimately be more because attorneys will be used instead of paralegals."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1447.688,1450.718,"That is certainly a possibility, but I think it's--"
1988.88-64,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1450.718,1456.903,So a large part of your argument seems to rest on a judgment as to whether or not what we say makes any difference to the practice of law in these cases.
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1456.903,1463.915,"--Well, one would hope that what you do say makes a difference in the practice of law."
1988.88-64,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1485.937,1492.403,"Well, if attorney are used in lieu of paralegals, then it clearly will increase the size of the awards."
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1492.403,1506.165,"Yes, but, even now, those kinds of hours are scrutinized by District Courts in fee litigations, so if attorneys are doing paralegal work, the hours, District Courts now typically reduce or eliminate the hours entirely."
1988.88-64,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1507.945,1510.616,So you think there should be a legal requirement that paralegals be used?
1988.88-64,0,17636,bruce_farmer,,1510.616,1525.595,"--Well, I think there's a, in determining whether to use paralegals or an attorney, the law firm must staff the case as efficiently as possible."
1988.88-64,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.832,1562.159,"Thank you, Mr. Farmer."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1563.159,1567.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.042,1623.337,"There was such mention of compensating for delay, wasn't there?"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1623.337,1625.04,"--There was, indeed, your Honor."
1988.88-64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1625.04,1626.804,And the judge did compensate for delay.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1626.804,1638.737,"He said that he was taking, actually, he divided his treatment between the way he treated Mr. Benson and the way he treated everybody else."
1988.88-64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.981,1658.572,"Joe, we just don't know how much compensation there was for delay."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1658.572,1660.932,"--That is exactly the situation, your Honor."
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.733,1688.124,It's better or worse?
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1688.124,1690.059,--Better or worse for whom?
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.059,1691.887,"Do you prefer the courts to say,"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1700.899,1703.586,"Well, I think I've got a two-pronged argument."
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.987,1838.065,"Yes, we would, it the suit were against the United States."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1839.141,1843.827,"Held that it would be ""reasonable compensation"", your Honor?"
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.827,1855.76,"Well, the same provisions at issue here, if applied against the United States, would, according to our decision in Library of Congress, be held to preclude an award of interest."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1855.76,1856.291,That is true.
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.915,1864.615,"So that must mean that we're willing to swallow that very large camel, at least in the context where the United States is the defendant."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1864.615,1871.988,"Well, I think, perhaps, if it came up before the Court in those circumstances, the situation might be different."
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.423,1881.359,I'm just going by what we said in Library of Congress anyway.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1889.95,1903.803,"And I suggest, with all respect, that Library of Congress is not determinative here and that its rule, whatever its merits in that context, calls for no particular attention in this context."
1988.88-64,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1903.803,1909.832,"Its principles may be exactly the same, if we recognize state sovereign immunity."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1909.832,1912.174,Yes.
1988.88-64,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1912.174,1912.893,Yes.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1912.893,1914.753,I'm forced to agree with that.
1988.88-64,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1929.464,1929.73,"Well, is that so?"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1935.837,1954.36,"--With all respect, your Honor, I would suggest that the 11th Amendment arose more out of a concern for the federalist system, a concern for the proposition that the states should not be called to account for anything in the federal courts."
1988.88-64,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1954.36,1957.0,Because the states were sovereign.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1957.0,1988.877,"Your Honor may hold that view, and I certainly am not going to attempt to do other than put forward the view that it was not because the states were sovereign, having the mystical attributes of the sovereign, the king, the almighty, but because the states were federated, that they were independent entities coming together by consensus to form these United States of America."
1988.88-64,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1988.877,1992.642,They were sovereign states coming together in a federation.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,1992.642,1998.905,"Sovereign, yes, but not sovereign in the sense of necessarily possessing immunity."
1988.88-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.899,2181.426,"Mr. Topkis, do you think paralegals come under the head of 1988?"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2181.426,2201.949,"--If I may, your Honor, I would answer that question by saying that the overall thrust of 1988 is to put civil rights plaintiffs on a par with all other plaintiffs in competing for legal services."
1988.88-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.865,2217.068,Are you going to answer the question?
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2217.068,2226.815,"--Yes, I will, and I will say, in consequence, it appears to me that market should determine because market is what determines in all other contexts."
1988.88-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.815,2229.877,But I asked you a question which I don't believe you've answered.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2229.877,2230.408,I apologize.
1988.88-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2230.408,2242.481,"My question was, do you think attorneys' fees are recoverable, rather, paralegal fees are recoverable as a part of a reasonable attorney's fee or as a part of other costs?"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2242.481,2250.041,"I would say, I would say with all respect that I don't think it makes a great deal of difference--"
1988.88-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.041,2255.038,Let's take reasonable attorney's fee.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2266.377,2267.971,--I would be quite content to see that--
1988.88-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.971,2270.595,"Then you add secretarial charges, too?"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2270.595,2273.157,"--No, because that's not the way the profession behaves."
1988.88-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2282.684,2283.636,"Well, Congress said"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2287.214,2288.041,--That is correct.
1988.88-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2292.148,2297.6,"And you feel that a reasonable attorney's fee should include a fee not only for attorneys, but for paralegals?"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2297.6,2309.252,"I'll take it there or I'll take it as part of costs, but in either event, I want paralegals to be compensated on a par so that the plaintiffs, the civil rights plaintiffs, are not disadvantaged."
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.39,2326.104,"Mr. Topkis, it does make a difference to me whether you put it under attorneys' fees or costs, because you, it is an impossible job to persuade me that you get costs awarded on some basis other than costs."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2335.991,2337.583,You mean out-of-pocket expenses.
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.583,2338.802,"That's what ""costs"" means."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2338.802,2340.363,"That's what it does to me, too, your Honor."
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2340.363,2344.237,"Well, so, you really think it has to be under attorneys' fees if it's going to be anywhere."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2344.237,2349.469,"Well, I would submit again that--"
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.469,2353.124,"That is to say, if it's going to be compensated on market basis."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2368.056,2372.334,"--As a logical matter, I am, of course, in total accord with your Honor."
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.201,2397.576,"Well, I don't deal with reality, Mr. Topkis, I deal--"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2399.855,2405.993,"--I think better of your Honor than that, with all respect."
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.509,2417.834,"I take it there is no instance, counsel, I take it there's no instance in which costs are billed at anything other than out-of-pocket."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2417.834,2421.239,"Oh, I think there are many instances, your Honor."
1988.88-64,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2422.175,2423.128,What are those?
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2423.128,2427.657,--The statute allows you a certain cost regardless of what your actual costs have been.
1988.88-64,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2432.484,2434.654,"Well, is there any instance in which it's more?"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2434.654,2435.732,--I can't recall.
1988.88-64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.42,2494.833,"You don't, even if the market would say that lawyers in this community do these cases on a contingency, you don't, you aren't required to recognize contingency fee arrangements, are you, under 1988?"
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2494.833,2498.815,--Not required to recognize them.
1988.88-64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.815,2517.12,"In one, it says in a 1983 damages suit, and there's a recovery and the contingent fee, the contract is, would give him, would give the attorney twice as much as what hours times a reasonable rate would produce."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2519.666,2529.147,"Your Honor has the advantage of me in being familiar with this Court's decision in the Bergeron case, which was announced this morning."
1988.88-64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.547,2545.641,No matter what the market says.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2545.641,2546.358,--I'm sorry?
1988.88-64,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.358,2549.029,No matter what the market is in Kansas City.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2549.029,2562.196,"Well, I'm not sure I agree with that, your Honor, because it seems to me that what economists teach us is that barring collusion, the market produces what is reasonable."
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.071,2647.022,"But they don't charge the rates of 10 years from now, either."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2647.022,2648.787,"Ten years prospectively, you mean?"
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.787,2649.162,Right.
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2662.25,2664.686,"Well, yeah--"
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2664.686,2664.953,Whatever the time--
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2664.953,2667.622,"--Whatever the numbers, that is correct."
1988.88-64,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2972.921,2974.842,"--I'm not sure that's right, Mr. Topkis."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,2987.072,2988.961,"I would think, in that case, yes, your Honor."
1988.88-64,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.686,3251.669,"A million dollars here, a million... you know, Sen. Dirksen's line."
1988.88-64,1,33212,jay_topkis,,3254.543,3254.825,--Right.
1988.88-64,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3291.371,3291.574,"Thank you, Mr. Topkis."
1988.88-64,2,17636,bruce_farmer,,3293.543,3298.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-64,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3350.768,3364.935,"Mr. Farmer, could I ask you about where you draw the line with respect to the principle you're talking about, that the 11th Amendment requires us to interpret statutes strictly against state liability."
1988.88-64,2,17636,bruce_farmer,,3397.999,3400.077,"--Your Honor, it's a difficult analysis--"
1988.88-64,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.077,3400.638,--So where do you stop?
1988.88-64,2,17636,bruce_farmer,,3407.152,3416.289,"--Well, we think you should go as far as we want to take you in this case because it is almost identical to the situation in Library of Congress v. Shaw."
1988.88-64,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3457.554,3458.258,"Thank you, Mr. Farmer."
