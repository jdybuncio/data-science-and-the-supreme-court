1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,64.941,"Mr. Masouredis, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,64.941,68.227,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.451,238.57,Is this being done apart from the CZMA program?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,238.57,239.403,"Yes, it is."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.471,283.599,"Well, it may not be the same program, but it is certainly the same sort of coastal zone management scheme, as opposed to a separate environmental statute dealing with one or another type of environmental damage."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,283.599,295.99,"Well, I think again that Public Resources Code 30,008 indicates that the state will apply the environmental controls of the Coastal Act to excluded federal lands."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.154,362.949,"But if the states can do the same thing by a coastal zone, a state coastal zone management program that is not part of the federal program, what possible purpose does the exclusion of the federal lands from the federal coastal zone management program achieve?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,362.949,368.185,"As we see it, the CZMA, adds to the state's police power."
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,454.791,460.945,"Well, this case really comes to us in quite an abstract position."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,476.472,486.429,"I think the things they would be looking at are reclamation for the mining that's occurred, measures to prevent pollution into the Little Sur River."
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.285,501.522,Danger of runoff from the federal land to the other lands not owned by the federal government?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,501.522,503.406,--Into the Little Sur River.
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,521.234,533.243,"In principle you, as I understand your argument, in principle you would say that damage to the federally owned land itself would justify the state environmental regulation, even though no non-federally owned land is affected by that damage?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,533.243,534.443,"That's correct, that's correct."
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.985,552.122,But how many citizens of California want to visit a mining operation that's mining limestone or something?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,552.122,561.161,"--Well, this particular area, the Big Sur coast of California, is very scenic and attracts roughly three million visitors a year."
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.504,593.282,"And so you think it's permissible under this scheme that we're talking about here for the state to say that, we want this federal piece of land to be kept up to snuff and appealing to visitors, in keeping with the Big Sur countryside?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,593.282,603.738,We think that we're interested in having additional supplemental environmental controls to complement the Forest Service's own surface use requirements.
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.745,643.815,"Well, of course, to the extent that the Forest Service incorporates state regulations the state doesn't have to worry about it, I suppose."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,643.815,649.117,"Well, under the Ninth Circuit's decision it doesn't appear that that is the case."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,695.431,708.155,"To avoid the preemption by the Coastal Zone Management Act, you really have to rely heavily on the distinction you were drawing earlier between land use restrictions and environmental restrictions."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,719.697,737.508,"I think the difference between a land use determination type of regulation and an environmental one is in the land use context the analysis is, we're going to define what are acceptable uses, without regard to environmental impacts."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,742.726,744.412,Without regard to environmental impacts?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,748.714,750.482,"--Not really, not really."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.886,759.338,On what basis do you zone?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,759.338,762.874,"--Certain amenities, decisions about where the community should grow."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.874,764.076,"""To-mae-to, tom-mat-to""."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,768.978,779.251,"I think an environmental regulation is one that says, regardless of what the use is... and it can be any use... it has to meet certain environmental standards."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.12,787.941,"I suppose you can say, yes, you can't break the surface of the land."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,797.397,805.301,"--Well, if you've said that certain activities can't occur because of the environmental effects, we'd agree that that might blend over."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.828,824.547,It seems to be they're both directed to precisely the same thing.
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,832.386,840.39,"I think the important thing here is whether or not the state is going to absolutely prohibit the particular use we're concerned about, which is mining."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.396,849.931,Could it prohibit strip mining?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,849.931,851.647,--That's correct.
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,851.647,853.966,"It could prohibit strip mining, but not mining?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,853.966,854.466,"Oh, no."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,859.787,863.672,I'm not saying... it isn't prohibiting all mining; it's just prohibiting strip mining.
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,869.876,873.195,"That's right, but it's defining a particular type of mining."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.832,879.534,So the state could prohibit strip mining?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,879.534,887.104,"Yes, a certain type of mining, but not all mining per se."
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.104,896.544,That could substantially modify the value of the land use classification given by the Forest Service.
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,912.671,920.342,We're not intending to interfere with any of the designations for the use of the land.
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.896,940.656,But do you really think there is that air-tight compartment... I think Justice Scalia suggested to you this in his question... between designating the use of the land on the one hand and designating the environmental aspects of the use or whatever you want to call it?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,940.656,956.534,"No, I'd agree that at a certain point there might be certain circumstances where the state's environmental regulation could conceivably be too onerous and could affect the actual mining use, the ability to carry out the mining use on federal lands."
1986.85-1200,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,971.377,981.316,"Well, we really have nothing before us here to tell us how demanding the California Coastal Commission would be that has jurisdiction, isn't that right?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,981.316,982.466,"That's correct, that's absolutely right."
1986.85-1200,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,982.466,994.223,What do you think the purpose of the consistency review provisions in CZMA are if the state has this independent power to regulate that you assert?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,994.223,1005.181,"Again, the consistency review provisions deal with the effects that activities on federal lands have offsite on non-federal lands."
1986.85-1200,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1061.851,1091.57,Did I understand you correctly to concede that the land at issue here held under the mining claim of Granite Pock fits within the definition of CZMA which excludes lands subject to the discretion of the federal government or held in trust by the federal government?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1091.57,1097.691,"Well, we believe the district correctly decided that question, but we don't think we have to reach it here."
1986.85-1200,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1105.761,1108.88,And you are willing to concede that they are in that definition?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1108.88,1111.415,"--For purposes here, yes, we would."
1986.85-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.604,1136.53,"Of course, if you construed the language in light of the legislative history as Congressional... a statement of Congressional intent to exclude any state regulation, the case would be over, wouldn't it?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1136.53,1147.254,"I think, but I think that question is directly answered by the federal CZMA regulations that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration adopted, 15 CFR 923."
1986.85-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.254,1156.194,"Well then, you don't concede for this case that these lands here have been excluded under the CZMA?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1156.194,1167.066,"Well, we think we can win the case even if they are excluded, because the CZMA doesn't preempt the state's inherent police power, and this Coastal Act is a police power statute."
1986.85-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.066,1169.252,"Well, it could if Congress intended it to?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1169.252,1171.286,"Yes, it could, it could."
1986.85-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.273,1182.344,"Well, who puts out the regulations you're talking to?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1182.344,1185.213,--This is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
1986.85-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.213,1186.146,Is that in the Department of Commerce?
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1186.146,1188.415,"Yes, and they administer the CZMA program."
1986.85-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.556,1210.579,"Well, the United States... and I suppose it's representing the Commerce Department... says you're wrong."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1210.579,1215.148,"Well, no, they didn't mention that provision, that regulation."
1986.85-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1221.719,1224.338,"Well, their argument is a preemption argument."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1224.338,1228.39,"Well, it is based on the idea that the excluded lands question--"
1986.85-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.39,1229.006,Of course it is.
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1229.006,1232.891,--controls.
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1232.891,1248.568,"Well, when this action was brought in the district court by your opponents to enjoin you from exacting any sort of a permit requirement, neither the district court nor the Court of Appeals really went into what that permit requirement required, did they?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1248.568,1249.669,"No, neither one."
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.669,1260.541,"So in a sense, I suppose you're entitled to prevail if any sort of permit requirements that might reasonably be conceived of would not be entirely preempted."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1260.541,1261.275,Yes.
1986.85-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1285.259,1296.448,"So in your view, if California could impose any sort of requirement at all as a condition of its permit, you want to prevail here, because that was really the only issue before the courts below?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1296.448,1297.733,"That's correct, yes."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1298.833,1310.058,"Permitting, to go back to the distinction you seek to draw, the validity of which I'm not so sure about, the permitting is a permitting of use, right?"
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1313.66,1315.695,The permit is a vehicle for attaching--
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.695,1319.147,"Well, it may be a vehicle for that, but what you permit is the use."
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1319.147,1321.849,"--Well, we've conceded that we can't deny the use."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.336,1329.02,But of course you can deny a permit.
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1334.573,1341.345,"--No, only when there's a preemption limit and when we can't deny a particular federally authorized use."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.345,1344.981,But when you deny a permit you are denying a particular use.
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1347.749,1349.383,"Yes, that's correct."
1986.85-1200,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.426,1364.795,I think we're saying the same thing.
1986.85-1200,0,34831,linus_masouredis,,1370.097,1371.531,"Right, yes."
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1592.654,1595.073,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1200,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.535,1643.22,"Now, your opponent I don't think agrees with you, Ms. Banke."
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1654.445,1678.893,"Your Honor, there is no purpose for the permitting process other than an intent by the Coastal Commission to control the use of these lands, because the Coastal Commission already has the right, as does the state of California, to set environmental standards for air quality and water quality, solid waste management, fire prevention."
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.618,1690.051,Excuse me.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1696.622,1702.442,The Forest Service regulations state that the Forest Service is to apply state and federal standards.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.442,1703.044,That's not what I asked.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1706.079,1706.679,I believe they--
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.679,1711.198,"Do those state laws apply ex proprio vigore, as we say?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1711.198,1721.839,--I believe that the Forest Service does have discretion to ascertain whether those regulations are an unreasonable constraint on the use of the federal lands.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.141,1727.243,I'm not sure.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1736.182,1737.699,The use of the federal lands.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.699,1740.217,Unless they unduly inhibit the use of the federal lands.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1740.217,1740.683,But in this case--
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.683,1747.573,"So basically, as far as the application of the state environmental laws are concerned, you don't disagree with the state of California?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1751.258,1758.862,--I believe that we do quibble with the state of California over whether it may in this case impose a coastal development permit--
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.862,1759.564,"Right, okay."
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1759.564,1760.714,--on the use of these lands.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.714,1779.109,"If they did this by ordinary application of their environmental laws and moved in on the mining company on the basis of some other statute than this particular one, you'd say exactly what the state of California says, that they can do it so long as it doesn't unduly inhibit mining, whatever that means?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1779.109,1782.06,"Yes, through those standards, and those have been applied."
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.762,1787.281,"It's a very small dispute we have before us, then, isn't it?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1787.281,1789.483,"Well, it's a major dispute to Granite Rock."
1986.85-1200,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1825.606,1827.941,"Well, why was it that stark?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1832.727,1833.679,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1200,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.679,1847.42,"""Granite Rock is hereby notified of its obligation to submit for Coastal Commission review and approval a certification of consistency with the state's coastal management program and for any future plan of operations. """
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1852.141,1856.026,"Your Honor, it is not the consistency review aspect of that letter that we're challenging."
1986.85-1200,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.682,1900.122,"So it's just a permit, and we don't know from this record what sort of conditions the Commission might have imposed in exchange for a permit?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1900.122,1921.368,"That is correct, except insofar as I believe they're disingenuous when they say they would only apply water or air quality, because those were already applied and would already be applied in a consistency review of any future plan of operations."
1986.85-1200,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1944.482,1948.184,"No consistency review was sought, was there?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1948.184,1950.97,No consistency review was sought at the earlier stage.
1986.85-1200,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1956.54,1957.74,I should ask your opponent.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1960.092,1961.528,I do not know.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.796,1979.087,"Let's assume that we agree that California can impose its environmental laws, but cannot impose a permit."
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,1989.459,1997.898,It can administer its environmental laws through standards which are applied to these lands and to the mining on these lands through consistency review.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.677,2017.379,But that's discretionary with the federal government.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2037.292,2046.981,I believe that the state would have a problem in that context and would have a dispute with the federal government over the standards it seeks to apply.
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.516,2062.074,Let's assume that the state has given its input and the plan of action or of operation wholly satisfies the state as it is issued.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2069.263,2069.913,If the federal--
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.913,2079.202,"Suppose that they send an inspector out there and your client just isn't living up to the permit, the federal permit."
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2081.052,2082.554,--I believe that they can go to court.
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.554,2084.071,And enforce their standards?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2084.071,2087.625,"Yes, because the Forest Service has a duty to enforce the standards."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.625,2095.527,"And what if the Forest Service says, you're all wrong, Mr. Inspector, they're completely complying with?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2107.519,2110.888,I believe it can if the company is not complying with the standards.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.525,2121.862,"Even though the federal government, as I understood Justice White's question, the federal government says they're complying, but the state thinks that they're not?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2121.862,2129.035,"--I believe that the federal government would have the last word and would prevail in that case, if in fact the company was complying with the standards."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.035,2129.884,You mean a judge wouldn't?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2132.069,2134.369,"Well, I believe that they would prevail in court."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.369,2141.259,"All the United States has to do is to go in and move to dismiss the action, saying: They're just wrong; they are in compliance?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2141.259,2147.079,"If the government of the United States could show that Granite Rock was in compliance, I believe that they would prevail."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.079,2149.615,"Well, who decides?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2149.615,2152.817,"The court would decide, in my opinion."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.817,2160.721,"Well, what if there is a trial and the government says they're complying, your client says they are not?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2163.773,2165.125,"Yes, I believe that would be the case."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.125,2173.563,"And the judge could then rule and say, Mr. Forest Service, you're dead wrong, Granite Rock is not complying?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2173.563,2178.782,If the Forest Service was incorrect in applying the standards.
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.782,2180.134,"Well, who decides?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2180.134,2184.352,"At the administrative level, I believe the Forest Service would decide."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.227,2204.266,"Well, is there any allegation here that the plan of operation that was issued did not contain the state standards?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2204.266,2205.183,No.
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.183,2207.702,Is there agreement that it did?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2207.702,2218.675,"We have stated in undisputed affidavits and in the plan of operations itself, which is in the appendix, it is stated that the state standards were applied for air quality and water quality."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.909,2222.227,"And even so, the state wants a permit?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2222.227,2225.013,"--Even so, the state wants a permit, yes."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.013,2232.869,"Just so they could enforce the... why would they need... they wouldn't need a permit to enforce those standards, I gather you say?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2232.869,2236.237,"Yes, that is my point, Justice White."
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.237,2239.673,"Well, aren't there other environmental considerations besides air and water quality?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2239.673,2240.473,Yes.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2240.473,2244.077,"I mean, such as, you know, removing a whole hillside that's there on the Big Sur?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2248.629,2252.164,"Technically, I believe the state could consider that an environmental concern."
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2262.121,2263.738,Shall be considered or shall be applied?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2263.738,2264.321,Shall be applied.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.321,2264.906,Or shall apply?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2265.956,2268.692,"Shall apply, shall be applied."
1986.85-1200,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.179,2289.272,"But does that mean that if the state during the existence of a permit, after you've been mining for a couple of years, decided to make the standards a little more strict, would you have to comply with the more strict standard or only those that applied at the time you got the permit?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2289.272,2293.558,"Only those that applied at the time of the permit, I believe, until a new permit was sought."
1986.85-1200,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.558,2296.259,So that the state could not change the standard?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2296.259,2298.877,I do not believe that the state could change the standard.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.877,2299.827,"Well, I am really confused."
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2320.725,2323.779,I believe that they cannot go beyond that.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.779,2324.412,"It's the latter, okay."
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2324.412,2325.529,Yes.
1986.85-1200,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2353.714,2359.718,Are the mining regulations such that these people could ultimately patent this claim?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2359.718,2376.644,"Ultimately, if all goes well in the exploratory phases of the mining operation which Granite Rock is currently... was engaged in prior to the letter and would re-engage in if approval of the plan of operations is obtained, yes, ultimately they can patent."
1986.85-1200,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.644,2380.531,And now they have a right of occupancy and a right to pursue their mining activities?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2380.531,2384.4,"Yes, they do have a right of occupancy and to pursue the mining activities."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.359,2429.929,Suppose there was no federal coastal act and no plan of operation at all.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2463.75,2464.686,No.
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.304,2478.494,And even though as far as the federal government was concerned it was mining and it was doing a permissible job of mining?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2478.494,2485.248,"If the company was engaged in what would be a nuisance, pollution of the waterway, the state could enforce it."
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.248,2491.419,So you... take it then you say it's the federal coastal zone act that does the preempting.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2491.419,2495.721,There are several things that do the preempting in my opinion.
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.073,2499.59,"Well, the mining law by itself wouldn't."
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2501.625,2502.492,The mining law--
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.492,2503.894,You just said it wouldn't.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2503.894,2507.429,"--That is correct, it would not prohibit that type of regulation."
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2524.622,2526.991,Suppose they weren't polluting a state waterway.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2545.718,2553.474,"I do not believe that independently it would be binding, because it is already provided for in the Forest Service regulations."
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.474,2559.778,"No, I was adopting Justice White's forest primeval hypothesis."
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2573.037,2574.254,Then it might apply.
1986.85-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.56,2584.179,So it really is the Act and the regulations that do the preempting primarily.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2584.179,2584.645,Yes.
1986.85-1200,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.474,2609.378,So federal lands in the coastal zone are less subject to state regulation that federal lands outside the coastal zone?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2609.378,2623.804,"No, I believe that that statement is consistent with law, that it is a clear exposition of the law, that a state may not control the use and disposition of the lands."
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.92,2692.429,"Ms. Banke, what do you do about the regulations that, as I recall, they require that the mining company have obtained all necessary permits, which seems to refer to state permits?"
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2692.429,2696.798,The regulations I don't believe contain that statement.
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2700.25,2700.868,In the plan.
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2700.868,2703.837,"And that, there are two reasons."
1986.85-1200,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2715.11,2720.662,What permit wouldn't be preempted?
1986.85-1200,1,17449,barbara_r_banke,,2738.725,2740.925,I don't... it is not conceded.
1986.85-1200,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2764.607,2766.543,"Thank you, Ms. Banke."
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2774.732,2780.552,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.081,2829.449,What if it weren't California coastal zone management program?
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2837.305,2841.024,It depends on the source of the law that California is seeking to impose.
1986.85-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.251,2856.501,Okay.
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2865.289,2871.043,Other environmental laws... California may have other environmental laws that impose permitting requirements.
1986.85-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.418,2884.553,Even though they bear upon mining use and even though they require a preliminary permit?
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2884.553,2885.186,Yes.
1986.85-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.068,2913.388,So California could essentially achieve what it wanted to do here by just putting in a different statute?
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2913.388,2917.174,It could with respect to what we view as pollution control requirements.
1986.85-1200,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2924.78,2933.718,But you seem to know a good deal more about what the California Coastal Commission might require as a condition of this permit than a lot of other people in the case.
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2939.872,2954.18,"Well, we have to judge the statute based on what the California Coastal Act provides, and the California Coastal Act provides that any development within the coastal zone must obtain... any developer, must obtain a coastal development permit."
1986.85-1200,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2964.571,2967.19,"But that's been waived in this case, hasn't it?"
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2969.891,2973.026,"Well, this is something apart from the consistency review requirements."
1986.85-1200,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.338,3080.779,You do not confront the problem of having inland states more restricted than coastal states by reason of the Coastal Zone Management Act.
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3097.907,3112.667,"--Justice Scalia, we suggest this is a bit of a red herring here, because a mining development 100 miles inland is subject to the same regulations of the California regime that a similar mining development inland would be subject to."
1986.85-1200,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3127.677,3134.331,"Mr. Minear, the Court of Appeals opinion of course didn't go off on the CZMA ground at all."
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3134.331,3135.699,"Yes, that is correct."
1986.85-1200,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3135.699,3145.821,And I take it you are urging that we decide the case on a ground not decided or discussed in the Ninth Circuit opinion?
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3145.821,3147.038,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1200,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3224.84,3239.231,"Mr. Minear, has California attempted to engage in a so-called consistency review process to make its coastal zone management provisions applicable to federal lands such as this?"
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3239.231,3239.6,Your Honor--
1986.85-1200,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3239.6,3243.718,Did they make that effort through the consistency review process?
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3243.718,3252.007,"--California waived that opportunity in this particular case, and it will have that opportunity again when Granite Rock submits a new plan of operations."
1986.85-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3310.526,3318.799,"Under the Coastal Zone Act, I suppose California could have required a permit for this mining development?"
1986.85-1200,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3318.799,3323.333,"It could not have... in our view, it could not have required a land use permit."
1986.85-1200,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3343.864,3344.764,"Thank you, Mr. Mienar."
1986.85-1200,3,34831,linus_masouredis,,3347.816,3348.735,"Yes, very briefly."
1986.85-1200,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3528.2,3530.518,Is that regulation in your brief?
1986.85-1200,3,34831,linus_masouredis,,3530.518,3535.303,"Yes, it is."
1986.85-1200,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3568.707,3569.976,"Thank you, Mr. Masouredis."
