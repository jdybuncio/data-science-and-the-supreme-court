1959.376,1,41616,sidney_g_kusworm,,2452.562,2454.935,He didn't -- he didn't protest.
1959.376,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2457.404,2462.676,"That was -- that was an enforced gift, wasn't it?"
1959.376,1,41616,sidney_g_kusworm,,2462.676,2467.021,"Well if Your Honor pleases, I'm not going to make an interpretation."
1959.376,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2480.976,2481.555,A what?

1959.376,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2686.948,2690.547,Who made -- who made the gifts?
1959.376,1,41616,sidney_g_kusworm,,2691.788,2697.319,"Berman made the gift as far as Duberstein was concerned, Your Honor."
1959.376,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2697.319,2698.789,Well.
1959.376,1,41616,sidney_g_kusworm,,2698.789,2704.028,I mean I thought he knew about it.
1959.376,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2739.229,2746.078,"The – although so far as Duberstein was concerned, Berman had made the presentation of the Cadillac."
1959.376,1,41616,sidney_g_kusworm,,2750.805,2760.105,"As far as we know, Mr. Justice Stewart, Your Honor, it was on Mohawk books but of course that's only because the revenue agent told us that."

1959.376,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3250.645,3258.328,Isn't it true also that the Pot O' Gold case was expressly corrected by the 1954 statute?
1959.376,2,37869,philip_elman,,3258.328,3277.454,"Yes, the 1954 Code does take care of prize and that kind of a prize would be taxable, but we think the Pot O' Gold was wrong under the 1939 Code for the simple reason, that a windfall and a gift are not synonymous."
