2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.824,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-371, Taylor versus Sturgell."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,8.18,17.599,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is the basic principle of American law that a lawsuit does not decide the rights of non-parties."
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,34.484,51.712,"When you have a situation where it is an associational standing case, and an individual is the one that's relied upon give the association standing, in that case is the individual, even though he's not bringing the suit, is he barred by the association's case?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,51.712,60.334,I think that would depend on whether the association in that case had the authority to bring that case on behalf of that individual.
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,91.573,99.535,"What if you had a case and there's a suspicion of something like that that's here, although the courts below did not so find?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,127.261,129.241,"No, not just on those facts."
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,130.525,130.977,Why.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,130.977,134.522,--first that is a big shift from what was decided blow.
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,142.706,148.127,"It held, as I recall, specifically, I think, that there was no collusion found."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,158.979,164.352,Collusion is sort of a pejorative way of saying an agreement.
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,171.318,174.289,Why wouldn't my example have done so?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,191.139,196.621,"--No, not without the party to the first case controlling the second case."
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,197.838,199.308,Why should that... why should that matter?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,199.308,205.539,--Because what's being protected here is the person's right to the opportunity to be heard on their claim.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.366,207.103,But--
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,207.103,207.711,--second claim.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,207.711,214.645,--The claim that Justice Souter has posited is not one that the second person would have been... he was soliciting.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,222.69,223.345,Exactly.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.345,225.672,"--As far as we know, Taylor didn't even know about the first case."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,245.119,246.243,Exactly.
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,254.049,254.21,Right.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,292.241,304.376,"--Well, again, that's a question of whether that second party is acting as an agent for the first party and really just trying to relitigate that first party's opportunity to be heard."
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,320.914,326.534,"Well, do you think that the collusion point was perhaps just ill-phrased here?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,359.379,372.813,"Well, I think the court of appeals found that there was no collusion because the facts that are in the record about the relationship between Taylor and Herrick do not demonstrate that there was any collusion."
2007.07-371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,372.813,378.779,"Well, didn't the court of appeals actually say there was no collusion, or did it say, we don't need to reach that question?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,378.779,382.526,"It said that the facts were ambiguous, and it did not need to decide it."
2007.07-371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,393.648,398.6,So these facts do not necessarily show collusion to avoid the preclusive effects of Herrick?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,398.6,399.443,--Yes.
2007.07-371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,399.443,403.143,We do not need to determine whether they count as tactical maneuvering.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,409.769,411.064,They did say that.
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,430.681,439.49,"But here the close relationship seems to boil down to this, and you correct me if I'm wrong here because I may be missing some fact."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,472.866,474.473,--Yes.
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,483.27,483.691,Okay.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,489.439,498.28,"Taylor is the executive director of the Antique Aircraft Association, and he is someone who is interested in antique aircraft and in aviation generally."
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.961,516.52,"You don't need a reason to file a FOIA request anyway, right?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,530.564,531.063,--Yes.
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.874,534.982,"I mean somebody could have walked in off the street and filed this same lawsuit, right?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,534.982,538.433,--Anyone who was interested in the record could file a FOIA request for them.
2007.07-371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,538.433,554.175,"But if somebody walked in off the street and began this lawsuit and had absolutely no connection with Herrick, and so on, the issue of preclusion wouldn't come up, or at least it wouldn't come up in the context that it comes up here."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,573.372,585.695,"Well, it shows that the problem, if it exists, of there being repeated litigation over the same records is not one that would be solved through preclusion."
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,600.969,610.277,"What about if it is the executive director of the association, and the suit is brought in the name the association, and they lose."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,617.387,636.657,"The question... that would then come down to whether or not he controlled the first case, because one of the categories in which people are bound by prior litigation in which they were not themselves parties, is if they had control over the first case and had the full and fair opportunity to litigate in that case."
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,636.657,643.298,"Well, let's say that it is somebody above him, you know, the president of the association, who decides what lawsuits are brought, and he's just the executive director?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,643.298,649.264,But he was not in control of the first case and did not get his opportunity to be heard in that case--
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,649.264,651.842,"But he recommended to the president, said we ought to file this lawsuit."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,657.574,670.068,"--If he was not in control of that first case, yes, he could go ahead as an individual if he was not... if he is not representing the association in the second case, but is, instead, representing himself."
2007.07-371,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,670.068,679.797,And could he continue to solicit other members of the association to file FOIA suits all over the country until they finally got a favorable decision?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,679.797,689.73,"Well, that would come down to what the definition of ""solicit"" was and whether those people were acting as agents of that person who is doing the soliciting."
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,730.292,742.303,"Well, that means your statement implicates very serious questions of standing under Article III, whether Congress can say create the injury by saying you've been denied records and, therefore, you have standing."
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.616,750.16,Although it is not really just your argument; it is also FOIA; isn't it?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,750.16,759.047,--That is the way Congress set up FOIA is to... to give people that statutory entitlement to the records.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,759.047,761.812,And it does cover idle curiosity.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,774.322,775.87,Exactly.
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.307,886.042,What are your clear rules?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,897.929,899.489,No.
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.875,909.281,Right.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,909.281,911.968,"--after the first suit, yet is nonetheless bound by the--"
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.968,912.982,So what are your tests?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,918.013,918.824,"--No, it's--"
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,918.824,919.807,You have some criteria.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,920.215,920.886,--There are an--
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.886,922.087,Agency?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,922.087,938.519,"--Well, agency would fall into a larger category of, that there are certain Legal relationships that treat people as the same person for res judicata purposes and often for other purposes; and those are substantive relationships created by underlying substantive law."
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,938.519,939.533,Okay.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,939.533,950.592,"People can also be bound when they have... have had their full and fair opportunity to litigate in the prior case, through some involvement in that case."
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.839,960.619,Okay.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,960.619,965.71,And then people can be bound when they were represented in the prior case.
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.174,975.565,A representative that they agreed to?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,975.565,976.364,Exactly.
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.94,981.702,"As in a class action, where they have the... the ability to bow out if they want, right?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,981.702,1013.113,"--Well, a class action is a very good example of that representational relationship, and the court of appeals in this case used language that is very similar to the rationales used for class actions, talking about identity of interests and adequacy of representation, but it did not include any of the protections that are inherent in class actions: the factors that need to be looked at to make sure that class treatment is appropriate."
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.971,1016.673,Yes.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1021.844,1022.499,Yes.
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.499,1024.297,That is crucial.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1024.297,1026.89,That is crucial in class actions.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1026.89,1038.869,"And the judge's obligation to look out for the trial to see, for example, any settlement has to be approved by the judge to make sure it is fair to the absent class members."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1038.869,1039.463,Yes.
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1056.284,1082.146,"If this case had been one in which were notice, before the suit was filed... or at the outset of the suit, and some encouragement to go ahead with the suit, would that have fit your, I guess, second category of adequate representation, adequate opportunity to have your... a case heard?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1082.146,1084.364,The category of having the full and fair opportunity--
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1084.364,1084.786,Yes.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1084.786,1085.663,--To litigate to the--
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1085.663,1086.256,From a fair--
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1086.256,1087.878,--Case... no.
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.787,1090.784,--And that is because?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1090.784,1098.142,--That is because that would basically be setting up a system of mandatory voluntary intervention.
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1098.142,1104.717,But why doesn't that fit at least the semantic version of the category you gave us?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1104.717,1111.681,Because that person still is not receiving... is not fully and fairly litigating that case.
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1124.974,1127.614,Your list of factors is cumulative?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1136.703,1139.702,--It can be in certain circumstances.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1141.091,1144.105,The word that we use is privity.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1149.853,1150.466,--Yes.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.466,1152.915,As the beneficiary and the trustee.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1152.915,1155.445,But--
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1155.445,1157.773,But... but that's not what... that's not what your second category was.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1165.63,1166.956,--The category talking about--
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.956,1167.439,Yes.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1167.439,1169.581,--Full and fair litigation?
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.581,1170.049,Right.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1171.284,1175.968,"Well, the problem with the term ""privity"" is that privity is often used as somewhat at the conclusion--"
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.968,1176.342,Right.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1176.342,1178.733,--to mean that someone is bound by the prior case.
2007.07-371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1178.733,1179.248,Right.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1179.248,1191.181,"What is generally meant by the privity, or often... the way the word is often used to mean that a substantive legal relationship, but lower courts have sometimes put the control cases in the category of privity."
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.13,1207.628,"We can use it accurately, bring it back to what it really means...--"
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1209.251,1219.186,What if you have a situation where a client has retained a law firm to do something and the law firm as part of its normal activity files a FOIA request?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1239.148,1246.877,"--Who would... if the company filed its own FOIA case, we request on behalf--"
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1246.877,1257.655,"No, the law firm... the law firm files its own FOIA request, and it is denied, and they litigate that, and then they lose, and the company brings a FOIA action."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1257.655,1259.998,--And the law firm brought it on behalf of the law firm--
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1259.998,1260.42,Right.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1260.42,1262.432,--But the company is bringing it on behalf of the company?
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1262.432,1262.888,Yes.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1262.888,1269.073,Then they are separate requestors who each have... who have their own opportunity to be heard on their own FOIA claim.
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.073,1272.321,Even if company is represented by the same law firm?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1272.321,1273.445,Yes.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1276.459,1277.351,Which is the case here.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1279.348,1280.553,Yes.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1281.536,1291.094,"But in the case of the Chief's hypothetical, of course, it would never come up, if the client sends another lawyer to bring this."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1300.512,1305.775,"--Well, people are not generally precluded because of their lawyers' actions in prior cases."
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1307.117,1313.675,"But... I guess to be fair to my hypothetical, it was the company that was paying for what the law firm was doing."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1324.018,1336.278,--The question there would come down to whether the company was representing the... whether the law firm in that instance was representing the company with the authority to be representing the company.
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1336.918,1338.138,Is it purely a formal inquiry?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1347.008,1360.658,--I think it would go to the underlying agreement between the law firm and the company and whether the company had somehow given the law firm authority to be filing this FOIA request and then filing the lawsuit.
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1360.658,1369.202,"Why isn't that not like Montana, where the government was not a party to the case but it was in control of what the contractor was doing?"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1369.202,1371.171,Right.
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.792,1380.791,I think you'd also say that if the company paid for the suit.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1390.27,1397.799,--I think that could be an indicator that the company was... that the law firm was representing the company.
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.799,1398.127,No.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1413.667,1422.351,"If the law firm does not have the authority to represent the company, then it's hard to see how the company could be bound by a decision--"
2007.07-371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1422.351,1435.457,"You don't think that somebody who finances... who solicits a litigation, recruits someone to bring the case, pays for it, and then says,"
2007.07-371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.623,1450.764,I think you've got to give that one away.
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1451.949,1453.853,--I think that that's a harder instance.
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1455.822,1456.165,"Well, it's a company--"
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1456.165,1456.976,--control a case.
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1456.976,1468.659,"--Let's say some group, say, Public Citizen Litigation Group sends a fundraising thing around saying we think all our members ought to contribute to a special fund so that we can bring a lawsuit under FOIA."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1473.08,1474.016,No.
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1474.016,1479.749,So it make as difference if it's one company as opposed to 40 donors?
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1479.749,1487.965,"Well, again it comes back to whether those people have given the person bringing the case the authority to represent them in that lawsuit."
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1487.965,1491.463,"Well, then in the previous hypothetical there was no authority to represent."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1494.399,1499.211,"Yes, and I still think in that situation there also would not be preclusion."
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1509.174,1509.752,"Well, controls."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1518.451,1525.556,"--If they had not given the law firm the authority to represent them in that particular case, then they are not bound."
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.556,1532.649,"Well, they said, yes, you can represent us, and we're three different companies, and, you know, it's a majority vote as to what you can do."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1532.649,1544.894,"Well, then that is sort of standard representation by a law firm of a company, and those people would be legally represented in that lawsuit, have had their day in court and would be bound by that decision."
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1547.628,1548.626,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-371,0,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,1548.626,1549.535,Thank you.
2007.07-371,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1549.535,1555.75,Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1555.75,1572.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Although the precise formulation adopted by the court of appeals may be somewhat novel, its holding of a finding of privity here is consistent with well-established principles of res judicata."
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1592.827,1595.575,Would you explain to me how that could possibly work?
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1636.867,1654.579,"Well, I think it's important to start by recognizing that even Petitioner acknowledges that there can be circumstances in which Taylor would be bound, even though at the time, at the end of Herrick's litigation, he had no notice, he had not participated."
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.521,1672.399,Because he's asking for Herrick who is bound by the first case.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1672.399,1673.117,--That's right.
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1681.848,1692.17,"Because what you're saying is the person who is really in the second case is the same person who was in the first case, and Taylor is simply acting as an agent to give Herrick another chance?"
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1692.17,1693.75,--That's... that's right.
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1693.75,1695.481,But we're talking about binding Taylor.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1695.481,1703.946,Well... but Taylor in the second suit that he brings as agent to advance the interests of Herrick would be bound.
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1706.337,1708.493,There was no finding of that.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1716.772,1722.236,"--Well, I don't... the court certainly did not find that there was no collusion."
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1724.329,1724.704,No.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1725.577,1728.14,"--It didn't reach the question of what they called ""tactical maneuvering""."
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.947,1755.724,If he... if he was his agent... and this goes to Justice Ginsburg's line of inquiry... suppose in the second case Herrick tells him I want you to bring a suit on my behalf.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1777.542,1778.166,No.
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1779.216,1782.104,"So long as there's no more collusion or anything else, he's--"
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1782.104,1790.804,"--If Taylor brought the second suit in his own name and it was found to be barred by res judicata, a third suit in Taylor's own name would likewise be barred."
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.266,1801.485,--I hope so.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1801.485,1802.908,--because...--
2007.07-371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1834.16,1836.971,Did you make your friend on the other side aware that you'd be--
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1836.971,1837.455,--Yes.
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.904,1963.998,That's a... it's a standard privity case.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1994.156,1994.769,--Well--
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.769,1997.237,It's up privity instead of down privity.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,1997.861,2007.684,--I think what Your Honor is reacting to is the reality of the situation seems to be that there's a sufficient relationship between these two that they ought to be barred.
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2021.819,2035.592,"There is in the... in the Restatement of Judgment, as far as I know, all of the examples involve a representational relationship that existed at the time of the first litigation."
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2042.155,2059.914,"Well, Your Honor, I agree that the Restatement (Second) does not, for example, state the law which we all know and which Petitioner concedes is the case, and that is that the agent who brings the second lawsuit is bound, even if the agency relationship arose--"
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2059.914,2061.052,"Yes, but here--"
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2061.052,2061.708,--after the first relation was concluded.
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2061.708,2064.879,--Do you agree with me about the facts that we're dealing with here?
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2073.199,2085.791,"What the evidence shows is that Herrick made Taylor aware of the... of the outcome of the litigation, but we don't have--"
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2085.791,2089.179,"But... and while the litigation is ongoing, Taylor doesn't know about it, right?"
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2089.179,2090.802,--There's no evidence of that.
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2090.802,2091.224,Okay.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2097.614,2100.282,"Well, the--"
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2100.282,2103.145,--after Herrick lost his case?
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2103.145,2115.233,"--The evidence is that Herrick asked Taylor to help him fix the plane, the plane and its restoration being the object of Herrick's own FOIA case."
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2119.651,2120.634,But that wasn't my question.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2120.634,2121.355,--to the restoration of the plane--
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2121.355,2132.363,"My question, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, is: Did Herrick ask Taylor to file that FOIA suit?"

2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.41,2142.236,Is there any evidence that Herrick financed the litigation?
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2142.236,2147.154,--The... there is no specific evidence of that.
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2149.202,2151.857,Is there any evidence that Herrick called any of the shots in that litigation?
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2151.857,2165.306,"--Well, counsel on the other side filed an affidavit that said... it was very carefully crafted, I think... that there was no attorney-client relationship with Herrick with respect to this--"
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2165.306,2169.193,"In any case, the decision that we're reviewing didn't find any of those things."
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2169.193,2169.974,"--No, that's right."
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2188.247,2209.394,"So if another member of the club, let's say another member of the aviation association who's interested in antique planes, just files a FOIA request, would that person be precluded who is... who knows that Herrick brought a suit and lost?"
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2216.346,2219.127,"No, that person is not barred."
2007.07-371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2220.234,2226.825,"--Even if he's the individual in the club that gave the club standing, associational standing?"
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2226.825,2245.753,"--I think in... Your Honor's first question to opposing counsel was such that, yes, I think that if that was the individual whose interest was relied upon to give an association standing, that it would bind the individual whose name and interest was relied on."
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2250.249,2253.86,"But my question was just a member of the association, whether--"
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2253.86,2262.482,"--No, the court of appeals was clear that just a common membership in an association or just a common interest would not be enough."
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2268.133,2269.743,--But why does there have to be any interest?
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2282.456,2284.83,--That... that's true.
2007.07-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.23,2298.217,Let me ask a general question here.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2302.105,2305.384,"--Well, because FOIA allows--"
2007.07-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.384,2308.243,Repeated requests--
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2308.243,2308.961,--a number of defendants--
2007.07-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2308.961,2312.646,"--but if they're all the same, wouldn't they say, well, that's the same case we had last week?"
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2312.646,2316.507,"--Well, FOIA allows the case to be brought in a number of different venues."
2007.07-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.473,2323.269,All right.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2323.269,2333.465,"And so a person such as Herrick could ask for assistance on his project, the project of rebuilding the plane, of people scattered throughout the country."
2007.07-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.465,2335.044,"Correct, and he's the one who raised the suit."
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2335.044,2336.011,And they could maintain it throughout the country.
2007.07-371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2336.011,2343.697,"But did any... defeat the suit by claiming there was preclusion because of a suit in another jurisdiction, rather than stare decisis?"
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2343.697,2353.926,"Well, Your Honor, the fact is that in FOIA, especially an exemption 4 case, there are special burdens on the government."
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.26,2474.315,"--Counsel, you have described for us a thousand-headed monster of litigation, and your proposal for a solution is to cut off one eyebrow."
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2503.117,2504.381,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2504.381,2505.492,Why should we stretch for that?
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2505.492,2508.677,--We are not advocating a broad rule.
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.489,2510.159,No.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2510.159,2523.203,"--think that's one of the virtues of our argument: That where there is a document that is of true public interest such that multiple individuals on entirely independent grounds might well seek it, they would not be barred."
2007.07-371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2552.442,2553.128,That sounds like--
2007.07-371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2553.128,2555.44,Is this an approach that only applies in FOIA cases?
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2562.016,2564.967,"--Well, the rule is a broader rule."
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2621.49,2624.973,I'm not sure what the hypothetical is.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2637.424,2647.59,"--But it recognizes there could be a close-enough relationship between the two such that the purposes of the rule would be satisfied, but there is no legal, familial relationship."
2007.07-371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2648.604,2660.224,"And if all that has been proved, the problem is that the D.C. Circuit said: We're not going to look into what they call strategic whatever."
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2667.002,2681.262,"--They didn't need to because of the fact that Taylor had voluntarily taken up Herrick's interests to get a second bite at the litigatory apple, as the First Circuit put it."
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2706.738,2710.454,"It is sort of a totality-of-the-circumstances test in every case, right."
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2710.454,2711.109,--Well--
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2711.109,2715.282,"We look at the whole thing, and we say, you know, close enough relationship."
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2722.542,2733.21,"--Well, Your Honor, it is interesting that the restatement with respect to the third category in the reply brief... they called it the third category of control perhaps."
2007.07-371,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2748.966,2747.468,That's just as bad.
2007.07-371,1,20751,douglas_hallward_driemeier,,2749.827,2751.231,That is the nature... that is the nature of res judicata principles.
2007.07-371,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2760.633,2762.118,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,2769.535,2789.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Scalia, I'd like to begin with the question that you posed earlier regarding privity and what it really means, because that's what has given rise, I think, to all of these vexing hypotheticals and to your concern about this being nothing more than a completely freewheeling, totality-of-the circumstances test."
2007.07-371,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2890.752,2898.575,"There was no showing that Herrick ever asked Taylor... well, there is a showing that they're interested in rebuilding this plane or restoring the plane."
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,2914.757,2925.394,"--I agree with you the D.C. Circuit didn't find collusion, looking at Petitioner's appendix 17-A at two things: The timing of the suit and the sharing of discovery."
2007.07-371,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3005.206,3018.574,"Look, I concede we can all see where you're going, but isn't the problem this: In effect, you're asking us to infer a finding of fact, and we're not the trial court."
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3043.986,3052.92,"Two responses, Your Honor: The first is that conclusion was precisely the conclusion that was drawn by the D.C. Circuit on the close-relationship point."
2007.07-371,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3070.413,3071.1,Okay.
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3093.889,3096.31,"--The district court, in fact, held precisely that."
2007.07-371,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3096.31,3096.981,What did it--
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3096.981,3108.149,In joint appendix 35-A... in Petitioner's appendix 35-A the district court concluded as a factual finding that there was deliberate maneuvering based on two things.
2007.07-371,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3108.149,3120.924,That's out of the case because the court of appeals said: We do not need to determine whether they count as tactical maneuvering.
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3122.531,3125.498,"Well, I'm going to resist you slightly, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-371,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3127.966,3128.984,It could be remanded.
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3136.962,3142.585,What the district court found constituted collusion was identical interests and the request.
2007.07-371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3154.783,3159.704,What... what the opinion said is to review the bidding.
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3183.242,3205.2,"--The discussion that precedes the reviewing of the bidding references with respect to the close-relationship finding the request from Mr. Herrick to Mr. Taylor to assist in the repair of his plane, the request that is featured in joint appendix 32 as the preceding factor to the filing of the FOIA action."
2007.07-371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3224.319,3231.815,"Well, what about the associational cases: The association brings a suit in the interests of the members?"
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3233.269,3244.121,"Well, it depends on... it depends on a couple of things, Mr. Chief Justice, but the first thing it depends on is a finding that the interests of the association and of the members is identical."
2007.07-371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3246.012,3250.087,"Association standing cases we talk about germane, right?"
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3250.087,3250.949,--Right.
2007.07-371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3250.949,3252.072,Is that enough?
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3252.072,3256.557,I think... I think the interests need to... to be identical.
2007.07-371,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3321.607,3329.399,"Anyone... anyone in this audience, and anyone in the association would be a proper FOIA plaintiff; is that right?"
2007.07-371,2,20037,catherine_e_stetson,,3329.399,3330.884,--That is right.
2007.07-371,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3383.111,3384.628,"Thank you, Ms. Stetson."
2007.07-371,3,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3394.217,3395.609,Thank you.
2007.07-371,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3474.2,3481.573,"What if two people get together who want the same documents for the same purpose, which is they think they're going to make money off of it."
2007.07-371,3,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3487.442,3492.254,--So they bring--
2007.07-371,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3492.254,3495.846,"Separate... separate suits, separate requests, separate suits."
2007.07-371,3,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3506.796,3513.325,--I think what would have to be looked at there is control or representation.
2007.07-371,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3556.339,3566.63,"Ms. Stetson said that the district court unlike the court of appeals, did find collusion, and she referred to a page that I didn't check."
2007.07-371,3,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3566.63,3571.161,The district court did think that there was tactical maneuvering happening here.
2007.07-371,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3581.312,3591.154,"Do you think we need to remand this for consideration of whether or not there was an agreement, if we conclude that what we see from the court of appeals opinion isn't enough?"
2007.07-371,3,16813,adina_h_rosenbaum,,3603.024,3604.334,Yes.
2007.07-371,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3649.3,3650.271,"Thank you, Ms. Rosenbaum."
