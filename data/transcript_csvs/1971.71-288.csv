1971.71-288,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,54.694,"We'll hear arguments next in 71-288, Laird against Tatum and others."
1971.71-288,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,59.35,62.882,May it please the Court.
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,1805.799,1809.3,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2023.858,2026.459,The allegation as I under -- I have it before me --
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2026.459,2029.702,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2029.702,2030.687,-- it is a little ambiguous.
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2047.365,2048.688,"Well, I do not think so Mr. Justice."
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2065.248,2074.362,"There's no allegation, any specific or explicit allegations or wire tapping or what became known as bugging or anything at that nature here that I've been able to find."
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2074.362,2075.792,"No, there is not Mr. Justice."
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2093.184,2103.173,"In short, I am right am I not in understanding this complaint as not relying on the Fourth Amendment but rather on the First Amendment?"
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2103.173,2117.197,"Essentially, this is the First Amendment complaint, that's correct. Except in so far as the allegations of invasion of the right of privacy include of course both the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment and whatever other constitutional provisions have been invoked in its [Voice overlap]."
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2117.197,2121.855,The Ninth and Tenth and the few others but it's basically a First Amendment complaint?
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2121.855,2126.249,"Essentially, the complaint is that the Army was invading the First Amendment Rights of the plaintiffs."
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2126.249,2130.471,"Not the Fourth Amendment rights as such, that's not the gravamen of the complaint?"
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2130.471,2131.884,That would not be the essential gravamen of the complaint.
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.884,2133.828,Okay.
1971.71-288,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2133.828,2137.363,"There was no answer here, only the motion to dismiss?"
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2137.363,2140.946,"That's correct Mr. Justice Douglas, only the motion to dismiss."
1971.71-288,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2329.724,2333.748,But the Solicitor General said the tip is the only thing we have.
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2333.748,2343.57,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, our allegations we believe are complete and state clearly a justiciable claim."
1971.71-288,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2393.611,2398.65,"I thought you're going to say if you got to trial, you might put evidence on the same line."
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2402.326,2403.654,We could put witnesses on this.
1971.71-288,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2421.088,2424.122,(Inaudible)
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2424.122,2432.604,"Mr. Justice Marshall, it was our understanding that we were going to have an evidentiary hearing that morning."
1971.71-288,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2482.346,2492.334,"Before you leave the facts, I understood you to say that the Solicitor General had misstated the facts that he made reference to electronic equipment."
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2494.141,2504.71,"Yes, Mr. Justice, I believe he says that we are complaining about a generalized system which does not focus concretely on these plaintiffs."
1971.71-288,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2633.266,2660.481,"Mr. Askin, suppose instead of sending agents, the military for whatever reason relied upon newspaper clipping services and just identified certain people in certain organizations who had a clipping service and fed them into their data banks, would you feel that that violated some constitutional rights of the persons affected?"
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2660.481,2664.075,"Of course Mr. Chief Justice, that's not our case."
1971.71-288,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2667.532,2670.1,"These were all public meetings, were they not?"
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2670.1,2682.619,"Well, the meetings we're talking about in the exhibit to the complaint republic meetings that suggest we made allegations that they were also gathering information by other kinds of clandestine methods."
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2861.992,2883.596,I'd understood the Government's argument and this plays the case at least in terms of standing to be that certainly there would be judicial review on when any individual plaintiff could show that he had been actually injured just as a matter of standing.
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2883.596,2885.175,"Mr. Justice Stewart, on standing [Voice overlap]."
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2885.222,2894.819,"Or perhaps, justiciable controversy or cases or controversy, we all agree these concepts run into each other and overlap the deal."
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2894.819,2905.826,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, on the question of standing, first of all, it is unlikely that any particular plaintiff, any particular individual is ever going to find out exactly what happened to him."
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2905.826,2910.676,Well he'll find out if he lost his job or if he were denied the clearance to some --
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2910.676,2911.094,He would never know Mr. Justice.
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2911.094,2920.616,-- confidential information in a place where he works or at a variety of other ways at which are reflected in many of the decisions in this Court.
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2927.322,2929.188,"Yes, but - I'm sorry."
1971.71-288,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2929.188,2929.993,I am finished.
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2929.993,2936.279,But indeed it is very unlikely that such a person would ever know why it was that he lost that job.
1971.71-288,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2968.681,2970.316,Your time is consumed.
1971.71-288,1,23535,frank_askin,,2972.756,2978.913,"Alright, let me very briefly try to conclude Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.71-288,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3045.077,3047.645,Thank you Mr. Askin.
1971.71-288,2,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,3047.645,3049.673,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-288,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3049.673,3057.26,"Senator Ervin, we allowed you ten minutes on request and will keep our bargain, you have five of it before lunch and five after the recess if that's agreeable."
1971.71-288,2,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,3057.26,3061.055,"Yes, that would be fine."
1971.71-288,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3335.147,3337.467,We'll take at that point after lunch Senator.
1971.71-288,2,41270,sam_j_ervin_jr,,3337.467,3343.539,Thanks.[Lunch Break]
1971.71-288,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3631.094,3633.162,Thank you Senator Ervin.
1971.71-288,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3638.499,3640.671,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-288,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3776.07,3777.511,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
