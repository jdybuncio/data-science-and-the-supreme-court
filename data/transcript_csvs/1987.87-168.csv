1987.87-168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.637,"We will hear argument now in No. 87-168, Russell Frisby v. Sandra C. Schultz and Robert C. Braun."
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,13.042,16.713,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.752,232.531,"Did it say prohibit; it just said regulate, did it not?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,232.531,236.654,--The--
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.654,239.404,"Well, never mind, maybe I have it wrong."
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,239.404,242.434,"--Well, footnote two reads as follows,"
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,350.936,354.716,"Now this picketing was at the Doctor's home, was it not?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,354.716,356.044,--It was at the Doctor's home.
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,356.044,360.449,"He did not operate a clinic, did he, from his home?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,360.449,361.011,"No, he did it."
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,361.011,362.745,It was just where he lived?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,362.745,365.025,That was just where he lived.
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,375.645,376.223,None in Brookfield?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,376.223,377.52,"None in the Town of Brookfield, right."
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.857,444.305,"Mr. Fuhrman, we are reviewing, I guess, the preliminary injunction."
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,454.286,456.378,We contend that it is not.
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,474.512,478.713,You still want to go to trial?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,478.713,479.213,No.
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.342,610.316,"Mr. Fuhrman, can I ask whether this ordinance would prohibit someone picketing generally, that is suppose a picket was not stationed in front of this Doctor's house, but would a group of people be able to parade through the neighborhood carrying signs and just leave?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,610.316,611.284,Yes.
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.284,614.251,What does picketing consist of under the ordinance?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,614.251,629.043,"Although the ordinance contains no definition section, in our opinion, picketing would be having the picket proceed on a definite course or route in front of a home."
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.023,644.473,And that means that you have to be concentrating on one dwelling?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,644.473,644.958,That is right.
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.958,648.785,"If you were just walking through the neighborhood, that would not qualify?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,648.785,650.112,That would not qualify.
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,650.112,654.626,"Suppose you were walking by a home with a picket sign that said,"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,662.669,667.667,"In the Town of Brookfield, under this ordinance, it would be."
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,667.667,672.493,And what would that damage be to the city?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,672.493,675.368,The damage would be to privacy.
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.678,693.704,"So if you had some people marching up and down these streets saying vote for so and so for sheriff, that would be banned, too?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,693.704,703.934,"If as Justice Scalia asked, it was a march, the answer would be that it would not be in violation of the ordinance."
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,715.101,732.314,"Do the findings of fact indicate that there is a commercial area or business area in which picketing can take place, was that a stipulation or a finding?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,732.314,734.548,"It is an uncontested fact, yes."
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,741.934,749.431,"Near this residence, is the commercial area anywhere near this residence?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,749.431,750.055,No.
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.055,754.71,Is the Doctor's clinic in Brookfield or is it elsewhere?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,754.71,755.397,It is elsewhere.
1987.87-168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,755.397,761.833,How far away is the nearest commercial area on Bluemound Road from this residence?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,761.833,767.315,I would estimate approximately three miles.
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,767.315,772.438,What is the width of the street there?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,772.438,777.951,The width of the residential streets in the Town of Brookfield are thirty feet.
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,777.951,780.48,Any sidewalks?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,780.48,783.948,"And there are no sidewalks, and no curb and gutter."
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,827.087,834.24,"We have no record as to the conduct of the pickets; there was picketing, was there not?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,834.24,835.786,There was picketing.
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,870.288,871.1,And what was their conduct?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,871.1,882.706,"Well, there were pickets of eleven to forty people picketing off and on over a period of approximately three weeks."
1987.87-168,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,889.609,896.075,"How, vocally or signs?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,896.075,899.277,"Both, both vocally and by sign."
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,907.679,910.349,"Stop abortion, and abortion is murder?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,910.349,912.209,"Yes, among other things."
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.396,916.489,Here you are not complaining about that?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,916.489,918.379,"No, we are not complaining about that."
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.952,933.356,You are still relying on the threat to public safety?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,933.356,934.356,"Yes, we are."
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.356,945.038,"Although you just told me that there would be no problem if the picketers kept moving throughout the whole neighborhood, I mean it is less of a threat if it occurs in the whole neighborhood than if it occurs in front of one house?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,945.038,956.52,"As we pointed out in our brief, in the event that you have a parade rather than simply a picket, you do have a less hazardous situation."
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.507,985.445,You will forgive me if I do not find that self-evident.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1011.559,1026.022,"Well, the record contains instances of interference, which of course goes beyond picketing, such as obstructing the driveway and trespassing upon property."
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1042.047,1054.87,"Mr. Fuhrman, would the town prohibit Appellees from standing in the street in front of the house and handing out leaflets containing the same messages as on the signs?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1054.87,1056.542,No.
1987.87-168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1076.142,1078.312,"But what is a picket, does a picket have to have a sign?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1078.312,1080.094,He does not have to have a sign.
1987.87-168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.094,1085.342,"Suppose he just stands there handing our leaflets, but he stands right at the one stop, is that picketing?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1085.342,1094.042,"If he is following a picket route, he is picketing."
1987.87-168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1094.042,1095.634,I will give you the facts.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1104.88,1105.661,All right.
1987.87-168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1114.017,1122.062,"Suppose he just stands in one spot and hands out the leaflet, is that a picket?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1122.062,1123.937,Not a picket.
1987.87-168,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1123.937,1128.013,"But if he moves ten feet of the way, then that is a picket?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1128.013,1132.434,"If he is moving and following a picket route, he is a picket, right."
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1132.434,1137.01,Even if he is not carrying a sign?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1137.01,1138.04,That is true.
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.11,1173.01,"Let us assume that he was in a black neighborhood and he walked up and down a whole block and did not concentrate on one house, is that picketing?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1173.01,1175.9,Then it would not be picketing within the meaning of our ordinance.
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.9,1179.539,"Well, he is concentrating on all of the houses there, all of the houses."
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1179.539,1180.477,I understand what you are saying.
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1186.193,1201.764,"Mr. Fuhrman, do you say that a single picketer, let us say present one hour a day, in front of a residence substantially interferes with the residential privacy?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1201.764,1202.701,I certainly do.
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1216.539,1219.523,For one hour a day or half an hour a day?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1219.523,1219.758,"Yes, ma'am."
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1220.164,1221.586,Or once a week?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1221.586,1230.566,"I would say that if he did it once a week, that it would also be a violation of the privacy of that home."
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1230.566,1236.688,Sufficiently substantial to justify the First Amendment infringement?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1236.688,1238.046,It certainly would.
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1288.12,1292.712,One man's cliche is another man's fundamental principle.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1294.493,1295.477,--Touche.
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1360.419,1362.262,"Billboards are forbidden on some of them, are they not?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1362.262,1362.918,--I beg your pardon.
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.918,1365.12,"Billboards are forbidden on some of them, are they not?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1365.12,1365.495,Right.
1987.87-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.705,1432.376,That argument might cut two ways.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1440.481,1442.307,Or across his neighbor's lawn.
1987.87-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.307,1447.385,They encourage trespassing in Brookfield.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1447.385,1453.211,"Well, trespassing is a mater of intent, because of the neighbor consensus."
1987.87-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.211,1458.911,"But is it not normal that in a lot of neighborhoods like that that you do in fact walk along the edge of the road, do you not?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1458.911,1459.738,This does happen.
1987.87-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1459.738,1469.282,"So I would think that the drivers would be aware of the fact that it is not a heavily trafficked area, I am sure, and they would know that you have to drive rather carefully."
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1472.093,1475.014,"No, it is twenty miles an hour."
1987.87-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1475.014,1475.795,Twenty miles an hour.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1479.747,1480.339,No.
1987.87-168,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.538,1495.489,That sounds like the ordinance is enacted for the protection of the picketer.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1495.489,1505.127,"--Well, this is the reason why I am suggesting reading the dissenting opinion of Judge Coffey."
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.878,1546.814,"And that is the interest that Carey spoke about, Carey v. Brown."
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1546.814,1554.232,"Well, Carey v. Brown primarily dealt with the matter of privacy."
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1554.232,1554.716,Yes.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1554.716,1556.778,And in fact--
1987.87-168,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.778,1558.825,Why do you not talk about that.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1562.603,1580.283,"--We believe that this Court should follow its own precedent that it established in the City of Renton case, and protect residential privacies."
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1612.474,1626.797,"Mr. Fuhrman, do you think that the First Amendment under that precedent would enable a city to prevent door to door solicitation and the actual ringing of the doorbell?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1626.797,1641.494,I would say that personally that an ordinance to that effect could be constitutionally valid.
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1643.351,1646.147,Do you think that this Court's precedence would support your view?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1646.147,1665.718,"--First of all, I believe at this time, we are not arguing that point of course, and we believe that there has been a division among the Circuits on that issue."
1987.87-168,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1680.12,1680.759,I thought that this Court had spoken to that issue.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1680.759,1686.506,"This Court did, because it actually confirmed the decision in the Watseka case."
1987.87-168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.506,1695.534,"The Green River ordinance cases, Murdock v. Pennsylvania, and Struthers, those are pretty much what Justice O'Connor is talking about, too, are they not?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1695.534,1695.815,Yes.
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1695.815,1702.281,What about the Austin case and the City of Boston back in 1971.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1707.874,1708.045,Leafleting.
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1708.045,1712.497,And you would draw a line between leafleting and picketing.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1712.497,1716.917,"As a matter of fact, I said that I do draw a line between leafleting and picketing."
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1721.681,1724.649,I still have not gotten your answer.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1724.649,1729.802,The ordinance of the Town of Brookfield only relates to picketing.
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1732.191,1741.485,And the difference between leafleting and picketing is what from a constitutional standpoint?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1741.485,1744.093,From a constitutional--
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1744.093,1745.576,"They both disturb, do they not?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1745.576,1748.982,"--Well, they do to some extent."
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.556,1760.041,"You are disturbing, are you not?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1760.041,1760.665,--I beg your pardon.
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1760.665,1763.507,"Is that not what you are against, disturbing the resident?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1763.507,1768.115,We are against invading the privacy of the home.
1987.87-168,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.268,1775.143,It is less disturbing then?
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1775.143,1776.205,"Less disturbing, yes."
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.205,1786.56,"I suppose that you suggest a bright line, that any street that could be classified as a residential street could be subject to an ordinance like this?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1786.56,1795.292,The rule that we believe that the Court should follow is the rule of Cornelius v. NAACP.
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.645,1823.842,"If the focus of the ordinance is an individual home, what difference would it make what kind of street it is, as long as the picketing is aimed at one home on a particular street, as the invasion of privacy is just as great?"
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1823.842,1825.122,I agree.
1987.87-168,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.744,1878.866,It is going to take a lot of litigation to litigate every street in the country to figure out whether they are public fora or not.
1987.87-168,0,27021,harold_h_fuhrman,,1878.866,1887.161,"Well, if you had litigation on each and every street, yes."
1987.87-168,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.183,1906.261,"Thank you, Mr. Fuhrman."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,1908.151,1923.629,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.15,1999.864,"The District Court or Court of Appeals, either one, Mr. McDowell, indicate that they thought more facts were necessary in order for them to reach a conclusion on the constitutional issue?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,1999.864,2013.561,The District Court's opinion indicated that based upon the facts that are currently in the record that there were sufficient facts to grant the preliminary injunction and in fact to grant a final injunction.
1987.87-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.92,2063.058,But the town says that it does not have anything else to offer.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2063.058,2064.337,That is correct.
1987.87-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.557,2108.553,"Well, if the town wants the issue decided on the present record, does that make it a final judgment?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2108.553,2115.77,"I am not certain of that fact, because I am not certain of that point."
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.465,2139.526,Did they not ask for a trial?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2141.151,2141.681,They did.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.681,2145.321,So they obviously are not satisfied with the record.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2145.321,2150.49,"Well, that is the way that the picketers have to construe the status of the case at this point."
1987.87-168,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2150.49,2157.253,"But before us today, I guess that Mr. Fuhrman says that he does not now want a trial."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2160.112,2161.565,That is what I heard.
1987.87-168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2169.89,2176.636,"The problem here is not finality at all, I do not think, under the provisions of the statute."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2198.674,2205.079,"Yes, it would be reviewed on the basis of an abuse of discretion standard in such a situation."
1987.87-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.838,2225.679,"You were just talking about appellate jurisdiction, were you not, not certiorari jurisdiction?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2225.679,2226.21,That is correct.
1987.87-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.584,2231.771,"So if you are talking about jurisdiction, we can always just grant cert.--"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2231.771,2232.411,"Oh, certainly."
1987.87-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.411,2236.143,--But that would still leave the standard of review that the Chief Justice was talking about.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2236.143,2236.456,That is correct.
1987.87-168,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2249.842,2254.699,"Mr. McDowell, is this a facial attack on the ordinance?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2254.699,2270.099,"--The attack is more in line of a facial attack, in that what the picketers are challenging is the application of the ordinance to picketers in general and into activity that they would wish to engage in."
1987.87-168,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2272.738,2288.076,"Well, if it is, then I take that if there is any set of facts that we can think about picketing to which the ordinance could constitutionally be applied, you lose, do you not, if it is a facial attack?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2288.076,2306.911,"If it is a facial attack, there the question that this Court would have to determine is whether the ordinance could appropriately be subject to a limiting construction."
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.423,2320.703,"You are not relying on the overbreadth doctrine then, I take it?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2320.703,2327.685,The overbreadth doctrine is a point that we have relied upon at various points.
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.958,2356.891,"If you can only conceive of one instance in which it is okay and only one, one might suspect that it is overbroad."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2356.891,2358.032,That is absolutely correct.
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2358.032,2359.984,I would think so.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2359.984,2361.39,Yes.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2361.39,2364.529,I must confess that I am a little puzzled.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2370.449,2370.777,Yes.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.777,2374.587,Because they have been threatened with arrest.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2392.595,2403.669,That type of picketing serves as a background certainly that this Court can consider and can consider in terms of the motivation perhaps of the town in passing this ordinance.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2403.669,2415.15,"What if we were to assume that that is all that it really prohibits, and that is all that you really care about, because you want to engage in exactly what you have done before, and then focus on that issue instead of all of these hypothetical things like leafleting."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2423.224,2428.737,The problem is that the ordinance forbids more than simply that.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2428.737,2429.909,"Well, first answer my question, would you."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2429.909,2441.233,We do not believe that the picketers have an absolute right to picket without respect to considerations.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.233,2446.198,Do you think that they have a constitutional right to engage in the kind of picketing that the District Court found in this case?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2446.198,2447.23,"Yes, I do."
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.23,2448.011,You do.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2457.288,2461.146,The picketing was directed at both Dr. Victoria and his neighbors.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.146,2466.127,"I see, thank you."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2466.127,2469.517,That is what the affidavits show and the record shows in this case.
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.517,2473.313,"What do you mean directed at, was it in front of the neighbors' houses or in front of his house?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2473.313,2475.14,It was in front of his house.
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.14,2479.983,"Well, that is generally referred to as picketing him, not picketing his neighbors."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2479.983,2481.278,That is correct.
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.508,2498.132,"Mr. McDowell, you mentioned a couple of basic principles of First Amendment law when you started off."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2564.652,2566.808,We do not claim a right to harass.
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.437,2604.666,"When you picket a store, that is a logical place to do that, because you are sending your message to the customers of that store or a business."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2621.706,2632.359,"Well, it is a legitimate place, as the picketers noted in their affidavits, to transmit their message both to the doctor and also to his neighbors."
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2632.359,2635.764,You can get it to his neighbors very easily.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2637.857,2658.535,The reason why picketing may be a particularly sensible type of procedure by which to transmit such a message is that a picket sign is a sign that a neighbor or anyone going by can look at and notice what the opinions are of the picketers.
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.673,2667.064,You can do that walking around the neighborhood.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2681.229,2684.571,I do not believe that it is in this case.
1987.87-168,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.879,2698.16,Why not picket him at his clinic?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2701.331,2705.172,It is possible to picket at other locations.
1987.87-168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2719.995,2732.912,But I think that any court familiar with our cases might be more likely to uphold a ban on residential picketing if there was an opportunity to picket the individual that they desire to bring the message home to somewhere else.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2732.912,2738.019,"Certainly, alternative channels can figure into the analysis."
1987.87-168,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2749.968,2755.465,Why do you say that it is not narrowly tailored to support privacy and safety?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2755.465,2782.423,"Turning first to safety, the reason why it is not narrowly tailored to support the safety interests is number one, because the ordinance prohibits only picketing but permits a number of expensive and non-expressive activities which can have just as severe an effect upon the interests of free vehicular movement and free pedestrian movement and the like as anything else."
1987.87-168,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2814.521,2815.786,As to privacy?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2815.786,2818.567,"As to privacy, the reason--"
1987.87-168,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2818.567,2823.034,How do you tailor this more narrowly than an absolute prohibition?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2823.034,2828.876,"--Well, a number of different options are available to the town."
1987.87-168,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2847.57,2860.441,"For example, they have an ordinance or law of some kind under which the picketers for crowding and such numbers on the lawn could be arrested?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2860.441,2864.845,"Well, there is a trespass ordinance which would apply to such activity on the lawn."
1987.87-168,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2864.845,2867.704,Could they be arrested for violation of that ordinance?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2867.704,2868.359,That is correct.
1987.87-168,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2873.53,2875.685,Is there any way that they could not be on the lawn?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2875.685,2879.073,They would be on the streets.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2904.907,2905.126,Let me interrupt you.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2917.059,2926.336,"We believe, and obviously this is a legislative question which the town would have to address, and it would present a different constitutional question."
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.336,2926.539,It is not a legislative question.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2936.956,2940.892,Let me clarify then my statement of a few minutes ago.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.085,2979.189,"Well, specifically, could they pass an ordinance saying that you may not picket with more than ten persons in front of a house for more than eight hours a day?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2979.189,2985.828,We would have with respect to that ordinance the similar analysis that would have to be applied.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2989.7,2989.966,I understand the analysis.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,2991.263,2991.731,All right.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2999.993,3001.836,"I understand that there is a severe question, but what is the answer to it?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3001.836,3002.507,--Okay.
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3012.973,3018.251,"In other words, you gave me the same answer that you did before, the picketing that you engaged in, you think was constitutionally protected."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3027.106,3042.648,"The question with respect to whether the picketers would believe that or not, I think would largely be determined if the town passed such an ordinance, would the picketers then challenge it as an unreasonable limitation on their speech."
1987.87-168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3045.584,3047.709,But it is not so much the picketers.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3072.995,3076.509,I would answer the question this way.
1987.87-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.082,3110.354,"Suppose that we thought that as applied to the picketing that actually had taken place and presumably would take place again, that the ordinance was quite constitutional, what if we thought that."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3119.741,3127.8,I would again go back to points that have been emphasized with respect to the entire discussion of this case.
1987.87-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3136.468,3136.687,I know.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3155.915,3157.132,That is right.
1987.87-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.91,3170.408,"And then what do we have to do, do we have to imagine the reach of the ordinance."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3175.03,3179.608,That is perhaps a question that would then have to be determined at trial.
1987.87-168,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.948,3189.869,"Well, that may be."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3195.571,3196.961,"No, but--"
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.961,3204.956,"We could never decide an overbreadth case if we had to do that, to go back to see exactly how the statute would be applied in these situations."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3206.597,3209.064,--Overbreadth is--
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.064,3210.625,"If it is overbroad, i is overbroad, is it not?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3210.625,3210.938,--Right.
1987.87-168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3230.931,3237.475,Have we ever applied overbreadth to an ordinance or a statute dealing just with picketing?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3237.475,3246.486,"I believe that the Thornhill case, which overbreadth was first utilized, was a picketing case."
1987.87-168,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3250.344,3254.265,Have you ever checked on how many times Thornhill has been cited?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3254.265,3263.324,"I have not checked out how many times, but I believe with some degree of frequency in my reading of this Court's First Amendment cases in preparation here."
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3263.324,3274.882,"In your answer to Justice Stevens, you indicated that privacy is a protectable interest insofar as the state is concerned, the privacy of homes?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3274.882,3278.208,Privacy of homes is a protectable interest.
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3278.208,3281.55,Can it be protected from picketing in any degree?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3281.55,3291.202,"In applying such an analysis, what has to be determined is what precisely is the character of the privacy interest."
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3300.621,3301.729,Do you have a right to a quiet street?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3301.729,3302.666,--Excuse me.
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3302.666,3304.806,Is there a right to a quiet street?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3304.806,3319.551,The residential privacy interests can extend to some extent to cover interests in tranquillity and quiet.
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3324.298,3330.187,But some picketing can be regulated in order to preserve the character of the residential neighborhood?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3330.187,3340.948,The abuses that go with certain picketing could be regulated.
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3344.135,3352.975,"So picketing can interfere with privacy and with residential character, and to that extent can be regulated?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3352.975,3358.691,--What we have in essence is a balance in such a situation.
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3378.62,3380.479,But you indicate that it can in some instances?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3380.479,3390.474,--The Court has not applied the analysis of residential privacy to forbid activity in a public forum of the picketing nature.
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3390.474,3399.362,"Well, has the Court confronted a case where the public forum doctrine has squarely measured against the interest of the homeowner and privacy and quiet?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3399.362,3405.015,The closest that this Court has come to that situation was the Carey case.
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3406.093,3407.343,And that went off on equal protection grounds.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3407.343,3408.936,"--Well, in the Carey case--"
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3408.936,3415.683,"And in that case, we also said that there is a very strong interest, a very strong constitutional recognition, of the right of privacy."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3415.683,3418.385,"--Granted, you are absolutely correct."
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3450.95,3456.995,"And under Justice Stevens' question, this could go on 365 days a year as far as you are concerned?"
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3456.995,3469.506,"--I believe that it could go on for a substantial period of time, yes."
1987.87-168,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3469.506,3474.317,365 days a year?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3474.317,3476.393,"Yes, I think it could."
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3487.795,3490.091,I do not understand how you can say that the length has anything to do with it.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3521.0,3533.01,"We do not believe that... to a certain extent, there will always be a degree of privacy invasion."
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3546.631,3546.832,Right.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3573.229,3594.674,What is distinctive about picketing activity is that by use of signs and by use of perhaps a limited degree of movement that it creates a place where people can determine and people can see a message that is broadcast by way of signs.
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3612.525,3618.195,"I suggest that if you have a parade in your neighborhood and then have a picket at your house, that you will see the difference."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3618.195,3622.1,"Perhaps so, perhaps so."
1987.87-168,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3675.844,3678.186,The doctor would probably invite them in for a cup of coffee.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3678.186,3681.982,"He might, he might, but he could also report them to the police."
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3684.122,3687.309,"If they liked him that much, of course, they would go away if he asked them, I am sure."
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3696.523,3705.097,The key point here though is that the ordinance sweeps so broadly that it prohibits all of these types of activity.
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3742.082,3750.189,The town is willing to let you march around Dr. Victoria's neighborhood with a sign saying Dr. Victoria is an abortionist or whatever harsher language that you want to use.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3756.281,3762.418,However--
1987.87-168,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3762.418,3764.684,They just do not want you to annoy him in his home.
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3764.684,3766.791,--The town's ordinance though--
1987.87-168,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3766.791,3769.634,Is there anything to stop you from picketing his office?
1987.87-168,1,41732,steven_frederick_mcdowell,,3770.134,3771.289,--No.
1987.87-168,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3771.289,3773.898,So he is right.
1987.87-168,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3773.898,3777.365,"Thank you, Mr. McDowell."
