1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4108.094,4115.24,"Well, I suppose Mr. Cohn, the issue for us is really where the Congress notwithstanding of this."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4115.24,4115.698,Yes.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4115.698,4121.871,"It has now interposed to some restraints on the selection -- that's the real issue we have, isn't it?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4121.871,4125.381,And may I quote Mr. Justice Brennan on that point.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4147.269,4147.599,I don't think --
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4147.599,4148.911,Nobody could have a stated that more --
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4148.911,4150.844,I don't think that's a word of fact --
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4150.844,4151.435,"No, I --"
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4151.435,4153.524,"Compose of the issue, isn't it?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4153.524,4156.037,I wish that I've written it.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4159.816,4163.462,"I -- well, unless you finish that sort, I have one other question."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4163.462,4168.6,Now the thought that I have is that the Congress enacted two-pronged legislation here.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4203.307,4206.037,You have the question I wanted to ask was this.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4212.564,4214.13,They all work in dining room.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4221.808,4227.18,It's just one particular craft calling whatever it is.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4227.18,4227.776,The waiters union.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4229.044,4233.242,"And is that -- how about the other one the Local 11, what is it?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4233.242,4236.022,That's the Luncheonette Union.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4239.412,4250.321,"Well, I was interested of that apparently, the experience requirement according to Exhibit 69 is not the one that Local 1 follows is it?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4250.321,4254.165,I don't know but let me -- I don't know whether it does or it does not.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4254.165,4254.51,"Well, at the --"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4254.51,4255.264,But let me --
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4255.264,4258.767,"Just like Exhibit 69 in the case, it does not."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4258.767,4269.7,Judge -- it does not follow it and my associate here tells me that but let me discuss this whole question of comparison since you've raised the point.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4417.363,4425.931,"Well, Mr. Cohn, I wonder if that's really the starting point of this Court."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4433.56,4435.589,With the further exception which you quoted before Justice Fortas.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4435.589,4449.739,And there's a parenthesis and it says subject to reasonable qualifications uniformly imposes but we start that we submit in statement form for your comment.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4538.009,4549.12,"Justice Fortas, let me meet that burden which you've stated and I'm perfectly willing to meet it on the assumption that presides imposes a heavy burden on us."

1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4580.145,4589.49,"Well, I'm going to go to that in just a moment but there are 1700 people who could run with four principle offices and 21 associated offices."
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4625.378,4625.922,"Oh, no."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4628.271,4629.731,"Alright, then --"
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4629.731,4643.984,You have to say that you -- that a man can't join a union that after make it possible I should think for a union to say that you can't join the union today for example and run for office tomorrow.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4654.689,4654.963,"Well, I'm not --"

1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4828.896,4832.647,Do you have any educational requirement for any office?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4832.647,4852.408,"We have no educational requirement but we have sir, fortunately, a great many people who are passing through the union and that they are working their way through college, a law school, a medical school that may get their jobs in the banquet department or as a waiter."
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4896.304,4901.873,Do you need your office which require man to be a bookkeeper or --

1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4922.654,4928.401,"Oh, as the Secretary-Treasurer whose duties are to handle the funds of the union."
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4942.369,4944.24,What are his qualifications?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4945.276,4948.831,"No experience in the union, no special qualification."
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4975.274,4980.257,Perhaps some of you would have agreed that many people who couldn't be a Secretary.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4980.257,4985.161,"It's true in as such, the membership to reject them or accept them."
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4985.161,4989.927,How do they get acquainted with one another?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,4989.927,4993.562,They get acquainted with one another because they live in the same community.
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5022.183,5025.02,What part of the world does your union include?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5025.02,5026.156,The hotel world.
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5028.363,5029.983,All over New York City.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5029.983,5031.973,"All over New York City, Justice Black."
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5031.973,5036.613,"Well, how could the individual members get acquainted with one another that way?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5036.613,5036.87,Well --
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5036.87,5037.846,They would have to vote.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5037.846,5039.443,It's -- it's difficult.
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5054.167,5055.366,They are the officers.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5055.366,5056.881,"They are the officers, yes."
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5056.881,5064.937,But I'm talking about the rank and file who then evokes the officers and get acquainted with.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5064.937,5074.899,"Well, let's take what happened in this particular case, they publish leaflets, they have headquarters, they solicit membership throughout the hotels."
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5123.126,5124.086,"Well, that's what I was thinking."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5124.086,5124.679,Yes.
1967.891,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5132.269,5136.815,But you've now dispensed with the -- I take it dispensed with the experience involved.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5136.815,5137.14,Yes.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5269.117,5271.802,"Incidentally, is there's going to be an opposition slate this time?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5271.802,5275.677,"There's going to be an opposition slate, they have nominated for our position."
1967.891,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5299.645,5304.654,"What constitutes the 10,000 who cannot be eligible?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5304.654,5308.79,Those who have not been members of the union for five years.
1967.891,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5314.489,5315.652,That's under the new --
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5315.652,5317.501,Under the new bylaws.
1967.891,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5317.999,5321.496,"That isn't true under the old one, the one we're --"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5321.496,5321.776,No.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5338.969,5344.279,"And in the old one, there was a two-year prior membership qualification, wasn't there?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5344.279,5344.519,No.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5347.745,5348.443,One year?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5348.443,5349.184,One year.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5349.184,5349.481,Have you now raised --
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5349.481,5350.325,Sorry.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5354.331,5354.869,Two years.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5357.203,5358.608,"No, no, no."
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5371.83,5382.528,"The fact of the matter is that before this time, to run for a general office, all you have to have was two years of membership in the union plus having been an officer."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5382.528,5383.211,That's right.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5386.135,5392.317,So you have -- so you have raised it from two years to five years for the top officers.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5392.317,5394.164,For the top officer -- no.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5396.972,5408.713,"Now, just address yourself to the number of years you have to have been a member of the union under the old bylaw and under the new."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5408.713,5412.9,It was a continuous good standing for two years under the old bylaw.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5412.9,5414.569,What is it under the new one?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5414.569,5420.558,Two years of continuous good standing but five years membership in the union.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5422.666,5432.658,To be a member -- you could be elected on one of those top officers if you were -- have three years or in bad standing as a member of the union as well as two years in --
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5432.658,5437.752,If the two years of good standing were immediately proceed until the time when you're running for office.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5437.752,5442.286,"So that's not a very impressive distinction here, is it Mr. Cohn?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5442.286,5448.981,"Well, I think impressive is almost as difficult to define as reasonable."
1967.891,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5453.459,5458.192,But why do you make the distinction between good standing and bad standing?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5459.857,5464.512,"Well, a man may be a member of a union and not pay his dues."
1967.891,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5479.296,5483.637,The only test of that standing is whether he pays his dues or not.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5483.637,5484.635,"Yes, that's all."
1967.891,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5484.635,5484.992,That's all what he's going to do?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5484.992,5485.919,Yes.
1967.891,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5498.212,5501.008,I -- I perhaps misunderstood it.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5519.704,5520.31,That's true.
1967.891,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5520.31,5525.953,And that you didn't change or increase the length of membership requirements of the original group at all.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5525.953,5528.592,"Now, that's true."
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5534.727,5541.239,"Well, could a union member for five or more years who has never paid his dues run for office now?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5541.239,5543.07,"No, of course not."
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5639.939,5641.343,Why do you think it is --
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5641.343,5641.93,Sorry sir.
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5641.93,5647.604,Why do you think that the five year membership is a good thing?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5647.604,5651.725,Because it gives the feel of the union.
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5679.88,5681.673,Now which office is required?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5681.673,5682.852,Any.
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5687.178,5688.266,31 general?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5688.266,5692.986,"That is for the president, the general organizers, the secretary-treasurer and the recording treasurer."
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5692.986,5694.837,That's all that's included.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5694.837,5697.514,That's all that's included among the 31 offices.
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5699.345,5702.662,That's all that have to have to meet the requirements?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5702.662,5702.878,No.
1967.891,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5898.089,5900.211,Can you say what date that was?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5900.211,5903.232,"That's dated August 25, 1960."
1967.891,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5907.62,5913.83,Ambassador Goldberg -- I'm mixed up in my history was not the Secretary of Labor until 1961.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5913.83,5916.706,"August 25, 1960."
1967.891,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5934.444,5935.773,We'll recess now.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5936.961,5943.559,Thank you sir.
1967.891,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5943.559,5946.287,"Mr. Cohn, you may continue your argument."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,5946.287,5946.574,Thank you.
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6045.349,6050.265,"Mr. Cohn, it seems to me that argument that was against you."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6054.369,6055.487,Why it was it necessary?
1967.891,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6055.487,6055.511,Yes.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6055.511,6079.063,"The bylaw had been established 15 years -- eight years before the legislation in question and had been historically in the bylaw for -- since the union was charged that the prior experience was -- but Judge Black, please forgive me."
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6116.589,6117.959,"Well, now it's not would have been."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6118.444,6119.347,"May have been, yes."
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6119.347,6128.307,"I think -- isn't that important Mr. Cohn what Judge Wyatt said as I believe in that opinion, his standard was could not have affected."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6131.096,6132.575,"May have affected, yes."
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6132.575,6133.957,"Well, there is a difference."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6133.957,6139.055,"There is a -- well, there is a difference but there has to be a probability that might have been affected."
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6299.427,6300.296,Sorry Mr. Cohn.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6310.417,6314.265,I think that there is a statutory scheme which would have to be followed.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6316.859,6320.033,"Well, we did say that I've forgotten in which one of the other cases --"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6320.033,6320.617,And what are these --
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6320.617,6336.776,"-- have we not, where there's been found a violation of the statute, those supervening union's supervised election can prevent the Secretary having the Secretary supervised election."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6336.776,6337.304,Yes.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6337.304,6346.434,"And I gather that has to carry with, it doesn't it, that if the Secretary does go through it on election, any supervening election including this one."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6347.227,6347.597,No.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6419.115,6431.978,"Yes, but what if the language -- this is in Bottle Blowers that it's incorrect to read the provision circumscribing the time and basis of the Secretary's intervention is somehow conditioning his right to relief."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6447.484,6449.003,As long as it was warranted.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6450.778,6465.449,"No, I'm hypothesizing that we were not to agree with your position either as to the bylaw or as to the issue of whether the violation of the bylaw affected the outcome of the election."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6465.449,6477.395,"Mr. Justice Brennan, the only answer I can give you is a complete -- I think the only honest answer I can give you is that the situation is different under which the two elections have taken place and I don't think --"
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6477.395,6482.129,"In other words, I think that question is foreclosed but anything we've already said with the last one."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6482.129,6488.302,I don't think it is foreclosed. I think there is a distinction between Glass Blowers and 153 in this case.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6488.302,6490.233,"Well, certainly a distinction on the facts is quite relevant."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6490.233,6500.005,"Yes, and these cases have to be decided on the facts because the Secretary asserted this argument, we don't know what the general rule is we haven't laid down a general rule."
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6500.005,6503.178,"Well, let me see if I understand this."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6505.435,6506.194,Right.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6506.194,6525.046,Suppose thereafter we decide that the Secretary's request that a supervised election should be held is sent and we send the case back with appropriate instructions to have a supervised election.
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6539.916,6541.526,Not if the Court so orders it.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6545.031,6551.237,How could we fail to order it if we ordered a supervised election?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6551.237,6561.068,"Well, because the question is whether it's necessary, we'd have to go back to the Court, I assume to the District Court to direct in terms under which the supervised elections could be held."
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6606.99,6609.77,"Well, that's an argument to be addressed by the Secretary, isn't it?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6609.77,6610.654,Yes.
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6610.654,6632.121,"But I would suppose if you -- the Secretary's election, he approved that the conduct of his election under your new bylaw, that's one thing and if you didn't and you went ahead with your election under your new bylaw, I should think there's some difficulty with that in light to what we said in Glass Blowers."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6632.121,6642.352,"Well, I would suggest that we would -- should be entitled to our day in Court to determine whether or not the new bylaw is appropriate."
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6642.352,6647.818,"Yes, but your day in Court can't come until after you've been through the procedure through the Secretary under the statute."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6647.818,6650.355,"Well, then may I say that I think the statutory scheme --"
1967.891,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6650.355,6651.645,Am I wrong about that?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6653.137,6661.815,"Yes, but I also think that the Secretary's day in Court has to come after he has exhausted the procedure which the statute provides."
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6699.219,6707.023,"Now, but it seems to me that you're making a very strong argument for a supervised election."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6707.023,6709.954,Then I failed.
1967.891,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6752.734,6765.937,"Well, it's possible theoretically for a union to keep one election ahead of the courts, and I'm inclined to think that that may turn out to be theoretical."
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6765.937,6769.654,I think that the Court has definitely prohibited that situation.
1967.891,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6808.815,6821.278,"Mr. Cohn, wouldn't there be a difference between a supervised election under the new bylaw than an unsupervised election of the new bylaw?"
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6821.278,6823.708,"Frankly sir, I couldn't see it."
1967.891,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6823.708,6831.405,What about the other intentions of the Secretary that no one ever reached in this case?
1967.891,1,41117,sidney_e_cohn,,6831.405,6841.598,"Well, Mr. Gold is going to argue those and therefore I haven't done it except that I think they're really minimal when you get into it and look at the record as to what they wanted to prove."
1967.891,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6870.421,6871.245,Mr. Gold.
1967.891,2,34498,laurence_gold,,6871.245,6875.284,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7150.365,7163.317,"Well Mr. Gold, has an independent ever won a -- in assembly man's position against the administration slate in this union?"
1967.891,2,34498,laurence_gold,,7163.317,7164.812,I don't believe so.
1967.891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7170.598,7173.469,I understand.
1967.891,2,34498,laurence_gold,,7173.469,7190.874,I -- to give an illustration of why believe that the percentage test is unsound that the union could pass a rule requiring members to attend four or six monthly meetings a year prior to the election in order to run for office.
1967.891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7210.38,7229.74,But the effect of the rule is to restrict the candidates for office to those that the present administration chooses because you know that the practical experience is that administration slates win in assembly districts.
1967.891,2,34498,laurence_gold,,7229.74,7230.726,"Well, but I think --"
1967.891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7230.726,7233.854,And they were the only ones who are eligible to run through?
1967.891,2,34498,laurence_gold,,7233.854,7234.187,No.
1967.891,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7272.083,7273.2,The people preferred it.
1967.891,2,34498,laurence_gold,,7273.2,7273.849,Right.
1967.891,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7386.531,7388.859,I think we'll have to get the rest from your brief --
1967.891,2,34498,laurence_gold,,7388.859,7389.577,Okay --
1967.891,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7389.577,7390.61,-- Mr. Gold.
1967.891,2,34498,laurence_gold,,7390.61,7391.118,-- I apologize.
1967.891,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7391.118,7396.789,Your time has expired.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7398.556,7405.423,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I may just make use of the few minutes remaining to make a few observations."
1967.891,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7405.423,7406.004,I beg your pardon.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7406.004,7409.121,If I may just make a few observations with the time remaining.
1967.891,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7424.882,7427.049,What is that finding you say?
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7427.497,7448.07,"At the bottom of page 297, Mr. Justice Black, there is a paragraph beginning with the sentence, “In practice, it was not possible to be elected to the assembly except with the blessing of the administration party conferred by selection to run for the assembly on row A.”"
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7448.07,7463.267,Do you think that's inconsistent with the free choice of the voters in each district perhaps referring the people put up by the administration over those who were running against it?
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7463.267,7472.453,This is one of the other points I made because it seems to me that the District Court looked at two factors that are really not permissible under this legislation.
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7510.07,7516.032,Would you think the administration -- the union ought to be permitted to endorse the slate?
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7516.032,7517.816,"Oh, yes."
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7518.011,7520.767,Nothing worse seemed about it.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7520.767,7525.203,"That on itself, it would seem is not coercive but the way what the district --"
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7525.203,7528.215,"And therefore, doesn't necessarily affect an election."
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7528.215,7551.689,"But what the district judge did in this case is analyze the history and the evidence and it was his conclusion which I don't think can fairly be disagreed with that over the span from 1951 to 1965, these rules worked to make it possible for the in group to maintain control, to make it highly difficult for an out group to get a leg off."
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7552.069,7556.279,Is that necessarily pernicious?
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7556.279,7563.606,It is pernicious Mr. Justice White when the out group is unable to mount the campaign and put its test to the members.
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7564.741,7566.314,You mean they can't win.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7572.008,7572.718,There's never been a fair test.
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7572.718,7573.96,They never won an election.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7573.96,7606.515,"There's never been a fair test to that, Mr. Justice White when the -- I think when the record shows that those who had attempted to mount an opposition slate have been unable to do so because of this prior office holding requirement and we would suggest that if there's one thing that is clear from the legislative history in this case is that Congress did not want the Secretary and did not want the courts inquiring into whether into question such of this which I would say posed as whether a union member ought to be happy with what he was getting."
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7630.004,7632.679,May I ask you another question.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7632.679,7635.168,"Yes, sir."
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7635.168,7647.645,"What do you think may mean in the effect side, it probably or possibly or once in a hundred times or one side of every two times or what?"
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7647.645,7648.167,I don't know --
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7648.167,7650.819,Do you think the district used the wrong standard?
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7650.819,7652.765,"Yes, for this reason, Justice White."
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7707.93,7720.28,Well you would just -- I gather you would just say then that anytime a rule excludes from a ballot some otherwise qualified candidate that it might have affected the election.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7720.28,7720.548,Yes.
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7721.408,7722.35,Period.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7722.35,7722.664,Yes.
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7722.664,7723.604,That's the end of it.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7723.604,7730.065,But we go further because it is our position when it might have affected a candidate and you do not know who could have come forward.
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7735.8,7744.994,When you wouldn't -- you wouldn't -- you think the reasonably probably standard that the District Court applies and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit apparently applies is wrong.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7744.994,7750.602,We think reasonably probable is wrong as applied to this record because it requires -- underlying any standard --
1967.891,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7750.602,7754.061,"Well, is it the right -- is it the right standard though?"
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7754.061,7758.743,"In general, if were to say reasonably possible."
1967.891,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7759.939,7761.771,It's perfectly -- It's a little bit different.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7761.771,7763.643,-- slight variation.
1967.891,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7763.643,7766.478,That's very -- not very slight.
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7766.478,7768.441,I think that if were seeking a general session --
1967.891,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7768.441,7788.731,"Are you -- are you really saying, I wonder, that unless one can reach the conclusion that the following of the -- by hypothesis invalid bylaw, did not affect the election then you must conclude that it may have."
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7788.731,7789.665,"Yes, Justice Brennan."
1967.891,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7792.534,7799.807,How are you going -- is it any easy to know when something did not affect it and when it did under this thing?
1967.891,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,7799.807,7812.025,I would suggest let's say in the case where the winning margin is a thousand votes and the charge is that a hundred ballots were destroyed in that counting.
