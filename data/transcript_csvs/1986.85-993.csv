1986.85-993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.808,"We will hear argument next in No. 85-993, Paula A. Hobbie versus Unemployment Appeals Commission of Florida and Lawton and Company."
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,14.374,22.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is not a factually complex case."
1986.85-993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.872,369.907,"Mr. Carson, on that point can I ask you a question?"
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,384.834,402.378,"Your Honor, it would be my impression that she would be entitled to benefits for a physical disability, and it is ironic that the state would award benefits to a person for a physical disability but not for a religious disability, if you will."
1986.85-993,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.378,410.901,"Are there Florida cases that make that clear, because I couldn't really tell from the briefs, and the language of the statute seems to say she has to be ready, willing, and able to work."
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,416.222,417.172,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,439.218,448.341,"Mr. Carson, could we go back a minute to Justice Stevens'... are there cases in Florida that support your view of Florida law on that point?"
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,448.341,475.86,"Your Honor, I believe that there are cases that would suggest that individuals for personal reasons have been denied... or have been granted unemployment compensation whereas Paula Hobbie, because of her religious reasons, was denied unemployment compensation, and there are three cases that appeared in Footnote 14 of the Solicitor General's brief."
1986.85-993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,514.385,522.741,So you deduce from that type of case your answer to Justice Stevens' case about someone who developed a handicap in the course of employment?
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,522.741,528.811,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1986.85-993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,586.165,614.667,"Mr. Carson, the Solicitor General also suggested, as I recall, that regardless of the test the Court ends up applying, that this case should be remanded to develop the facts on the effect and operation of Florida's statute here, that we shouldn't decide it alone on the ground that Mrs. Hobbie was denied benefits."
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,616.953,618.719,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I would."
1986.85-993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,653.626,665.1,Do you find any tension at all between the Thomas case and Estate of Thornton which the Court decided more recently?
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,665.1,665.734,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,665.734,690.917,"In Estate of Thornton, of course, the Court found that a state law providing Sabbath worshippers an absolute right not to work on the Sabbath violated the establishment clause, so it is rather ironic that the very same provision if compelled by the state is unconstitutional, and yet to deny the benefits--"
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,690.917,692.167,"I think, Your Honor, that--"
1986.85-993,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,692.167,694.786,--would also be unconstitutional in your view?
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,694.786,698.238,"--I don't see a tension, quite frankly, in this case."
1986.85-993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.963,871.585,"Mr. Carson, do you think our decision and opinion in the Thomas case went further than the decision and opinion in the Sherbert case?"
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,871.585,888.261,"I think the Thomas decision, Your Honor, was a natural evolution, if you will, of the principles that were first articulated in Sherbert and were further refined and developed in the Yoder v. Wisconsin case, and ultimately found their fruition in Thomas."
1986.85-993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.261,913.812,"What if it were to turn out upon an examination of Florida law in this case that actually Florida is quite strict about the sort of thing that your client engaged in, and for anything like that or similar to it, being in jail or something for nonreligious reasons very strictly dealt with, it is either misconduct, unavailable, whatever, do you think Sherbert and Thomas would govern that situation?"
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,913.812,923.784,"Your Honor, I would look to Sherbert and Thomas first and foremost as protecting the free exercise of religion under the compelling state interest test."
1986.85-993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.784,931.273,But under my hypothesis do you think the result there is foreordained by the opinions in Sherbert and Thomas?
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,931.273,933.725,"Yes, sir, I do."
1986.85-993,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,933.725,935.761,May I ask this question?
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,935.761,936.144,Yes.
1986.85-993,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,936.144,943.515,Let's assume that your client had applied to this particular employer for a job.
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,955.223,959.274,"Your Honor, I believe that that would be an issue that might come up under Title 7--"
1986.85-993,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,959.274,959.759,Yes.
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,959.759,992.014,"--of the civil rights law, and the standard that the legislature has established there that an employer must accommodate a person's religious beliefs unless to do so would create an undue hardship on the operation of that particular business, and so to answer your question, the employer could deny her a job if her religious beliefs and limitations would create an undue hardship on the operation of his business."
1986.85-993,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,992.014,1006.607,"Employing one person who couldn't work perhaps would create no hardship, but when the second and third Seventh Day Adventists sought employment with a small jewelry company I suppose the hardship would be evident."
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,1006.607,1010.392,That could create a hardship but those are not the facts here.
1986.85-993,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1010.392,1011.292,I understand.
1986.85-993,0,44281,walter_e_carson,,1011.292,1018.415,"All right, sir."
1986.85-993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.386,1129.786,"Thank you, Mr. Carson."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1139.258,1163.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the state of Florida disagrees that Sherbert and Thomas are controlling in this case, at least to the extent that there is a difference between those cases and this case, a difference which would mean if those precedents were followed here it would be an expansion of the principle of law announced in those cases."
1986.85-993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1260.973,1273.614,"I am not entirely sure, Mr. Maher, that I see what difference that should make insofar as unemployment compensation benefits is concerned."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1273.614,1280.768,"--Justice O'Connor, Hobbie would have been awarded... I'm sorry."
1986.85-993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1314.358,1333.335,"Does it really make any difference under the Constitutional standards, do you think, that this particular woman, Mrs. Hobbie, was a recent convert instead of holding her beliefs over a longer period of time?"
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1333.335,1347.845,"I believe it does, because as Hobbie conceded, it would be unfair for a person to accept employment that is in conflict with their religious beliefs and then expect the employer to make adjustments."
1986.85-993,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1356.285,1365.456,"Well, that seems to allow the state to put a special burden on religious conversion, and it just struck me as a very strange argument."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1365.456,1397.695,"--It is not so much a burden as I would see it as it is just the recognition of the realities that in our society there are going to be certain, if not conflicts, then certain impacts between religious beliefs or free exercise of religious beliefs and society, and the only way that we could accommodate these changes in religion would be to make special accommodation."
1986.85-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.495,1438.672,"And the only distinction between here and Sherbert is that you say this employee is not disabled from, what, obtaining employment which will later entitle her to unemployment compensation with any employer?"
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1438.672,1461.954,"It is a more coercive penalty in Sherbert's case than it would be in this case because it would continue with her so long as she maintained those religious beliefs, whereas in this case unless Hobbie takes employment in conflict with her religion there won't be a future disqualification."
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.006,1485.069,"May I ask the same question really I asked your opponent, I guess, but she was, in this case she was found guilty of misconduct for refusing to work, and as I understand the Administrative Law Judge's opinion or whatever the proper title is, it had to be an intentional act of misconduct, namely, refusing to work."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1497.127,1498.91,"To an extent, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.874,1554.88,"But that, being able to work, to collect benefits applies to the period in which benefits are claimed rather than the time of the discharge."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1554.88,1555.48,--That's correct.
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.48,1570.425,"So it would be conceivable to me... now, maybe this isn't a fair thing under Florida law, conceivable to me that she would meet that standard because she would be able to work at a lot of other jobs and she could very well work at jobs that don't require them to be there on Saturday and therefore not violate that provision."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1570.425,1570.791,Right.
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1571.658,1585.368,"And if that is true then it seems to me the net result of it is that she would get benefits if instead of having this burden, this obstacle to working, namely a religious obstacle, if she had a physical obstacle."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1585.368,1589.803,"--That's correct, because there is a specific provision covering disability, illness or disability."
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.839,1598.509,"So then isn't... can one argue that this is a special burden on a religious, you might call it a handicap in effect."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1604.73,1605.397,--I would style it just the opposite of that.
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.024,1630.88,But it is only a special exception if you are willing to say that it is misconduct when your reason for not being able to work is a religious reason as opposed to a physical reason.
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1630.88,1631.397,Right.
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.082,1635.701,Both people are simply unable to work.
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1635.701,1638.653,--Let me... for different reasons.
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1657.964,1666.72,But is it really any more intentional if there is this religious obstacle than the consequence of a physical inability to work?
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1674.826,1679.211,"Well, obviously, an illness is completely unintentional."
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.47,1718.188,What about a woman who becomes pregnant?
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1720.974,1721.907,We had this case yesterday.
1986.85-993,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1721.907,1727.044,"Say she deliberately became pregnant and so forth, and therefore couldn't work for a certain period."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1728.761,1729.444,If she is--
1986.85-993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.444,1730.162,Were you here yesterday?
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1730.162,1731.112,"--Yes, I was."
1986.85-993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1731.895,1733.114,I am just wondering whether--
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1733.114,1735.397,I was.
1986.85-993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.303,1744.672,--It would?
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1744.672,1746.989,And she would not be guilty of misconduct.
1986.85-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.717,1845.371,Of course the freedom of religion clause doesn't apply there.
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1850.49,1858.345,They are so close that I would say that you have to draw a very fine definition.
1986.85-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.345,1865.951,"Yes, a line so fine that you would really only do it if you didn't like Sherbert versus Verner to begin with."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1867.284,1868.903,"I am sorry, I didn't hear the last part."
1986.85-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.903,1877.04,A line that is so fine that one would only draw it if one did not like Sherbert versus Verner to begin with.
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,1877.04,1879.259,Probably so.
1986.85-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.166,2020.451,"What about the Amish case, the Amish education case?"
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,2020.451,2021.568,Wisconsin v. Yoder?
1986.85-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.568,2023.653,Yoder.
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,2023.653,2037.08,"Wisconsin v. Yoder I think is the example of where the line should be drawn, where there is a very strong coercive impact between the government regulation and the religious practices."
1986.85-993,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.359,2393.811,"Of course, depending on how we are interpreting the establishment clause you might like a collision."
1986.85-993,1,32050,john_d_maher,,2399.481,2401.25,It is something that needs to be resolved.
1986.85-993,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2435.423,2436.856,"Thank you, Mr. Maher."
1986.85-993,2,44281,walter_e_carson,,2443.51,2446.779,"Your Honor, I believe that Paula Hobbie would rest on the submission."
1986.85-993,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2447.898,2449.514,"Thank you, Mr. Carson."
