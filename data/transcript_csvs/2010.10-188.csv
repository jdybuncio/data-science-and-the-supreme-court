2010.10-188,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.789,"We'll hear argument next in Case 10-188, Schindler Elevator Corporation v. United States ex rel. Daniel Kirk."
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,10.822,13.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,57.519,83.737,"But suppose the FOIA information is just to confirm, to back up, to fill out; that the -- the relator suspects there's a fraud going on, and he thinks that the -- the fraud will be documented by filings that the alleged fraudulent party has made in the government."
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,83.737,84.503,--Justice--
2010.10-188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.503,85.103,Yes.
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,85.103,103.4,"--Justice Ginsburg, that may well be a legitimate use of a FOIA request, and the question then becomes whether the information disclosed in the FOIA response reveals the allegations and transactions upon which the qui tam suit is based."
2010.10-188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,128.099,151.464,"So in each case, we'd have to tell what was the -- the false claims claim; was it so heavily dependent on FOIA disclosures, or was the FOIA disclosures -- say they were a minimal part of the--"
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,151.464,152.981,"Precisely, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.10-188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,230.333,262.285,"--If I -- if I submitted, as we -- all Federal judges do, financial disclosure statements to an administrative office, and then someone from the press has a Freedom of Information Act request to see that financial disclosure statement, does it then become -- does it become the report of the administrative office, rather than my report to the administrative office?"
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,262.285,284.551,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's an interesting question, and whether -- and some lower courts have held that if the Federal -- if the -- if the report -- even though the report is filled out by a nongovernmental person, such as yourself in this instance, it might still qualify as an administrative report because the information being sought is dictated by a Federal administrative agency."
2010.10-188,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,301.445,310.035,"Suppose that in this case, the agency has said: Well, we have 10 files where these documents are, and we'll make them available you to in the reading room."
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,311.485,320.657,"--Justice Kennedy, if the agency has exercised some selectivity in terms of what it's put in that reading room, we would argue that it is a report."
2010.10-188,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,347.291,354.212,"Well, I don't know if the files are digitized or not, but if they want this particular veteran's report, suppose you could just push a button, and they all come out."
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,363.92,365.003,--It certainly is a report.
2010.10-188,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,370.574,379.762,"It doesn't sound like in normal parlance if you come to an agency and say I want these documents, and the person comes down and says here they are, he's not going to say here's my report."
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,383.397,395.372,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is a report in the following sense: The agency is saying, one, we have these documents; two, these documents are the very documents you're asking for."
2010.10-188,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,396.339,402.026,"There's information, facts, that you can glean from their action, but that doesn't make what they've done a report."
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,402.026,414.936,"--Well, with all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I think their response in handing over the documents, saying these are the documents, is a report that we have these documents; here are the documents you've requested."
2010.10-188,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,415.903,429.112,"So that means that if they tell you go look for it on the Web site of X agency, then they are incorporating everything that that other agency has as part of their report?"
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,429.112,430.745,"--Well, they are--"
2010.10-188,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,430.745,433.48,That it's not a response in telling you you've got to find what you're looking for?
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,433.48,436.866,--It is a report in the sense they're reporting where to look for it.
2010.10-188,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,489.734,495.555,Is your position that sometimes it can't -- a FOIA response can be a report and other times it's not?
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,495.555,497.173,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.003,533.696,So there's no difference between a report -- the government has an investigating commission and it works up a report -- as opposed to the many government agencies that are just repositories?
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,569.269,571.221,"Justice Ginsburg, let me be clear."
2010.10-188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.503,597.455,Let's take this very case--
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,597.455,597.621,--We may or may not have the document.
2010.10-188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,597.621,629.824,"--I'm asking you isn't there a difference between saying we want the raw filings, we want what Schindler filed, we don't want the government to do any investigations, we want them to do just the mechanical thing that they do under FOIA, and an agency saying we're going to investigate and make a report, we're going to put our people under the investigators, and we're going to interview witnesses, they're going to examine documents, and -- and we'll make a report?"
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,642.9,652.106,"Justice Ginsburg, we think that reports and investigations can certainly vary drastically in degree and kind."
2010.10-188,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,721.686,732.542,But is the question whether the documents that are turned over themselves reports or whether they are included in a report?
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,754.423,755.856,"Absolutely, Justice Alito."
2010.10-188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.266,850.985,We'll find out from them if that is what they have set their position.
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,865.494,876.885,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but their response is that certain FOIA responses will constitute a report or investigation, depending on the underlying documents that are disclosed."
2010.10-188,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,876.885,878.654,"If you request a report, then you get a report."
2010.10-188,0,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,878.654,889.962,But -- but their -- their test for the underlying documents is effectively the resurrection of their on-the-trail notion that this Court rejected only last term in the Graham County case.
2010.10-188,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,939.109,939.843,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,945.529,949.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-188,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,983.338,992.693,"Most of the -- maybe I'm -- maybe this isn't correct, but many FOIA responses include more than just turning over the documents."
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1002.299,1003.401,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1056.034,1061.921,"Well, but it's not really because it does get into the assertion of exemptions and privileges, and--"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1061.921,1062.921,--That's true.
2010.10-188,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1062.921,1063.487,--things of that sort.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1070.591,1085.351,The -- all the work that Your Honor described goes into whether or not that document should be released; and under the False Claims Act test the release of documents is only the first test in the five-part public disclosure bar test.
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1100.526,1103.062,"Well, could we talk about the test that you propose?"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1114.184,1114.568,That's right.
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1114.568,1122.774,And then an investigation is most reasonably understood as an official probe into fraudulent conduct.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1122.774,1123.976,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1124.492,1138.985,"So if the report does not investigate fraudulent conduct, then it isn't -- if something does not involve information about fraudulent conduct, it's not a report?"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1138.985,1141.853,"--We -- we wouldn't take that hard a line, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1182.745,1186.014,"Well, could I ask you about a document to which your adversary referred?"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1199.107,1199.924,Yes.
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1199.924,1200.924,--under the False Claims Act?
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1200.924,1213.366,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, and we've argued that because the FOIA uses the word ""response"" for the documents we're talking about today and uses the word ""report"" for that document that goes to Congress, it must have understood those words to mean different things."
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1213.366,1221.87,But this report is -- doesn't seem to involve a process that's any less mechanical than responding to a FOIA report.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1233.761,1237.963,"Well, FOIA is a special case, Your Honor; that's the first difference."
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.617,1272.3,Well--
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1272.3,1273.402,In a lot of ways -- sorry.
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1273.402,1276.002,--Give us -- give us your definition.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1279.389,1279.889,Right.
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.889,1281.572,--that was read.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1290.595,1311.091,"On the investigation side, it's a definition -- the definition is a focused and sustained inquiry toward a government end, a substantive government end that would have to do with the policies and practices of the -- of the agency; that is, uncovering noncompliance or assembling information about a policy program or something like that."
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1312.61,1315.978,Do you know any -- any dictionary that gives that definition?
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1326.334,1326.901,"--It is, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.901,1330.488,I don't know any dictionary that would define the word the way you say it.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1330.488,1331.838,"That's the Second Circuit's holding, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1340.928,1352.585,Which is -- can you point us to the page so we can see the Second Circuit's definition of report and the Second Circuit's definition of an FCA investigation?
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1352.585,1358.555,"--I'm not sure that I can do that, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1358.555,1368.53,"Well, I don't -- I don't want to eat into your time."
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1368.53,1378.903,"Well, I -- I understood the definition that I read to be the position that you are advocating, not simply some dictionary -- some definition that happens to appear in the dictionary."
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1384.922,1399.799,"We -- we believe that that's a good definition that could be used, Your Honor, but the trouble is that there's not going to be any dictionary definition that covers all the innumerable ways that ""administrative report"" can be used."
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1415.159,1426.097,"But if we adopt your definition, isn't it true that a lot of things that are labeled Department of Labor report, Justice Department Freedom of Information Act report, are not reports?"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1426.097,1433.686,"Yes, Your Honor, and that's why I told you that the Second Circuit's definition, if you're looking for an overarching definition, is a better one."
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1435.555,1439.44,So you're withdrawing from the definition that you proposed in your brief?
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1439.44,1450.898,"--I -- I believe they are both helpful, Your Honor, and I also believe that the -- the Second Circuit's definition covers all of these kinds of reports, but there's no need for this Court to issue its own definition."
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.573,1466.957,Don't we have to say why?
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1469.609,1470.209,"--Of course, you have--"
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.209,1475.013,"And once we have to say why, we're -- we're getting into the need for defining what a report is."
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1475.013,1477.113,"--Well, I -- it would be possible--"
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.113,1480.167,"We don't usually just say yes, no; you know, we usually give reasons."
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1480.167,1493.307,"--I agree with that, Your Honor, but point two of our brief is an explanation of why it makes sense not to have a categorical rule that every FOIA response and all of its attachments are always administrative reports and investigations."
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1517.423,1520.042,Let's talk about the purpose of the statute.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1547.975,1549.994,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1604.564,1607.432,He only knows that because of the FOIA response.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1607.432,1607.816,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1607.816,1613.669,Because -- because the agency said we don't have any reports for those 5 years.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1625.208,1628.512,"There were a few statements wrapped up in that -- in that question, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1657.779,1662.499,"Counsel, the -- I think you've just divided up two issues."
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1671.105,1674.557,It said -- the word is that reports were not found.
2010.10-188,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1674.557,1674.94,Found.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1682.461,1695.404,"That's true, and I would say it's also different from the issue of whether they were filed, because the fact that the agency didn't find them during a cursory review of its records, which is -- a reasonable review of the records is all it's required to do."
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.757,1707.028,"But your client would search if they weren't filed, and on the basis of no other information except this FOIA response."
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1707.028,1708.478,"--It's not no other information, Your Honor."
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.48,1716.734,"How else does your client know that there were no reports filed for these years, which is part of the -- part of the claim here?"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1716.734,1724.138,--He knows that Schindler did not collect the information that it would have needed in order to file accurate reports.
2010.10-188,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1724.138,1725.59,"He wasn't there during those years, was he?"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1725.59,1730.894,"He was only not there during the very tail end of our period, which runs from 1999 to 2005."
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1772.304,1778.208,"Well, may I ask you why a FOIA response doesn't satisfy the Second Circuit's test?"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1806.575,1817.85,The -- there's a missing government end here because all that's happening is the transmission of documents from inside the agency to the outside the agency.
2010.10-188,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1817.85,1823.586,"But that's the way the Second Circuit defined its own, or limited its own definition."
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1834.127,1851.589,"Obviously, satisfying the requirements of FOIA and its regulations is a government end to that extent, but the Second Circuit was trying to distinguish between the substantive work of an agency and the more ministerial but still important act of taking documents out of files and sending them out to the public."
2010.10-188,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1866.948,1874.019,The person is -- the person is separate but is often dealing on a regular basis with people who have line responsibilities and something else.
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1874.019,1874.519,Of course.
2010.10-188,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1874.519,1880.756,"He sees something -- well, that looks like it might be a problem -- he gets on the phone or goes down there and says: Is this covered by the exemption or not?"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1880.756,1882.123,Of course.
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1959.522,1963.224,How do you determine which government ends count and which government ends don't count?
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1963.224,1967.093,My only argument is that FOIA is a different kind of mission.
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1967.093,1970.914,That's the only government -- compliance with FOIA is the only government end that doesn't count?
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,1970.914,1977.484,"I believe FOIA is a special case, Your Honor, and there are many reasons why that -- that would be the case."
2010.10-188,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1984.221,2002.932,"So a report that goes to a department or agency's compliance with some law that is not directly related to the mission of that department, that would qualify as a -- as a government end for these purposes, but FOIA's the only thing that doesn't count?"
2010.10-188,1,33664,jonathan_willens,,2002.932,2005.817,FOIA is the only thing that -- that doesn't count.
2010.10-188,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2067.989,2069.391,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2092.173,2094.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-188,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2138.885,2148.509,"Your test, am I right -- this is page 21 of your brief -- that it has to go to the uncovering of the truth of the matter or inquiring into wrongdoing."
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2149.509,2152.728,--I don't think it has to go just to the inquiring into wrongdoing.
2010.10-188,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2184.913,2190.65,Isn't the test whether -- the test is whether there's a substantive analysis of facts?
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2190.65,2193.185,--There's a substantive analysis of the facts.
2010.10-188,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2212.265,2229.525,"So -- but when the -- when the DOJ pulls together at the end of the fiscal year the number of FOIA requests that it received and calculates the length of time they were pending and discloses that in the annual freedom of act -- Freedom of Information Act report, that is a report?"
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2229.525,2308.477,"I think that would be a report under our definition because the Department of Justice is actually engaging with the data, engaging in the analysis."
2010.10-188,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2311.163,2311.246,Every report is a mean -- means of public disclosure.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2311.329,2311.413,"That's -- that's certainly true, but the public disclosure bar requires more than just the public disclosure."
2010.10-188,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2311.579,2311.663,But I'm -- I'm still struggling to find out what the definition is of -- of a report or an investigation.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2321.952,2325.054,I don't think the -- two answers to that question.
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.24,2385.358,So what -- why -- imagine everything here is the same.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2412.861,2414.661,"--No, and -- I'm sorry."
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.05,2421.4,All right.
2010.10-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2421.4,2423.15,You don't understand the circumstance.
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2423.15,2424.752,That is exactly what happened here.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2424.752,2428.721,"Let me -- that is not -- that's what I want to explain, that's not -- that's not what happened here."
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.06,2444.766,"No, no, it says, please tell me any documents that they filed that says da, da, da, something like that, okay?"
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2469.798,2474.268,The second one would be a report if there was an investigation going on.
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2474.268,2475.368,I'm just telling you the facts.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2478.137,2478.82,If -- if--
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.82,2483.839,"Everything the same except he signs his name, ""fraud officer""."
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2483.839,2485.391,--Then -- then I misunderstood the hypothetical.
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.159,2489.593,All right.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2519.012,2531.688,--In the Government's view the fact that the information was obtained through a FOIA request doesn't answer the question as to the underlying document is an administrative report or an administrative audit or anything else of the sort.
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.89,2540.21,"No, no, you're repeating -- I'm trying to show you what the problem is in my mind."
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2546.031,2551.833,--And -- and the definition -- and -- and I would be the first to acknowledge that there may be difficult questions at the margin.
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.833,2553.451,I'm not trying to make a difficult question.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2563.224,2575.551,"I think based on your hypothetical in both circumstances, all that is done is the agency has looked in its files to see if it has responsive records and disclose them, then in both circumstances that's not a report and there was no--"
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2575.551,2576.017,You say in most.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2577.117,2577.467,"--Oh, sorry."
2010.10-188,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2578.051,2579.003,--In both circumstances.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2579.003,2581.704,Then it's not -- it's not a report and there's been no investigation.
2010.10-188,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.07,2639.707,I don't -- I don't want to have to play these games every time there's -- there's -- there's one of these qui tam actions.
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2649.113,2657.753,"It may be easy to apply, but it's easy to apply and it reads out an entire subset of enumerated sources that Congress thought important to include."
2010.10-188,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2657.753,2668.108,"Did the FCA, the amendments in 2009, which are not retroactive, do they have any bearing on this problem prospectively?"
2010.10-188,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2668.108,2679.499,"On a prospective -- not -- not directly in that the words ""report"", ""hearing"", ""audit"" or ""investigation"" are still included, but it did narrowly and further define what that means."
2010.10-188,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2706.566,2707.432,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-188,3,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,2710.184,2713.636,"I don't think I'll use it all, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-188,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2823.708,2833.665,"Mr. Reiss, assuming that the government did all of the steps you took, how does it promote the purposes of FOIA--"
2010.10-188,3,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,2833.665,2834.832,Very--
2010.10-188,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2834.832,2847.223,"--to find a document created by a third party, under duty or not, that is submitted and contains false statements."
2010.10-188,3,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,2859.298,2859.881,--Well--
2010.10-188,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2859.881,2868.737,"Doesn't that seem illogical, meaning the -- the report filed by the employer is not screaming out, ""I filed a false report""."
2010.10-188,3,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,2883.496,2907.379,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, in that hypothetical the relator actually is bringing independent information, and the public disclosure bar would not be invoked -- not because the FOIA response isn't a report; it wouldn't be invoked because the allegations and transactions in the qui tam complaint were not based on; they were not disclosed in the FOIA response."
2010.10-188,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2925.906,2927.692,I'm still not sure I understand.
2010.10-188,3,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,2952.974,2963.698,"And what I'm saying, Justice Sotomayor is if that's the case, a court can evaluate -- certainly can evaluate whether he is in fact the original source, which would take him out from under the public disclosure bar."
2010.10-188,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2989.447,2994.317,I still don't understand how it promotes the purposes of a qui tam action--
2010.10-188,3,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,2994.317,2996.151,--Because of--
2010.10-188,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2996.151,3007.541,--to put any kind of bar on a relator who is challenging the creation of a document that's submitted by an independent party to the government.
2010.10-188,3,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,3007.541,3022.368,"--Well, one of the purposes of the public disclosure bar was to stop -- and this Court recognized it in Graham County -- parasitic lawsuits by relators with no real significant independent or valuable information to contribute."
2010.10-188,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3025.32,3026.855,In fact that's not true.
2010.10-188,3,41976,steven_alan_reiss,,3039.93,3051.553,"--Exactly, Justice Sotomayor, but our position does not resurrect the government knowledge standard that Congress changed in 1986, and it doesn't do so for some very good reasons."
2010.10-188,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3129.32,3131.52,"Thank you, counsel."
