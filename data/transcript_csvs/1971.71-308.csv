1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,36.08,39.629,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-308,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,212.251,214.083,(Inaudible)
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,214.083,216.953,"Yes sir, he did."
1971.71-308,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,216.953,225.843,Are there any (inaudible) and there was a veto?
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,225.843,235.111,"This case came on, on cross motions for a summary judgment Mr. Justice Blackmun and the record doesn’t reveal any such instance."
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,282.733,286.983,The trusts have been in existence less than six years at the time of his death.
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,286.983,289.936,The trust was created in December 1958.
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,289.936,291.858,He died on September of 64?
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,291.858,292.373,That’s right.
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,292.373,296.81,"And these were series of transfers, it wasn’t just one transfer."
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,296.81,297.966,That’s correct the --
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,297.966,302.783,The creation of a trust in 58 and then a series of transfers over the so many years until his death?
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,302.783,303.638,That’s correct.
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.638,322.746,And how are the case stand if the trust had lasted -- if he lived another 10 years and transferred all of these closely held trust to the or closely held the stock in his corporations to the trust in time of his death but had retained course the same.
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,323.59,327.98,So far as the United States is concerned Mr. Justice Stewart the case would be precisely the same.
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.98,329.199,I thought you would say --
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,329.199,336.713,"Indeed, that may have been the plan in order to obtain the maximum gift tax."
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,336.713,348.087,"So, if the entire 71% and 83% and 88% respectively had at the time of Mr. Byrum’s death then in the hands of the trustee, your case would still be the same [Voice Overlap]."
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,348.087,355.04,"Yes, it would and I would suggest that that would be a kind of see it for estate planners because by then --"
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.04,363.668,"Yes, that is what you now suggesting but the track of the majority was still in his hands at time of his death, doesn’t make your case any stronger, really?"
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,363.668,366.324,That’s only true in the case of the first corporation.
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,366.324,369.386,"Alright, but a lot of percentage was still in his hands?"
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,369.386,379.164,We don’t rely on the distinction between whether the stock retained in his own name or was enough to control or whether to combine right to vote the transfer stock.
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,379.164,386.244,If there has been a complete transfer of all of these stocks even if the trust in 1958 your argue submission would still be basically the same.
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,386.244,387.681,"Yes, we’d still be here."
1971.71-308,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.681,387.916,Yes.
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,387.916,388.353,Yes sir.
1971.71-308,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,388.353,402.79,"Suppose he had transferred not to the trust but it just sold to unaffiliated interest all are substantial percentages of the shares he retained initially, does that make a difference?"
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,402.79,404.557,Sold the stock?
1971.71-308,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,404.557,410.168,"Sold the stock he retained as to that people, suppose he had."
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,410.168,413.136,In other words suppose that he didn’t have control?
1971.71-308,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,413.136,414.215,Right.
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,414.215,429.398,"Well, in the case of the first corporation, if he got below 50% ownership, we might still be here if we could show that he had in substance had control even with the smaller interest."
1971.71-308,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,429.398,431.201,But your case rests on control.
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,431.201,431.824,"Yes, it does but --"
1971.71-308,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,431.824,432.761,Effective control?
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,432.761,437.339,"Effective control, that’s right and if we’re less than 50% it still might be effective control."
1971.71-308,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,439.192,447.808,"At least the point I was leading up to, you asked on control and it may or may not exist depending on whether you have 50% or more."
1971.71-308,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,447.808,454.027,"Well, but in this case, we don’t have that problem on, Mr. Justice Powell because there’s no question that he had controlled."
1971.71-308,1,35124,larry_h_snyder,,1562.239,1568.411,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-308,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,2865.276,2867.825,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice, I do."
