1960.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,5.726,"Dollree Mapp, et cetera, appellant, versus Ohio."
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,8.27,21.598,"Mr. Chief Justice, this Honorable Court, if the Court please."
1960.236,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,118.373,120.489,"What time of the day was this, day or night?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,120.489,122.125,In the daytime.
1960.236,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,122.125,125.145,On a weekday? On a weekday in the daytime?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,125.145,127.282,"Weekday, yes."
1960.236,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,250.964,253.244,"You say ""supposed search warrant"" (Inaudible)"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,253.244,256.269,"There was no search warrant, Your Honor."
1960.236,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,365.43,367.355,What was the piece of paper?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,368.392,370.403,We don't know what it was.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,416.676,419.404,You couldn't have called him?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,419.404,422.508,"If I called him, Your Honor, I would have made him my witness."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,422.508,427.845,"Yes, I know but hostile witnesses, one has freedom with a hostile witness."
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,427.845,429.384,I agree.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,443.974,445.318,"Anyhow, you didn't call him."
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,445.318,447.567,"I did not, I did not."
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,497.707,502.028,Now how -- tried and acquitted of what charge?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,502.028,509.253,Of having in her possession policy paraphernalia for gambling.
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,509.253,509.696,And was the trial --
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,509.696,511.994,It was in the basement in a trunk.
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,511.994,516.547,"And was the trial for possession of obscene literature the same day, immediately following?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,516.547,517.227,"Oh, no."
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,517.227,517.658,I see.
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,517.658,521.413,"Later, and in an entirely different court."
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,521.413,525.022,What was the -- was the prosecution by information or indictment or what?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,525.022,538.021,"The prosecution for the literature was by indictment, whereas the prosecution for the paraphernalia in the gambling transaction was by affidavit."
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,538.021,541.028,How much time elapsed between the two trials?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,541.028,546.902,"If I recall correctly, there was almost a year."
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,546.902,557.261,And had the indictment for possession of the obscene literature been voted before the trial on the other?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,557.261,558.241,"No, after."
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.241,558.75,After.
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,558.75,560.537,"After, after."
1960.236,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,560.537,562.236,You said it was that in different courts?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,562.236,564.204,Different courts.
1960.236,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,566.077,566.447,The other was misdemeanor --
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,566.447,569.746,-- and the other was a misdemeanor so it was tried in the Police Court.
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,569.746,574.069,"Well, was the obscene literature taken in the same search --"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,574.069,574.669,Same search.
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,574.669,576.484,-- as the policy materials?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,576.484,581.307,"Yes, Your Honor, the same search, at the same time."
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,583.024,585.686,From the same trunk?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,585.686,588.888,"Well, parts of the same trunk, we claim."
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,879.326,885.125,Was this without reference to whether the possession was in the room or in the cellar?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,885.125,886.975,Without reference as long as she had it in her possession --
1960.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,886.975,889.738,"Even if in the cellar -- even if in the cellar,she --"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,889.738,893.877,"Even if in the cellar, because she testified that they carried it down to the cellar."
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,897.694,903.644,"Did the judge require the jury to distinguish, though and find that the goods were in the room?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,903.644,904.838,"No, he didn't."
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,904.838,905.431,He did not?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,905.431,908.353,He did not.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,948.568,949.978,Mr. Kearns.
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,949.978,950.749,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,950.749,963.096,May I trouble you to tell us what you deem to be the questions that are open before this Court and I'll tell you why I ask that question.
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,973.431,975.821,"The Lindway case, yes, sir."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,975.821,977.05,Is that still the law of Ohio?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,977.05,978.547,That's still the law of Ohio.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,978.547,992.142,"Well, therefore, in going to the syllabi, I find that the court hasn't decided questions of evidence or the charge, etcetera, etcetera."
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,999.185,1000.729,That's what they decided.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1001.876,1004.507,What else is open?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1016.051,1017.367,Unlawful search and seizure.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1017.367,1021.885,"Yes, but not the charge and not the adequacy of evidence."
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1021.885,1023.06,They didn't decide those.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1033.784,1048.136,Is there any thing else open – is anything beyond – is there anything open before us beyond what the court decided or the chance that they refused to decide a due question and they wouldn't decide it?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1048.136,1049.144,"Well, that is right."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1068.898,1069.169,That is a –
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1069.169,1098.912,"-- because one man was to be put in jail and wanted to be and should have been kept there and that's the Lindway case because they say in the Lindway case, they're actually advocating anarchy because in the Lindway case they say that the police officers that come to the home without a search warrant are trespassing."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1116.449,1121.202,Are asking us to overrule the Wolf case in this Court?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1128.097,1129.673,One of the questions I am trying to –
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1129.673,1132.064,What about my question?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1132.064,1140.811,"Judge Frankfurter, I thought I would start giving you the factual situation and now I will come to the questions."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1142.265,1148.229,When I interrupt – when I ask my – I ask my question as you talked about the charge.
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1148.229,1148.611,Yes.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1148.611,1153.688,"Now so far as I can make out that question isn't here, is it?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1153.688,1154.61,"Yes, it is."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1154.61,1155.292,What?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1155.292,1156.309,"Yes, it is."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1156.309,1159.746,And it wasn't decided by your court?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1159.746,1173.311,"It was raised in our court, but of course, they didn't actually decided by putting it into the syllabus or the syllabi at all."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1187.265,1204.865,"Well, as I understand it, when dealing with an Ohio case, what the court decides is authoritatively expressed only in the syllabi, but I can go to the opinion to find out, perhaps to get some light on what the syllabi means."
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1205.803,1206.83,We do.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1206.83,1213.111,"-- in the opinion, did they say -- did they deal with the charge at all?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1224.665,1231.979,"To my knowledge, yes, it is right, but may I have a moment and I'll read part of it."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1232.784,1233.389,What are you reading now?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1233.389,1238.985,The opinion by Judge Taft of our Supreme Court.
1960.236,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1238.985,1241.352,What page are you reading from?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1241.352,1249.661,Page 91 of the record.
1960.236,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1309.161,1315.169,"Well, that's the only question we've got here, as to whether the statute's constitutional or not constitutional, isn't it?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1315.169,1330.3,"Two questions, as we see it, very respectfully submitted is the question of is the statute constitutional under which she was convicted and the search and seizure proposition in this cause."
1960.236,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1330.3,1336.258,"Well, that means you're asking us to overrule Wolf against Colorado?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1336.258,1338.386,"No, I don't believe we are."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1350.044,1356.477,"And that holds that although evidence is ill procured, it is admissible, is that what that --"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1356.477,1357.685,That's right.
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1357.685,1368.538,And that's the familiar doctrine in most -- so many states of this Union and which we dealt with in the Wolf case that you don't even refer to in your brief.
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1368.538,1372.693,"Well, we went through the Wolf case, but we don't refer to it here."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1502.687,1509.084,"Mr. Kearns, does the State contend that there was a valid search warrant here?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1509.084,1517.606,"I don't believe they do, Your Honor, although they speak of it, and they've spoken of it in the Court of Appeals and in the Supreme Court, but they don't contend that there was."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1517.606,1528.003,"In the Supreme Court of Ohio is there any basis, even in Judge Taft's opinion or the others or the syllabi, that there was a valid search warrant?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1528.003,1531.774,"No, I just read where he says that there is no valid search warrant."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1531.774,1533.258,I said the syllabi.
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1562.932,1565.153,It certainly is because --
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1565.153,1575.952,"I'm not saying – I am not saying are they correct in sustaining it, but is the question that there was an unlawful search, is that in controversy in this case?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1575.952,1577.115,"No, it isn't."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1577.115,1577.702,All right.
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1577.702,1581.013,There was an unlawful search.
1960.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1581.013,1584.194,Did you raise the question of no search warrant in the trial court?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1584.194,1584.867,I did.
1960.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1590.575,1594.747,What was the response of the prosecution to that?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1594.747,1599.229,"There is nothing in the record of any response, nothing."
1960.236,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1632.509,1646.44,"And the Lindway case says, conceded that there was an unlawful search, the fruits of it may nevertheless if relevant to be introduced into evidence in trials in your state, that is –"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1646.44,1658.381,"That is right, and if they do not find contraband then they are liable to a suit for being trespassers, that's what the law – the case holds."
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1741.626,1746.099,What the (Inaudible) do with the sentence that you say is likely sentence?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1746.099,1752.102,"Well, constitutionally hasn't her constitutional rights been violated?"
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1752.102,1753.952,On the length of the sentence?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1753.952,1754.663,Yes.
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1754.663,1756.102,Or --
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1756.102,1758.967,On the severity of it.
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1758.967,1760.515,And you think that's cruel and unusual punishment?
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1760.515,1769.762,"Cruel and unusual punishment, yes and we cite it in our brief with the constitutional provision."
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1776.784,1778.664,"I may be wrong about it, you correct me on it."
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1789.431,1806.794,"Your Honor, the character and type, you're right. But in this case the court had the right to give her a money fine under the same statute, had he seen fit to do so."
1960.236,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1833.604,1842.848,"I thought your real argument was that that conduct just couldn't be a crime, and that therefore this statute's an unconstitutional one?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1842.848,1844.255,That is true.
1960.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1877.539,1885.802,"Assume for the moment that she was constitutionally convicted, do you still contend that the punishment is cruel and inhuman?"
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1885.802,1887.307,I do.
1960.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1896.057,1897.24,I understand that.
1960.236,0,16367,a_l_kearns,,1897.24,1926.313,"And, our Supreme Court, four judges of the seven found that she was not constitutionally convicted, but under our particular procedure the Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court, and where there is an affirmance, then we need six of the seven jurists to hold this unconstitutional, and we only had four of the seven."
1960.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1953.456,1959.333,You may.
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1964.978,1969.238,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2028.615,2033.748,"Are you asking us to re-examine Wolf, or are you relying on Rochin against California?"
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2033.748,2036.903,We are asking the Court to re-examine Wolf.
1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2047.268,2053.672,Do you think an argument could be made based on the existing decisions of this Court?
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2053.672,2055.281,I think that an argument could be made.
1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2060.179,2062.098,The handcuffing of this --

1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2093.284,2103.894,"I notice that statute also makes it a criminal offense, punishable presumably by seven years imprisonment, to have possession of anything intended to prevent conception."
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2103.894,2117.178,"We understand that, and in a case in which the facts were such that that could properly be raised we would be here, with the leave of Court, arguing that point as clearly as the question of obscenity which is now before us."
1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2117.178,2119.197,"This is a fairly new statute, isn't it?"
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2119.197,2121.621,"Yes, it is a fairly new statute."
1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2129.183,2130.001,Yes.
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2130.001,2137.502,That portion of the statute apparently is no longer with us and it seems to us to be one of the principal constitutional defects of the statute.
1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.502,2139.821,"When was the statute enacted, this present one?"
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2139.821,2143.065,"I believe it was in 1955, Your Honor."
1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2143.065,2146.439,Have there been other prosecutions under it?
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2146.439,2147.105,I beg your pardon?
1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2147.105,2149.697,"Have there been, to your knowledge, other prosecutions under it?"
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2149.697,2151.57,"Yes, there have."
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2175.986,2180.656,"Does your brief give us a legislative history, if there be any, for this?"
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2180.656,2181.496,I beg your pardon?
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2181.496,2184.296,Does your brief give any legislative history?
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2188.505,2197.899,"Well, the only legislative history about which we know appears in the brief of the representative of the defendant in this case."
1960.236,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2266.654,2268.837,"It's a constitutional provision, not a statute?"
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2268.837,2274.272,"I'm sorry, the constitutional provision, but we are not now arguing about that."
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2275.203,2285.882,"(Inaudible) it was held in 1912 as a great forward-looking, liberal measure against judicial usurpation."
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2285.882,2293.977,"We understand that at that time some social legislation was under consideration, and, as happens many times situations come back to haunt us."
1960.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2293.977,2298.073,"Herbert Bigelow was the father of it, and he was a great, enlightened reformer."
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2298.073,2300.622,We think -- it's conceded.
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2301.136,2306.138,He was the only one to propose that at the time.
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2306.138,2309.288,"As I say, we are not now contesting that constitutional provision."
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2314.06,2318.163,But in some other case it might help?
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2318.163,2321.494,"Those facts are not before us, Your Honor."
1960.236,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2384.965,2388.915,Is there any issue in this case that the books were obscene?
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2388.915,2389.796,I think not.
1960.236,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2528.413,2532.395,You are not asking us to reconsider Roth?
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2532.395,2535.466,"We are asking you to reconsider Roth, in addition to the other --"
1960.236,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2535.466,2541.602,"You're asking a lot today, don't you?"
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2541.602,2545.084,"Not representing individual defendants, we have considerably more freedom."
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2545.084,2548.77,May I suggest that you do represent a defendant?
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2560.605,2561.898,"We understand that, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2561.898,2563.643,But you just said that you're not --
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2563.643,2569.528,"Consequently, we would like to direct our attention to the argument which we feel is directly related to the --"
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2569.528,2576.942,"I think you can make any argument on behalf of defendant, but you can't say you're not restricted within the bounds within which he's restricted."
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2576.942,2581.518,"Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, there are several branches to our request to this Court."
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2592.298,2596.444,My objection is not to your making any argument that's relevant.
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2598.077,2598.417,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.236,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2598.417,2603.648,You were not given leave to make an oral argument on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.
1960.236,1,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,2607.826,2608.851,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2884.931,2886.91,Mrs. Mahon?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,2886.91,2894.325,May it please the Court and Mr. Chief Justice.
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2933.293,2937.338,Isn't that conceded -- isn't it conceded that the material was obscene?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,2937.338,2939.842,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2940.493,2942.572,So it doesn't make any difference.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,2942.572,2947.772,"No, it wouldn't, except that I did not introduce the cover as an exhibit."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2947.772,2949.233,Yes.
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2949.233,2951.076,Has the Clerk been indicted?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,2952.826,2964.264,"Well, that shows you the necessity for the provision in this statute against possession, knowing possession."
1960.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2966.378,2967.52,How do we know he didn't read it?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,2967.52,2972.409,"Well, frankly, the statute doesn't prohibit reading an obscene book."
1960.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2983.458,2994.635,"But if he keeps it, as I understand it under your Supreme Court's interpretation, after reading it, and it's obscene, then the possession of it is criminal under the statute, isn't it?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,2994.635,2999.858,"Mr. Justice Brennan, if he has unlawful possession and knowing possession --"
1960.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2999.858,3001.47,Where's that either in the statute or in the Supreme Court opinion?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3001.47,3006.286,"That's the charge, in the indictment that this woman was charged."
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3010.594,3015.026,"Unlawful, but possession is unlawful under the statute."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3015.026,3016.319,"I disagree, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3016.319,3018.291,Unlawful possession is circular reasoning.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3018.291,3019.171,"Well, there is a --"
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3019.171,3021.916,"The statute makes possession unlawful, isn't that correct?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3021.916,3025.456,"Well, there is a possession in the hands of the prosecution."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3042.933,3053.917,"Are you saying, I understood you to say a little while ago that the statute was directed against circulation of obscene matter, is that right?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3053.917,3054.428,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3054.428,3056.455,Is that what you said?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3070.353,3072.409,"Circulation, I –"
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3072.409,3074.6,Has your court so construed it?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3074.6,3077.912,"There has been no such construction, but a reading of terminology--"
1960.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3077.912,3081.47,The construction has been exactly opposite.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3091.655,3097.961,"That is right, but inherent in the element of possession is the opportunity for circulation, wouldn't you say, Mr. Justice Brennan?"
1960.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3097.961,3098.543,I wouldn't know.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3100.014,3112.026,"Well, that's what I have in mind in connection with the additional provision in the Ohio statute which was made in 1955."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3142.08,3162.327,"Does that mean, let me see if I understand that, does that mean that any book on my shelf, on any of my shelves, which may be found to be obscene constitutes the possessor, who does nothing but just have that on his shelf, a violator of that statute, is that correct or incorrect?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3162.327,3172.377,"A knowing possession under this statute, a knowing possession of obscenity is prohibited by this statute."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3178.197,3210.153,"On a bookshelf, merely as part of his library, he's a bibliophile and he collects first editions, not for the contents, but because it's a first edition and any book on his shelves, on my shelf, which I know to be obscene in content, but a matter of great indifference to me because I'm interested in the fact that it was published in 1527, that makes me, while I am in Cleveland, a violator of this statute, is that correct?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3210.153,3211.399,"I would say so, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3213.83,3214.964,"Well, then the question of –"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3216.252,3221.596,Any collector of obscenity would be violating this statute.
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3221.596,3229.007,"Well, Uncle Sam is one of the biggest collectors, and I can tell you now where it is, but it's outside of your jurisdiction."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3229.007,3233.429,"Well, Your Honor [Attempt to Laughter]"
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3233.429,3246.235,"But that is not what you said when you said the purpose of this, the aim of this statute, is to prevent circulation, dissemination."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3254.69,3262.044,"Well, Your Honor, but you would have the opportunity, having possession of it, to circulate it, would you not?"
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3262.044,3262.458,What you're saying is --
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3262.458,3266.135,You would have the opportunity to circulate the obscenity.
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3266.135,3293.057,"Well then, what you're saying is that this statute, as your Supreme Court has indicated to anybody who reads it, your statute says that anybody who has in his library, under the circumstances I've indicated, a book concededly containing obscene matter violates your statute and the justification for it is that people might be tempted to circulate it."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3293.659,3297.634,"Well, that's an element involved in possession, too."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3298.691,3304.054,"You can arrest the disseminator, and the way to deal with it is not to have it on his shelf?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3304.054,3304.723,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3304.723,3308.259,"All right, now I understand you thoroughly."
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3308.259,3315.01,"There's no charge, was there, here, that she attempted to disseminate it or intended to disseminate it or intended to circulate it?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3315.01,3317.914,"No, there was not."
1960.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3374.455,3378.427,"Well, wouldn't you say she was still guilty even if they had found it in the basement?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3378.427,3395.866,"1 would say, sir, if she, honorable sir, if she had acknowledged possession, but the claim was that she didn't have possession of that, that she had an involuntary, if you will, possession for someone else."
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3400.751,3420.837,"This man, isn't it correct that the Supreme Court of Ohio, at least this is the way I read their opinion, held that, even if we accept her story as true, that she simply packed up his stuff, of her former roomer and put it down in the basement, even accepting that as true, that still there was a violation of the statute?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3420.837,3423.097,"Yes, I know, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3423.097,3424.097,Isn't that what the court held?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3424.097,3425.328,That's what they held.
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3425.328,3429.185,"And that's what we're bound by here, that construction of your statute."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3429.185,3435.792,"Well, they held that in Syllabus 1, based upon the defense evidence alone, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3450.722,3452.799,"It may be, but we can't do anything about that."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3452.799,3464.606,"Well, I know, but to me, I mean as a prosecutor, it was a jury question, in view of the conflict as to whether she had possession, as she was charged."
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3481.574,3483.422,"Well, why wouldn't she?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3494.621,3500.293,"Well, the charge in the indictment didn't charge her with possession as a bailee."
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3500.807,3501.833,Do you think there's any difference?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3510.434,3512.249,No.
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3530.011,3531.182,"Oh, not available?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3531.182,3531.343,Yes.
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3531.343,3534.141,"And she knew about it, she knew it was there in her house?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3534.141,3535.129,In the basement.
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3535.129,3538.429,"She knew it was there, and that it was very obscene, and didn't do anything."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3538.429,3543.553,I don't believe that the statute contemplates a conviction under those circumstances.
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3582.455,3595.366,"Do you think that under a statute that makes it a crime to have morphine or narcotics that a person could get out, on the basis that he was holding or in possession for somebody else?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3595.366,3597.873,Depending upon the type of possession.
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3617.927,3621.325,"In Prohibition times, the possession of liquor."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3623.744,3636.217,"That is true, but I believe this, Your Honors, that if the jury had given credence to her evidence that we might well have found her not guilty."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3641.558,3655.774,"Mrs. Mahon, are you under the impression that your argument starts with the problem that we are here to decide whether she had possession as a matter of title or if she had merely a bailee's possession?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3657.133,3658.504,"No, whether the statute --"
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3658.504,3660.468,Do you think we're concerned with that question?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3660.468,3662.538,"All right, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3674.012,3697.523,"What difference does it make under your statute or assume, assume that you have to have something which as a matter of law means legal possession, and your Supreme Court has found, has sustained the statute on the assumption that this defendant was found to have had legal possession, whatever legal possession may be in Ohio."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3700.303,3701.299,No.
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3701.299,3704.97,"Well then, that's the basis from which one has to start in discussing this case."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3704.97,3706.104,"All right, then."
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3706.104,3708.137,It requires possession and knowledge.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3708.137,3709.31,Possession and knowledge.
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3709.31,3714.705,"In other words, a checker down at the Union Station wouldn't be guilty if these things were in a suitcase?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3714.705,3719.319,No and scienter was proven in this case.
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3812.302,3818.486,"Is there any other state, to your knowledge, Mrs. Mahon, that makes mere possession a criminal offense?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3818.486,3821.09,"Well, I haven't run down the statutes, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3827.872,3829.097,Winters against New York.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3829.097,3842.559,"In the Winters case you had a different part and that was a similar statute to the Ohio statute, but I do not recall that it prohibited possession alone."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3872.949,3876.114,This must have been before 1955.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,3876.114,3886.048,"Well, I say, the portion we have here was not in the Ohio statute at that time."
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4034.503,4044.278,Do you see any constitutional difference between a statute making possession of narcotics a crime and a statute such as yours making obscene literature?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4044.278,4044.798,Absolutely not.
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4044.798,4046.003,You think they're both the same?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4046.003,4059.695,"I think so, Mr. Justice, because of course, restricting the possession of narcotics comes within the police power of the state to conserve public health and --"
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4059.695,4071.451,"Really, your constitutional argument, if I understand it correctly, come from Roth, is that Roth says obscene literature is not protected, and therefore it's just like contraband, and therefore the State can do anything they want with it."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4071.451,4073.994,"It is within the police power, yes."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4677.765,4705.753,"Have you made an examination of the library of the State University of Ohio or Western Reserve or Wooster, or scores, you've got scores of colleges, I suppose, that are esteemed, I have been told, but my guess is, probably more than any other State in the Union."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4715.371,4724.325,"I would not agree, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that any of those libraries contain any type of book such as the exhibits are in this case."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4724.325,4726.234,I haven't seen these exhibits.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4756.347,4757.267,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4757.267,4763.417,"Pornography itself is a subject for learning, a very important subject."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4763.417,4777.996,"I would find it difficult to believe, without even examining those university libraries, that those libraries would contain what has been passed upon by a jury in this case as obscene material."
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4791.812,4809.2,"But psychiatrists have studied these things as to why human people are so perverted, I take your indication of what these things are, that human beings are so perverted that they bother with these things, or manufacture them, write them, print them, sell them, read them."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4809.2,4810.091,They have to -- well --
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4810.091,4815.42,"Psychiatrists have a lot of business of this sort, I can assure you, Mrs. Mahon."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4815.42,4821.37,"Well, I've often -- I won't say it, Your Honor, but – [Laughter]"
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4821.37,4822.723,"Probably wise, probably wise."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4822.723,4824.072,Probably wise.
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4824.072,4831.016,"Maybe it might be wiser not to discuss the university libraries much further, for the benefit of the university libraries."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4831.016,4832.091,That is true.
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4841.576,4847.135,But we're examining a statute of general application and --
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4847.135,4850.411,It doesn't exempt a psychiatrist.
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4859.214,4866.857,"There are some important medical faculties in Ohio, and therefore important psychiatric branches of medicine."
1960.236,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4866.857,4869.865,Is the petitioner a psychiatrist?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4869.865,4870.491,Who?
1960.236,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4870.491,4873.278,"Petitioner, what is her calling?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4875.304,4877.146,"Oh, no."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4877.944,4881.779,(Inaudible)
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4881.779,4882.755,I don't know.
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4886.971,4891.462,We have your assurance that psychiatrists are not exempted from this statute?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4891.462,4901.436,"Well, as a prosecutor, if we had one charged with unlawfully and knowingly having in his possession and of course the element --"
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4901.436,4908.833,"You don't say that you would prosecute him, though?"
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4908.833,4925.73,"I think only a short time ago there was a proceeding at the Port of New York to prevent one of the great Middle West universities from getting the background, the source material, of the Kinsey Reports."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4938.711,4939.879,For scientific purposes.
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4939.879,4940.297,Yes.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,4957.717,4967.891,"I believe, Mr. Justice, that the law is directed against a scienter possession."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4993.315,5002.761,"Well, the only question I'd be interested in having you answer is the one that Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked you earlier in your argument."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5029.414,5030.003,Yes.
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5036.069,5039.766,"Yes, but does the interpretation of your court make any such distinction?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5039.766,5051.179,"Well, so far we haven't had a decision on anybody from a university charged with unlawful possession of obscene material."
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5075.724,5083.0,"I thought you said a few moments ago that if they had possession and it was obscene, then they should be prosecuted."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5085.23,5090.449,"The individual who would have scienter possession, I don't know who you would charge."
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5090.449,5096.124,"You couldn't draw any distinction under this statute between a university librarian and anybody else, could you?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5101.393,5104.978,I think it's the possession for circulation.
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5104.978,5107.256,But she's not charged with that.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5107.256,5112.323,"No, but the possession with the opportunity for circulation."
1960.236,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5112.323,5115.203,"That'll cover the library, because that's what s library is for."
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5115.203,5116.102,It's a circulating library.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5116.992,5118.327,That's the reason for it.
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5118.987,5125.94,"Not only that, but libraries sell books by way of exchanges."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5125.94,5127.52,That are obscene?
1960.236,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5127.52,5136.272,"Well, all sorts."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5136.272,5149.656,"The only cases, Your Honors, perhaps I should say that I didn't cover the field on this issue, beyond what my experience has been as a prosecutor in prosecutions brought under this statute."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5243.779,5249.048,"Did your Supreme Court hold that, though, in this case?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5249.048,5252.776,"No, that doesn't appear, but our trial court instructed the jury --"
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5252.776,5254.526,It appears to the contrary.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5270.329,5273.859,"Oh, no, not if she knew it was there, Mr. Justice."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5280.68,5282.499,"Yes, that's right."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5282.499,5288.773,"Not that she knew the book and pictures were there, that scienter element."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5288.773,5292.819,"Yes, she had possession of them, knowing what was in them."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5318.07,5319.487,That is so.
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5331.021,5337.692,"You're not in a very good position to disagree with the interpretation that your Supreme Court puts on your Act, are you?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5337.692,5338.292,No.
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5338.292,5339.699,"Not in this Court, anyway."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5339.699,5342.021,No.
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5377.965,5384.241,"Your statute does seem to contain some exceptions, if I read it correctly."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5410.472,5412.245,That's in a separate section.
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5412.245,5414.795,"Well, it applies."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5421.644,5427.689,"No, I said that 2905.34 contains no exceptions."
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5427.689,5430.891,But you have to read that section together with —
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5430.891,5431.215,"With the others, yes."
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5431.215,5434.958,-- with some other sections that bear different numbers.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5434.958,5442.609,"Yes, those are the two - 2905, exempting druggists and exempting —"
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5442.609,5449.027,"Bona fide art associations, whatever that is."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5449.027,5460.462,"Of course, there wasn't any question raised in connection with those other statutes, as I said to you, in the Court of Appeals, any issue raised"
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5469.789,5472.506,They do not apply to this statute?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5472.506,5476.283,"They mentioned 2905.34, yes."
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5476.283,5480.824,You think all the exceptions apply to each statute?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5480.824,5487.992,"No, the one that he is reading from —"
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5487.992,5492.838,Does that apply to the statute under which this lady was convicted?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5492.838,5495.614,"That is true, Mr. Justice."
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5499.872,5507.474,"Well, this is 29 -- the one you've got here is 2905.34, isn't it?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5507.474,5508.148,That's the one –
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5508.148,5522.433,"This exception that I'm reading says 2905.33, which is the one before 34, to 2905.36 don't apply, in these categories of things that I've been reading."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5522.433,5523.133,Yes.
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5523.133,5523.662,Is that right?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5523.662,5527.769,That is true.
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5527.769,5531.15,"Well, I don't understand your other argument."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5543.864,5553.919,The exceptions in the other statute are really exemptions.
1960.236,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5553.919,5554.148,"Well, what –"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5554.148,5557.377,"That is in this respect, now if I can get this clear."
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5576.096,5578.389,2905.37.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5578.389,5639.368,"It's 37, 2905.37."
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5641.746,5665.032,"I think it appears on page 34 of the appellant's brief, 2905.37, Page 34."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5665.032,5704.524,"Well, 2905.37 reads that, Sections 2905.33 to 2905.36, which of course, would include 2905.34, do not affect teaching in regularly chartered medical colleges, the publication of standard medical books, or regular practitioners of medicine or druggists in their legitimate business, nor do they affect the publication and distribution of bona fide works of art."
1960.236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5739.142,5753.605,"I suppose that exemption is directed toward the part of the other statute that makes anything for the prevention of conception, the possession of anything for the prevention of conception, a criminal offense."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5753.605,5754.838,"I suppose, Your Honor."
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5788.74,5808.02,"Well, would it have exempted this lady if she --if what she had was a bona fide work of art made, published, and distributed by a bona fide association of artists, or an association for the advancement of art?"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5808.02,5826.48,"No, it would not, Your Honor, because the very end of that statute says ""whose demonstrated purpose does not contravene Sections 2905.06 through 2905.34."""
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5835.681,5841.594,I don't know what those other sections define.
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5841.594,5878.644,"Even if she belonged to the — if it was for the advancement of art, it cannot be held to contravene, I mean, there's no exemption if it contravenes 2905.34."
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5972.201,5973.557,Is she out now?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5973.557,5975.114,She has never served time.
1960.236,2,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,5975.84,5978.635,Out on bail?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,5978.635,5991.988,"In other words, on a sentence to the Ohio State Reformatory for Women on this case, the defendant's time could be one year or less a month; in other words, she's put in eleven months."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6016.325,6031.76,"But in your State -- is your State like other states, some other states, where they have an indeterminate sentence law that when they are sentenced they are sentenced for the maximum until the parole board --"
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,6031.76,6032.567,"Oh, no."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6032.567,6036.299,-- reduces it to a shorter term?
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,6036.299,6040.649,"Oh, no, Mr. Justice."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6062.174,6063.361,"Yes, I understand that."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,6063.361,6065.013,There's no maximum sentence.
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6065.013,6072.358,"I know, I understand that, but I've operated under an indeterminate sentence law, too, for many years."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,6088.742,6091.545,The sentence includes that?
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6091.545,6099.624,"No, there's nothing said about it, but that is the statutory interpretation of it."
1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,6105.192,6116.271,"Well, of course, I -- it's been my impression that they go to, for example, on the one to seven, or one to ten."
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6441.037,6444.978,Is the search warrant in existence?

1960.236,2,25730,gertrude_bauer_mahon,,6452.84,6458.252,There's no record that there was a search warrant.
1960.236,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6502.87,6507.33,"All right, thank you."
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6507.33,6509.489,Do I have --
1960.236,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6509.489,6514.712,"Yes, you have some time left, I think, Mr. Kearns."
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6514.712,6518.362,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1960.236,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6677.652,6679.76,We'll recess now Mr. -- We'll recess now.
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6679.76,6684.117,Thank you.[Recess]
1960.236,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6684.117,6685.191,-- your arguments.
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6685.191,6689.51,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1960.236,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6735.366,6742.016,"I suppose -- I suppose she could've called it to the attention of the police, couldn't she?"
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6742.016,6750.707,"Well, if she called it to the attention of the police, she would still be in possession under this statute."
1960.236,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6750.707,6753.071,"Well, (Inaudible)"
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6753.071,6772.091,"And -- and if the police were of the type that they were and doing the things that they did they usually do in Cuyahoga County using their badges as supreme authority, they would have done the same thing by prosecuting her."
1960.236,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6942.058,6945.498,May I ask you what relevance to that as to your point?
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6945.498,6947.434,The relevance that it has to our point --
1960.236,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6947.434,6951.075,-- State -- State constitutional provision.
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6951.075,6954.678,State constitutional provision as well as the Federal constitutional provision.
1960.236,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6954.678,6956.335,You are reading from that.
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6958.048,6974.703,I was reading from the State constitutional provision as same as Section -- practically a copy of our own federal constitutional provision which is the same that the people be secured in their homes against unlawful search and seizure.
1960.236,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6974.703,6982.358,"Yes, but you are reading what the Supreme Court has held with reference to its own State constitutional provisions."
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6982.358,6983.339,Not that they held.
1960.236,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6985.46,6985.938,Well --
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6985.938,6987.383,-- of Judge Herbert --
1960.236,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6987.383,6988.427,It's all than more.
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,6988.427,6998.337,-- reading the State constitutional provision which is identical with the federal constitutional provision as to unlawful search and seizure.
1960.236,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7000.171,7004.484,That doesn't -- that doesn't reach the question that you ask about several times.
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,7025.247,7053.921,"Well, we feel that in the Wolf case, this Court did not intend to make it a general matter or proposition of that sort because of the fact that there are such exceptions where as in the Lindway case, where there is real criminality, where there is violation of law knowingly, intentionally and profitably as in the case."
1960.236,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,7075.161,7081.52,(Inaudible) the Rochin case?
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,7081.52,7083.098,I think it does.
1960.236,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7114.185,7121.811,What particular Acts bring it within the Rochin case?
1960.236,3,16367,a_l_kearns,,7121.811,7127.477,The -- we -- that's -- I -- I can't say definitely Your Honor.
