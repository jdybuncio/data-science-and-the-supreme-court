1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.84,"We'll hear arguments next in No. 79-770, The Environmental Protection Agency vs. National Crushed Stone, et al.--"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,84.764,88.497,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,183.539,184.273,What was that second--
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,184.273,186.1,--304(b).
1980.79-770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.266,360.842,"--When you say an industry, you're not talking about a particular firm, you're talking about all of the firms in the industry?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,360.842,361.279,All of the industry.
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,424.02,425.676,The '77?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,425.676,427.036,That's the '77; that's right.
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.339,459.71,"Well, I suppose, then, the EPA does think it's relevant and significant how many marginal firms will be put out of existence?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,459.71,460.006,That's right.
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,479.233,483.636,"In arriving at that conclusion, what was the concept of total cost?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,483.636,496.695,"The concept of total cost as evidenced in the legislative history primarily is a kind of economic total cost, the outlay of firms, capital costs, operating costs, and also--"
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,496.695,499.662,It would include economic dislocation of unemployment?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,499.662,500.849,--Yes.
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,500.849,501.349,Did it?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,501.349,502.74,It did in these cases.
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,516.923,521.108,"Well, but did they do all this before arriving at the conclusion that there were only 28, if that's the number--"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,521.108,521.92,--That's right.
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.647,546.082,"--And now, is there any difference in this respect between the '77 limitations and the '87?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,546.082,547.3,"Well, to some extent."
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,561.03,569.432,"Well, the '87 said something about, there must be the maximum technology, not the best practical technology--"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,569.432,569.76,It says--
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,569.76,572.15,"--which is the '77 test, isn't it?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,572.15,572.759,"--That's right, but--"
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,572.759,573.883,And the '87 is maximum.
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,576.804,577.648,--Yes.
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,586.035,589.894,"I missed the first... the average of the best, or--"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,589.894,594.518,--The average of the best performers in the various subcategories of a particular industry.
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,601.875,607.044,"--Well, doesn't this mean that under the '87 test the burden is going to be much greater on a member of the industry?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,607.044,611.01,--It can be but it doesn't necessarily have to be and in fact--
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.01,611.823,What did you say was the difference?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,615.462,619.258,"--Twenty-six and 35, respectively, in the two--"
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,619.258,621.445,Thirty-five under the '87 and 26 under--
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,621.445,622.148,"--No, excuse me; I'm sorry."
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,636.563,638.719,"--Now, how about as a result of the '87?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,638.719,660.632,"There has... since in these industries up till now the '87 limitations are approximating the '77 limitations, since the best performers happen also to be the best performer, and since there's not a great need for further improvement at this time, they don't expect anybody to be put out of business, as I understand it, as a result of the '87 limitations."
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,660.632,665.364,"Realistically, the two standards might not be very far apart."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,666.129,667.52,"That's exactly correct, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,667.52,672.05,"The average of the best, or the highest, might be quite close together."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,672.05,672.612,They could be.
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,680.155,681.671,And that's why the 10-year span--
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,681.671,683.202,That is right.
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,683.202,687.779,--to allow time for economic and other and technological adjustments?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,687.779,688.138,That's right.
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,698.445,702.116,"Suppose, instead of 27 and 35 it was 270 and 350?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,706.816,730.401,"--Well, at some point, if EPA initially promulgated on the interim basis, not a final regulation, and then they went out and they did an economic survey and they saw that a substantial portion of the industry was going to be closed down as a result of that, they would have to rethink the level of technology and make it more affordable and reasonable for the industry as a whole."
1980.79-770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,730.401,740.085,You do concede that the statute with respect to the 1977 limitations does require the agency to weigh the total cost to the industry?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,740.085,742.443,"That's correct, and that was done here, and there's no dispute about that."
1980.79-770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,742.443,751.33,"And if the figures were such as suggested by the Chief Justice as a hypothetical question, that could affect the total... that could affect... the total cost to the industry?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,751.33,768.308,I am informed by the Administration that in no case under the 1977 limitations did the economic forecast show that anything more than 1 percent of an industry would be closed as a result of the industry-wide level.
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,768.308,779.96,"If you had those larger figures, there would be a further subanalysis to be made to determine whether those were the marginal operators or whether they were average all the way through the industry."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,779.96,796.952,"Or it could turn out that upon promulgation they'll find out that they didn't know enough about the industry as a whole, and so they have to go back and get some more information, because when you have an industry of more than 5,000 or 6,000 dischargers, as you have in these cases, you can't... they don't take into account every single discharger."
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,812.165,823.083,"Suppose a given member of the industry is determined by EPA to be unable to meet the prevailing 1977 standards, must EPA then grant a variance?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,823.083,825.16,"No, that's the... well, that's the issue in this case."
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,832.892,844.747,"Well, suppose they determine they can't, what I'm trying to get to, is it your position that they need not, even in that situation, grant a variance but merely to consider that as one of other factors?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,844.747,845.544,--No.
1980.79-770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,848.746,862.194,"The issue in this case is, if the reason a particular component of the industry cannot is a financial reason, your claim is that they do not and need not grant a variance, period."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,862.194,862.864,--That's right.
1980.79-770,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,863.614,868.533,"And that's the issue, and your brothers on the other side claim you have a duty to grant a variance."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,868.533,868.94,--Yes.
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,945.129,949.035,Suppose in that very instance EPA had refused to grant the variance?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,949.035,953.362,"Well, then there might be an abuse of discretion, and that's reviewable in the--"
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.362,958.297,Wouldn't he have to show that he had some other proposal that would improve?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,958.297,959.375,--No.
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.045,968.139,"Oh, you're talking about '77 now?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,968.139,968.592,--That's correct.
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.592,970.403,If it were '87--
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,970.403,973.777,"Well, I will get to that in one moment if I could, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,973.777,977.213,"--Before you leave '77, let me put this hypothetical."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1001.468,1007.841,"I am not quite sure I follow the hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, Insofar as he came in and said--"
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1007.841,1010.544,"Well, I'd come in to EPA and say, I've got three competitors here."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1016.947,1021.321,"--And the question then becomes, why his expenses would--"
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1021.321,1028.035,"Is EPA going to say to me, well, you're just not very efficient, because if your competitors can do it, you ought to be able to do it?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1028.035,1053.072,"--Well, if your plant for all purposes directly relevant to compliance is exactly the same as your three competitors and it is simply a matter of your having been economically inefficient, or incompetent, and you just cannot afford, because you don't have the money that your more efficient competitors have to comply, and you are no different in any other respect, that is not a basis for a variance and you'll be forced to close."
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1054.276,1054.853,Forced to comply?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1054.853,1055.822,--Or comply; right.
1980.79-770,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.216,1137.525,"He has to also say, I have made reasonable progress over the '77 limitations, and if the '77 limitations are the same as the '87 limitations, he can't get a variance under those circumstances."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1137.525,1140.772,--But then presumably he's been complying with the '77 all along; there's no reason he needs a variance.
1980.79-770,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.772,1151.144,"But there really can't be a hypothetical case, can there, in which anybody could get a variance under the '87 limitations, who has complied with the '77 in this industry?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1151.144,1153.675,That's right.
1980.79-770,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.533,1165.687,"Before you finish, will you tell me the statutory source of the variance authority under the '77 limitations?"
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1165.687,1171.155,"Well, that was a... that was underlying the problem in dupont, I think."
1980.79-770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1266.569,1286.92,"Well, Mr. Levander, looking at the government policy as a whole here and including the Small Business Administration loan, it isn't going to be the kind of mom-and-pop crushed stone operators that are hit, when you refer to the marginal ones, because they can get the loans."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1290.747,1295.807,"That is conceivable although I'd like to point out two things, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.927,1424.709,I'll argue with you on that.
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1428.145,1428.911,--That's right.
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.659,1440.5,"That's an independent reason for having it, for having that variance expressly stated."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1440.5,1444.137,"--Well, except that you wouldn't have needed to say, 301."
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1490.12,1500.834,Let me back up a little bit to ask whether this record discloses how many of the total in each of these industries would be under 250 employees?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1500.834,1508.238,The record does not break it down but it does indicate that the majority of firms are quite small in terms of the percentage--
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1508.238,1522.59,"I should think that the general observation would be, although I would not notice it judicially, that most of the crushed stone people, more than half of them, would be under 250 now."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1522.59,1535.243,"--I would guess that is absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice, although in terms of production there are few firms, like 1 percent or 10 percent of one industry produces 40 percent of the production."
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.693,1553.345,They might be large firms but each unit... they might well be scattered; a corporation might own ten of these units... but each of the units is not likely to be over 250 employees.
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1553.345,1553.968,I think that's probably correct.
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.968,1560.373,And they'd each be operating under different conditions with different drainage problems and different supply problems.
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1560.373,1565.588,"Well, but the regulation was set by taking into account these variances."
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1580.021,1581.036,Tell me something.
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1583.863,1587.252,"Well, the permits last for five years."
1980.79-770,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1587.252,1587.955,Five?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1587.955,1588.362,Right.
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.719,1595.186,This is for the '77?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1595.186,1595.577,That's correct.
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.249,1606.806,But at least a variance under '77 couldn't last any longer than... a variance would be required for the '87s?
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1606.806,1607.931,That's right.
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.429,1620.723,"Well, did the Court of Appeals hold that you had to take in affordability in a sense that if he couldn't afford it, you had to give the variance."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1621.286,1622.239,That's not altogether clear.
1980.79-770,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.457,1630.751,"On the other hand, it isn't altogether clear that the question that you present in your brief is really the question."
1980.79-770,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,1636.857,1637.92,--Yes.
1980.79-770,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1658.866,1661.364,Very well.
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1665.315,1668.22,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.217,1759.714,"You mean you've never claimed that just because you couldn't afford it, you were entitled to a variance?"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1759.714,1760.12,"--No, sir."
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.892,1786.906,Or even... or for the variance.
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1786.906,1787.438,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.67,1805.477,"Well, he... I thought he also said that in making the '77 regulations, might not that... that they considered affordability in the sense that, how many firms would be put out of existence?"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1805.477,1807.164,"And that's the heart of this case, sir."
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.024,1922.726,"Well, when does he get a variance?"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1922.726,1924.569,"--He never gets a true variance, sir."
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1933.144,1935.159,"Well, I know, but when does he win?"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1936.219,1936.891,--When does he win?
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1939.656,1943.03,What does he have to show to win so that he gets his permit?
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1943.546,1944.28,--All right.
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.478,1957.586,"--You know, well, you've already conceded as far as I can tell that just because he--"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1957.586,1957.79,"--Yes, but i'm going to tell you--"
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.79,1960.243,--can't afford it doesn't get him very far.
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1960.243,1960.664,--That's right.
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1975.519,1976.83,"Under '77, for '77?"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,1976.83,1977.221,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2061.063,2062.594,"Mr. Freeman, let me ask you this."
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2062.594,2063.03,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2063.03,2076.885,"What inferences, if any, could reasonably be drawn from the fact that such a small percentage of the... such a small segment of the industry in each case here is adversely affected?"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2076.885,2080.694,"Sir, we don't know how many people are adversely affected here."
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2082.288,2083.1,"Well, we were given some figures."
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2084.756,2088.208,--I do not challenge those figures as being figures in the record.
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.503,2156.352,"Suppose, for example, that the record showed that 1/10 of 1 percent of all the employees in the industry, the employees, would be unemployed, out of business, under the regulations, would... would that reasonably suggest that the regulations were not unduly stringent?"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2156.352,2160.335,"Oh, sir, I think that would suggest that the regulations were probably all right."
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2160.335,2162.225,Or even too loose?
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2162.225,2166.411,"Well, but the regulations meet one test."
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.101,2255.984,"What do you make out of the example that your colleague gave a few moments ago that the man who is on the edge of a cliff, and if you really enforce the regulations against him, he wouldn't get a permit and if he had to live up to it he couldn't afford it?"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2266.933,2271.198,--I didn't in any way understand him to say that.
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.198,2271.948,"Oh, you didn't."
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2271.948,2284.818,"And I know that in the cases that I've had where I have tried to present evidence of those economic effects, that EPA clearly will exclude it."
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.568,2293.316,"Well, I asked him if he weren't talking about the '87 variance and he said, no, he was talking about the '77."
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2293.316,2297.595,"--Well, sir, I ask you to look at their reply brief--"
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.595,2300.188,Because let's assume that I understood him correctly.
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2314.495,2318.914,"--Well, sir, if he said that, I didn't understand it that way."
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.914,2320.227,"Then he's even changed his position more than you thought, then."
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2320.227,2328.676,"Yes, sir, and it's contrary to the position set forth in footnote 9 of his reply brief where he makes it clear that--"
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.676,2329.973,I perhaps misunderstood him.
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2329.973,2332.675,--that evidence would not be admissible in a variance proceeding.
1980.79-770,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.675,2334.518,What do you think he meant by it?
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2336.159,2338.173,I don't know.
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2388.342,2400.931,"Let me put a hypothetical concretely to see if I understand the point you made about their resistance to subjective evidence, as distinguished from objective, industry-wide evidence."
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2425.295,2427.217,In a variance clause proceeding.
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2428.981,2430.372,"Well, do they in fact?"
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2430.372,2432.043,--it's what they state clearly time and time again.
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2432.043,2437.54,Do they in fact and in practice have they refused tenders of evidence of that kind?
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2437.54,2458.969,"Well, we have pointed out, sir, and in certain cases of inconsistency on EPA's part... because one of the things that it has argued here is the presumption of validity to its own regulation, which changes daily, but, in some of the cases, we pointed out that they had admitted evidence of that."
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2473.838,2476.135,"Well, then the EPA is allowing it in."
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2476.994,2485.132,"Well, it's allowing it in... it's being allowed in by a hearing examiner over the objections of counsel for the agency."
1980.79-770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2520.196,2524.413,"--Mr. Freeman, it seems to me we've got another problem that we haven't talked about yet."
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2524.413,2525.132,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.132,2530.817,At one stage of the proceeding I thought the question was whether affordability was a sufficient ground for a variance.
1980.79-770,1,25290,george_c_freeman_jr,,2564.444,2581.813,"If I may have... yes, sir... well, if I may address that because I think you are wrong, and I think what happened is that the D. C. Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit arrived at the same point, namely that all of this evidence under 304(b)(1)(B) had to be considered."
1980.79-770,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2702.311,2712.931,Mr. Garrett.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2712.931,2714.758,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-770,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2714.758,2722.864,"Before you go on, let me pursue the hypothetical if not real question posed by Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2754.773,2756.913,"--Well, I'll address it now, since it seems to be on your mind."
1980.79-770,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2833.103,2837.897,"Will not be grounds, but will it be received and weighed, along with other factors?"
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2837.897,2846.082,"The Agency's regulations say not, and I think that if you read the preamble to the Agency's 1979 regulations, it makes it absolutely clear."
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.482,2862.715,This is for the '77 variance?
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2862.715,2864.527,Yes.
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.948,2869.666,Different from the '87?
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2870.119,2871.337,I believe that's right.
1980.79-770,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2881.943,2895.968,"Well, is your response to be taken as saying that if the EPA declined to receive evidence of the hypothetical I suggested, economic factors on the town, that would be error?"
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2897.999,2902.263,"Well, it would be consistent with its own regulations and the Agency would be bound to follow those regulations."
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.334,2927.192,--But at least we'd have a record about what kind of evidence they really will permit and what they won't.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2936.564,2941.797,"--Well, what I made of it is that if there was a technological factor--"
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.797,2943.514,Technological?
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2946.17,2950.45,"--My understanding, and I think it's better addressed to the EPA counsel--"
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.45,2953.73,"I thought that the implication was that, sure, we'll receive evidence of that."
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2953.73,2957.12,"--As to the costs, but not as to affordability."
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.681,2964.571,"Well, it's evidence of affordability anyway, the cost is."
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2964.571,2971.347,"--Well, I guess all I can suggest is that you read EPA's regulations as I just cited them."
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.394,2978.314,"And so you're suggesting the Solicitor General isn't following his own regulations, in this example?"
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2978.314,2979.892,"--Well, I think that you'd better ask him."
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.892,2985.593,"Well, I thought it was fair, I thought it was fair to ask you."
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2985.593,2985.718,I had understood it in a different way.
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.123,2998.495,"You mean, if the fellow who is putting in the evidence couldn't go on and say, furthermore, I can't afford this?"
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,2998.495,2999.432,That's exactly right.
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3001.885,3004.461,But that they might give him a variance because it was more expensive for him?
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3004.461,3005.836,That's correct.
1980.79-770,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3018.626,3022.047,I'm sure Mr. Levander will enlighten us when it comes to his four minutes.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3040.197,3043.07,"Well, yes and no."
1980.79-770,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3043.07,3047.6,It has to... for it to be a relevant factor it has to be decisive in some cases.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3055.144,3061.532,"Well, first of all, I think our position has consistently been that you have to consider a number of factors so that that one factor--"
1980.79-770,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3061.532,3065.171,All other factors are neutral except affordability in my hypothetical.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3065.171,3067.154,"--Secondly, I'm not sure that the size of the plant alone--"
1980.79-770,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.154,3070.044,"Well, it's the capital structure of the company."
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3072.214,3083.226,"--Well, let's say that the large company concludes that by virtue of imposition of these added costs that it becomes uneconomical to operate that plant, whether it be a crushed stone facility or some other facility."
1980.79-770,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.226,3084.21,You keep changing my example.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3084.21,3089.957,"Well, my only point is that it might be a relevant distinction and it might not."
1980.79-770,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3089.957,3091.129,Yes; dupont's.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3104.346,3104.503,My point is it's always relevant.
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.503,3105.986,What are we arguing about?
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3105.986,3106.752,It's always relevant.
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.877,3112.157,The government's position was that that was wholly irrelevant.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3112.157,3114.234,--That's our understanding of their position.
1980.79-770,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3114.234,3116.045,But now you just said it might or might not be relevant.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3116.045,3119.544,"Well, our position is that it would always be relevant."
1980.79-770,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.761,3130.492,I don't understand how anything could be relevant but never be dispositive.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3138.693,3158.45,"Well, I just think that all other factors being equal it might be dispositive, yes, recognizing the fact that there is a certain amount of discretion that the Agency has and that it's hard to find two plants that are in identical circumstances with respect to the impact on receiving waters and other factors."
1980.79-770,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3158.45,3162.574,I'm sure Mr. Levander will clear it up for us.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3162.574,3179.364,"The difficulty that we have with the Agency's regulations is that the Agency says that it will grant the variance based on a number of factors, and they enumerate them, including engineering, process factors, land availability, and so forth."
1980.79-770,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3412.1,3416.598,How does that translate into number of employees?
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3416.598,3444.446,"I'm not sure, Mr. Justice Burger, but it's relevant with respect to EPA's economic analysis, and the adequacy of that analysis, that on-third of the industry... some 1,600 companies... are composed of plants that produce less than 25,000 tons per year, far smaller than studied by EPA even in its smallest small plant economic analysis."
1980.79-770,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3471.045,3477.714,"Mr. Garrett, you don't make any constitutional argument in this care, do you?"
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3477.714,3487.631,"Well, we suggest that there's a delegation problem that could be avoided if the statute's interpreted our way."
1980.79-770,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3487.631,3493.8,"Well, I thought it was a matter entirely of statutory construction."
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3493.8,3502.298,I think the case can be disposed of as a matter of statutory construction but I--
1980.79-770,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3502.298,3503.766,I thought that's what the issues were.
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3503.766,3504.797,--That is the issue.
1980.79-770,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.774,3528.428,"But there's no due process argument, or there's no argument that there's a taking without compensation, or anything like that."
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3528.428,3528.819,Well--
1980.79-770,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3528.819,3530.614,Is there or isn't there?
1980.79-770,2,42737,theodore_l_garrett,,3530.614,3540.939,"--Not as such, although the issue is going to surface in one proceeding or the other, which was getting to my second point."
1980.79-770,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3638.663,3642.881,"Now you'll clarify this problem for us, Mr. Levander."
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3642.881,3643.615,Yes.
1980.79-770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3749.231,3751.636,Are there some contrary indications in the legislative history?
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3751.636,3753.104,No.
1980.79-770,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3814.079,3821.421,Would the Government be satisfied if we adopted the formulation of the problem of the D.C. Circuit with which you say this 4th Circuit is in conflict?
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3821.421,3823.247,Yes.
1980.79-770,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3842.083,3844.021,Is that the man on the cliff problem?
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3844.021,3846.41,That's the man on the cliff problem and all kinds of other problems.
1980.79-770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3847.004,3849.518,So you take evidence of cost as relevant?
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3849.518,3851.142,--Cost of compliance.
1980.79-770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3851.142,3855.594,And you do... would you agree with Brother Stevens that it will be determinative sometimes?
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3855.594,3856.641,That is correct.
1980.79-770,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3880.818,3882.427,Does the cost of compliance include capital costs?
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3883.443,3892.469,"--Well, that, of course, I answer by Section 8 financing which is available, so that the person who couldn't get monies for--"
1980.79-770,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3892.469,3898.857,"No, no, not in whether there's financing, but in determining costs, are capital costs an item that you're looking at?"
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3901.044,3908.229,"--Well, that's a closer question as to whether his lack of money, we don't take into account."
1980.79-770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3927.285,3931.722,"So if he offers his operating statement for the past five years, you reject it?"
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3931.722,3932.315,We don't want to see it.
1980.79-770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3932.315,3933.643,You reject it.
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3933.643,3934.096,That's right.
1980.79-770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3935.096,3938.0,But if he wants to tell you how much it's going to cost him?
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3938.0,3945.559,"--That we want to know, and that's the basis for variances and that's what will keep these claims of all these industries--"
1980.79-770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3945.559,3948.995,Even though in making up the regulation you wanted all those operating statements?

1980.79-770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3967.425,3973.064,You don't think the fact that he'll go out of business triggers the necessity to consider some of the other factors?
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3973.064,3977.891,"--Well, I think it heightens the analysis on the variance proceeding, but it's simply irrelevant--"
1980.79-770,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3977.891,3981.484,"Well, then, how can you say you don't want to see his operating statements?"
1980.79-770,3,16416,andrew_j_levander,,3981.484,3982.201,--We don't.
