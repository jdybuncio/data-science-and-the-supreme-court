1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.01,"Mr. DeVault, you may proceed whenever you are ready:"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,15.01,17.61,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-177,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,372.672,374.422,Was that a divided opinion?
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,374.422,385.463,"There was a special concurring opinion by Judge Hill, Your Honor, and he consented and concurred in the judgment because he felt bound by a prior Fifth Circuit decision."
1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,494.867,498.719,But you have to prove that two or more people conspired to defraud?
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,498.719,515.745,"Exactly, Your Honor, of course, in order to reach the conspiracy you would have to prove that initial element, my point being that whereas the first section is anchored to a substantive federal offense, so there is no question as to what the defendant is being charged, the second section is not so anchored."
1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,538.444,544.998,Did the indictment name the agency which your client is charged with defrauding?
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,544.998,551.568,"It named the REA as the agent which guaranteed the loan, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,619.479,627.818,"Is that the government's argument here, that you defrauded Seminole and therefore you are guilty, or is it the government's argument that you defrauded REA?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,627.818,631.937,"The government's argument is that we defrauded REA, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.845,702.866,"I suppose... would you be making the same argument if these two gentlemen, Mr. Conover, was it--"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,702.866,703.3,Yes.
1986.86-177,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.3,712.639,"--and Mr. Tanner, if they did something that made it more likely that the REA would be called upon to live up to its guarantee?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,712.639,727.066,"Justice White, I don't believe that a likelihood of damage would in itself be sufficient, absent some federal purpose."
1986.86-177,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.066,748.329,"Well, assume... just assume that two people conspired to use materials in building a road that were so bad that they had to do it all over again, and they had to... and the REA had to... and Seminole ran out of money."
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,748.329,756.001,"If there was evidence of a proprietary loss, as in Your Honor's example, then it would fit within this Court's prior decisions which say that--"
1986.86-177,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.001,759.47,"Well, the loss would be to Seminole."
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,759.47,765.191,--I thought Your Honor's example suggested that the REA would be required to extend--
1986.86-177,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.191,765.907,Exactly.
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,765.907,769.928,"--additional funds, and that there would be some loss to the federal government because of the inability--"
1986.86-177,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,769.928,780.05,Wasn't there an allegation in this case that the specifications were so drawn that they favored Tanner?
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,780.05,781.152,"--There was, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.152,788.489,"And hence, that perhaps better, lower bids weren't forthcoming?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,788.489,797.511,"There were allegations of that, Your honor, and of course for purposes of this petition we accept those allegations and the proof there under--"
1986.86-177,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.511,803.415,"It may be that this job cost Seminole more than it should have, under the allegations?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,803.415,805.015,"--That was the allegation, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.091,821.043,Let me get this clear.
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,844.024,856.634,"I believe Your Honor, that if there were shown, on Your Honor's hypothetical, that there was a loss to the federal government because of the defaulting, then you could have, under this Court's decisions, fraud against the United States."
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.634,863.387,"Why does that make it any... well, this isn't an indictment for fraud against the United States."
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,866.822,868.191,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.191,875.845,"Now, it seems to me basic law that you don't have to achieve the end of your conspiracy to be guilty of conspiracy."
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,890.855,897.711,"Well, first, Your Honor, there was no such allegation on this indictment with respect to the purposes of conspiracy."
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.47,922.909,"You have to actually intend to cause a loss to the federal government; it's not enough that you want to defraud Seminole of every penny it owns, that wouldn't do?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,922.909,929.396,Absent a connection between Seminole and the federal government or an agency thereof.
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.396,931.132,"Well, there is a very close connection."
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,938.336,948.059,"Your Honor, only if there is a default under the loan would the federal government have to make good on Seminole's obligations."
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.701,976.544,"I'm not sure you're wrong about your whole case, but I do think it's very difficult to draw the line where you would do it, and that is to say that so long as the government has to cough up some money the indictment is good, but if it doesn't have to cough up any money the indictment is bad."
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,978.163,988.351,"Well, in point of fact, this Court has not heretofore drawn the line and indicated what the line should be."
1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1040.069,1050.442,Does the government allege or prove that there were any fraudulent representations or practices made to the REA by your clients?
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1050.442,1065.018,"There was no proof, Your Honor, of which I am aware that showed a direct representation that was fraudulent to the REA."
1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.682,1095.49,"If your clients had made false representations to the REA and the jury found them, on substantial evidence, guilty, you wouldn't be raising this point, would you?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1095.49,1111.182,"If it was a false representation in order to induce the REA to enter into the agreement, such as where a non-Communist affidavit was filed to induce the NLRB Act, then, Your Honor, I agree."
1986.86-177,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.123,1128.127,"Yes, but that's not the thrust of their theory of the case, as I read the indictment."
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1154.778,1162.448,"--They did make that allegation, offered proof, Your Honor, of that fact after the fact with respect to these loans."
1986.86-177,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.448,1165.067,"By after the fact, you mean after the loans had been made?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1165.067,1168.002,"Well, not only after the loans, but after the contracts had been awarded."
1986.86-177,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1168.002,1170.788,"Right, but not after they had been fully performed?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1170.788,1171.788,Correct.
1986.86-177,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.788,1186.999,"The question, I suppose, is whether a conspiracy to make a false representation... conspiracy to cause a false representation to be made to a federal agency that might affect the way in which it administers a contractual program, states a violation?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1186.999,1187.765,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.057,1208.163,"What you are saying is, if I understand you, there is no crime unless the representation harmed the federal government in some way?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1208.163,1213.381,Either harmed the federal government or interfered with a federal governmental function.
1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1231.528,1237.598,"In other words, if your clients went to the REA and made a bunch of false statements and the guy at the REA says,"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1247.204,1260.362,"If the REA, as in this instance, is simply a guarantor on a loan with a private corporation and is not engaged in a federal governmental function, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.362,1263.298,But I mean... I don't think the point really is that.
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1284.478,1293.317,"I think they would in that instance, Your Honor, if there is a conspiracy to induce the federal agency to take some action that--"
1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.317,1295.367,But even though no action is taken.
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1295.367,1302.439,"--If the purpose of the conspiracy is to induce some action, then, Your Honor, there could be a crime."
1986.86-177,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1302.439,1315.997,"Mr. DeVault, in this circumstance does the REA have rules and regulations and standards to meet for contracts of this type?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1315.997,1321.218,"It does, Justice O'Connor, and those that were put in... and in fact several of them appear in the joint appendix."
1986.86-177,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1321.218,1340.298,"I thought so, and was it not the fact, then, that it was alleged that the conspiracy here was one to avoid those requirements that REA would have imposed on contracting?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1340.298,1343.083,"I think not, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1376.554,1389.629,"Well, is it your assertion that none of the requirements imposed by the REA were violated by what was done here?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1389.629,1409.942,"Your Honor, I think of no requirement that the REA imposed with respect to the awarding of the contract which was shown to be violated with respect to the entering into of these contracts."
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.07,1443.097,"You would concede, I take it, that if the whole purpose of the conspiracy had been to get those false misrepresentations made to REA, that would be a different case?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1443.097,1448.465,"And that those were material to the program as inducements to act, I would, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.465,1451.434,Material to the program as inducements to act?
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1461.975,1462.592,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1462.592,1471.597,"Then at least for the purpose of securing the future performance for which the loan was given, that is something the government has an interest in, doesn't it?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1471.597,1473.032,"It does have an interest, Your honor."
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.032,1488.976,"And you would take the position that so long as it's done after the money's been advanced, even if the very purpose of the conspiracy were prominently in mind, to get a false misrepresentation to be made to REA, that would not be enough?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1508.705,1510.089,Correct.
1986.86-177,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.089,1515.291,"You'd say even if they were after that, even if that was the whole object of their conspiracy, we couldn't--"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1515.291,1535.721,"We take that position, Your Honor, and it's simply because this REA here, although REA is a federal agency, it was not performing... in this case it was not performing a federal function with respect to simply guaranteeing a loan made to Seminole."
1986.86-177,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.407,1624.113,"--Is this a case of jury... alleged juror incompetence, or a case of alleged juror misconduct, and does it make a difference?"
1986.86-177,0,29870,john_a_devault_iii,,1624.113,1642.407,"I think it makes a difference, Your Honor, and we have specifically cast it as a case of juror incompetence because we believe the test should be as to whether a juror would be physically or mentally competent to qualify as a juror initially, under 1865."
1986.86-177,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.006,1665.99,"Thank you, Mr. DeVault."
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1673.861,1679.765,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.227,1784.619,"Now, how do you distinguish this case from any case in which a federally subsidized entity is defrauded?"
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1784.619,1804.246,"We don't suggest that just because Seminole is a recipient of federal financial assistance its because they are actually performing a function on behalf of REA, and we distinguish it because if you look at the terms of the loan contract, the REA bulletin, it is quite apparent that Seminole is being supervised closely with respect to almost all of its actions."
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.246,1806.365,A lot of recipients do.
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1820.625,1839.686,"And for that reason, when the degree of federal oversight is such that they are in effect acting on behalf, as I believe counsel for petitioners conceded a moment ago, and that is that Seminole, on behalf of the REA, is in effect constructing an electric plant to provide services to rural residents of America."
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.477,1851.794,They are a federal agent?
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1851.794,1853.013,We do not say they are federal agents.
1986.86-177,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.176,1886.4,"But when the VA loans money to a builder or advances money to a builder to build a house for someone who is entitled to a VA loan, you don't generally say that the builder is doing it on behalf of the VA."
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1886.4,1899.994,"It would depend on... we aren't saying that every time that the VA guarantees a loan that that's enough, but in those instances when they are actually being supervised in that capacity."
1986.86-177,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.994,1907.164,"Well, maybe the contractor that's building the house has to meet certain VA specifications for materials and so forth."
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1907.164,1925.942,"And if in that case the VA required that oversight, and to see whether or not those requirements were being met, and a third party defrauded the builder in a manner which caused a violation of those requirements, we basically have the same case and we believe it would be a defraud on the United States."
1986.86-177,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.833,1942.671,"Do you allege Seminole or the REA, or both?"
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1942.671,1949.808,"We allege that the REA was defrauded in two different avenues, one directly and one indirectly."
1986.86-177,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.808,1951.977,"So, it's both?"
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1951.977,1952.961,Yes.
1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1956.43,1957.38,I'm not sure I followed that.
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1961.984,1962.6,--That's right.
1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.6,1964.686,And the indirect fraud is what?
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1964.686,1976.308,"The indirect fraud is that by defrauding Seminole Electric, they increased the chance that there would be a pecuniary loss to the federal government and that federal statute objectives were--"
1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.308,1978.91,"You don't allege that in the indictment, do you?"
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1978.91,1982.398,"--Well, we believe that's encompassed within the indictment."
1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.837,1995.621,"It was not a part of your proof, as I understand your theory of the case?"
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,1998.657,1999.273,"No, we did not."
1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2001.873,2003.808,It could have been the lowest responsible bidder.
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2011.747,2012.647,--That is right.
1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.647,2017.349,"So, an awful lot of irrelevant evidence went before the jury, I suppose."
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2020.401,2026.038,"It may have not been irrelevant evidence, maybe unnecessary, but that's not a problem."
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.014,2098.253,The limitation asserted here by the defendants is the United States.
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2103.888,2104.573,"Right, and we believe--"
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.573,2106.04,"So, the ""in any manner"" doesn't do you any good."
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2106.04,2106.423,--No.
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.423,2110.477,What we are arguing about here is whether this is a defrauding of the United States or not.
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2110.477,2132.724,"Yes, but we believe that ""in any manner"" is critical here because as this Court has recognized, nonfederal intermediaries often perform official functions of government on behalf of the United States, and we think that when that happens, and when those official functions are obstructed when being performed by someone on behalf of the United States, that is a defraud of the United States in any manner."
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.724,2133.124,What is

United States, where the Court recognized that when a private entity is administering a federally supervised and federally supported project on behalf of the United States, performing official functions under close supervision, that in those instances they are performing official functions and acting on behalf of the United States."

1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.42,2289.259,"So that theoretically, perhaps you could have reached the same conduct by relying on the other clause of section 371?"
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2289.259,2289.726,--That is right.

1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2299.317,2300.067,--That is right.
1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.067,2301.75,If you are right about that.
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2301.75,2316.26,"I think a similar instance was in the Glasser v. United States case, where the manner... the method of the fraud in that case was bribery and the U.S. charged conspiracy to defraud the United States even though the fraud was committed through bribery."

1986.86-177,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2601.976,2605.863,Would there be a difference in how we would view it?
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2605.863,2608.649,We don't believe there would be a difference.
1986.86-177,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2615.653,2629.979,Could juror misconduct or temporary incompetence rise to such a level that it becomes a constitutional question of due process and a fair trial?

1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.736,2667.938,"Mr. Lazarus, of course it may be the only source of evidence."

1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2709.015,2712.05,Our answer would be precisely that--
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.05,2724.524,"--I guess what you're relying on is the fact that anything that goes on in the jury room is observed by the other jurors, and if somebody pulls a gun presumably one of the jurors could tell the Court about it and the Court can conduct an inquiry right then and there."
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2724.524,2725.057,--That's right.
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2726.007,2732.796,"Whereas outside influences can't be observed by the other jurors necessarily, so it wouldn't necessarily come to light?"
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2732.796,2743.902,"--The more egregious the hypothetical, the more unlikely that it would ever escape observation and only arise six months or so after the verdict."
1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.902,2757.31,"But if that is the adequate answer, you are totally satisfied, assuming the most glaring version of the facts of what happened here which were not called to the attention of the judge, perhaps some were afraid to do it, and so maybe they don't always immediately run to the judge."
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2758.493,2759.012,That's right.

1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,2851.771,2859.943,"Well, in such an instance that would undoubtedly arise before the verdict was handed down, and there would be absolutely no bar at all to the judge calling and--"

1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3095.072,3095.922,I don't understand that.
1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3109.13,3116.117,They were defrauded in this case because it affected the material that they received and they did not--
1986.86-177,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3116.117,3117.986,"Yes, but maybe the jury didn't believe all that."

1986.86-177,1,39819,richard_j_lazarus,,3162.265,3162.748,--That's right.
1986.86-177,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.748,3164.848,Was that necessary under the indictment?
