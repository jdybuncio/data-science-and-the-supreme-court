1985.84-1244,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,77.75,"Mr. Evans, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,77.75,95.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1981 the Indiana legislature passed a Reapportionment Act following the 1980 census and this Act was modified and amended in certain minor respects in 1982."
1985.84-1244,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.093,335.151,"Mr. Evans, did the court below consider the effect of this plan under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as amended?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,335.151,350.593,"Justice O'Connor, in this case the lower court did, and this makes this case so different from other cases because in this case the lower court said, there has been no violation by this Reapportionment Act in Indiana of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act."
1985.84-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,534.446,544.284,"Well, I thought one of your major points was that we shouldn't review this case at all, or the merits; we should say it is not justiciable."
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,544.284,545.018,"That is true, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.018,554.842,"It does not sound to me like if you are citing the multi-member district case, and I suppose you are going to talk about Gaffney--"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,554.842,556.209,"We had thought of Gaffney, yes."
1985.84-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.209,561.246,"--Well, are you still pressing us to say that this issue is not justiciable?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,561.246,563.063,"I am, Your Honor, but we are here."
1985.84-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.063,564.782,It doesn't sound much like--
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,564.782,578.958,"We are here today, so the Court must be interested in the question, But I do believe that the issue is not justiciable, and in the briefs we went into that at great length and the Court, I assume, is familiar with the legal arguments."
1985.84-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.575,586.378,"--So, you are making an argument, assuming it is justiciable, you do not think there was an unconstitutional gerrymander here?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,586.378,587.813,"Yes, Your Honor, that is my position."
1985.84-1244,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,603.823,614.298,"But if you say it's not justiciable, that means that even the most extreme example of gerrymandering would not be subject to any judicial review?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,614.298,619.619,"Your Honor, I believe particularly where we're dealing with two major parties, I believe that is true."
1985.84-1244,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,655.042,663.98,"Well, no, Mr. Evans, the line you are drawing is one between partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering, are you?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,663.98,669.115,"--I believe the Court made that distinction in Whitcomb v. Chavis, Your Honor, and I was in my argument making that distinction."
1985.84-1244,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,672.217,675.086,"Well, on the question of justiciability."
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,675.086,675.788,"--Oh, yes."
1985.84-1244,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,675.788,678.823,"Partisan gerrymandering, you say, is non-justiciable?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,678.823,679.607,But racial is.
1985.84-1244,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,679.607,681.407,But racial gerrymandering is justiciable?
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,681.407,682.609,"And has been, yes, sir."
1985.84-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.609,684.192,What about Gaffney?
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,689.946,690.631,That is right.
1985.84-1244,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.631,692.665,"And, we reviewed it."
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,692.665,701.587,"Yes, and in the Gaffney case the Court did review and approved the reapportionment plans in the Gaffney case."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,748.051,750.169,"Mr. Evans, may I ask you this question."
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,763.727,765.679,That is our position.
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,765.679,767.215,Putting the racial issue aside.
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,767.215,784.808,"Racial issue aside, Your Honor, I believe that when the Court in Wells v. Sims and other cases in the early '60s established a one-vote, one-person rule based upon residence of, everybody's vote is the same, has equal weight, I think that was a rule that was well accepted in the nation."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,784.808,788.128,"If that rule is met, is that the end of this case?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,788.128,788.928,"Yes, that is the end of this case."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,788.928,796.9,Your position then is that the equal protection clause has no application to the case at all?
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,796.9,799.134,"That is my position, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,817.362,818.481,Excuse me.
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,829.187,835.609,"I believe, Your Honor, that that is correct, where you have, as I say, two major political parties as we have in this case."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,844.013,857.606,"So, by gerrymandering, one party could put the other party entirely out of business, entirely, if you were using the computer, without discriminating against the voters in the other party?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,857.606,863.527,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that that question has been raised, perhaps by Justice Powell in some of your arguments."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,908.106,919.596,Did the Republican majority consider any purpose in adopting this plan other than maximize the Republican vote and minimize the Democratic vote?
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,921.381,922.631,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,926.766,935.022,"Did I read the record that the Speaker of the House said the only purpose was political, just to maximize the Republican vote?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,935.022,939.241,"The Speaker of the House was quoted as saving words to that effect, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,991.191,1000.213,What other purposes were considered by the Legislature that are effected in the record or by findings of the District Court?
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,1000.213,1003.082,"One-man, one-vote was met."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1004.432,1005.115,Yes.
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,1005.115,1012.27,"Then the record is clear that the rights of black citizens, black vote, was absolutely--"
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1012.27,1014.687,"Apart from that, what other things?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,1014.687,1020.96,--The Legislature then followed the tests under the state law which were emphasized by this Court in Karcher.
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1044.124,1051.23,"They did not have very much time, did they, in view of the schedule followed by the Republican majority?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,1051.23,1053.847,"Well, Your Honor, they had about as much time as the Republicans did."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1080.999,1088.336,"But in the Legislature the plan was adopted, as I recall, on either the last or the next to the last day of the session."
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,1088.336,1089.371,"Your Honor, you are right."
1985.84-1244,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1104.214,1106.899,"No Democrats on the conference committee, were there?"
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,1106.899,1112.736,"--No Democrats were on the conference committee, Your Honor, but I wonder if this Court wants to draw great weight on that."
1985.84-1244,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1266.719,1280.461,We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1985.84-1244,0,44606,william_m_evans,,1297.238,1301.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal."
1985.84-1244,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1301.909,1310.415,Mr. Boehm.
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1310.415,1324.156,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I should like to begin by correcting what we believe to be a few factual misapprehensions that the Court may have gained in the course of the presentation this morning."
1985.84-1244,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1394.569,1397.021,How does that come to be?
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1399.64,1402.275,"Mr. Evans' statistics are done manually, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1515.865,1519.833,"And they conform perfectly to one-man, one-vote or one-person, one-vote?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1519.833,1521.369,"Well, within two percent, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1521.369,1524.721,Which is satisfactory for state districts?
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1524.721,1527.756,We submit it is satisfactory if justified.
1985.84-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.159,1591.396,"But you would be no happier, however, if it were zero percent deviation and still came out with this sort of gerrymander?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1591.396,1592.848,--That is correct.
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.848,1614.012,"Under your theory, it seems to me that almost any time a reapportionment or redistricting by a state legislature occurred and the result was not close to perfect proportional representation, that there would be a violation?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1614.012,1616.631,"No, sir, we want to be absolutely--"
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.631,1625.236,"Now, everybody knows who is districting, knows exactly what the political consequences are going to be of any set of districts that are drawn."
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1625.236,1626.002,--That's correct.
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.002,1639.044,"And so, they know that if this particular set of districts downgrades the Democrats or downgrades the Republicans, that that is going to be the result, and they thoroughly intend it?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1639.044,1639.912,That is correct Your.
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.262,1644.964,"Well, how much of a deviation would you allow?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1644.964,1649.702,"There are several ways you can have a perfectly constitutional, plan, Justice White."
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.702,1657.458,"That ends up with the Democrats not getting what, arguably, what they desire, what they are entitled to vote-wise."
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1657.458,1664.694,We do not claim that we are entitled to any specific number of seats in the General Assembly.
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.823,1692.445,"Well, what justification could there be to give the Democrats fewer seats than they are entitled to in terms of their voting population?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1692.445,1697.666,"Several things could do it, and they have been iterated in the opinions of this Court."
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1700.118,1704.402,"Well, were they articulated by the Court of Appeals or not?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1704.402,1706.438,"--They were, by the District Court, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.458,1754.085,"What if we were to uphold your claim in this case and say there has to be some kind of neutral objective, and so it goes back to the Indiana legislature, and this time they say, the Republican majority says, we can still get the Democrats and that is what we intend to do, but we will kind of preserve county lines in most of them."
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1769.012,1792.341,"Preserving county lines is one restriction, Your honor, just like population equality is a restriction, just like the requirement that if they're going to have different sized districts, in other words some multi, some single different sized multis, there has to be a reason for it, a proper governmental reason which there was in Whitcomb against Chavis, but they decided Marion County ought to get 15 seats."
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1921.274,1950.341,"Well, suppose the prior districting in Indiana had been done by a Democratic legislature and they had gerrymandered it in their favor, and now comes along a Republican legislature and they decide to do exactly what was done in Gaffney, try to get proportional representation, so their purpose has to be... is to cut down the Democrats."
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1952.893,1954.328,"Yes, it would be a legitimate reason."
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.982,1973.706,"Would you say, then, that the first step in attacking a plan like this is, you have got to prove intent, or do you prove intent from just the consequences, or both:"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1973.706,1980.277,I think in this case we have got an easy case because on the question of... there are two questions presented by this case.
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1980.894,1983.828,"--It may be, but in theory do you think you have to prove intent first?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,1983.828,1986.847,--I think you can talk about it as intent if you wish.
1985.84-1244,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2007.777,2020.354,"Mr. Boehm, if this were a non-justiciable... that is, if partisan gerrymandering is non-justiciable, I guess we do not have to address some of these questions, do we?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,2020.354,2021.771,"That is the threshold question, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2025.222,2026.59,Are you going to address justiciability?
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,2026.59,2027.74,"I certainly am, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.74,2037.732,"Before you come to that, is there any evidence in this record about the impact of the mobility of population in periods of one year or two years?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,2037.732,2049.623,"None, other than, we have the census of 1980 which is obviously different from the '70 census that was the predicate of the previous plan."
1985.84-1244,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2049.623,2062.348,"Well, there are cases which have shown conclusively that between the time the plan is enacted and the time it is carried cut in an election, the mobility of people has altered the validity of the plan."
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,2065.799,2085.129,"There is nothing in this record, Your Honor, and we would agree that it may be a validation of a deviation from a legitimate plan if there were a showing that for perfectly good reasons we have identified that this area is likely to be bigger in 1982 than it was in 1980 so we're going to tip it a little bit, and besides it is a city."
1985.84-1244,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.175,2209.525,Clerks of Court are always anonymous.
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,2233.29,2235.825,"No, sir, I would not, on the face of it, draw any conclusion from that."
1985.84-1244,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2254.12,2261.393,"In a Congressional district, do you suggest that a House member doesn't have as much profile as a Senator?"
1985.84-1244,1,42466,theodore_r_boehm,,2261.393,2263.076,"I think it is correct, that he does not have as much."
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3130.932,3132.8,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3199.742,3201.194,What about the multi-member districts?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3202.494,3214.586,"--I defend them the same way that they were defended successfully in Whitcomb v. Chavis, Your Honor, because they don't have anything to do with the fact that you've got people that lose in some multi-member districts or single-member districts."
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.423,3221.275,Not these same ones?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3221.275,3222.008,Pardon?
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.008,3223.092,Not these same ones?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3223.092,3227.096,"No, but the only reason those were changed was because of the one-man, one-vote restrictions."
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.903,3246.223,"Is your only answer to the multi-member districts, is it, well, we've always had multi-member districts somehow, someplace in Indiana?"
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3247.023,3248.092,--I would say that there are a lot of--
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3248.092,3251.127,--Let's get right around the specific reason.
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3257.281,3262.417,"--Well, I will say on the record, there is no particular justification for a particular district, Justice White."
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.319,3269.672,"Well, it really wasn't... it's not the same multi-member district, was it?"
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3269.672,3277.694,"--No, it wasn't the same but it was the same in the sense that they'd been there and they had 15 members at the time."
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.694,3281.813,Are you saying you can't find in the record any justification for any specific multi-member district?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3281.813,3287.234,"I'd say there is some testimony of governmental purpose, but I think, being frank, what happened--"
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.234,3289.086,What is it for a multi-member district?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3289.086,3302.744,"--Well, there's some evidence in the record that it's easier in urban areas to have it because of media, of one media source to have the voters vote for several different representatives in the same district in the House."
1985.84-1244,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3331.329,3343.137,"Well, Mr. Evans, is it correct, if you look at Marion County, the history was as multi-member district for the entire county, and then with the population change 14 representatives would have satisfied that county."
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3348.791,3349.941,"Well, it depends on where you start."
1985.84-1244,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3377.492,3384.548,"If you get over the hurdle of justiciability, if your opponent does, would you agree that there must be a rational basis for the plan?"
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3384.548,3389.968,"--I would say so, Your Honor, and I think, following the guidelines of this Court as were done would justify it, yes."
1985.84-1244,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.968,3399.49,"If you say there must be a rational basis, would you say that the desire to maximize the political strength of the majority party is a rational basis within that standard?"
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3399.49,3403.692,"No, I wouldn't think that that would be, in and of itself, a rational basis."
1985.84-1244,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.294,3405.261,You would say there would have to be some other basis?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3405.261,3407.413,--That isn't before the Court in this case.
1985.84-1244,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3418.685,3434.23,"Well, would the case be different if the majority of the legislature adopted a statute saying, we will not entertain any Democratic plan and we will refer the districting job to the Republican State Committee which apparently hired the computer firm here, would there be a different case?"
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3434.23,3439.717,"Yes, there would be, Your Honor, because this wasn't just a plan worked out just by the Republicans."
1985.84-1244,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3449.573,3454.81,"But why would the suggestion I made to you, what would be wrong with that suggestion, if your view of the law is correct?"
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3454.81,3460.298,--Because the plan should be made by the representatives... the citizens through their representatives.
1985.84-1244,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3477.823,3486.579,"I don't understand why it would be wrong for the Republican Party to prepare the plan and the legislators say, well, we've taken a lock at it and it looks okay to us, and adopt it."
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3487.948,3491.733,"Well, I don't think it would be right to have it done outside of the normal electoral process."
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3491.733,3500.673,"Well, didn't the District Court find that the only reason for this plan was to minimize the Democratic representation?"
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3500.673,3501.406,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3503.025,3506.66,What did they... on what ground did they invalidate this?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3506.66,3507.41,--The plan?
1985.84-1244,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3559.461,3566.381,Is community of interest a factor that properly may be considered in determining whether there is a rational basis for the plan?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3566.381,3570.602,"It is a consideration, Your Honor, but I think it's a minor consideration."
1985.84-1244,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3586.212,3589.247,The district court thought community of interest was fairly important?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3589.247,3591.349,"--Well... I don't know, Your Honor."
1985.84-1244,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3597.502,3597.919,Yes.
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3597.919,3599.704,"It mentioned it, though."
1985.84-1244,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3599.704,3601.038,I think one could agree with that.
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3606.025,3609.06,"It said that, but what are you comparing that with, Your Honor?"
1985.84-1244,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3619.332,3620.516,You have no other plan to compare it with?
1985.84-1244,2,44606,william_m_evans,,3620.516,3621.618,--That's my point.
1985.84-1244,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3645.599,3647.599,"Thank you, gentlemen."
