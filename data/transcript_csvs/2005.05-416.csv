2005.05-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.782,"We'll hear argument next in 05-416, Woodford versus Ngo."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,7.813,10.94,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,122.714,129.479,What do you say to the argument that that really is an inapposite because the 1983 proceeding is de novo?
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,129.479,134.653,I would suggest... I... we concede there's that distinction.
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,160.144,172.661,"But that's the... a function of... you want the first line decisionmaker... you need that decision, because, at the second rung, in... at the court level, deference is owed to it."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,192.119,197.901,"Well, Your Honor, in the first instance--"
2005.05-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,197.901,200.261,"I'm sorry, Ms. Perkell, could I ask you to speak up just a bit?"
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,200.261,200.793,"--Oh, sure."
2005.05-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,201.011,201.261,Thanks.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,201.261,202.308,--I apologize.
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,228.892,229.923,Invoke what?
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,229.923,238.565,"--The word ""commence"" instead of ""exhaust"", which this Court has expressly, again, distinguished from an exhaustion requirement."
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,258.303,265.821,"Are you... are you saying, then, that those two go together, they're inextricably tied together?"
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,271.791,290.124,"I'm suggesting in that... in the... excuse me... in the administrative law context, which is the context in which Congress was legislating under this statute, that that is, indeed, the established conception of that term."
2005.05-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,290.124,294.983,They're saying that it's special here.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,309.862,312.347,"I'm sorry, I'm not sure what Your Honor--"
2005.05-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,312.347,317.568,"--I'm think... oh, well, I guess it isn't... unlike IIRIRA, it is apparently unknown."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,317.568,318.521,--Oh.
2005.05-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,318.521,322.553,"There was a predecessor act, and the predecessor act used this same language, just about."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,378.644,408.837,"Well, I would suggest that, in part, the language of the CRIPA, which is... I believe, is... that's how I pronounce it; I believe that's what Your Honor is referring to... in part, precluded the possibility of a default... procedural default bar largely because it required a continuance of a case for 90... or I believe it started out as 180 days, and then became 90 days."
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.103,491.309,But that was a comment made when the decision itself held that there was no exhaustion.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,501.874,503.265,That is so.
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.015,504.937,I mean McCarthy.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,504.937,507.704,--This Court made that observation.
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,569.014,579.923,"Well, there was... in McCarthy, itself, the wording was something that... of the kind proposed."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,596.473,609.976,"Your Honor, I would respectfully dispute that, in that our reading of the opinion, as well as the Government's brief in that case, seemed to propose no unusual rule of exhaustion."
2005.05-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,629.465,651.594,"Before you get to the purposes, you quote in your brief... the only legislative history I could find here... you said that Congressman LoBiondo referred to McCarthy, which you find relevant, because McCarthy indicated that the word ""exhaustion"" would carry along with it a procedural default rule."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,653.844,656.985,--What did Representative LoBiondo--
2005.05-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,656.985,657.141,Uh huh.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,657.141,657.688,--say?
2005.05-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,657.688,658.016,Uh huh.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,658.016,670.331,"The significance of excerpting that provision was to, in part, demonstrate that Congress was, indeed, aware, consistent--"
2005.05-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.331,670.55,All right.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,673.285,673.956,--He--
2005.05-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,673.956,675.644,--except to refer to the name of the case--
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,675.644,676.941,--Well--
2005.05-416,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,676.941,678.426,"--in which case, what we have on the... all right."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,679.176,683.599,"--Your Honor, I think there are two relevant things about that statement."
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,732.235,733.11,In thinking--
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,733.11,733.376,It's--
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,733.376,742.081,"--of what Congress might have meant, one part of the picture is, we're not dealing with statutes of limitations enacted by legislatures."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,761.18,763.789,--That is correct.
2005.05-416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.88,836.133,"So, you would treat a State with a 2-day statute of limitations just like your State, with a 15-day statute."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,836.133,850.698,"I think the... always, the relevant inquiry, especially in light of the statute... or precisely because of the statutory language, the inquiry is whether or not remedies are, indeed, available and capable of use by the inmates."
2005.05-416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.745,856.433,It was--
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,856.433,856.823,--filing period.
2005.05-416,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.823,860.761,"--available for 2 days, so that's had a... so, I suppose it would be okay for 6 hours, too."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,860.761,863.746,It could conceivably be.
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,869.982,870.654,Is that--
2005.05-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,870.654,870.873,I suppose--
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,870.873,871.404,--plausible?
2005.05-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,871.404,878.921,--I suppose there can always be a specific objection to the reasonable availability of a particular remedy.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,890.877,893.018,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
2005.05-416,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,897.753,902.473,Would you agree that there's a requirement that the exhaustion period be reasonable?
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,902.473,917.272,--I'm... I... the requirement that I think is relevant under the statute is whether or not the procedure is available.
2005.05-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,917.272,923.977,"Conceivably, if it's too short, it's not reasonably available."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,926.071,926.915,"That is... yes, Your Honor, that is--"
2005.05-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,926.915,927.103,--Okay.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,927.103,928.103,--that is a conceivable--
2005.05-416,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.103,928.525,That's conceivable.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,928.525,929.182,--conceivable--
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,929.182,929.432,Well--
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,929.432,929.948,--scenario.
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,929.948,930.245,--what do you--
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,930.245,930.417,I--
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,930.417,939.871,"--what do you make of the fact that there was prior law that required... I forget its exact words, but something like ""reasonable procedure"", and that language was repealed?"
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,939.871,951.64,"--I presume, from that, that Congress had shifted its focus in the new statute to the purposes that we have articulated in the brief, one of them being--"
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,951.64,963.642,"Well, if that's... if that's the case, then, on your own reasoning, you can't assume that there's... that availability requires any reasonable availability."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,970.097,972.346,"--I would agree with that, Your Honor."
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,973.736,973.847,Do you find--
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,973.847,974.128,--position.
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,974.128,983.302,"--it plausible that Congress, in effect, would have intended these... the statute of limitations on 1983 to be truncated in that way?"
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,983.302,986.615,"Yes, Your Honor, I do believe that."
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1003.025,1016.746,"Yes, but the abuse was not coming from people who filed... or the... let's say the line that identifies the abuse was not a line between those who file a grievance within 2 days and those who do not."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1032.094,1038.017,"--Well, Your Honor, I would first dispute that a 2-hour time limitation would necessarily keep out a lot of cases."
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1040.143,1041.893,Wouldn't you like to have a 2-hour time limit?
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1042.159,1042.955,"--Your Honor, it--"
2005.05-416,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1042.955,1047.347,"You'd have a lot... you know, a lot more time at the park."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1047.41,1059.834,"--Your Honor, it wouldn't necessarily be my preference, but I certainly wouldn't suggest that it was a remedy unavailable or incapable of use by anyone, if you take into consideration other aspects of the prison grievance procedure."
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1059.834,1060.099,May I--
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1060.099,1060.271,So--
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1060.271,1061.943,--May I ask you just one thing--
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1061.943,1062.115,--Yes.
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1062.115,1065.568,--about how this operates and who reviews what?
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1091.558,1099.716,"I think what... in this... as occurred in this case, the inmate has made this contention that there was a continuing violation."
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1106.873,1107.045,"Well, what--"
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1107.045,1107.796,--as presented.
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1107.796,1110.734,--role would govern whether a continuing violation occurred?
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1111.375,1115.438,I would suggest that the law of the prison grievance proceeding.
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1116.454,1119.954,--And what is the law of the prison grievance proceeding on that point?
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1119.954,1129.769,"--Well, in California the requirement is that an inmate must file a grievance within 15 working days or 3 weeks of the event or decision at issue."
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1131.081,1134.77,"Well, he... that... his point is that the event at issue happens every day."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1134.77,1148.196,"--Well, I would submit that the facts of this case actually show that the events at issue are the two decisions that were made which resulted in consequences with which the inmate was dissatisfied."
2005.05-416,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1149.978,1160.385,"But your... but your point... your... whatever the internal grievance procedure is, there's no judge that would decide that, which you said, this is all for the internal procedure."
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1160.385,1161.432,--That is correct.
2005.05-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1201.411,1201.879,Ms.--
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1201.879,1202.286,If--
2005.05-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1202.286,1203.786,"--Perkell, perhaps you'd like to save your remaining--"
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1203.786,1203.989,--Yes.
2005.05-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1203.989,1204.505,--time for rebuttal.
2005.05-416,0,32405,jennifer_g_perkell,,1204.505,1205.364,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.05-416,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1205.364,1205.817,Thank you.
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1208.146,1220.572,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1338.939,1352.272,"Is his best case, your brother's best case, in your view... and you probably... may not think of it as a very persuasive case... Fay and Noia, is that the closest Respondents can come?"
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1352.272,1355.975,"Well, probably, Justice Kennedy."
2005.05-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1389.858,1390.374,You--
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1390.374,1390.921,Respondent places--
2005.05-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1390.921,1391.078,--Could--
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1391.078,1391.546,--heavy--
2005.05-416,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1391.546,1400.376,"--Would Respondent tell us, well, that at least in some administrative law schemes, generally there is a requirement that the exhaustion period must be reasonable?"
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1400.376,1424.835,"--Well, the... this Court has made clear, in various cases, including in the very context of the exhaustion provision at issue here, in the Booth versus Churner decision, that there are no exceptions to the exhaustion... to an administrative exhaustion requirement when Congress provides otherwise; that is, in the context of statutory, as opposed to a judge made, exhaustion requirement."
2005.05-416,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1479.737,1487.035,"Well, wouldn't it go... wouldn't that apply... that principle apply to reasonable... unreasonable remedies?"
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1494.005,1499.147,"No, I don't think... I don't think reasonableness is the right way to think about it, Justice Breyer."
2005.05-416,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1510.618,1511.337,It's not just a filing deadline.
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1556.222,1563.161,"Our only point, Justice Breyer, is that it wouldn't be appropriate for a court to look at a particular filing deadline in a prison."
2005.05-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.999,1615.015,"Would that apply to a prisoner who claimed he'd been raped by a guard or something, but was afraid to bring the proceeding, for 2 or 3 weeks, until the guard was transferred to another facility?"
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1620.236,1625.659,"--Justice Stevens, I think there would be cases... and that might be one of them... that would present difficult questions."
2005.05-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.613,1631.332,"--Well, those are--"
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1631.332,1631.488,--from the guard--
2005.05-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.488,1632.16,--his allegations.
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1639.005,1644.349,"--If a prisoner filed a 1983 or Bivens action, and the--"
2005.05-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1644.349,1653.07,"No, he... first he files a prisoner complaint, 17 days late, but makes the allegations I describe, and he's just denied because he's too late."
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1655.415,1656.774,"--Well, I would think--"

2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1659.758,1665.87,--That could be an issue that would have to be litigated in connection with a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust.
2005.05-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.375,1688.672,So even--
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1688.672,1688.875,--and a much harder--
2005.05-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.875,1689.531,--if it was seven--
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1689.531,1689.718,--case.
2005.05-416,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.718,1694.33,"--even after the 17th day, the Federal Court could hear a... have a factual hearing."

2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1706.472,1707.144,--That's right.
2005.05-416,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1797.055,1801.18,"Why did they use the word ""until"", instead of the word ""unless""?"
2005.05-416,1,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,1801.18,1809.4,There are lots of statutory exhaustion requirements that are framed in lots of different types of language.

2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.255,1870.474,"I would... I would not describe ""exhaustion"" that way."
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,1892.072,1906.699,"Well, Your Honor, I think... I think that in the habeas cases the Court has consistently read ""exhaustion"" as referring simply to ""no remedies presently available""."
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.699,1918.623,"Yes, well, we're talking about administrative law, which is a field I used to know something about, and I've never thought ""exhaustion"" included ""failure to exhaust"", which--"
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,1918.623,1918.67,Well--
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.67,1919.139,--which is--
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,1919.139,1919.248,--first--
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.248,1922.655,--what happens when you simply don't file within the prescribed period.
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,1922.655,1929.203,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, I don't think we're... that administrative law is the appropriate analogy here."
2005.05-416,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1959.71,1961.163,"Well, I'm not sure."
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,1989.043,1997.919,"--Well, actually, Your Honor, I don't think there's any indication that Congress was focused on input from the prison grievance system."
2005.05-416,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2010.984,2019.83,"--Well, not so much maybe input, but so that they can... they can resolve the program... the problem within the institution, and not have to come to the courts."
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2019.83,2021.783,"--Well, two things."
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.44,2169.205,But how does it do that?
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2195.959,2196.85,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.85,2197.788,"--by saying,"
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2206.149,2206.399,"Well, we're not--"
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.399,2207.072,--this--
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2207.072,2207.9,"--we're not saying that, Your Honor."
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.9,2208.712,"--Oh, no,"
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2210.713,2210.869,Yes.
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.869,2218.776,"""# you just sit around until it's too late, file a grievance that you know will not be accepted, because it's too late, and then you can come into Federal Court. """

2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2257.175,2260.082,Maybe because they thought they had to file on time.
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2260.082,2267.802,--But there is no... there is no indication anywhere of there being widespread defaults.
2005.05-416,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2362.871,2363.652,Yes it is.

2005.05-416,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2408.287,2414.319,"No, the point is that if he complies with the time limit, it's going to hurt his claim; therefore, he doesn't want to comply with the time limit."
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2414.319,2422.211,"--I understand, Your Honor, but everything here is within the framework of the Section 1983 statute of limitations."
2005.05-416,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2453.045,2457.889,"Well, you were suggesting that the prisoner had no incentive not to comply and go through his State grievance procedure."
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.564,2478.16,"And the more frivolous the case, the more likely it is that it won't be remembered by a guard."
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2486.145,2506.65,"Well, Your Honor, again, I think that, at a minimum... even if you grant that there may... the prisoner may see some advantage in that, there is, at a minimum, a substantially smaller incentive than you would... than you would have in, for example, a habeas case."
2005.05-416,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.796,2611.062,"Yes, all right, but the thing I don't understand in this, which is hard... Is there any answer to this point from the other side?"
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2648.54,2654.838,"--And what I'm saying now, Your Honor, is that he can't just wait and not file."
2005.05-416,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2654.838,2655.338,Why not?
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2655.338,2658.62,Because he will not have exhausted until he files and has--
2005.05-416,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2658.62,2664.153,"No, no, but, I mean, that's a... that sounds to me like a verbal gimmick, to tell you the truth."
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2672.061,2675.295,"--Well, two things about that."
2005.05-416,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.295,2676.171,Isn't that true?
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2697.441,2698.816,Part of--

2005.05-416,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2699.144,2699.3,Okay.
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2704.989,2715.568,"--Well, Your Honor, I think... again, first of all, it's a... it's important to understand that we are saying he will have to file, in all circumstances."
2005.05-416,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2716.789,2716.976,All right.
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2716.976,2717.523,--that the State--
2005.05-416,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2717.523,2718.664,"Now, I want to get rid of that argument."
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2719.43,2719.805,--I understand.
2005.05-416,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2719.805,2720.477,--terminology--
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2720.477,2721.039,Putting that--

2005.05-416,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2727.322,2728.353,--which is what I just said.
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,2729.369,2736.229,"First of all, there is always the possibility, depending on the nature of the grievance, that the prison may address it."
2005.05-416,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.998,2838.811,It seems to me you're understating the amount of time that he's saving by failing to exhaust.

2005.05-416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3347.077,3348.514,--I understand one thing about your position.
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,3359.798,3360.486,--Yes.
2005.05-416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.626,3369.082,So that you do say that you at least will give the State the opportunity to decide whether it wants to try and remedy it in an informal or hasty manner.
2005.05-416,2,35816,meir_feder,,3369.082,3369.582,Yes.
2005.05-416,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3369.582,3369.988,Yes.
