2007.07-77,0,kevin_c_newsom,,213.286,229.713,"But under the argument that I was talking about specifically under Young versus Fordice, I think it does make a difference that the Alabama Supreme Court stepped in at the earliest possible opportunity to invalidate this statute, again as part of litigation that preceded the first and only implementation, attempted implementation, of the statute.",16.426999999999992
2007.07-77,0,kevin_c_newsom,,229.713,250.626,"And I think the question at bottom here in this case is whether section 5 provides State courts with any breathing space whatsoever in which to conduct this exercise of judicial review, and our submission is that at the very least that it ought to extend so far as to allow State courts to step in, as they did here, at the earliest possible opportunity.",20.91300000000001

2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3632.718,3634.218,But the language is what the language is I'm sorry.,1.5
2007.07-77,3,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3634.218,3642.74,What about Ms. Karlan's response that this is not the same practice but it's different because the underlying method of election has been changed.,8.521999999999935
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3642.74,3645.626,"With respect, Your Honor, I think the plaqueities is gubernatorial appointment.",2.886000000000422
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3645.626,3654.984,"It doesn't strike me that the underlying method of how the election might have operated if the rule were election should matter, the rule was gubernatorial appointment.",9.35799999999972
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3654.984,3658.186,The rule is by virtue of these decisions gubernatorial appointment.,3.2020000000002256

2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3659.919,3666.172,"Justice Ginsburg, the question of what DOJ was asked to preclear here is crystal clear from the district court's opinion.",6.253000000000156
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3666.172,3681.665,"On August 18, 2006, this three judge court held that two Alabama Supreme Court decisions Stokes v. Noonan and Riley v. Kennedy must be precleared before they can be... so the notion that the State was not asked to preclear judicial decisions is simply incorrect.",15.492999999999938
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3681.665,3691.704,The second thing I'd like to mention just briefly is that the Federalism exacerbation here exists in a very real way for this reason.,10.039000000000215
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3691.704,3697.792,The entire legislative and litigation history of section 5 has been about legislative and administrative change.,6.087999999999738
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3697.792,3712.351,"Even with respect to those sorts of changes, this Court has said most recently and most forcefully in Presley that that application of section 5 even there works an extraordinary change of the traditional course of relations between the states and the Federal Government.",14.559000000000196
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3712.351,3717.255,So the... to this point to be sure the Court has been willing to accept that extraordinary departure.,4.903999999999996
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3717.255,3726.211,"The question in this case, however, is whether this extraordinary departure ought to become this extraordinary departure to account for this new category, this new universe of changes.",8.955999999999676
2007.07-77,3,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3726.211,3735.567,Why as a matter of Federalism is it more extraordinary to review a court determination than the determination of a popularly elected legislature?,9.356000000000222

2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3739.185,3742.037,That's more extraordinary simply in a quantitative sense.,2.8519999999998618
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3742.037,3746.94,"We are talking about a lot more changes, so in sheer numbers we have got an exacerbation.",4.903000000000247
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3746.94,3762.034,"But it's also in a qualitative sense the sense that we are living in a post Marbury, post Cooper versus Aaron, post Bernie world in which State courts just like Federal courts are tasked with finally deciding what State law means.",15.094000000000051
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3762.034,3771.323,"And so, there is a very real difference, I think, in upsetting the considered judgment of a State court with respect to what State court... with respect to what State law means than there is--",9.28899999999976
2007.07-77,3,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3771.323,3774.025,But they are not saying State law is different from what it means.,2.7020000000002256

2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3779.462,3786.35,But with respect I think that that doesn't do justice to the functional reality of what's going on here.,6.88799999999992
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3786.35,3795.957,"In 1988 the Alabama Supreme Court says, may I, says in Stokes versus Noonan that 85-237 is and always was unconstitutional.",9.606999999999971
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3795.957,3804.327,"We have an issue of doctrine that's simply part of Alabama law and, again, I don't think anybody here seriously disputes that 85-237 was unconstitutional.",8.370000000000346
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3804.327,3814.466,"And 20 years later DOJ steps in and refuses to bless that determination, and to be sure, is not meddling around in the intricacies of state law but the functional equivalent is the same.",10.138999999999669
2007.07-77,3,kevin_c_newsom,,3814.466,3827.456,"They set that judgment aside, and notwithstanding the Stokes court invalidation of that, DOJ says very clearly in its objection letters that 85-237, despite its invalidation, remains in full force and effect.",12.990000000000236
