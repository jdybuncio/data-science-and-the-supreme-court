2007.07-77,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.754,"We will hear argument next in Riley, Governor of Alabama, versus Kennedy."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,11.622,22.411,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This appeal presents two issues, both a threshold jurisdictional question and a substantive question concerning scope of section 5."
2007.07-77,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,88.286,93.19,"It's pretty hard to argue something wasn't in force and effect when they have an election under it, isn't it?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,93.19,109.886,"Your Honor, I don't think... Your Honor is correct that the only possible distinction between Young and this case is the holding of the 1987 election, but I don't think the election can make the difference here, for this reason: It preceded solely by virtue of the vagaries of the State litigation process."
2007.07-77,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,181.565,190.588,"What if there had been no challenge to that election, but two or three years later somebody challenged the election and then the Supreme Court said it was invalid."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,190.588,191.69,"Well, Justice Stevens--"
2007.07-77,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.69,193.756,Then there never would have been a State statute.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,193.756,194.34,--I'm sorry?
2007.07-77,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,194.34,198.526,"Then there never would have been a State statute, a valid State statute."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,198.526,198.843,Right.
2007.07-77,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,250.626,267.538,"If the respondent prevails in this case and you have a case similar to this one that begins in the trial court, how do you think it would work, that the plaintiffs in the trial court action have to get preclearance either way?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,277.227,278.527,I'm not frankly--
2007.07-77,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,278.527,286.131,"If I'm in State trial court, how can I make a ruling if... assuming the respondents win in this case, if I know there has to be preclearance?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,286.131,322.82,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that's certainly part of the point that we've emphasized here as one of the key federalism issues in this case, is that this case really does in a very functional way strip State courts of their jurisdiction to exercise judicial review, whether at the trial court stage or at the supreme court stage because on Appellee's theory once the statute is precleared it is effectively locked in place and that the trial court or the supreme court needs permission from the Executive Branch in Washington to exercise the authority to--"
2007.07-77,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,322.82,329.224,"I suppose States get... State courts get preclearance all the time with district changes, don't they?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,336.397,344.251,"--Well, to be sure the Appellees are correct that it is the administration of the change itself that requires preclearance."
2007.07-77,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.647,376.205,"Are there any other district cases that require preclearance except those that redistrict the, the State?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,376.205,393.816,"No Your Honor, and the point is that no one here denies, certainly the State does not deny, that a State court order redistricting, redrawing a map, in essence, and giving rise or exercising what is functionally, as this Court has said, a legislative power requires redistricting."
2007.07-77,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,405.041,422.253,Are there district court... there must be... district court cases in which the State trial court has invalidated on some State constitutional ground legislation redistricting that has been passed by the legislature?
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,425.622,427.906,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
2007.07-77,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,433.893,438.262,But isn't the reason that there would be no reason to preclear them?
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,462.328,467.382,"--That might be right, Justice Souter, but I'm not sure that I understand the implications for this case."
2007.07-77,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,467.832,474.035,"Well, I guess what I'm saying is your ""No"" answer does not prove much."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,530.855,540.163,"--Well, I think the point that I was trying to make, Your Honor, is that this Court has said in construing section 5 that it will not construe it so as to exacerbate federalism costs."
2007.07-77,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.302,551.102,"Well, that may be--"
2007.07-77,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,551.102,554.839,But you said in answer to Justice Souter that this is your case.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,556.506,572.968,"--Well, it's certainly true, Your Honor, that when a state Court, as any court... as this Court made clear only last month in Danforth, when a court exercises judicial review to invalidate a practice that's unconstitutional it is not changing or making new law as it goes along, but declaring what the law has always been."
2007.07-77,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.968,587.526,There is a law to be cleared if you... if you assume that the existence of a law to be cleared occurs before that law has been tested in the courts.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,612.959,619.397,"Well, with respect, Justice Scalia, my case is the latter situation, where there was technically a law in place."
2007.07-77,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,627.386,629.471,And it was precleared at what point?
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,634.372,637.91,"Yes, Your Honor, it was precleared virtually immediately, so let's say in '85."
2007.07-77,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.828,643.062,And it was submitted by?
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,643.062,645.164,Submitted by the State of Alabama.
2007.07-77,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.164,646.214,Yes.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,648.449,648.816,Right.
2007.07-77,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.601,659.424,"And so your point is that if the circuit court... there are only two levels of court in this, the circuit court and the supreme court?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,659.424,660.94,For purposes of this litigation.
2007.07-77,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,660.94,670.213,"So if the circuit court had gotten the State law right, then there never would have been an election?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,670.213,671.698,"Well, that's right."
2007.07-77,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.698,675.649,--There never would have been perhaps preclearance if it got it right soon enough.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,675.649,681.003,"Well, that's true, but of course courts don't get to reach out and grab the disputes and bring them into courts."
2007.07-77,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,681.003,699.415,"Well, but if the... if the challenging parties go into court at the first opportunity and you don't have an election sort of coming up next week, I would suppose that in cases like that, the State would at least allow the State litigation to proceed to some level."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,719.595,724.849,"That's right, Your Honor, but it... but the challenge here would not have been ripe until 1987."
2007.07-77,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,733.272,734.072,I will assume that.
2007.07-77,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,734.072,749.032,"Even in the hypothetical Justice Souter proposes, I don't know the rules in Alabama, but I can see a Federal court saying: Well, this is premature; it hasn't been precleared; why should I pass on the validity of something that might not be precleared?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,749.032,751.565,"Well, I think that's entirely possible, Your Honor, and--"
2007.07-77,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,751.565,754.735,"On the other hand, I can also see the attorney general saying: Why should I preclear it?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,765.974,777.782,"--The Justice Department's regulations at 51.22, Your Honor, say that they will not preclear things that are not final and that are subject, it says, to revision by court... by court judgment."
2007.07-77,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,782.75,788.253,How does that apply to a State statute which is fully enacted and then there's going to be a challenge?
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,788.253,802.03,"--The truth is the regulations don't speak specifically to that question, and the reason is that the regulations are quite clear in the Federal Register at 46 Federal Register 872 that they don't deal with changes, so called, brought about as a result of court judgments."
2007.07-77,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.401,810.886,Where they are doing the districting or--
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,810.886,813.638,"--That's right, redistricting, reannexation."
2007.07-77,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.638,823.727,--Do you know of any cases where... where a piece of State legislation has been in the middle of litigation where the Justice Department has precleared it?
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,823.727,827.513,"No, Your Honor, not right off... not as I'm standing here, I don't."
2007.07-77,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.513,830.114,It seems like an exercise in futility.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,830.114,838.653,"But the point... Justice Ginsburg, getting back to your point so you'll appreciate the timeline, in April of 1987 the challenge is brought."
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.804,865.688,What happened... I have a factual question.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,882.099,882.899,Yes.
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,882.899,887.386,"And then when the Governor appointed him, what does the appointment look like?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,902.146,904.162,"The truth is, Your Honor, I do not know what--"
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.162,912.351,"Well, I think it's important to me because, for this reason: I would guess they don't make it retroactive or you'd know it, and therefore we... we have more."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,954.428,965.402,"--Your Honor, the difference, or what makes this case just like Young versus Fordice, is that the relevant... the relevant implementation in Young was not election."
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.573,976.794,"Yes, their registering is a precondition of voting."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1005.963,1006.829,"With respect, Your Honor--"
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1006.829,1008.079,All right.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1013.967,1014.217,"--No, I can't--"
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1014.217,1014.767,So I assume it wasn't.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1014.767,1015.833,--tell you as I'm standing here that the--
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.833,1016.2,Yes.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1016.2,1029.227,"--that the appointment was retroactive, but I do think that, given the nature of the implementation, the relevant implementation in Young being registration, the fact that 4,000 people were registered does bring this case pretty close to Young."
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1029.91,1030.31,All right.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1065.133,1071.254,"--With respect to that, Your Honor, it's that I don't think it is accurate to say that this was the governor's plan."
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.137,1083.676,"No, I'm just using that as shorthand, the shorthand for a system under which the officeholder is appointed by the government... by the governor."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1083.676,1084.145,--Right.
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1084.511,1101.52,"And I'm saying if we start from the base that the plan is special election which was in force and effect for a year and two months, then for whatever set of reasons there is a change, and the State has to preclear the change."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1103.156,1113.647,"--The answer to that, Your Honor, is that the shorthand misses the fact here that what we're talking about is that the change results here from a State court exercising judicial review."
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1113.647,1121.268,All right.
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1154.889,1155.922,"--The point, Your Honor, is that that--"
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1155.922,1160.643,"You see where I'm going, and I'm not phrasing it correctly, but you can answer it anyway."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1160.643,1167.963,"--So the point, Your Honor, is that the result of that court decision would have been immediately enjoined under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, or section 2."
2007.07-77,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.482,1175.669,"It would have been able to be brought up here if it was based on a discriminatory intent, certainly."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1175.669,1176.536,--Absolutely.
2007.07-77,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1179.254,1202.236,"But what my question is, is there any authority for the proposition that between 1964 and today, it mattered whether the cause of a change in a State plan was a decision of let's say five members of a court... of a State court... or whether it was a legislative decision."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1206.155,1232.472,"--If I... if I may, Justice Breyer, as a preface it's important that I emphasize simply as sort of a superstructure point here that as... not only as the plaintiff in this case, but as the party asking the Court to exacerbate federalism costs, within the meaning of Bossier Parish, over what they have been to this point, I think it's my opponents' burden to show you that Congress clearly intended to include these provisions, as opposed to my burden to show you that Congress intended to exclude them."
2007.07-77,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1235.007,1251.586,"Well, they argue in their brief that there were instances in which State supreme courts participated prior to the enactment of the Voting Rights Act in changes in election requirements for the purposes of disenfranchising African-Americans."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1265.526,1267.295,"Well, I think there are... if I can answer in two parts."
2007.07-77,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1337.055,1341.393,"Now, counsel, since you mentioned section 5, perhaps you ought to look at it."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1375.214,1375.88,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2007.07-77,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1390.174,1394.092,"Well, in your reply brief on page 8 you say you take no position on that question."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1394.092,1407.25,"--With respect, what I say at page 8 of the reply is that there is no need for this Court to determine specifically how the November 1, 1964, language ought to operate in the legislative and administrative change scenario."
2007.07-77,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1415.938,1422.125,"Well, there wouldn't be a different baseline for judicial changes than there would be for legislative or executive changes, would there?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1422.125,1422.642,--No.
2007.07-77,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1442.439,1462.919,"Well, I take it it's your position... and I noticed this in the question put to you by Justice Breyer... tell me if this is wrong, but that it's not just the fact that the court makes a decision, because the court may have discretion to choose plan one, plan two, plan three, but it is if the court makes a decision to show that the prior practice was invalid, was void under State law."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1462.919,1463.486,"That's right, Your Honor."
2007.07-77,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1463.486,1464.469,"That's the distinction, I take it."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1464.469,1464.869,"That's right, Your Honor."
2007.07-77,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1464.869,1467.688,"Not the fact that it's just the court, but the kind of decision the court makes."
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1467.688,1468.29,That's right.
2007.07-77,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1533.248,1544.554,"Mr. Newsom, before you finish I would like to ask you a question about what action Governor Riley would take if you're right on the law?"
2007.07-77,0,33930,kevin_c_newsom,,1619.585,1633.378,"It would be the Governor's option, Your Honor, whether to... to do what was done in 1987 or 8, I suppose, and to install the winner of the election or to reinstate Juan Chastang to his position."
2007.07-77,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1642.934,1650.989,"Thank you, Mr. Newsom."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1651.839,1664.147,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to turn initially to two cases that weren't mentioned yet by the Court that I think dispose of the question of whether the law was in force or effect."
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.601,1752.538,Do you agree that the lawsuit to invalidate it was filed as soon as was feasible?
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1752.538,1761.161,"I don't honestly know the answer to that question, Justice Scalia, because Alabama law has different views, for example, on ripeness and the like than Article III does."
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.897,1821.784,Why didn't the Alabama Supreme Court say that in this very case?
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1821.784,1826.203,"Well, in this case, the election hadn't been held yet, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-77,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.244,1845.567,Then it was the district judge that made Alabama go to the preclearance after the second--
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1845.567,1846.5,"Yes, that's correct."
2007.07-77,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1846.5,1863.961,"--But still, if you take this case at its essence, a circuit court got Alabama law wrong and that's what you say counts as to make the law operative."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1888.511,1889.294,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.461,1914.011,Excuse me.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1927.469,1928.154,Your Honor--
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.154,1933.792,--the Alabama Supreme Court would say it never went into effect because it was unconstitutional.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1933.792,1934.275,--No.
2007.07-77,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.609,1964.727,But suppose they didn't have that footnote.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1968.746,1984.224,"--My answer to his question is Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart against United States still compel the result of finding that this law went into effect as a matter of Federal law, because the question of whether a law is in force or effect is a question of construing section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which is Federal law."
2007.07-77,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1984.224,1993.813,"Well, you're saying that if a State passes a statute... a State legislature passes a statute that's flagrantly in violation of the State constitution, it immediately is precleared, it's locked into place?"
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1993.813,1995.113,"Yes, I am."
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.113,2004.036,That rule of law renders constitutional under State law an act that would otherwise not be constitutional.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2004.036,2005.304,"No, it does not render it constitutional."
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.304,2005.971,"Well, that's what you're saying."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2005.971,2006.321,No.
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.321,2008.023,You're saying that's the effect: It locks it in.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2008.023,2012.492,"It locks it in until the State comes up with a constitutional cure, in the same way--"
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.492,2014.944,"Oh, but it can't go back."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2014.944,2015.794,"--No, it cannot go back."
2007.07-77,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2015.794,2016.945,It locks it in.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2016.945,2021.08,"Well, it doesn't... it doesn't require that they stay with that law."
2007.07-77,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2027.951,2030.453,May I ask: You're not... correct me if I'm wrong.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2061.907,2065.359,"It's a little trickier than that, Justice Souter, for the following reason."
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.043,2071.763,"For the reason that, absent their coming up with a new law, what law would be in effect?"
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2071.763,2073.114,--That's what I was about to explain.
2007.07-77,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2073.114,2075.984,And isn't the answer that no law would be in effect?
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2105.436,2109.221,"Well, we are, but as I suggested, it's a little trickier than that."
2007.07-77,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2117.827,2119.527,"Well, it was in force and effect."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2119.527,2119.763,--Excuse me?
2007.07-77,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2119.763,2132.237,Does the theory require that we assume it remains in force and effect by virtue of the preclearance even when there is a subsequent determination of unconstitutionality?
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2132.237,2137.306,"I think the answer to that question, candidly, is yes, and the State can cure that quite quickly."
2007.07-77,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2174.798,2186.738,"I'm not sure that in those cases you had what you had here, which was a declaration, let's assume, of invalidity ab initio."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2215.358,2223.377,"--Well, in your hypothetical there would be no problem at all, and this goes back to Justice Souter's hypothetical that he asked Mr. Newsom, which is: That law hasn't been precleared."
2007.07-77,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2226.429,2227.765,"Well, suppose it had been precleared?"
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2227.765,2231.15,Then it would be Perkins against Matthews.
2007.07-77,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.15,2231.733,"Well, is it?"
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2309.195,2313.581,"Well, there are two factual points in response to your question, Justice Breyer."
2007.07-77,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2407.741,2421.3,"If I could just ask you, in making that argument, aren't you asking us to say that the purpose of this act... that the intent of the Alabama legislature in passing that act is different from the intent as determined by the Alabama Supreme Court?"
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2421.3,2426.254,"--Yes, but if I can explain why I think this is important in a sense."
2007.07-77,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2458.29,2461.777,It's a review of a lower court by a higher court.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2478.92,2488.328,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, which leads to the second pair of cases that we think this Court has already decided that provide you absolutely clear guidance as to why preclearance was required here."
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2544.914,2546.564,What does the Alabama Supreme Court preclear?
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2564.276,2564.859,They have to--
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2564.859,2566.042,"Do they submit their opinion and say,"
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2568.077,2568.393,--No.
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.71,2569.91,All right.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2570.295,2572.411,They do not have to come before this court at all.
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.031,2582.533,"Before the attorney general, you're talking about?"
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2582.533,2584.385,He doesn't even have to come before the attorney general.
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.204,2589.571,"No, no."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2594.107,2597.359,"--Well, the attorney general found that this was a retrogressive change."
2007.07-77,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.359,2598.109,I understand.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2603.646,2614.171,"Exactly what was submitted after the Federal court did, which is the... the decision to appoint rather than to elect someone to District 1 of the Mobile County Commission."
2007.07-77,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2618.873,2620.741,The Federal court told the Alabama--
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2620.741,2621.741,"No, it told--"
2007.07-77,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2621.741,2622.691,--It told Alabama.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2638.219,2639.436,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.07-77,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2640.988,2641.888,What did they say?
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2641.888,2661.568,"If you turn to the August 18th final judgment, which is on page 9a over to page 10a of the jurisdictional statement, they said judgment is entered in our favor... that was the declaratory judgment... and then said the State of Alabama has days to obtain preclearance."
2007.07-77,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2670.691,2678.894,But the State's position was it shouldn't have to preclear a decision of the State's highest court--
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2678.894,2680.179,But it... it--
2007.07-77,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2680.179,2682.931,--saying that the State lower court got it wrong.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2682.931,2689.335,"--Justice Ginsburg, this does not say the State has to preclear the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court."
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2709.996,2712.03,Why did Alabama have to preclear anything?
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2721.736,2724.588,"Well, for one thing, this Court would have to overrule its decisions--"
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2724.588,2725.088,"Oh, no, no."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2726.538,2736.895,"--But let me go then straight to a factual point, which is this is not the same practice as they were using on November 1st of 1964, because that practice was a combination of two things."
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2747.517,2748.703,So something else changed--
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2748.703,2749.269,"--No, the--"
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2749.269,2751.019,--whether they are membership elections or at large elections.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2751.019,2752.637,"--It's a huge difference, Your Honor."
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2752.637,2757.872,The argument you made in your brief was that this was already decided in Reno versus Bossier Parish.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2758.541,2759.207,"No, we didn't--"
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2759.207,2761.909,"--Is the argument that this was not, in fact, a change in your brief?"
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2761.909,2767.647,"--We didn't see that until their reply brief, and we didn't think we needed to file a surreply brief."
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2768.997,2769.313,No.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2771.115,2771.482,No.
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2771.482,2776.335,--You quote in your brief Reno versus Bossier Parish and one other case.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2777.385,2781.087,"I think you're probably thinking about Young against Fordice, itself."
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2781.087,2781.47,Yes.
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2788.143,2803.153,"Well, their claim there was that... not that this wasn't any different, but part of our explanation is that, in context, we think there is a difference between what was going on in 1964."
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2841.275,2849.447,"I think you're quite right on the DOJ regulations and the House report, but I just don't see how that squares with the statutory language."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2849.447,2856.034,"--Well, Your Honor, if I could just make an observation about section 5 more generally in Allen, and I'll start here."
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2872.396,2875.448,"So because we've ignored the text in other areas, we should just forget about it here?"
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2875.448,2882.586,"--No, because that's... that's the... those sets of decisions by this Court have been ratified by Congress and have been the longstanding practice under section 5."
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2883.536,2890.207,"I thought that... they ratified... these cases were ratified by Congress, but Congress did not change the language in the statute."
2007.07-77,1,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,2890.207,2904.082,Because it thought that the purpose of section 5... if I could spend just one sentence on this... the purpose of section 5's November 1st language was to prevent a sort of game of Whac-A-Mole in which the States would keep changing the practice.
2007.07-77,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2916.589,2917.339,"Thank you, Ms. Karlan."
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2923.677,2937.686,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this Court has repeatedly recognized, section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires a cover jurisdiction to seek preclearance whenever it seeks to administer any change in its voting practices."
2007.07-77,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2948.392,2953.279,Do you have any problem with the republican form of government provision of the Constitution?
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2953.279,2953.896,Absolutely not.
2007.07-77,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2953.896,2972.51,"As I understand what's going on here, the... the legislative process of the people of Alabama, whereby something is invalid as a law, suddenly becomes a law because the Federal attorney general has given it preclearance."
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2981.531,2985.667,"Well, I don't think, with respect, Justice Scalia, that that's actually happened here."
2007.07-77,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3024.508,3029.446,From an Alabama law that had never been adopted by the people of Alabama?
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3029.446,3031.548,It had been adopted by the people of Alabama.
2007.07-77,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3031.548,3032.998,"Not validated, so--"
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3032.998,3035.933,"It was invalid, to be sure, as a matter of State law."
2007.07-77,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3064.95,3068.469,That all depends on there having been a change.
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3096.088,3102.909,"--That's exactly right, and under our view there would not have been a change, because it was the fact that there was a special election that was critical."
2007.07-77,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3102.909,3110.915,So there becomes... there becomes a change only because the circuit court has made the mistake about what the State law is.
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3111.848,3121.204,"There becomes a change, Justice Ginsburg, because the practice of special elections actually went into effect by virtue, at a minimum of the fact that an election was held."
2007.07-77,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3121.82,3125.189,What if the district court... circuit court I guess it is in Alabama.
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3148.654,3157.41,"--Well, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I think what a State court might do in that circumstance would be to enter a stay until it could adjudicate the validity--"
2007.07-77,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3157.41,3158.027,"Well, sure, but not always."
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3170.118,3189.114,"--Well, it is certainly the implication of our position that if the law actually goes into effect and an election is held and if preclearance has already been granted for, in some sense, the contrary position, then, yes, if the State Supreme Court or the State trial court subsequently gives State law a different interpretation, then that change is going to require preclearance."
2007.07-77,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3189.114,3190.248,That's not just an implication.
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3191.55,3196.585,"Well, it is our theory as to what the ""in force or effect"" requirement means."
2007.07-77,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3205.691,3217.748,"Well, Young versus Fordice, that's Young versus... I mean, if it never went into force and effect, of course we don't reach questions like republican form of government or 1964 safe harbors and so forth."
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3304.12,3307.072,"--Justice Breyer, the harm is that there would be actual retrogression."
2007.07-77,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3355.42,3357.089,"Counsel, you talk about force and effect."
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3368.047,3369.813,"Well, it isn't quaint at all."
2007.07-77,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3401.518,3404.836,"Well, that can't tie our hands in properly interpreting the statute."
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3404.836,3407.272,"--Well, it's not within the scope of the question presented, either."
2007.07-77,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3433.84,3439.826,"I don't see how... regardless of how consistent the interpretation is, how can you read 1st, 1964> [""], to mean anything other than that date?"
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3439.826,3453.084,"Well, I do think that a textual argument could be made, Mr. Chief Justice, that the practice that was in effect as of the coverage date in some sense ceases to exist when the jurisdiction adopts an intervening distinct practice."
2007.07-77,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3464.875,3471.696,"--Mr. Shanmugan, what does the attorney general do when he gets... I mean, does he just preclear any old thing that somebody shoves under his nose?"
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3478.385,3479.601,I think this bears--
2007.07-77,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3479.601,3480.335,--the plan was submitted--
2007.07-77,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3480.335,3482.37,"--This bears on a critical point, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-77,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3551.165,3554.367,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-77,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3556.119,3562.788,"Mr. Newsom, I hate to intrude on your rebuttal time, but I would like to ask you this question."
