1982.82-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.84,We'll hear arguments next in Solem against Helm.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,57.101,63.678,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a case from the Eighth Circuit that basically began three years ago."
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,305.161,310.004,"Attorney General, you mentioned about this life imprisonment and parole."
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,311.596,313.658,That's correct.
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,337.257,339.023,It confused me.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,339.023,343.38,"--Well, an individual can be commuted and in South Dakota that's the normal process."
1982.82-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,376.273,385.551,"Well, is this to say that every sentence which is just a life sentence remains without possibility of parole unless the governor commutes?"
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,385.551,386.723,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,392.502,396.812,And how many offenses can result in life sentences?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,396.812,405.105,"--Well, anything that's a Class 1 felony in South Dakota, which would include murder, rape... the more serious offenses, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.627,467.908,"Yes, but isn't there a difference in the parole situation?"
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,473.874,477.796,"Well, I think the record would show since 1975, and I think--"
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.796,480.919,It is correct nobody's gotten it since 1975?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,480.919,481.31,--That's correct.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,482.855,487.073,I suppose there have been people who have been put on parole in South Dakota since 1975.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,487.073,487.354,--There have.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,487.354,488.104,Probably quite a lot of them.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,488.104,488.385,There have.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.837,496.727,"Would you... because I had not found it in the record, at the beginning you recited the convictions."
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,500.912,501.146,"Yes, sir."
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.431,534.164,And then this $100 check item.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,534.164,537.585,And then the $100 no-account check in 1979.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,537.585,551.299,"So then it's correct that from 1973 on, he had one conviction for drunken driving, which probably had meant there were a couple others before, because it was a felony, and the $100 check."
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,552.47,567.635,"Well, from '73 to '79... he's been in prison, Justice, since '79, so in that six-year period he was convicted of three felonies, and you must remember that he was in prison during part of that time."
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,578.648,594.5,"Mr. Attorney General, as I read your statute, am I correct that if somebody commits a felony and it's shown that he's had three prior... I mean, four prior misdemeanor convictions he can get life?"
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,594.5,595.938,"No, he can't."
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,595.938,596.469,Under this statute?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,596.469,596.905,"No, he can't."
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,596.905,598.155,It says convictions.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,598.155,600.575,"I know it, and that was changed in '82."
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,602.636,602.996,Good.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,602.996,607.776,"--that everybody assumed we... that it was meant by a felony conviction, but that was changed."
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,618.147,619.334,I have changed my notes.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,619.334,619.6,Okay.
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,619.6,623.41,"General, were the burglaries third-degree burglaries?"
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,623.41,623.957,They were.
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,623.957,626.347,Would you describe those for us?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,626.347,631.548,"Well, the record's not real clear, but I believe they were just third-degree burglaries."
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,635.233,637.951,What is the statutory definition of a third-degree burglary?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,637.951,643.606,--It's breaking... in South Dakota it's breaking and entering into a building that's not inhabited.
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,643.606,644.62,That's unoccupied.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,644.62,645.339,Unoccupied.
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,645.339,647.291,"What, like a stable or--"
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,647.291,649.244,Could be a liquor store.
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,655.069,660.504,--Was any violence involved in any of the burglaries?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,660.504,664.783,"Well, by its definition there was breakings, but not to a human being, no, sir."
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,664.783,665.158,Right.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,669.938,673.374,That's a... taking property over $200.
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,673.374,674.765,Over $200?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,674.765,675.686,Over $200.
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,681.98,684.698,It seems to me I read somewhere it was $50 at the time.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,684.698,689.305,"--Well, it is now $200, but in 1973 it could have been $50."
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.006,699.645,"Was there a dollar value on the burglary in the third degree, or was it just any entry?"
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,699.645,700.753,No.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.966,720.215,You'd make the same argument if in each of the three burglaries he stole a quart of liquor?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,720.215,722.214,--Yes.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,769.726,773.646,May I ask how frequent... I take it there was no pre-sentence report here either.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,773.646,775.364,"No, it was the--"
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.364,776.598,Is that customary in your state?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,776.598,777.566,--It is not customary.
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,782.003,782.923,He waived it.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,782.923,783.345,He waived it.
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,783.345,783.891,He waived it.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,785.579,785.765,"Yes, he did."
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,827.64,837.277,What would have happened if in each one of these burglaries he was stiff drunk and broke in just to lay down and go to sleep?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,837.277,838.916,--I doubt if--
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,838.916,843.478,Isn't that different from breaking in or blowing up a safe and destroying a building?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,843.478,845.194,"--Well, the record--"
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,845.194,846.397,Or killing somebody?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,846.397,848.224,--It's certainly different than killing somebody.
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,857.065,858.799,But I'm saying it could have.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,858.799,862.953,"It could have been, but it wasn't, or we don't know."
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,862.953,864.515,And nobody seemed to be interested in it.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,874.59,875.106,It does.
1982.82-492,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,875.106,877.198,And would sleeping constitute a felony or theft?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,877.198,880.009,It does in our state.
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,887.537,889.943,Burglary 3 doesn't include that?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,889.943,890.427,--Yes.
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,893.411,893.739,A crime.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,893.739,894.549,A crime.
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,897.58,898.315,All right.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,900.813,901.375,Um-hum.
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,901.375,902.406,That's it.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,904.468,908.999,Only after there's three prior felonies.
1982.82-492,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,908.999,910.465,Only after three loaves of bread.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,910.465,913.824,"Well, if you want to look at it this way."
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.286,968.191,May I ask one other question about his batting average?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,968.191,968.426,Yes.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,968.426,973.659,"In '75 when he went in for drunken driving, how long was he sentenced then?"
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,973.659,975.846,I know what he served.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.671,982.983,Nine months.
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,987.622,988.637,Until he was convicted.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.745,994.447,"Well, wasn't it rather promptly... the charge promptly disposed of in '79?"
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,994.447,995.791,"--Yes, it was."
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.791,999.196,And when did the $100 forgery occur?
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,999.196,1002.538,"It occurred three years ago, March of '79."
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.538,1011.049,"So he was out from '75... from late in '75, early '76, until '79 without resuming his evil ways."
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1011.049,1012.596,He was not convicted during that time.
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.346,1017.204,"Well, there's nothing in the record to say he engaged in any misconduct for that three-year period."
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1017.204,1020.875,"--That's right, but I don't think I can naively say he did not commit any crimes."
1982.82-492,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.466,1029.839,"Well, what presumption should we make during that three-year period... that he was out committing a lot of crimes, or that he was--"
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1029.839,1030.104,No.
1982.82-492,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1265.245,1282.222,"--General, I understand the Court of Appeals to the Eighth Circuit said that only one other state had laws that would enable or authorize a life sentence without parole for the type of recidivist that we have in this case."
1982.82-492,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1283.05,1288.282,I think they mentioned Nevada and I believe there's one other that skips my mind.
1982.82-492,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1319.504,1325.938,Mr. Burnett.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1325.938,1338.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Mr. Helm has been deprived of his freedom for life by the punishment involved in this case."
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1362.892,1365.501,He didn't say one.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1367.141,1375.42,"--Your Honor, he said the felony and in accordance with his brief and in accordance with, as I understood, his argument to you--"
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1375.42,1383.213,"But the issue here is whether seven felonies can invoke this statute without offending the Eighth Amendment, isn't it?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1383.213,1384.042,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.509,1391.444,"What you'll have to do is tell us why the Rummel case doesn't control, don't you?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1391.444,1392.725,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.545,1572.886,Do you really think he was... do you think he was a prime candidate for rehabilitation?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1572.886,1580.041,"Your Honor, I think it was certainly not justified on the basis of his record to totally rule out the fact of his rehabilitation."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.945,1590.801,"That's, of course, the judgment that the South Dakota legislature made, saying that in these circumstances of multiple felonies that they would rule out that possibility."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1594.472,1601.032,"--Your Honor, what I'm saying is that the Eighth Amendment requires... I think there were two tests laid out in Coker."
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1641.062,1646.764,Suppose this had been his fourteenth conviction instead of his seventh felony conviction.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1648.981,1650.949,If it had been a sixteenth felony conviction?
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1650.949,1651.199,Yes.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1651.199,1656.368,"I'm not sure what my position would be then, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1664.882,1666.146,Let's move it up to twenty then.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1666.146,1667.349,--To twenty.
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1667.349,1668.208,To twenty.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1668.208,1670.005,I don't know.
1982.82-492,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1693.854,1706.91,"Mr. Burnett, if Mr. Helm had been sentenced not to life but to 50 years in prison without possibility of parole, would you say we had to apply proportionality analysis?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1706.91,1710.503,Fifty years without possibility of parole.
1982.82-492,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1723.779,1726.137,What if he were 60 years old?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1726.137,1733.852,"If he were 60 years old and you're talking reform, the sentence would effectively then probably deprive him of his freedom for life."
1982.82-492,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1745.614,1752.173,"You would suggest that the Court would have to apply proportionality analysis to terms of years as well, then, I take it?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1752.173,1753.47,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1982.82-492,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1753.47,1764.278,Your argument suggests that this Court would have to apply your same proportionality analysis even to sentences for specified terms of years.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1764.278,1787.503,"What I'm saying, Your Honor, is if a sentence cannot be clear... if you can clearly distinguish a sentence from traditional sentences of imprisonment, which a term of year sentence normally is, then a bright line could be drawn between that sentence and the proportionality test, as applied in Coker should apply."
1982.82-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.695,1814.804,"Well, so would any sentence."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1818.912,1824.675,"Well, if you could know for sure what his life expectancy would be--"
1982.82-492,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.675,1825.987,"Well, you go to the tables."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1825.987,1827.737,--Okay.
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.448,1889.446,"Mr. Burnett, what was the crime involved in Coker?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1890.055,1892.21,"In Coker it was rape, yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.21,1903.846,"Well, under your analysis would you say that a state could not sentence a person who is found guilty of the sort of rape that was involved in Coker to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1903.846,1904.518,"No, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.455,1915.685,"What, then, is the distinction between seven of this kind of felonies and the rape, so far as rehabilitation is concerned?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,1918.512,1929.882,"Your Honor, what I'm saying in this case is that the proportionality principle applied in Coker should be applied in this case."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2005.118,2012.583,"But under your test, if only two states in fact impose that sort of a punishment, those two would be lopped off by your test."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2012.583,2013.551,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.555,2050.553,"But wasn't this, your whole approach, pretty well rejected by the Court opinion in Rummel?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2050.553,2053.645,My approach was rejected by the Court--
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.645,2056.972,"I mean, this breaking it down into numerous so-called objective factors."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2065.203,2082.525,"--Your Honor, the Court opinion in Rummel, I think, it rejected that for one reason, and that was that Rummel's sentence could not be clearly separated, a bright line could not be drawn between Rummel's sentence and traditional forms of imprisonment."
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2216.876,2223.951,In each case your argument seems to treat the offense as simply the seventh felony.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2225.543,2226.481,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2226.481,2244.865,"It's just the seventh felony, but his offense in the view, in the eyes of the legislature of South Dakota, his offense is a continuing life of criminal conduct that endangers the safety and the peaceful life of the people of South Dakota."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2244.865,2263.715,"Your Honor, I do, as the Attorney General has said, I have not argued that the habitual offender, the enhancement of punishment for a prior offender, that that is in and of itself unconstitutional."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.194,2322.63,What if the last felony were his fourth third-degree burglary?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2322.63,2325.737,The fourth third-degree burglary.
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2387.744,2395.897,Is it a general practice to omit or to waive the pre-sentence reports?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2395.897,2397.443,"No, Your Honor, it's not."
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2397.443,2410.797,Would it not be particularly important to have a pre-sentence report on a seventh felony conviction with the invocation of the habitual criminal statute?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2410.797,2412.844,"I would think so, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2412.844,2415.249,"He waived it here, didn't he?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2415.249,2416.265,"He did, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2432.913,2435.959,Under... what authority did the Eighth Circuit have to make that sort of suggestion?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2435.959,2436.474,--What?
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.474,2439.41,What authority did the Eighth Circuit have to make that sort of suggestion?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2439.41,2440.145,"No authority, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2568.343,2572.857,"Well, if it affects the mens rea sufficiently, the elements of the offense aren't made out, are they?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2572.857,2574.013,"--No, they're not, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.013,2584.666,"So presumably in each offense which he was found guilty of there was the necessary intent, whether or not he might have been drinking."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2584.666,2585.088,Um-hum.
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2585.088,2587.305,So I don't see why it would affect the mens rea.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2587.305,2589.601,"I'm just saying in terms of punishment, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.097,2600.689,"Well, but then he wouldn't be guilty of the offense."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2600.689,2603.532,"No, he wouldn't be guilty of the offense in that case."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2619.12,2633.161,"You say if he had been drinking and then formed the intent to commit a burglary and committed the burglary, he is less blameworthy than someone who hadn't been drinking and formed the intent to commit a burglary and committed the burglary?"
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2633.161,2635.63,"In general, yes, Your Honor, because of--"
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2635.63,2638.972,You think that's implicit in the Eighth Amendment?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2638.972,2652.685,"--I don't think it... I think it's implicit in the Eighth Amendment to the extent... and this is going to be rather involved... but it's implicit in the Eighth Amendment to this extent, that the Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2666.445,2668.148,What is distributive justice?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2668.148,2685.812,"--It means that a person should be treated as an individual, that justice should be gauged... his sentence should be gauged to his personal culpability, his personal blameworthiness for the offense that he did and the actual harm that was caused."
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2707.913,2715.754,"Well, in this case at one time he was convicted of driving while drunk."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2715.754,2717.174,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.174,2726.67,"Well, that is close to a crime of violence, but by sheer accident it wasn't violence."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2728.373,2734.667,"Well, if you're talking about a car accident, it was a sheer accident that wasn't--"
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2734.667,2740.868,"I'm talking about driving while drunk, using a lethal weapon in the hand of a drunk is dangerous."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2740.868,2742.57,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2742.57,2744.492,So that's in this case.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2744.492,2745.569,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2748.536,2752.473,"Well, suppose he'd been convicted seven times of drunken driving."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2755.66,2758.954,"--Well, again, Your Honor, I think when you look at--"
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2758.954,2761.094,"Well, put it this way."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2765.968,2782.21,"--Well, I don't... I'd still argue that I would have, I think, that there would still be problems under the Eighth Amendment in imposing a life sentence without parole for those."
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2812.745,2817.993,"You mean there's no intent to do injury, yet you know what could happen."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2817.993,2819.226,"Well, Your Honor--"
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2819.226,2821.008,You are presumed to know that.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2821.008,2822.631,"--Your Honor, I just--"
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.631,2827.974,You are presumed to know that a drunken driver does not have the same reflexes as a sober one.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2831.815,2833.425,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2856.649,2859.71,In both are the victims equally dead?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2859.71,2861.6,Yes--
1982.82-492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.6,2868.332,Whether he shoots a guy in a robbery or otherwise drives over him in a truck while drunk?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2872.3,2873.752,"--That's certainly true, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.752,2877.485,May I ask one other factual question?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2888.683,2891.259,That's about what I was going to say.
1982.82-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.149,2901.304,"There's reference to his having been 35 or 36 years old, but I didn't know whether that was today or at the time of the last conviction or what."
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2901.304,2911.142,"--He's 40 today, because I think he was sentenced when he was 36, which would have been '79, so he's 40, I think, at this date."
1982.82-492,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2911.142,2911.736,Okay.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2911.736,2936.554,"Then, finally, the last objective factor that I mentioned, interjurisdictional approach, South Dakota... the only people in South Dakota that could be... receive a life sentence without parole, as Mr. Helm did, would be someone convicted of murder, first-degree manslaughter, first-degree arson or kidnapping."
1982.82-492,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2964.526,2969.088,You don't think drunken driving involves any threat to the person of another?
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,2969.088,2973.21,"Well, Your Honor, it would if there was an accident involved."
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.281,3108.327,We will resume at 1:00.
1982.82-492,1,29327,john_j_burnett,,3108.327,3108.671,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1982.82-492,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3109.89,3126.929,Mr. Attorney General?
1982.82-492,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3126.929,3130.037,"Just a brief rebuttal, Your Honors."
1982.82-492,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3222.718,3223.56,"Thank you, gentlemen."
