1978.77-1829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,71.001,We'll hear arguments next in Bell against Wolfish.
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,74.216,76.717,Thank you.
1978.77-1829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.474,125.874,Mr. Frey when you say pretrial detainees I take it you are excluding those who are confined other than in a status as pretrial detainees?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,125.874,126.749,That's right.
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,171.34,176.598,"Well, all those categories of people are people who have been convicted and sentenced to confinement?"
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,176.598,177.422,That's correct.
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.422,190.22,"And since the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit did not find that this was in any way cruel and unusual punishment and no appeal was taken from that, those people are out of the case, aren't they?"
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,190.22,192.569,As to the double-bunking issue.
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,192.569,193.758,As to the double-bunking business.
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,193.758,196.927,That's correct; they are out of the case.
1978.77-1829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,196.927,208.408,"Now the people who will remain there, who are awaiting trial, by definition they have not been able to secure release on bail or they wouldn't be there?"
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,208.408,215.234,The group of people that we're talking about in connection with the double-bunking issue are people who have been unable to secure a release on bail.
1978.77-1829,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,215.234,218.637,[Inaudible]
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,218.637,220.838,Is there any difference in the facility?
1978.77-1829,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,220.838,224.374,"I know it's new and all, but is it the same group of people?"
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,224.374,226.899,I believe it is generally the same group of people.
1978.77-1829,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,247.068,261.74,Are the people being held because the -- they either were not allowed to put up bail or couldn't do it; those have been indicted for felonies or are there some people charged with misdemeanors?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,261.74,263.764,I don't know the record.
1978.77-1829,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,266.229,274.656,"Mr. Frey before you get into your argument, if this were a state facility the cause of action would be brought under 1983 I would suppose."
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,281.733,288.271,"Well, it was brought as a habeas corpus class action, certified as a class action."
1978.77-1829,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.184,303.08,You agree these issues are properly raisable in a habeas corpus proceeding?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,303.08,308.887,"Well, I have not focused my attention in preparing the argument on that question."
1978.77-1829,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,311.027,312.89,"It just struck me, it's somewhat anomalous."
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,316.621,318.194,Not one that I could state.
1978.77-1829,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,318.194,324.702,Is there any history of class-- habeas corpus class action that you're familiar with?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,324.702,346.975,"Well, I believe there is some authority for habeas corpus class actions and there have been questions that have come to our attention in the Solicitor General's office in connection with whether that should be challenged, but to this point we have not sought to challenge the propriety of that, and we don't do it in this case."
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.975,362.629,"A basic question, didn't the Preiser case hold that when all that is challenged, the conditions of confinement by contrast with the fact of confinement, that habeas corpus is inappropriate?"
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,367.233,371.745,"I'm not sure if that's correct, but I'm -- well I'm generally familiar but I have not refreshed."
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.745,374.7,You're generally familiar [Voice Overlap]
1978.77-1829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.7,386.985,"Well in Middendorf against Henry which is October term 1975, I think the opinion of the Court expressly reserved the prior -- the question as to whether a habeas corpus action could be a class action."
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,389.078,401.506,"I haven't suggested that this Court has, but I don't think -- I don't perceive of that as the kind of threshold jurisdictional question that you must decide even though we have not brought it to you for decision."
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,401.506,406.459,"Well, the class action is one thing, but the basic availability of habeas corpus is more fundamental."
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,409.248,415.288,"Well, I think that would right and I'm not sure perhaps my colleague can answer."
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.369,422.618,[Voice Overlap] you want the lawsuit or otherwise [Inaudible]
1978.77-1829,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,422.618,430.719,The question I thought my brother is do you agree that there is habeas for conditions?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,430.719,450.42,"Well, I think my answer is that we have not asked this Court to overturn the judgment below on the grounds that there is a lack of jurisdiction or on the grounds of any challenge to the propriety of a class action certification and I'm reluctant to state a position for the government on these issues without having giving it a greater deal of thought."
1978.77-1829,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,450.42,466.891,"Well, one way would be if we rule against you then --"
1978.77-1829,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,466.891,475.09,"Did you say, what percentage of the total population is represented in the class [Inaudible]"
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,475.09,481.58,"Well, the class consists of the total population of inmates both sentenced and pretrial detainees."
1978.77-1829,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,481.58,483.704,I see.
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,483.704,493.882,I think that that are some internal conflicts of interest between these groups that are -- request to have such separate subclasses certified was denied by the District Court.
1978.77-1829,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.882,495.536,So we have the whole population?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,495.536,498.937,"You have the whole population, but not as to every issue."
1978.77-1829,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,543.762,545.627,And issues concern the whole --
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,545.627,560.957,"With the exception of the room search issue which applies only to pretrial detainees, no distinction was drawn on the other three issues between sentenced inmates and pretrial detainees, arguably one might be but none has been."
1978.77-1829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,943.121,946.086,Was that a liberty interest or a property interest?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,946.086,964.858,I believe they viewed it as a liberty interest and we do not dispute in this case the pretrial detainees retain those liberty interests that are not inconsistent with the fact of confinement itself.
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1041.752,1044.984,Do you say there are no disputes they must and you mean constitutionally?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1044.984,1045.757,Constitutionally.
1978.77-1829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.757,1047.003,Because of the cruel and unusual punishment.
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1047.003,1049.409,Cruel and unusual punishment clause.
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1049.409,1052.802,And as pretrial detainees the Due Process Clause.
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1052.802,1054.181,What's a due process has to do with it?
1978.77-1829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1054.181,1056.313,What's that have to do with it?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1056.313,1071.659,"Well, it has to do with it in the same sense I think that conditions of this kind can be viewed as cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment."
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.362,1080.963,[Voice Overlap] isn't he?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1080.963,1083.405,"Well, after to conviction, when they see --"
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.405,1085.711,But you said pretrial detainees.
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1085.711,1086.713,They can't be punished.
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1086.713,1087.028,That's all.
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1087.028,1088.021,That's correct.
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1088.021,1092.549,Not only could be usually punished they can't be punished at all can they?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1092.549,1093.267,That's true.
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1093.267,1095.169,And that is matter of due process you said.
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1095.169,1098.003,Yes we agree.
1978.77-1829,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.003,1109.727,"That is the standard that you suggest one that if we were to conclude that a particular type of treatment really had to be classified as punishment then that would violate the Due Process Clause, it didn't have to be cruel and unusual, but just as long as --"
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1109.727,1113.627,If you concluded that it was punishment then it would violate the Due Process Clause.
1978.77-1829,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1134.985,1138.261,What do you call it incarceration?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1138.261,1139.289,Why do I call incarceration?
1978.77-1829,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1139.289,1141.859,If it's not punishment what is it?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1141.859,1144.013,"Well, this is not punishment, its custody."
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1147.771,1151.617,But it is if it's inevitably punishment then there could be no pretrial detainees?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1151.617,1158.918,"Well, that's and if that's the case then the Due Process Clause allows punishment to the extent that pretrial --"
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1158.918,1162.612,It doesn't allow punishment of anybody who is not been convicted of a criminal offense?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1162.612,1165.335,"But, I think we are getting into a circularity."
1978.77-1829,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.474,1172.226,"If it is punishment there can be no such thing as a pretrial detainee, everybody have to be released?"
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1172.226,1176.332,No one is questioning the validity of the institution of pretrial detention.
1978.77-1829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.332,1195.236,"So then, doesn't your Right to Detain have to depend on the finding that these people were found, not likely to show up in for their trials where upon furnishing a bail, therefore you had to detain them in order to assure their presence at trial."
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1195.236,1223.654,"Well the detention involves an impairment of a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause and the standard that the Court of Appeals applied to double-bunking is clearly inappropriate standard to apply to pretrial commitment, and indeed the both the Constitution and the statutes require a kind of least restrictive alternative test so that detention is the last step after you've excluded any other reasonable measure to assure presence at trial."
1978.77-1829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1223.654,1230.522,But if you've met all those tests then you're depriving them of liberty simply in order to assure their presence at trial --
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1230.522,1231.54,That is the purpose for which they're being --
1978.77-1829,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1231.54,1239.941,But Mr. Frey some of these people at least would have been released if they could have raised the bail?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1239.941,1240.601,That's true.
1978.77-1829,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1242.826,1248.167,You're not keeping them because the people who wouldn't show up when they're supposed to show up.
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1251.544,1270.139,"Well I don't think -- I don't think that's right because the amount of bail is set in the amount necessary to assure their appearance at trial, and if they don't post that amount, then it follows that there has been an determination that with some lesser amount or Personal Recognizance bond, their appearance at trial cannot be assured and that's the reason why they are --"
1978.77-1829,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1270.139,1272.442,But whatever the amount is?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1276.08,1282.845,That's correct but they would have then been deterred from fleeing or failing to appear by the --
1978.77-1829,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.845,1288.16,It's what you said -- applicable statutes on bail?
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1288.16,1290.352,I think the -- I believe it is.
1978.77-1829,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.781,1302.396,But doesn't there have to be some finding that some alternatives besides bail wouldn't --
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1302.396,1307.577,"There are consider -- there are considerations of a number of alternatives, money bail being low down on the list."
1978.77-1829,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.577,1314.397,"Well, so that isn't -- what you said really doesn't cover the kind of a determination that's been made."
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1321.747,1334.1,"Well, we don't -- I agree with that I am not sure what the bearing of -- I don't know what the bearing of that is in the context of this case because no one is contesting the validity of the institutional pretrial detention."
1978.77-1829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.859,1357.163,But the purpose of the detention must have some bearing on the standard of review.
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1365.646,1370.669,"Well, let me explain the role that I think punishment properly plays in this."
1978.77-1829,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1524.788,1527.267,"You can move them to state facility in New York, they're --"
1978.77-1829,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1527.267,1562.793,"No there too, we could not, but this is the kind of issue that would have explored at a trial, and it is not simply administrative convenience of the administrators but encompassed within this rubric is the welfare of the people committed to their custody as a group and when the MCC was told, you can't double-bunk anymore, what happened was that 90 inmates who the Bureau of Prisons judged ought to be housed at the MCC were sent off to other facilities, possibly more crowded or for other reasons less suitable for them."
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1573.004,1573.745,Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1573.745,1575.726,Mrs. Bamberger.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1575.726,1576.621,Thank you Your Honor.
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.264,1642.546,"Would you think Mrs. Bamberger that double-bunking, as it has been described, is in itself a punishment?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1642.546,1667.583,"Double-bunking as the District Judge saw it and found it, it's an incentive punishment because it is not necessary in order to assure the appearance of the defendant at trial and for the security of the institution, which are the only two factors which can be considered in determining whether or not a condition of confinement that is above and beyond the fact of incarceration is punishment."
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1667.583,1676.707,"Would double-bunking be -- would double-bunking a form of punishment in the military services for example ,in an army camp?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1676.707,1678.187,"Well, we have to look at the particular --"
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1678.187,1682.762,They're all -- they're detained under military discipline.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1682.762,1685.576,Are you talking about normal military condition?
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1685.576,1687.927,"Army, Navy, Marine Corps?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1687.927,1694.279,Yes Your Honor there's a vast distinction between the governmental purpose in the military context and the governmental purpose here.
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1694.279,1695.71,"No, I'm talking about double-bunking."
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1701.263,1701.526,Oh!
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1710.585,1714.914,Now is the overcrowding caused by double-bunking or the double-bunking caused by overcrowding?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1714.914,1719.46,"No, well there would have been no overcrowding if there had been no double-bunking."
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1737.442,1739.82,How you defined overcrowding?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1739.82,1751.658,"Okay, we defined it, for purposes of this case, as the District Court saw it and as he made findings, we have two people housing a cell, which the Judge found was built for one."
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.243,1787.818,I don't mean to be anecdotal but the troopship I came back from the Second World War had bunked stacks six high in the hold of a ship and I don't think the common view then was that was form of punishment or that it was necessarily overcrowding given the circumstance.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1787.818,1792.465,"Well I think, I think Your Honor that is a point which can be easily explained."
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1809.873,1817.496,"Well if you go into some military camps right today and when we are in no war, you will find a considerable amount of double bunking."
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1817.496,1838.216,"Indeed Your Honor and the conditions of confinement in a military camp even in normal times can be justified by the government because of the government's need to create a unified fighting force, capable of taking orders and directions and indeed in wartime conditions leaving under a very severe restrictions and conditions."
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1862.299,1872.544,May be not providing each pretrial detainee a suite of rooms is not necessary to assure you showing up at trial or not providing each one a private bathroom?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1872.544,1873.712,No that's not.
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1873.712,1877.166,"Why does the, I don't understand the connection?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1877.166,1888.759,The connection in this case Your Honor is that the conditions which were imposed resulted in a severe loss of the privacy and dignity as the judge found on this specific facts in this case.
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1888.759,1892.902,"So arguably, would depriving somebody of a suite of rooms and private bathroom."
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1892.902,1896.9,Yes but they are all admittedly limitations.
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1896.9,1897.984,"They are, aren't there?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1897.984,1901.877,Yes they all are in limitations and that's why this is not a per se case.
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1902.459,1906.135,Well it's not -- is it a per se case even with respect to the class?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1925.646,1931.205,"That might very well be true Your Honor, but this is an imposed condition, a condition imposed by the government."
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1939.513,1943.003,"That's you concede, it cannot be allowed to these people, don't you?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1945.397,1951.501,"Yes we do concede that, but what we are saying is that they are confined to this very small space."
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.285,1977.589,Couldn't we put a blanket on?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1977.589,1984.472,"They did put a blanket on it and what the judge found was it a result of, as a result of that the ventilation system was not functioning properly."
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.248,1988.739,"This isn't supposed to be a spa, it's a prison?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1988.739,2003.738,"Well we are not urging that its if, it should be a spa, my urging is that in these conditions on these facts the individuals were deprived and the judge found if minimal privacy and dignity the Court of Appeals agrees."
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.256,2009.425,Bunk bed is punishment because if so I'm going to apologize to my sons.[Laughter]
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2009.425,2011.922,No.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.922,2014.906,"I mean, would I not be obliged to?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2014.906,2023.818,Yes you would except if you lived in a room like this where if he slept in the top bunk he would be unable to move when if he slept in the bottom bunk with the bunk bed in the room --
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.818,2025.338,What do you mean he couldn't move?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2025.338,2038.574,"Because the air-dent will let cold the air right across the top of the inmates body on the top bunk bed so that his movement was restricted, he couldn't lift his legs, he couldn't turn over, he couldn't prop himself up against the wall because his body was --"
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.574,2042.269,"That's because of his size, if that wouldn't have big --"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2042.269,2043.421,No way it would be because Your Honor.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.421,2049.44,It might be cruel when you put me in with an another guy of my size.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2054.141,2055.188,Well it --
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2055.188,2056.71,Is it?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2056.71,2059.004,It would be if they couldn't move in the room.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2059.004,2064.915,"If the room, this size room and they 225 pound guys in it?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2064.915,2066.71,Well we're free to leave this room.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2066.71,2068.906,No they can move around in that room.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2068.906,2072.632,Yes we would but the judge found that they couldn't move around in that room.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2072.632,2073.766,Regardless of their size.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2073.766,2075.149,Regardless of their size.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2075.149,2076.962,You mean the wall shrunk?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2076.962,2107.127,"No it meant that after there was the desk and the two chairs which the second chair had to be put in because there was a second person and the bunk bed that the room, that the aisle was too narrow for them to move around that they couldn't leave each others company in any way that they were forced to remain together all the time in that within one inches, within few inches of each other they have to use the toilet facility and that when if the bed was not placed on the wall with the vent, it would be placed on the opposite wall where --"
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2107.127,2110.244,Is that a private toilet for use?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2110.244,2114.76,"Not if, not per se."
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2129.287,2130.132,This is untrue.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2137.38,2138.061,That Your Honor is not --
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2138.061,2140.087,Not anything but close to it?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2140.087,2142.002,The record in this case disputes that.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2173.207,2178.853,Well what would you do in the mean time while you are building a new facility?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2178.853,2182.641,The -- that question doesn't come up here because the government has never asserted that a new facility --
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.641,2185.237,Is there a new facility available?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2185.237,2193.415,The government's never asserted the need for one. Here on appeal in the district court the government has the right.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2193.415,2206.07,Well I don't feel the government will show anything when the court case was issued that two people in one cell is bad and denial of Due Process?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2206.07,2207.632,But they didn't say that.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.632,2208.419,What did they say?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2208.419,2226.835,"The court said that with a functional unit system which was used by the bureau of prisons for this institution, the inmate's could, the institutions could not service a population which was in excess of the population for which the institution was built, 449."
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2226.835,2229.29,Well doesn't that may require a new institution?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2229.29,2230.595,No it doesn't require a new institution.
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2230.595,2233.665,But then you require another institution or turn them loose?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2233.665,2235.089,"Not on this record, there is no indication of that."
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2235.089,2237.814,Well how else would you handle on this --?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2237.814,2250.95,The Court of appeals found that the government handled it simply by removing from the institution those inmates who were serving their sentences but were kept at the institutions as part of a workforce for the government's own convenience.
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2250.95,2254.654,Mrs. Bamberger that leads me to ask questions beyond on my mind.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2272.177,2280.814,Well that the government has been in compliance with the court's full order on overcrowding since August 28 1978.
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2291.595,2296.4,"In fact there is no overcrowding of the kind about what your complaining, is that right?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2296.4,2297.441,"As far as I understand, that has to be --"
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2297.441,2300.297,And is the case moot?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2300.297,2307.543,Well the government says that they should be relieved of the obligations because the situation may come up again.
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2307.543,2312.117,"Well it may, but it's disappeared now hasn't it, haven't they changed their policy?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2316.621,2317.444,They are no longer keeping custody --
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2317.444,2319.206,Then why isn't the case moot?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2319.206,2328.46,"Well I think Your Honor with all due respect has to ask the government, whether their statement in their brief that they intent overcrowded if --"
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2328.46,2334.901,Well if you comply with an injunction presumably to avoid contempt you can nonetheless appeal?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2334.901,2342.71,Exactly Your Honor but the point is that is the government didn't seek a stay of the double-selling or the overcrowding double-selling order they never have.
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2342.71,2345.452,That's in the prerequisite to avoidance of mootness?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2345.452,2347.164,There are two more factors involved here.
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2358.246,2378.716,"Well those may support your contention here that the order was proper but I don't see how they support their contention that the case is moot because the court ordered the government to do something but it didn't want to do voluntarily, the court -- the government complied with that order under the threat of contempt sanction and appeal."
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2378.716,2379.578,Yes what.
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2379.578,2387.592,"It's conceivable that the case could become -- this place had burned down and there were no more MCA, then the case would probably been moved, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2387.592,2402.999,"Yes that's correct but it's the government position here that leaves it open to, because they say that if they need, if they say if they are, if they have a lot of prisoners again that they would put them in any institution convicted, non-convicted, pre trail whatever it may be."
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2403.776,2411.806,"Ms. Bamberger please don't push to point that it's moot because if it is moot, joint junction is wrong."
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2411.806,2415.04,"No I'm not pushing that it's moot, [Attempt to Laughter] what I'm urging Your Honor."
1978.77-1829,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2415.04,2416.586,I just want to.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2416.586,2427.066,I'm urging Your Honor is that we have a situation here which the government claims as capable of repetition and we are urging that this order is proper on that assertion.
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2449.25,2457.628,"I think that the government's position as a matter of law, that it is entitled to act on its own without going to the district court and asking it for a certificate?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2457.628,2459.317,It doesn't have to go to the court.
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.097,2468.197,Well isn't its position that it doesn't have to be subjected to that sort of requirement?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2468.197,2473.63,Its position is that but even though that order is in effect now.
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.722,2496.647,"Well but if they feel the remedy is improperly imposes a matter of constitutional law, I suppose they have a right to appeal even though you suggest they have perhaps an easier out by simply complying with the order, but that doesn't moot the case?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2496.647,2498.736,"No, no we are not asserting that the case is moot."
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.688,2524.054,"Mrs. Bamberger, how can cost or inconvenience have anything to do with the question of whether the particular condition is punishment or not?"
1978.77-1829,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2524.054,2525.653,That's what I want to know?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2525.653,2530.535,Well that's the government's theory and I don't understand that because if it's --
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2530.535,2536.046,And either its punishment or not if it is punishment seems to me they concede that they have to spend what ever money is necessary to remove the punishment.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2536.046,2537.159,That's exactly the point.
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.159,2538.831,So why are we fighting about money?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2538.831,2540.127,Well.
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.127,2541.65,I don't understand.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2541.65,2544.71,With that I will move on to one additional issue --[Laughter]
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2544.71,2563.566,"Before you move on to that, will you tell me please, what authority the District Court or the Court of Appeals relied upon to say that the ancient remedy of habeas corpus is a class action, could be used under a class action umbrella?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2563.566,2581.902,There have been decisions which I don't have in my head at this moment Your Honor in the Florida and California Federal courts involving capital punishment sanction in which those cases decided the issues based upon class action status.
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2581.902,2583.86,It was with the habeas -- with the habeas.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2583.86,2586.273,I believe Your Honor that they were habeas corpus proceedings.
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2599.933,2603.623,Well but in a class action that's all I am addressing myself to now?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2603.623,2611.529,I say I believe that there are cases which I will be happy to supply to the court with.
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2648.63,2664.339,"Ms. Bamberger what if the place have been designed originally so that the sleeping rooms were to house two people in exactly the way that the government ultimately ended up housing them, but the other facilities had met the standards that you think they are to mean."
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2673.767,2676.033,I think that would present a more difficult case because.
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2676.033,2676.92,Why?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2676.92,2686.809,"Well because the conditions in the room, the denial of privacy, the cold air blowing into the vent, the presence of the exposed toilet would still exist."
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.809,2693.059,"Well supposing that was all present, but it was simply designed that way."
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2698.678,2711.853,Well if that was the architects plan I would submit that the Court could disregard the architects plan just as though just as the Court could consider it as an element in deciding whether the room was appropriate for housing more than one person.
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2711.853,2718.278,So it isn't a question about going beyond what the capacity of prison was originally supposed to house?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2726.703,2740.348,"That's correct and indeed the bureau of prisons has itself has presented testimony in cases which would indicate that 50 square feet is the minimum required per inmate in a cell in order to give him adequate movement space, adequate psychological space."
1978.77-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.959,2760.962,Do you think those are absorbed in the Constitution?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2760.962,2783.994,"I don't think that they are absorbed into the Constitution, but I suggest to the Court that they are valid evidence which can be considered, expert evidence from, in the case of the government drafted standards it's own correctional officials, which would indicate what they believe to be adequate and I think that is evidence which the district court considered and which is appropriate to consider in making an evaluation."
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2795.298,2801.507,Ms. Bamberger if you are finished responding to Mr. Justice Rehnquist I would like to ask a question.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2818.537,2822.805,"No sir, there is no objection to that and the record doesn't present that in this case."
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2822.805,2824.336,What are the dimensions of these cells?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2826.169,2828.732,They are about 75 Square feet.
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2828.732,2830.384,Well what are the dimensions?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2830.384,2831.134,It's --
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2831.134,2834.224,30 feet long and how many feet wide?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2835.421,2842.903,"Yes they are in a supplement appendix, (Voice Overlap) Excuse me Your Honor."
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2842.903,2844.852,It shouldn't be much over 10 and by 7.5?[Laughter]
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2844.852,2849.891,That's right.[Laughter]
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2849.891,2851.635,What are they?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2851.635,2856.358,Approximately 10 X 7.5.[Laughter]
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2856.358,2857.762,You are relying on the Chief Justice or the record?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2857.762,2860.479,"Yeah, well I think he is good authority [Laughter]."
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2866.085,2867.906,Is that opposite to bunks?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2867.906,2868.529,I'm sorry.
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2868.529,2871.319,Is the toilet opposite to bunks?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2871.319,2885.861,Well it's not exactly opposite because it is in to the middle of the room so that if the bunk bed were on the side where the toilet juts out towards the bottom bunk would be just inches from the toilet and the other end of the bed would be at the window.
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2885.861,2891.842,How far is the mattress on the top bunk from the ceiling?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2891.842,2893.762,That fact is not in the record Your Honor.
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2893.762,2898.871,I thought you knew because you said that one couldn't turn over and one couldn't --
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2898.871,2909.398,"No it wasn't the ceiling height Your Honor, that was significant, it was the height of the ventilations, the vent which supplied the air that went in and out of the room."
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2909.398,2911.668,It's the cold air is what prevents one from turning over?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2911.668,2912.463,That's right.
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2918.903,2922.221,How wide are the bunks?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2922.221,2932.056,There is only one piece of evidence in the record which would indicate that and that was one of our experts who testified that the bunks were 6 feet by 3 feet.
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2933.435,2943.833,If so bunks 3 feet wide in a room 7.5 feet wide would leave 4.5 feet and you said that the people couldn't pass each other?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2943.833,2956.767,"Well the aisle is, the judge found that was approximately 30 square feet in width, I'm sorry 34 square feet so it would be 4, if it --"
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2956.767,2962.088,"The square feet wouldn't necessarily affect the width of a room, it would depend on how they were structured?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2962.088,2964.052,"No that's correct, so if it would tender it would be 3 foot."
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2964.052,2966.591,But my point is you were saying that they couldn't pass each other?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2966.591,2973.477,"Well it's about 3 feet wide, the width of the aisle that was left in the room."
1978.77-1829,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2973.477,2978.594,It will be tight but your math is little different from that and perhaps you are right.
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2978.594,2984.925,In any case the judge made a specific finding that the space would make it very crowded and very difficult to move about.
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.925,2990.044,"Are the rooms rectangular in shape, I think some these facilities have triangular rooms, is that correct?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,2990.044,3001.575,"They are -- no they are not triangular, they're irregular because of the way the fixtures for plumbing and electricity cut into the room."
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3095.388,3097.405,"No, it's just your five minute warning."
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3097.405,3110.726,"Sorry, anal and genital cavity perusals after every visit in a context of enormous security precautions, searches, strip searches which required the inmate to completely disrobe."
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3121.007,3127.167,"Now the reason for that was to prevent drugs and weapons from being concealed in a book and related matters, is it not?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3127.167,3136.739,"That is true, but the District Court found and the Court of Appeals agreed that they were less restrictive, not so overboard measures which could control that."
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3136.739,3141.657,Maybe we should make the District Judge or some judge the Director of the Institution?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3141.657,3147.569,"No, Your Honor and in fact the District Court completely disowned that responsibility as did the Court of Appeals."
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3152.814,3159.855,You regard it as an extreme measure to prohibit books being handed to the prisoners without inspection?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3159.855,3160.432,Oh!
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3232.692,3234.706,May I ask two related questions?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3254.791,3256.353,It's done every single time.
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.353,3258.018,Every single time --
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3258.018,3265.254,"Regardless of -- notwithstanding that the government has enormous search processes, the strip search is still required."
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.254,3266.282,"The answer is yes in another words, tell me…"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3266.282,3283.851,"Yes, now with respect to the nationality or the nationwide application of the rules; the government's publisher only rule has national application and indeed the government has indicated here that they don't even need that board rule, that they're going to – now the rule."
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.851,3286.998,How about strip search regulations?
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3286.998,3293.151,I am not aware of the general applicability of strip search or of the other two.
1978.77-1829,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3336.224,3340.749,"But the government quoted some witness that said diametrically the contrary, said yes it could be?"
1978.77-1829,1,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3340.749,3348.141,"No well, the government and we apparently have disputed to the significance of that testimony."
1978.77-1829,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.453,3401.283,Thank you Mrs. Bamberger.
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3403.308,3406.985,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1829,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3556.048,3562.05,"Mr Frey, were the government denied the right to put on testimony?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3562.05,3564.158,A summary judgment was granted against us.
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3647.5,3656.34,"It's your submission that unless or until there's a finding that this amounts to punishment, the Due Process Clause is not implicated?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3656.34,3678.488,"Well, our argument is that unless or until there is a finding that there is a lack of a reasonable relationship under whatever level of judicial scrutiny might be given to government's justification between the practice of double-bunking and the government – legitimate governmental objectives that might support that practice, the practice stands –-"
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3678.488,3682.917,"In other words you don't accept my, the series suggested in my question."
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3687.824,3695.412,"We think that it could, but that is because we don't think the concept of punishment has a useful role to play in an analyzing the due process plan."
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3695.412,3699.13,Then how was the Due Process Clause implicated?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3714.964,3715.393,Right.
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3715.393,3727.677,"Now that would clearly implicate the Due Process Clause in this case of the Fifth Amendment, but absent a finding a punishment how is the Due Process Clause involved?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3727.677,3731.92,"Well, that now depends upon what view you take."
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3745.491,3751.002,"[Voice Overlap] Constitution and then in order to find the answer to a constitutional question you look at the Constitution, don't you?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3751.002,3769.834,"Well, I understood the Moore case to suggest that there were five votes on this Court at least for the proposition that the due process concept is a rational continuum in Justice Harlan's words and that is not include just a series of points that are picked out."
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3778.044,3786.611,"Well, if its punishment, all the reasons in the world wouldn't make this constitutional, would it, if you show there are good reasons to whip these people once a day?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3786.611,3790.146,"I agree, if its punishment, we would be defendants."
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3790.146,3793.33,Then there wouldn't be no [Voice Overlap] at all constitutionally?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3793.33,3793.606,That's correct.
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3793.606,3807.035,"[Inaudible] cells were six -- they had ten square feet and then when two people, just room for two chairs and they kept them in there 24 hours a day, would you think you could be enjoined from --"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3807.035,3808.177,Yes.
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3808.177,3810.375,On grounds of the Due Process Clause?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3810.375,3818.462,"Well, yes on the grounds of the Due Process Clause, now, there are there are two separate ways however to look at the due process analysis."
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3834.289,3838.24,"But that involves punishment, doesn't it, the Eighth Amendment?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3838.24,3838.761,Well the Court --
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3838.761,3842.302,That means that there is some punishment.
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3842.302,3854.201,"The Court has, has I think the courts have approached that concept in a pragmatic way that is they're prepared to say the conditions of confinement that fall below minimal standards of decency to constitute punishment."
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3854.201,3855.292,Let me get one thing straight.
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3876.052,3888.015,Well the case might be different because the Court of Appeals made it per say probation turned upon the design quality or the aspect of the case.
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3892.097,3899.021,Well my question still is if it has been designed the way it has been used you would be still be here defending it?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3899.021,3900.397,We would defend it of course.
1978.77-1829,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3900.397,3901.896,Won in the Court of Appeals?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3901.896,3905.17,"We might have won in the Court of Appeals, that was the point I was trying to say."
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3905.17,3918.054,"Mr. Fery, with respect to the publisher-only rule you indicate in your briefs as I remember that the government is now changed as practice and policy and there's no longer enforced such rule with respect to paperback books?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3918.054,3919.246,That's correct.
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3919.246,3923.186,And therefore to that extent you're not –
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3923.186,3924.452,We're not asking you to –
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3924.452,3932.12,planning about asking that the court of appeal's judgment be disturbed in that aspect?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3932.12,3933.63,That's correct.
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3933.63,3940.183,Now how about the more general change of conditions in the overcrowding in this facility?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3940.183,3940.576,Well --
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3940.576,3944.9,Isn't it -- don't you represent to us now that there is no more overcrowding?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3944.9,3956.461,We have explained to the Court that we have been able to comply with the outstanding injunction because the number of pretrial detainees has at present is dramatically lower than it was two years ago.
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3956.461,3959.013,But you're still complaining?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3959.013,3968.747,"We still take the position, the population in the institution at present is fluctuating at or near 449 people the present capacity --"
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3968.747,3970.449,It's designed for 449?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3970.449,3972.95,It's designed for 449.
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4014.83,4020.22,So you would vigorously object any suggestion that this case is moot?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4020.22,4029.89,"Well I don't know, I don't -- we would object to a disposition that involved let's say I dismissal of the writ."
1978.77-1829,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4061.449,4062.439,When it doesn't exist.
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4062.439,4065.335,doesn't exist.
1978.77-1829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4065.335,4078.334,"Do I understand the government concedes or taking no position on the question of a writ of habeas corpus is subject to a class action, not a very important question?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4078.334,4079.905,It may be a very important question.
1978.77-1829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4088.222,4088.652,None here --
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4088.652,4091.94,-- there is none here I am simply --
1978.77-1829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4091.94,4094.346,Don't you think that's an important question in this case?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4094.346,4095.767,I think it's an important question.
1978.77-1829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4110.941,4115.665,"But there's no jurisdiction, it's before the Court whether anyone raised it or not?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4115.665,4126.749,"Well, but there is a distinction between the kind of subject matter jurisdiction in habeas corpus over a claim and the question of whether class action was improperly certified."
1978.77-1829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4127.837,4132.43,"But this one which deserves some exploration, would you not agree?"
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4132.43,4141.55,"Well, we would be prepared if the Court wants us to research the question and submit our views on it."
1978.77-1829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4141.55,4142.852,No we'll pass on that later.
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4149.671,4150.064,Now?
1978.77-1829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4150.064,4153.261,"Yes, you won't be back at 1 o'clock?"
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4153.261,4156.745,"Well, I might if you're asking."
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4161.819,4163.624,Now we're not suggesting that at all.
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4163.624,4164.953,What are you suggesting?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4164.953,4170.406,We are suggesting that we are not requesting relief except as regards --
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4170.406,4174.198,Where do you put – you raised this question in your petition?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4174.198,4174.988,We have raised in our petition.
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4174.988,4177.656,And you've briefed it?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4177.656,4186.038,"Well, the way we've – at the time that we brief that the policy had already been changed and our briefing was intended to focus."
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4186.038,4190.569,So does that mean that the issue has become moot since the filing the petition for certiorari?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4190.569,4199.959,"Well, I think if the hardcover books were not involved, and the injunction had been issued only against soft cover books then I think they should be moot."
1978.77-1829,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4202.127,4208.968,And the injunction would then be vacated to that extent?
1978.77-1829,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4208.968,4212.637,"I guess, I am not sure that it would draw a matter of something."
1978.77-1829,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4212.637,4213.803,Thank you.
