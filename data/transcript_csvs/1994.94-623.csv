1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,27.529,"We'll hear argument next in Number v. Reaseguros... no, Vimar Seguros Y Reaseguros v. M/V Sky Reefer... the spectators are admonished to remain quiet until you get out of the courtroom."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,59.039,62.481,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-623,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.854,150.36,"Mr. McDermott, is Japan a signatory to the Hague Rule?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,150.36,151.289,"Yes, it is."
1994.94-623,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.289,159.535,And do we know whether Japan's law differs significantly from U.S. law with regard to liability?
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,159.535,171.773,"As... in this case, we believe it does, because we do not believe that the Japanese Hague Rules impose on the vessel owner the nondelegable obligation to load and stow the cargo carefully."
1994.94-623,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,171.773,175.435,But wasn't that issue expressly reserved by the First Circuit?
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,198.931,199.822,No.
1994.94-623,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.583,200.971,Okay.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,218.155,238.868,"Well, the district court would retain jurisdiction of the case, not least because it has in rem jurisdiction over the ship, so there is always the opportunity, after the arbitration in Japan were concluded, to come back to the court here and, for one reason or another, if there had been manifest disregard of the law, for example, to seek vacation of the award."
1994.94-623,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,300.959,305.231,And might be so determined by the arbitrator if it gets to arbitration.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,305.231,306.141,--Yes.
1994.94-623,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,306.141,308.722,"I mean, that's not foreclosed by the reference to arbitration."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,310.483,323.492,"That may be the result, but here, respondents' own expert, a Japanese lawyer, has stated in an affidavit that the Japanese Hague Rules would be applied in this arbitration if conducted in Japan."
1994.94-623,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.492,334.048,"Is it clear that the application of foreign law is prohibited by COGSA, if foreign law is the same as COGSA itself?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,338.943,349.529,"No, we do not have a case where it is identical, but we do have in this case a statute which says that COGSA, this COGSA applies as a matter of law."
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.529,382.751,"Mr. McDermott, isn't it an anomaly that in COGSA we are modeling our domestic law on an international model... the whole purpose of it, wasn't it, of the Hague Rules, was to achieve greater uniformity in these bills of lading... and then to say we, on the substantive side we're trying to get greater uniformity within the international shipping community, and then say, but we don't trust foreign fora?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,382.751,388.337,"It's not so much an issue of trust, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.032,432.325,What's your authority for saying that this would necessarily lessen the liability of a carrier?
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,432.325,436.517,"Well, lessening... lessening has multiple aspects."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.517,438.149,"Well, what's your authority for it?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,440.01,444.741,"Well, first of all the Wesermunde decision in the Eleventh Circuit."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.741,446.404,Any case from this Court?
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,446.404,448.524,"Not from the Supreme Court, no, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,448.524,454.008,"In fact the Bremen v. Zapata case suggests quite a different approach, doesn't it?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,454.008,458.972,"Yes, but only in the context of a freely negotiated--"
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.972,468.329,"Well, a much more tolerant approach to arbitration clauses, and a less distrust of foreign forum and foreign laws."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,468.329,484.219,"--Yes, provided, however, that you do not have what this Court decided in Knott almost 100 years ago, which was an express declaration that foreign law cannot be applied in a case dealing with a bill of lading governed then by the Harter Act."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.219,488.732,"Which talked about relieving, or... was it relieving or lessening?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,488.732,490.402,Relieving in the Harter Act.
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.565,525.244,Is this venue entirely unrelated to the voyage?
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,530.39,536.203,"Yes, but the cargo was lifted in Morocco; it was shipped and discharged in Massachusetts."
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,536.203,541.847,"Would your position be different if the place for arbitration was, say, Morocco?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,541.847,546.689,"Depending upon the law, it would be different."
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,546.689,556.056,"Well, how would it be... let's take... I thought your position was, any place other than the United States is no good."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,556.056,557.095,That is correct.
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,558.207,572.705,"So, then why are you responding differently to Morocco versus Tokyo, or, say, Spain, where the insurer is from, versus the United States?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,572.705,575.807,"Well, I didn't intend to respond differently."
1994.94-623,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,592.55,616.736,"Assuming that lessening can mean something other than the application of a rule which imposes a lower standard of liability, assuming that in your favor, isn't there something a little bit antique about the argument that by having to go to Tokyo or Morocco or what-not, the injured party is being dragged around the world?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,646.954,658.812,"We don't believe so, because the burdens of going half-way around the world, dragging your witnesses half-way around the world, are very formidable and they still remain quite significant."
1994.94-623,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,679.137,683.649,Then why wouldn't you make the same argument if the arbitration was going to be in Los Angeles?
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,685.899,686.771,--We--
1994.94-623,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,686.771,690.873,It would be just as tough for you to go there as it would be to go to Lisbon.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,690.873,698.328,"--No, we don't... arbitration in the United States is materially different from arbitration abroad."
1994.94-623,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,703.371,709.966,"Well, but isn't that... aren't you now talking about substantive rules of arbitration as opposed to the cost of having to go somewhere?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,725.216,737.414,"--Not a gross difference, but there are transaction costs abroad which will inevitably be greater than the cost of presenting a claim here in the United States."
1994.94-623,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,743.977,744.357,Why?
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,750.232,757.837,"Because of the deterrent effect of a foreign arbitration, or a foreign litigation, or any--"
1994.94-623,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,757.837,763.33,"You mean they don't like the law when they get there, but that's... you know, that's an argument, but it's a different argument, isn't it?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,763.33,765.141,--There are... it is a different argument.
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.838,811.693,But these all build from the Indussa case that was in 1967.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,822.299,840.882,"--That is true, but what is also equally provincial, if not more so, what is equally parochial, if not more so, is the insistence of foreign carriers that they be sued only in their home jurisdictions, under color of their laws."
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,848.726,850.216,Like the cruise line in--
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,853.18,865.359,"--Well, Carnival Cruise Lines first of all did not deal with a statute such as COGSA, which governs the substantive rights of the parties to the contract, in this instance to the bill of lading."
1994.94-623,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.359,865.61,Did Congress--
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,871.733,878.548,"Well, that act applied to the measure of damages, and it prohibited any--"
1994.94-623,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.548,880.999,Lessening of that liability.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,880.999,883.651,"--No, their right to a court of competent jurisdiction."
1994.94-623,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,898.861,921.225,"No, no, no, I think it prohibited lessening of a vessel's liability, and the conclusion of the case that making you go to another court did not constitute a lessening of the vessel's liability, which is I think exactly what's going on here, except that it's another State instead of a foreign country, but you have to travel a long way."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,933.614,952.945,"Without, of course, adding to the problem we have here of a provision which would change the law that applies, and which would remove all guarantees that the COGSA, which is the American enactment that requires it be applied to this bill of lading, be enforced."
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,965.393,977.402,"Well, you said that... you had a witness to say that the Japanese law, which is, or at least purports to be modeled on the Hague Rules just like COGSA, you had a witness on your side saying the Japanese law is different."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,981.135,991.33,The Japanese lawyer whose affidavit is in the record simply said that the Japanese Hague Rules would be applied to the arbitration.
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1019.169,1021.201,But no finding was made to that effect.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1021.201,1022.663,"--No, absolutely not."
1994.94-623,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.964,1054.132,"What is your response to the point made in footnote 25 of the respondents' brief, which says the COGSA contains the same kind of an exemption, namely it says that neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from (i) act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods, his agent or representative."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1058.866,1065.03,That deals with the interplay of sections 3 and 4 of COGSA and the Hague Rules.
1994.94-623,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1245.019,1255.205,"Do you say the FAA does not apply to any boilerplate provisions in contracts, only to hammered out, negotiated arbitration provisions?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1255.205,1256.777,"No, that is not our position at all."
1994.94-623,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.777,1260.588,"I thought that's what you just said, that this was not negotiated."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1260.588,1305.448,"That's true, but the FAA applies technically, but in terms of reconciling the two statutes to see whether there is room for COGSA to remove this foreign arbitration clause from the grasp of the FAA, to reverse the analogy which the First Circuit used, which said that the FAA removed the foreign arbitration clause from the grasp of COGSA, you'd have to examine the policies, we believe, in the two statutes, and the policy of informed consent, which has animated most of this Court's decisions concerning arbitration, doesn't exist in a case--"
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.448,1308.37,"Well, but we're not talking about a guilty plea here."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1316.595,1323.2,"--Well, it's not... a bill of lading essentially is not a sophisticated document which informed businessmen enter into."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.2,1326.412,"Oh, I didn't say the bill of lading was a sophisticated document."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1329.473,1343.533,"Well, it's a form bill of lading which is... which the carrier issues at ports around the world to shippers who may or may not be informed of what that bill of lading represents."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1349.217,1362.237,"So then there must be a case-specific inquiry every time there's a bill of lading as to whether the shipper read it or not, or knew of its contents?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1362.237,1362.587,No.
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.587,1364.338,That's a strange doctrine.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1364.338,1366.597,"Well, we're not advocating that doctrine."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.597,1368.009,"Well, what are you advocating?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1368.009,1380.177,"That in terms of reconciling the two statutes COGSA acquires much greater force in weight in a situation where the foreign arbitration clause wasn't negotiated in any sense, and where the--"
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.177,1382.719,You're saying that.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1389.244,1398.899,"--Because in the case of bills of lading, ocean bills of lading governed by COGSA, freedom of contract is not the controlling doctrine."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1425.746,1440.436,"So every time we get a consent agreement to arbitrate under the FAA, we... a court must look at it to make sure that the parties had what you called informed consent that they had read the terms of it?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1440.436,1448.68,--That is not in... it is not our position that that is indispensable to the application of the FAA to a form contract.
1994.94-623,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1461.83,1474.529,"Well, but if... unless we think that holding the arbitration in another country lessens the liability, COGSA just doesn't invalidate, isn't that right?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1474.529,1474.97,That is true.
1994.94-623,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1475.478,1495.683,"So the question is whether the mere location of the arbitration... setting aside any choice of law question to be applied, the mere holding of the arbitration in Japan somehow lessens the liability of the carrier?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1495.683,1496.892,--That's correct.
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1511.182,1532.947,"But why should we take a different view of the bill of lading than, say, for example the contract ticket that the passenger certainly had no say in negotiating, as far as the relevance of this being a one-sided contract, a take-it-or-leave-it contract?"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1532.947,1543.313,We're not suggesting that the FAA is entirely displaced because there was not notice and opportunity to negotiate.
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1609.326,1613.009,"Well, they said we'll assume that arguendo."
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1641.527,1642.759,I don't believe so.
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1660.29,1689.29,"But everything preceding, notwithstanding the arguably tremulous ground on which Indussa and its progeny currently sit, and we had pages referring to Carnival Cruise and to Bremen... isn't the First Circuit saying, we think that the way is paved by Carnival Cruise and Bremen, but even if we're wrong about that--"
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1689.29,1703.678,"--With the proviso of footnote 5, which is on page 10a, in which the First Circuit says, we recognize, however, that absent the FAA, COGSA might operate to nullify foreign arbitration clauses and bills of lading."
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1703.678,1704.379,--Might.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1704.379,1722.371,"Might, certainly, but what the First Circuit was clearly recognizing was that it was only the FAA which salvaged this foreign arbitration clause, and that conflict between the two statutes was, we think, resolved incorrectly, because COGSA is clearly the more specific statute."
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1783.42,1791.625,Does the 1970 change to ratify the convention on enforcement of foreign arbitral awards?
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1791.625,1792.586,"Well, we think not."
1994.94-623,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.375,1829.77,Do you think that that means that an arbitration clause that is null and void under a rule prohibiting arbitration is unaffected by the FAA?
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1832.512,1836.715,"Well, the COGSA is not a statute that is targeted at arbitration."
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1881.355,1883.605,It's not arbitration per se.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1887.128,1894.023,We do not contend that that lessening of liability would be so extreme as to validate the clause.
1994.94-623,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1905.571,1908.222,This must be in the United States.
1994.94-623,0,41750,stanley_mcdermott_iii,,1908.222,1910.072,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.072,1912.113,"Thank you, Mr. McDermott."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1914.096,1924.492,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-623,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.738,1967.392,You mean negotiable in the bills and notes sense--
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1967.392,1967.812,--Yes.
1994.94-623,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.812,1971.212,"--not as a subject of the word ""negotiated""."

1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.098,2106.82,May I ask a hypothetical question?
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2123.764,2127.145,"I believe it would, Your Honor, it would before the arbitrators."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.145,2129.277,"What is left of COGSA, then?"
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2141.814,2149.469,"At some point, Your Honor, I believe you reach a stage of what has been called fundamental unfairness, or is not fundamentally fair."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.469,2149.979,"Well, what's unfair about it?"
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2159.287,2162.709,"Your Honor, if you assume the--"
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.709,2165.02,"Maximum liability, $100 for each ton of goods, or something."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2165.02,2172.216,"--If you assume... Your Honor, if you assume sophisticated traders, and you assume knowledge and negotiation, it is difficult--"
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.216,2185.195,"The whole premise of COGSA is that you don't have time for knowledge and negotiation in advance, because you have these transactions taking place with time considerations and all the rest, and there's some interest in uniformity that COGSA was intended to serve."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2185.195,2195.961,"--Well, Your Honor, there is a great deal of COGSA that does not have to do with the arbitration clause, and does, in the normal course of events, reflecting the Hague Convention, which is what it is--"
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.961,2203.475,"Yes, but under your view, all of that could be agreed to not be followed in a particular shipping situation."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2203.475,2207.389,"--Between sophisticated individuals, Your Honor--"
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.389,2211.893,You assume all people who own... make million dollar purchases of oranges are pretty sophisticated.
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2211.893,2215.445,"--Yes, Your Honor, I believe that is the case."
1994.94-623,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2215.674,2229.534,"Are you saying that every time the arbitration clause also contains a kind of specific choice of law clause, that the arbitration clause carries the choice of law clause with it, as it did in Justice Stevens' example?"
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2229.534,2230.573,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2231.144,2242.331,"Well, when do you get to the point of fundamental unfairness, because you were arguing it was okay in his example, because they had negotiated and accepted it."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2247.456,2272.471,"--Your Honor, I believe you can get to fundamental unfairness in the sense of geography, in the sense of foreign law statutes... for example, if you assume there was a country where we were sending someone to arbitrate and the law in that country provided that anyone awarding a judgment in favor of an American would be disenfranchised, that would be fundamentally unfair."
1994.94-623,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2277.656,2281.978,"Yes, but that would be unfair because in effect there would be no fair arbitral forum."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2297.588,2300.38,And I believe--
1994.94-623,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2300.38,2315.31,"And so I guess what you're saying is, it may get to the point of fundamental unfairness if there's something fundamentally wrong with the arbitration process, but it never gets to the point of fundamental unfairness if it simply substitutes different rules of liability."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2315.31,2316.792,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2316.792,2351.414,"Mr. Walsh, I have some difficulty, frankly, with your approach, and I wonder why we shouldn't just look at COGSA and see what it prohibits and what it doesn't prohibit, and ask whether COGSA prohibits the holding of the arbitration proceeding in Japan, does it lessen the liability of the carrier to have the arbitration held in Japan, without looking at the moment at the choice of law issue."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2351.414,2356.818,"We would submit, Your Honor, that it does not lessen if you reach that issue."
1994.94-623,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2375.818,2394.632,"Well, that was certainly the thrust of Judge Friendly's approach in that Indussa case, but you say that's been somehow changed over the course of the intervening years."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2394.632,2410.153,"I think in large part, Your Honor, it's simply the passage of time and the changes in air fares and transportations and faxes, and things that we deal with in the commercial world, that has resulted in a different attitude, and perhaps that was appropriate then, and perhaps it is not now."
1994.94-623,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2438.129,2443.953,But presumably COGSA was adopted in conformance with the Hague Rules.
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2443.953,2454.442,"--That is true, Your Honor, but we understand that the Japanese Hague Rules, Japanese equivalent, was also done in that fashion."
1994.94-623,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2486.052,2486.603,Suppose--
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2486.603,2487.404,The structure is the same.
1994.94-623,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2487.404,2503.602,"--Suppose the parties agree by a separate bill of lading simply to supersede and ignore the provisions of COGSA, and then that contract is sought to be enforced in a court, in the United States district court."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2511.857,2513.379,"I believe that's true, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2514.9,2550.552,"Well then, under the Federal Arbitration Act, although under section 2, referring to the arbitrability of maritime contracts, the last clause says that you cannot arbitrate... that you must arbitrate save upon such grounds as exists at law and equity for the revocation of any contract, can you argue here that what the petitioners are asserting, that there's grounds to revoke the provision in the bill of lading that superseded COGSA?"
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2555.318,2560.43,"--I believe that was intended, Your Honor, to deal with fraud, duress, and things of that nature."
1994.94-623,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2575.02,2586.126,"Well, but the FAA has a specific exception: save upon such grounds as exist at law or equity for the revocation of any contract, and I assume that would be the revocation of any part of a contract."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2586.126,2589.618,"I would assume that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2589.618,2593.252,"Well, why doesn't that operate to restore COGSA, then?"
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2593.252,2603.297,"I don't... at the moment I can't think of the answer, Your Honor, although I had it earlier."
1994.94-623,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2603.948,2605.2,Then perhaps we should--
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2605.2,2606.25,"--The... excuse me, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2606.25,2610.253,--concentrate on the question that Justice O'Connor asked.
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2660.385,2672.474,"Your Honor, that is correct, it does cost something, but in this case it is not as if your entire evidence is in the United States."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.269,2699.534,"Yes, but your case would be... your legal position would be exactly the same if nobody ever was within 400,000 miles of Japan."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2705.986,2707.749,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.749,2713.753,Some of whom might not really want to go to Tokyo to testify for 15 minutes in some kind of an arbitration.
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2713.753,2719.076,"That is true, Your Honor, and they might decide not to go, and there might be a change in the agreement at that point."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.076,2729.403,"So it may well be, as a practical matter, much more difficult to prove the liability if you have to go 10,000 miles to a distant forum than if you do it right where everybody's right at home."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2729.403,2736.126,I cannot quickly tell you whether it's further from Morocco to Tokyo than Morocco to New York.
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2736.126,2738.997,"No, I'm just assuming... my hypothetical is everybody lives in--"
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2738.997,2739.258,No--
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.258,2740.85,--in Boston in my case.
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2740.85,2743.422,"--If everyone lives in Boston, Your Honor, no one will want to travel."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.422,2746.113,"Yes, and they still, under your view they still--"
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2754.248,2755.69,"That's true, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.69,2759.572,"I know you will argue it's not different because of the international convention, but I don't think that's essential to your position."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2759.572,2768.227,"No, and I think it's important to keep in mind, Your Honor, that what we're talking about is arbitration, a totally different vehicle than litigation."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2799.128,2814.758,"But I'm not sure how you get around Justice Kennedy's concern that the COGSA says, in so many words, if you have different terms in a bill of lading than those the statute requires, that bill of lading is null and void, and you're saying well, we can write a different bill of lading as long as we have an arbitration clause."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2815.758,2822.903,"My belief is that there's nothing in COGSA, Your Honor, which says I cannot put an arbitration clause in a bill of lading."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2841.966,2842.466,--But you'd also say--
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2842.466,2843.658,--and also say it's greater or lesser.
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.658,2846.91,"--that applying a different nation's law does not lessen liability, either."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2850.151,2851.081,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2858.227,2870.595,"But you could lose on that point entirely, and still you would maintain... I assume you would maintain the position that the mere existence of the arbitration clause is not what the statute means by lessening liability."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2870.595,2872.435,"That is correct, Your Honor, absolutely."
1994.94-623,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2872.435,2872.695,Okay.
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2887.706,2893.62,"the lower court, my recollection is, Your Honor, simply said that issue's not before us."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.62,2906.57,"Yes, but by doing that it said we can assume arguendo that it's different, and we still will require arbitration, and if your position depends on them being the same, then there is not a necessary finding that they are the same."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2906.57,2909.441,Our position does not depend on it being the same.
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.441,2915.024,"You're... and under the court of appeals rationale, you're entitled to win, even if they're different."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2915.024,2915.825,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2915.825,2917.505,"Because they said, we don't have to decide it."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2917.505,2917.886,Yes.
1994.94-623,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.886,2933.387,"But you're making the argument here that you're a fortiori entitled to win if they are the same, and in order to sustain that argument, we have to make a finding about whether they're different or the same, which hasn't been made."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2933.387,2935.357,"Correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2935.357,2958.601,"And I guess... am I correct that what the court of appeals was ultimately assuming was that the question of their resemblance would be decided in the first instance by the arbitrator, the district court would retain jurisdiction, and subject to whatever rules for review of arbitration might exist, the issue could ultimately come back to the district court."
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2958.601,2960.063,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2960.833,2963.254,"It simply would be resolved by arbitration in the first instance, is that--"
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2963.254,2963.624,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-623,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2963.624,2964.195,--what was assumed?
1994.94-623,1,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2964.195,2969.929,And the district court here with the security posted retains jurisdiction until this matter is finally ended.
1994.94-623,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2994.696,2995.815,Very well.
