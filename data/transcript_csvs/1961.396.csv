1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.175,157.534,You say this is not annual.
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,158.582,160.159,"That's correct, sir."
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,161.406,163.031,Two every three years or so?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,163.031,164.722,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."

1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,231.138,233.197,"No, Mr. Justice Harlan, they do not."

1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,234.378,236.062,They do not get a check for anything.

1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,265.455,266.351,That is correct --
1961.396,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,266.351,266.59,(Inaudible)
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,266.59,267.283,Mr. Justice --
1961.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,267.886,269.958,"Well, how was the amount identified?"
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,269.958,279.815,"Well, the record indicates that the total convention cost as computed by Southland accountants was figured and then just divided, I assume, by the number of people in attendance."
1961.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,279.815,284.603,And was each one in attendance apprised to what his portion shared to (Voice Overlap)?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,284.603,285.934,"No, sir, he was not."
1961.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,285.934,287.633,"Well, how did this issue get up this way?"
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,287.633,302.938,"Well, this was -- when the Government raised the issue as to what was taxable to the petitioners and an investigation was made, it was determined that this would be the appropriate amount that this was the total cost to the convention divided by the number of people in there."
1961.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,302.938,304.986,And the taxpayer has not included this?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,304.986,306.231,"No, sir, he had not included it in his --"
1961.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,306.231,307.97,And about the deficiency assessment?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,307.97,309.465,A deficiency was assessed.
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,309.465,315.597,"The total was added to his appropriate need to be recorded, to be --"
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,315.597,315.717,Yes --
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,315.717,315.812,-- a filed income?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,315.812,317.709,Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,320.95,322.394,Was that an issue of income?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,322.394,322.982,"Yes, sir."
1961.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,322.982,330.052,"And now, this, as I understand it, is the proportion of share, the total expense, transportation, room, meals --"
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,330.052,330.825,That's correct Mr. Justice --
1961.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,330.825,331.189,-- all of the rest.
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,331.189,331.769,-- Brennan.
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,331.769,331.917,And you say --
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,331.917,332.181,Of it --
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,332.181,334.282,"-- proportionate, what does that mean?"
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,334.282,339.589,"Well, I assume, it's -- I would use the term ""allocable"" that the total cost were divided by the number of people in attendance."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,339.589,340.558,"Oh, oh, yes."
1961.396,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,341.143,344.47,How do you say they qualified to attend the --
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,344.47,351.569,They had to meet a standard of having sold a prescribed minimum amount of insurance in the preceding year.
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,357.138,397.276,"But when you get it around to it just both you and Mr. Jones would point out the difference of -- the analogy between something that happened to me before I came down and dispose namely, once a year there's a meeting of the Association of American Law Students, each law students sends the delegation of law professors to meetings and that was -- the expenditure was covered by the law -- this was (Inaudible) -- I don't know what happens now, was covered by the law schools, somebody, I think I'm not sure; my recollection is poor."
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,414.842,420.361,"Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I hope to touch on that point expressly by an analogy."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,433.327,454.319,"But the Government's position is that it is arguable that in going to those Christmas time meetings, the cost of going there, the railroad expenses in those days, by hotel rooms, etcetera was part of my income."
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,454.319,455.89,"Well, I cannot speak for --"
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,455.89,456.112,"No, no."
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,456.155,457.629,"-- Government counsel, Mr. Justice."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,457.629,459.095,-- but that's my --
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,459.095,461.639,I would say that the situation is analogous.
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,461.963,464.867,Alright.
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,464.867,475.287,"After the formal business program, everyone attended a luncheon at which Dr. Norman Vincent Peale gave an address on the subject of success through right speaking."
1961.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,559.34,559.957,May I interrupt you?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,559.957,560.577,"Yes, sir."
1961.396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,560.577,569.251,Is your position one that it's not includable in gross income or if it is that it's deductible also as an expense or it washes out?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,569.251,573.543,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan that is."
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,766.059,771.466,Aren't you talking about -- which fraction of this case you're talking about?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,775.503,775.611,Yes.
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,775.611,782.822,"If you're talking about the deductibility of these expenses by the taxpayers that is the purpose of the taxpayers to which you look, is it not?"
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,782.822,784.306,"Well, yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,784.306,785.743,Rather than the purpose of the company?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,785.743,786.518,That is correct.
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,797.975,812.146,"Well, it would seem to me, and you tell me if I'm wrong and if so why, that when you're talking about whether or not this is income to the taxpayer, then the purpose of the company becomes a dominant relevance."
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,822.969,830.611,"Mr. Justice Stewart, that's correct that the purpose of the taxpayers on the expense side of the case is the ultimate question."
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,839.718,839.738,No --
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,839.738,844.438,-- this wasn't an independent pleasure joint which they took of their own volition.
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,845.666,845.674,"Well, that --"
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,845.674,846.109,-- in response to --
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.109,847.812,-- that's kind of begging the question here.
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,853.916,853.925,Yes.
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,853.925,855.157,-- in determining whether or not this is a --
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,855.157,855.294,Yes.
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.294,857.37,"-- business expense to the taxpayers, isn't that true?"
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,869.33,869.855,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,869.855,872.11,Not my purpose in going with him?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,872.11,872.759,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,872.759,877.501,He takes me to lunch to sell me insurance then it's perhaps deductible.
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,877.501,878.519,"I agree, Your Honor."
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,898.996,900.616,Aren't you -- the deductibility of --
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,900.616,901.048,"Yes, yes, Your Honor."
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,901.048,904.399,-- the lunch and the bill from his income.
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,904.399,907.051,"Well, also if you were charged with income by virtue of --"
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,907.051,912.076,"Now, are you getting in the third -- that's a third, that's a question not involved here I take it to be."
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,912.076,913.231,Well --
1961.396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,913.231,915.813,He's not my employer.
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,915.813,919.717,Yes.
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,930.344,932.539,May I ask you?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,940.485,941.919,"Yes, yes, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,941.919,953.99,Is the relation of the expenditure of the convention purposes to the employer unrelated with the problem before us?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,972.217,973.525,"No, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,999.369,999.761,But then --
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,999.761,1000.783,-- is directly relevant.
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1000.783,1025.559,"-- in the case of an employer, of a potential insured, sending an employee of his to talk with a fire insurance agent and you're going up -- to go with him at lunch for which the agent pays, the relation of that to his employers' activity is relevant, isn't it?"
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1025.559,1028.176,"Very definite sir, extremely so."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1094.078,1099.438,"But there's another gain, he stayed at home, he would've had to pay for his own meal and board."
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1099.438,1101.282,"I think that's true, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1161.443,1165.055,Is there a statutory definition of gross income?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1165.055,1166.065,"No, there's not."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1167.644,1170.001,Gross income is whatever gross income is --
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1170.001,1170.398,"Yes, sir."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1170.398,1172.5,-- need to be.
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1172.5,1187.576,"Now, we believe that this rational and the law of governing the hypothesis which I posed is entirely consistent with the Court's decision in Commissioner versus Smith that compensation in whatever form constitutes income."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1478.574,1482.687,He could suggest that he doesn't want to go on a joy ride?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1482.687,1486.348,"Yes, he certainly could, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1961.396,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1520.273,1524.035,Did some of the employees not attending?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1524.035,1524.69,Yes.
1961.396,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1524.69,1526.358,Does the record show?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1526.358,1527.162,Yes.
1961.396,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1527.162,1529.084,How many couples?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1529.084,1534.983,"Out of approximately 300 agents, 102 attended the convention Mr. Justice Harlan."
1961.396,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1534.983,1538.43,How many were invited there?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1538.43,1542.643,I think that there were few more who were invited and actually attended.
1961.396,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1542.643,1546.377,That depends largely on the amount of insurance they've written the year before?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1546.377,1548.093,"Yes, it does."
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1578.354,1599.049,"But why doesn't -- why doesn't it, the mode of selection show that it is -- becomes of function of reward rather than a compulsion of duty or a manifestation of requirement."
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1599.049,1600.85,"Well, we think that that --"
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1600.85,1605.884,"If it's related to how much insurance you'd written and you therefore say, ""You're a good boy."
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1608.528,1611.941,"Well, it's not as simple as that Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1961.396,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1682.145,1684.06,How many were eligible?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1684.06,1685.135,300.
1961.396,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1685.135,1688.556,Out of the eligible --

1961.396,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1688.697,1691.107,-- they happen to receive the invitation or --

1961.396,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1693.087,1693.484,What I wanted --

1961.396,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1693.526,1701.296,-- to find out is how much were eligible and how many actually were invited?
1961.396,0,39271,richard_a_freling,,1701.296,1710.426,The record indicates that there were 102 agents eligible in all but 10 or 15 attended the convention.
1961.396,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1714.965,1716.068,You may.
1961.396,1,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1723.254,1727.811,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1820.24,1823.061,"Well there wouldn't be any income in that case, would there?"
1961.396,1,31119,john_b_jones_jr,,1823.061,1824.036,"Well I used the word ""quibble."""
