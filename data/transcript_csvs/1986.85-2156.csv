1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.24,"We will hear argument first this morning in Number 85-2156, Shaare Tefila Congregation versus John William Cobb."
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,13.573,18.556,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-2156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,194.52,197.361,May I ask you a question about your last comment?
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,205.197,212.361,"--I believe that they did, under the common understanding of the word ""race"" at that time."
1986.85-2156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,237.088,238.581,Maybe it should.
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,251.277,255.451,--We believe that they did use that term at that--
1986.85-2156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,255.451,257.071,But you don't rely on that fact?
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,257.071,261.705,--We don't believe that that really adds to the argument that we are making.
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.746,328.799,"Ms. Brannan, the word ""discrimination"", of course, connotes treating some people differently than others, and your idea is that the statute covers any instance in which, say, a Frenchman treats a German differently than he would another Frenchman, if they are all in this country?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,328.799,330.489,"--No, Justice Rehnquist."
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.006,349.933,"Well, then how does one know whether a decision by someone of French extraction to treat someone of German extraction differently than he would treat other people, is racially motivated?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,349.933,355.006,We think that that is a question for the finder of fact as it would be in any--
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.006,358.92,"Well, what should the judge charge the jury?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,358.92,377.56,"--The judge should charge the jury that the standard is racial motivation, and that that can be evidenced by statements and admissions of the defendants, by any, for instance, expert opinion as we put in, in this case, that indeed this very conduct and these very symbols--"
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.56,387.067,"And if someone of French extraction then thought that the person of German extraction was of a different race, that would be sufficient?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,387.067,392.309,"--Yes, it would, if it can be established... and the plaintiff, of course, has the burden of proof."
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,392.309,397.956,"But only that this person-thought that, not that it is a fact?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,397.956,399.164,That's exactly right.
1986.85-2156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.335,413.914,"But If you had discrimination of the same sort by a Frenchman against a German, just because he doesn't like Germans, they have been engaged in too many wars and that other Frenchman acknowledges that they are not different races, then it wouldn't be actionable?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,413.914,419.667,"--Unless the plaintiff could prove, of course, that that statement was false or that acknowledgment was false."
1986.85-2156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.164,449.797,"Why isn't it enough that he is discriminating against Germans, and Germans are a race under the statute?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,449.797,451.229,--Well--
1986.85-2156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.229,467.409,"He is discriminating against Germans as Germans, not because he thinks Germans are a different race but because he thinks Germans are Germans, and under the statute as it was enacted at the time, it was agreed that Germans were a distinct race."
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,467.409,468.969,--That is--
1986.85-2156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.969,470.08,Why wouldn't that come within the statute?
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,470.08,482.679,"--That is another way of approaching the issue that we think is very fair in light of the legislative history, and indeed, would lead to a reversal at this case and an affirmance in the St. Francis College case as well."
1986.85-2156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.679,496.778,"It would make a lot more sense... given two instances of discrimination against the German, you would want us to find one actionable and the other one not actionable simply because of the two people is foolish enough to think that Germans are a separate race and the other one isn't?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,496.778,510.038,"The only difficulty, as we have argued in our briefs, is that at all costs we would want the courts to avoid is the issue of defining race in order to determine coverage."
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,536.405,540.747,"Well, unless that's what Congress intended to be determined in a case like this."
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,540.747,553.276,"And we believe, Justice Rehnquist, that the legislative history demonstrates it's not at all what they intended, and that in fact this Court's analysis of that history in the McDonald case makes that very clear."
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,553.276,565.834,"What if I take a dislike to people with brown eyes, and I say that I'm just not going to deal with people with brown eyes the same way I'm going to deal with people with blue eyes."
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,571.408,577.631,"Well, the answer is, of course, unless it's racially motivated in our society."
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,577.631,580.962,"Well, could that be racially motivated?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,580.962,590.609,"It could be if there were facts to show that historically, or in our society, and in the eyes of the discriminators, was a racial distinction, and the hypothetical--"
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,590.609,592.85,How is the judge going to charge the jury?
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,602.908,628.564,"--The charge should be whether it is conduct that we understand as racial, as based on that person and their heritage and background and what they are in unchangeable ways, unlike, for instance religion, and that that should be backed up in the evidence and the plaintiff has the burden to show that it ties in historically or culturally with an understanding that is racial."
1986.85-2156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.831,638.181,But it has to have a historical background.
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,644.345,645.646,Not necessarily.
1986.85-2156,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,666.269,677.477,"Ms. Brannan, are you asking us, in effect, to equate race with national origin discrimination?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,679.638,681.608,We are not.
1986.85-2156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.364,715.472,"So long as they are intelligent enough to know that they are not a distinct racial group, it would be okay; they could paint the same things on the synagogue so long as they know that the Jews are not a separate race?"
1986.85-2156,0,37733,patricia_a_brannan,,715.472,717.134,"--In this case, Justice Scalia--"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,1800.415,1804.548,"Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court:"
1986.85-2156,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.898,1885.092,"Ms. Garren, there is some evidence in the legislative history, of course, that Congress had in mind treating race to cover such things as Gypsies and Chinese and Germans and so forth, is there not?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,1885.092,1888.204,There are some general references by some of the legislators and the--
1986.85-2156,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1888.204,1896.409,"President Johnson vetoed the statute because he thought it was unwise to sweep in Chinese and Gypsies, didn't he?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,1896.409,1898.629,"--Yes, ma'am."
1986.85-2156,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.629,1917.693,"So, there is some legislative history to support the approach that Congress, at least, in enacting Section 1982, may have intended to cover discrimination on the basis of a different version of what constitutes race than we would have today?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,1917.693,1927.698,I think there is no evidence in the legislative history that Congress intended to define the coverage of the statute wholly by reference to intent.
1986.85-2156,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.537,1952.555,"That may be true, but how about the argument that apparently is going to be made in the companion case, rather than here, that indeed the statute does cover discrimination against Jews because they are Jews?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,1952.555,1968.955,"I would say, Justice O'Connor, that in this case the petitioners have always very carefully not argued that Jewish people have any sort of racial identity or even are commonly identified by society as racially distinct."
1986.85-2156,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1988.139,1996.513,"Well, it would be appropriate, though, to look to the legislative history to determine what it is that Congress had in mind in passing this statute?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,1996.513,2013.023,"--Yes, ma'am, and that is what you all have done in determining that the statute is limited to rights which are racial in character and addresses an effort to achieve racial equality, with reference to people who are members of specific groups, I think."
1986.85-2156,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.675,2064.077,This Court has brought whites within the protection of the Act in McDonald.
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2064.077,2064.788,"--Yes, ma'am."
1986.85-2156,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2066.218,2068.371,It is unlawful to discriminate against white people.
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2071.681,2082.86,"Jewish people would have a cause of action based on discrimination because they are white, if that was their contention, but that is not their contention in this case."
1986.85-2156,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2095.367,2112.129,"Mrs. Garren, the problem we have in the United States... when I say a problem, it's perhaps a great asset of our country... is that we have so many different races that over a period of many years that there have been a great many intermarriages."
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2131.181,2131.662,I understand.
1986.85-2156,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2131.662,2133.485,You can cite any number of examples like that.
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2137.175,2148.074,"Your Honor, I am not attempting to suggest that the Court define scientific categories of race, as has been suggested by the petitioners."
1986.85-2156,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2169.118,2170.848,That is matter of perception?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2170.848,2179.704,It is a perception only of an individual's membership in a group that is commonly identified as non-white.
1986.85-2156,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2186.69,2191.331,Does that bring you close to the position of your opposition here today?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2191.331,2202.628,"No, I think it does not, because the petitioner argues that the perceptions of the discriminator, without reference to groups, are determinative."
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2253.522,2262.699,"Where do you want to go to find this, it read it, if you are part Scandinavian, part Indian, part South African, part Japanese?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2266.061,2269.643,"Again, Your Honor, I am not saying that anyone has to make that determination."
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.476,2277.948,--White or non-white?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2277.948,2278.909,Pardon me.
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.909,2282.082,You said you have to find out whether you are white or non-white?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2282.082,2286.926,"No, sir, I did not say that."
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2286.926,2287.765,What did you say?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2287.765,2301.315,"I said that an individual could obtain the coverage of the statute if he was discriminated against because he is identified as non-white, or as a member of a group that is commonly identified as non-white."
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2301.315,2303.425,How did he become identified as a non-white person?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2303.425,2316.114,"Well, I think one obvious way in which he would be identified as a non-white person would be by reference to immutable physical characteristics such as skin color, which we traditionally understand--"
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2316.114,2319.106,I would like to have seen you identify my father.
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2326.18,2330.504,"--In that case, sir, I don't think he would have a cause of action for race discrimination."
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2330.504,2332.314,"Oh, but he did."
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2346.616,2352.887,Sammy Davis might certainly have a cause of action for race discrimination.
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.31,2364.676,"The people that committed this act knew exactly what they were doing and they knew exactly who they were aiming at, didn't they?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2364.676,2369.6,"Your Honor, I understand that this was an egregious wrong."
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.6,2371.661,And should be punished.
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2371.661,2373.193,It's one that cries out for a remedy.
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2376.944,2377.535,What?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2377.535,2385.081,"Mr. Rehmer was convicted of malicious destruction of property and was sentenced to three years, the maximum sentence for that offense."
1986.85-2156,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2426.937,2430.278,"Ms. Garren, there is such a thing as an Ethiopian Jew, isn't there?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2430.278,2431.64,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-2156,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2431.64,2435.524,Suppose this synagogue had been one for Ethiopian Jews?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2435.524,2438.345,"That might be a different case, Your Honor."
1986.85-2156,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2451.933,2453.893,"Black, not Jewish, then?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2453.893,2455.155,That's correct.
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.659,2461.639,"Well, if they are black and Jewish?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2461.639,2466.692,I think they have a cause of action because they are black.
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.692,2469.134,But not because they are Jewish?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2469.134,2470.666,As indicated--
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2470.666,2475.949,If they painted swastikas they wouldn't have a cause of action because they are Jewish?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2475.949,2479.012,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-2156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.012,2482.244,You have to take that position.
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2482.244,2483.783,"In order to take that position, you would have to."
1986.85-2156,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2539.98,2547.796,"Are you taking the position, however, that the statute is applicable only to blacks?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2547.796,2550.637,"No, sir, I am not."
1986.85-2156,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2550.637,2556.472,"So, if it were the yellow... they were Chinese you would say the statute is applicable?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2556.472,2558.192,That is correct.
1986.85-2156,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2560.495,2566.767,"And yet, when the statute was enacted, the concern was with the freed men, was it not?"
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2566.767,2577.566,"--Well, if one looks to the actual concern of the legislators in passing this statute, I think one would have to realize that it was passed in an effort to protect and extend the rights of the newly freed slaves."
1986.85-2156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2617.04,2623.455,"May I ask, Ms. Garren, over the... years ago, and of course it's still prevalent in some areas, there was prejudice against Jews."
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2628.457,2629.969,"Your Honor, I would--"
1986.85-2156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.969,2631.96,You wouldn't call it racial prejudice?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2631.96,2634.153,--Prejudice that is based on their religion.
1986.85-2156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.153,2635.843,Do you think it was based entirely on their religion?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2635.843,2637.554,That is the characteristic that defines them.
1986.85-2156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2643.307,2648.994,Do you think that would be the proper characterization in Germany when it was so virulent?

1986.85-2156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.53,2666.094,Do you think the origin of the prejudice in this country was entirely religious?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2666.094,2671.807,Of the prejudice against Jewish people?
1986.85-2156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.807,2672.197,Yes.

1986.85-2156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.082,2741.453,Why?
1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,2741.453,2741.993,I don't think I do.
1986.85-2156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.84,2757.803,Modern perceptions is what you want us to use?

1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,3124.033,3124.383,That's correct.

1986.85-2156,1,20874,deborah_t_garren,,3402.576,3410.721,That is why I would take the position that it isn't appropriate to define races by reference to any kind of scientific terminology.
1986.85-2156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3412.233,3413.472,"Well, how do you define race, then?"
