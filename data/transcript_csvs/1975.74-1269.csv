1975.74-1269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,221.915,222.892,For non-uniform personnel?
1975.74-1269,0,38349,patrick_a_sweeney,,222.892,223.495,"Yes, it does."

1975.74-1269,0,38349,patrick_a_sweeney,,238.81,240.897,Just in Suffolk County.
1975.74-1269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.897,246.177,"Well, how -- the incorporate cities are not regard as being part of Suffolk County?"

1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1095.088,1104.628,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the members of the Court.
1975.74-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1202.021,1205.698,Do you think the policemen are to be required to wear uniform while on duty?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1205.698,1206.845,Yes sir.
1975.74-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1206.845,1212.733,Do you think all citizens of Suffolk County could be required to wear uniforms while in public?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1212.733,1213.714,No.
1975.74-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.714,1220.315,Then surely there are differences where the state may demand more of a member of the police force and of an individual citizen?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1220.315,1225.255,"Yes sir, as an employee if there is an compelling state interest of course."
1975.74-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.255,1233.11,Why do we get a compelling state interest standard when we are talking about what regulations the state can impose on an employee?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1233.11,1244.659,"Because there are certain needs the state has which supersedes the needs of an individual, and therefore, the burden is placed upon the state to prove that need, the right to wear a uniform."
1975.74-1269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1247.721,1249.513,But why a compelling state interest?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1259.734,1261.648,"Well, we are taking away someoneâ€™s rights."
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1279.864,1284.363,What about the right to have a pressed uniform?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1292.409,1295.279,"I think they may be compelling state interest, yes."
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1296.87,1299.275,But why do you have to have shiny shoes?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1302.138,1303.401,"Maybe, not appearance."
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1304.101,1306.144,"Well, what -- in hair appearance?"
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1306.144,1307.359,It is more than that.
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1307.87,1309.222,(Voice Overlap) hair appearance?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1309.222,1311.112,"Yes, it is appearance sir, but I think --"
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1311.112,1312.994,Shinningshoes is an appearance?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1312.994,1314.759,Yes.
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1317.219,1319.778,(Inaudible) one end to another?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1319.778,1326.88,Yes [Laughter] and I do not mean by that alone.
1975.74-1269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1369.322,1375.652,But no one has argued that policemen and soldiers are exactly alike?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1375.652,1378.346,That -- the argument has been up until Dwen --
1975.74-1269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1378.346,1379.318,Exactly alike?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1379.318,1380.074,"No, quasi."
1975.74-1269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1380.074,1382.92,Quasi.(voice Overlap) alike --
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1382.92,1385.223,I want to establish they are not.
1975.74-1269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1385.223,1386.442,They are not anything alike?
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1386.442,1388.337,No.
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1400.843,1405.66,"If the police cannot maintain order in the town, who do you send in?"
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1405.66,1407.768,I think the police can maintain order in the town.
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1407.768,1414.428,"I said if they find an area where they cannot, who do they send in, the militia, do they not?"
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1414.428,1415.437,Yes sir.
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1415.437,1425.655,"So, why would they send the military in to do with civilian job if the police have civilian job?"
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1425.655,1429.164,That is -- it has gone beyond the police authority.
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1429.164,1430.057,That is right.
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1432.544,1434.981,"No, I do not think so."
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1437.606,1441.926,"Well, if you have a school strike, you do not send in the military to teach school, do you?"
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1441.926,1442.761,No.
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1442.761,1450.282,"And if you have a strike in some other department, any other department of the government, you do not send police -- the military in for that do you?"
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1450.282,1453.086,"Yes, you do in the postal strike, you send the policeman in."
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1453.086,1458.126,"To move the mail not to do the postal work, not to sort the mail?"
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1458.126,1462.719,"Sir, I thought that was the job that the postal to move the mail."
1975.74-1269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1462.719,1475.222,"The State Postal service, well I do not know anything about anystate postal service,I am taking about the state, the only department that is to supplant by the military is the police department."
1975.74-1269,1,35244,leonard_d_wexler,,1475.222,1476.765,I beg to defer sir.
1975.74-1269,2,38349,patrick_a_sweeney,,2028.898,2035.31,Just briefly.
