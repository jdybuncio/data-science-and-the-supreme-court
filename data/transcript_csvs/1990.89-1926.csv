1990.89-1926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,23.756,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1926, United States v. Centennial Savings Bank."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,37.827,38.228,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.813,159.236,"How do you feel about this one, Mr. Roberts?"
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,159.236,166.5,"This one comes out the same way as the Cottage Savings case, Your Honor."
1990.89-1926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.113,171.843,You're sure there's not a material difference between the two?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,171.843,174.945,--There's not a material difference in the two cases on this issue.
1990.89-1926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.612,339.972,Um-hum.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,368.633,370.734,The label you put on it would not make a difference.
1990.89-1926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.372,401.003,Um-hum.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,401.003,414.522,"In the case that you pose, and in this case, there are two obligations: your obligation to pay back the $1,000, and my obligation which we agreed to prior to the transaction to pay $200 if I want the money back early."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,466.816,468.819,"Mr. Roberts, can I just ask you a question there?"
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,482.917,484.236,"--I think not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.502,496.164,That's not what... do any of the instruments in the record say that?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,505.43,526.084,"My understanding... the current, the 1981 Federal regulation provided that if you had a certificate of deposit for more... the term of which was more than 3 months, and you withdrew the amount prior to the expiration of 3 months, you would forfeit not just the interest that had been earned, but all the interest that could have been earned."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.084,527.736,"Well, that's right, but you still get your principal back."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,531.229,531.549,"Well, you wouldn't--"
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.549,532.879,--you get less than the principal.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,532.879,538.994,"--I... well, the fact of the matter is you would forfeit all the interest that would be earned for 3 months."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.994,539.564,Correct.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,539.564,542.817,If you withdrew that after 2 days you wouldn't have any of that interest yet.
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.817,547.328,You'd get... but you'd forfeit then the interest that would have been earned during the period that you held the certificate.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,547.328,547.848,Yes.
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.96,552.651,Well--
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,552.651,560.898,"Well, here, if you deposited $1,000 for 3 months, and over that time it's going to earn $30 in interest."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.683,571.434,--I don't read it that way.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,573.636,581.282,"Well, that's what's provided in the 1981 regulation, which sets that as the minimum penalty."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,581.282,582.872,Where is that regulation in the record?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,582.872,585.864,It's in the record.
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.319,661.873,This is... you concede this is a qualified business indebtedness--
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,661.873,663.055,Yes.
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.055,664.396,--within the 108?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,664.396,666.607,Within the 108 as it stood at the time.
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.207,683.567,"But to be a qualified business indebtedness, the taxpayer has to make an election--"
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,683.567,684.479,Yes.
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.479,686.9,--under this paragraph with respect to the indebtedness?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,686.9,687.49,Yes.
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,687.49,690.383,"Now, we're talking about the debtor here, the bank."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,690.383,692.223,Yes.
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.223,694.805,What election did it make?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,694.805,697.306,It made an election when it--
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.41,697.306,It didn't have any election to make.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,703.2,705.023,--It had no choice in the transaction.
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.023,705.443,Exactly.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,706.212,710.195,The election refers to when you are filling out your tax returns at the end of next year.
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,715.477,715.978,I see.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,715.978,720.252,--elect to reduce the basis of depreciated property that you have.
1990.89-1926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.802,723.863,"I thought that was an easy way out, but it isn't."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,725.215,732.719,--It points out a further incongruity in the decision of the court below.
1990.89-1926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.913,810.891,"Would you describe for me... you say ""but for"" is not enough causation to say that it's a... it's by reason of the discharge of the indebtedness."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,818.057,824.529,"--It has to be the reason, as the statute says, and the reason means the source."
1990.89-1926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.378,866.968,--What if it isn't a Federal regulation?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,875.542,879.036,That would not be income by reason of the discharge of indebtedness.
1990.89-1926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.086,911.618,--Why does that make any sense?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.217,929.559,It's not the same deal.
1990.89-1926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.847,944.719,"Well, there's one obligation until we make an agreement."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,960.688,965.603,Well... but the agreement will be your forgiving me part of the debt that I owe you.
1990.89-1926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,981.031,988.188,Would it make any difference in your analysis if the penalty had not been required by Federal regulation?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.188,989.549,"No, Your Honor, it would not."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.307,1069.82,May I ask you a hypothetical question?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1109.787,1112.629,"Well, I'm not even sure that in that... yes, I think so."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.245,1122.673,"Well, there's a debt."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1132.731,1140.285,"--But there's no forgiveness of the debt if I come in 3 days later and I say our deal for 3 days was that you would give me this much back, and that what I would like."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.285,1140.656,--Yes.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1155.767,1158.016,"Well, but I don't think--"
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.016,1161.99,"And I say it's all in one document, so you don't worry about whether it's two separate obligations or not."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1169.666,1179.872,"--Well, I think the two separate obligation notion is of course stronger in this case because it's set forth in the Federal regulations and in the... in the opinions."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.872,1185.085,"It describes it as a penalty, but it describes economically the same thing I have described to you in one document."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1185.085,1192.461,"But in your... in your case I don't understand that there's... it's as if there are, for 30 days, 30 different deals."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.461,1195.403,"Well, they might be, some of these you forfeit the interest accrued up to the date."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1203.997,1213.895,"I'm just saying that in your case I don't see that there is an ongoing, an entire ongoing obligation."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.534,1215.175,Sure there is.
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1215.175,1222.39,"--For example, if you decide to withdraw it after 3 days you couldn't be said to be forgiving the obligation for the next 27 days."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.39,1224.722,"No, because it's all one obligation."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1228.763,1235.839,"Well, I think it's different in that there are, as I would say, 30 different deals in your case."
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.839,1238.529,"Well, there are under the regulations, too."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1247.345,1247.996,Yeah.
1990.89-1926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1256.141,1263.568,"Well, subject to the right to withdraw upon payment of a penalty, which is the equivalent of an obligation to pay back a little less if they withdraw earlier."
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1267.068,1277.386,"I think that the case where the penalty is set in advance, it's easier in that situation to see why... why are you getting the money."
1990.89-1926,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1297.949,1301.192,So are you saying the discharge of indebtedness must always be something that is renegotiated?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1301.192,1311.678,"It's difficult for me to envision a situation where, if it's all set in advance, that that's not also a separate obligation."
1990.89-1926,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1312.629,1315.16,And the distinction is between the original... an original contract and the novation?
1990.89-1926,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.16,1323.765,"--Well, the novation would be the negotiation to forgive some of the debt, only one obligation, the debtor's, forgive some of that."
1990.89-1926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.279,1360.491,"Very well, Mr. Roberts."
1990.89-1926,1,35734,michael_f_duhl,,1362.084,1364.825,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1926,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1414.797,1429.146,"Well, I take it, or correct me if I'm wrong, that income as defined in section 61 reaches to the full extent of income under the Sixteenth Amendment?"
1990.89-1926,1,35734,michael_f_duhl,,1429.146,1431.347,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1926,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1431.347,1435.24,So then what those cases say is relevant here?
1990.89-1926,1,35734,michael_f_duhl,,1435.24,1440.443,"Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly what we... exactly how we interpret this regulation."
1990.89-1926,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1458.726,1468.102,"And so you're saying that the Government couldn't tax, under its theory couldn't tax this even if it chose to by a specific statutory provision?"
1990.89-1926,1,35734,michael_f_duhl,,1468.102,1473.615,"--I'm not... I think if you were to apply those cases, yes."
1990.89-1926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1603.951,1607.795,"When was the regulation promulgated, Mr. Duhl?"
1990.89-1926,1,35734,michael_f_duhl,,1607.795,1622.334,"The regulation was promulgated in 1935, but there was an earlier regulation that was in existence prior to 1924 that used the same phrase, it used ""essentially different"" instead of ""materially different""."
1990.89-1926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.334,1624.896,And what are the dates of the Weiss and Marr decisions?
1990.89-1926,1,35734,michael_f_duhl,,1624.896,1629.627,Weiss and Marr were... Weiss came down in 1924.
1990.89-1926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1637.524,1644.767,And is it your view that the predecessor of the present regulation was based on Weiss and Marr?
1990.89-1926,1,35734,michael_f_duhl,,1644.767,1645.749,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1990.89-1926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.749,1652.732,And it was then... the regulation... the predecessor was promulgated after those two decisions?
1990.89-1926,1,35734,michael_f_duhl,,1652.732,1656.876,I don't know when the predecessor regulation was promulgated.
1990.89-1926,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3095.667,3096.907,"Very brief, Your Honor."
1990.89-1926,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3152.242,3155.574,"Of course, isn't it also somewhat ludicrous to assume the savings and loan industry didn't suffer all these losses?"
1990.89-1926,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3155.574,3157.307,It certainly suffered the losses.
1990.89-1926,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.217,3204.946,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
