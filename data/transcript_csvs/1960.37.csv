1960.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.727,"Number 37, Frank Wilkinson, Petitioner versus the United States."
1960.37,0,40696,rowland_watts,,19.833,25.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, and may it please the Court."
1960.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,212.265,213.478,Pardon me Mr. Watts.
1960.37,0,40696,rowland_watts,,216.519,220.991,"Oh, it's 156 stamped in the corner."
1960.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,220.991,223.842,Thank you.
1960.37,0,40696,rowland_watts,,223.842,227.603,It's page 2682 of the Committee print.
1960.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,227.603,232.522,Thank you.
1960.37,0,40696,rowland_watts,,232.522,257.69,"Now, there was no suggestion at any time in the testimony of any witness before these particular hearings that Mr. Wilkinson had any knowledge of any of the stated activities for which the subcommittee was authorized to conduct hearings."
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,991.938,995.519,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1167.254,1169.338,Did he give any about Wilkinson?
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,1169.338,1176.298,He -- he did not testify concerning Braden or Wilkinson.
1960.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1190.947,1202.045,"About this other witness, Mr. Maroney, who has taken all over the country to repeat and repeat and repeat again the same testimony that he gave."
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,1202.045,1239.6,"Well, in this particular case, Mr. Fishman testified as to the receipt into the United States, the importation into the United States, through the mails of foreign Communist propaganda directed to the areas, the geographic areas, of the South, so that his testimony had to do with the extent and the general nature of foreign Communist Party propaganda that had been imported into the United States and was destined to the southern -- various southern communities, as part of an --"
1960.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1239.6,1240.286,Was that the fist time he --
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,1240.286,1240.964,-- as part of --
1960.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1240.964,1244.984,Was that the fist time he had testified on that subject?
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,1244.984,1264.78,As far as the South is concerned -- I assume that in his other appearances which I understand he made before this Committee in various parts of the country from newspaper reports that he testified as to the direction of this foreign Communist propaganda into a different geographical areas of the country.
1960.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1264.78,1266.575,"You say, you assume that, you don't know that."
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,1266.575,1267.193,I don't know that.
1960.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1267.411,1268.709,"Well, then let's don't assume it."
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,1268.709,1284.137,"Well, I only assume with the fact that his testimony here related to the importation of materials into the South, and of course, that was the subject matter, the geographical area to which this Committee hearing was limited."
1960.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1284.137,1295.403,"Do you think that gave the Committee any additional information on which to legislate, the fact that he testified to the same thing in different geographical sections of the United States?"
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,1295.403,1309.852,"Well, as far as Mr. Fishman's testimony is concerned, I don't know that -- they may not have had sufficient information or have been able to get sufficient information other than at these hearings in order to --"
1960.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1309.852,1321.307,"That would be -- now, what I was asking was if the -- I understood the argument indeed that the purpose was to inform Congress so it could translate the sections."
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,1326.042,1328.868,"Well I don't know that it is the same thing, Your Honor."
1960.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1544.818,1546.87,What do you mean by omnibus?
1960.37,1,33912,kevin_t_maroney,,1546.87,1566.639,"Well, it's -- it was a bill generally covering of a number of internal security statutes but it covers a variety of different statutes and amendments to statutes, for example, it would amend the Subversive Activities Control Act."
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3433.058,3434.102,Your -- Your Honors.
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3663.944,3667.785,Would you mind summarizing why that's clear?
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3667.785,3667.849,Yes.
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3667.849,3673.191,"I hope this has nothing to do what one may think, one may think as ill of this conduct as --"
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3673.191,3673.314,Right.
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3673.314,3680.593,-- one sometimes think ill of the prosecutors and the criminal courts and the federal courts were asking cumulative witnesses.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3689.616,3710.479,"Why -- what lies in the minds of men in this particular situation, it seems to me, is that a Subcommittee of the -- of the Congress is sent to the South to conduct investigation in three specific areas."
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3734.298,3739.856,But an inquirer doesn't have to tell in advance what he's going to get out of a -- out of a witness.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3739.856,3740.323,"No, he said --"
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3740.323,3743.883,No man in a criminal trial does that or in a civil trial.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3743.883,3744.162,No.
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3749.038,3756.664,How can you tell if he shut off all inquiry and wouldn't answer any questions?
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3756.664,3770.794,The specific question that they wanted to get from him was his activities in organizing a hostile attitude towards the House Committee itself.
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3775.547,3780.258,Is it -- does it appear in the record that that's all they wanted to get out of him.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3780.258,3781.367,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3781.367,3785.289,Well then how can you tell it was?
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3785.289,3798.414,"Because there is nothing in the record, nothing in the hearings to show that he had any knowledge concerning anything else that the Committee was mandated to investigate."
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3798.414,3804.698,"But you don't know that and I don't know that and the record doesn't disclose it, because he shut off all inquiries."
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3812.63,3815.071,Very well.
1960.37,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3815.071,3826.981,"There's -- there is something in the record to show that the Committee had information indicating that he was a member, a fairly active member of Communist Party, apparently on page 158, --"
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3826.981,3827.549,That refers to --
1960.37,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3827.549,3828.419,-- in Los Angeles.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3828.419,3831.703,-- to the testimony given in --
1960.37,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3831.703,3832.201,Los Angeles.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3832.201,3833.661,-- Los Angeles.
1960.37,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3833.661,3833.802,But that --
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3833.802,3842.842,And that was the same hearing which Mr. Wilkinson was subpoenaed to appear and did appear and refused to answer.
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3883.878,3888.292,Would you think that was an illicit forbidden line of inquiry?
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3888.292,3891.405,I -- I do not say that Your Honor.
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3903.521,3904.741,What were those?
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3904.741,3921.314,"They were colonizing an industry in the South, foreign political activity propaganda distribution in the South, and Communist activity in the South."
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3921.314,3939.352,"And you think the letter is not â€“ that the inquiry whether it was a Communist, an organized Communist effort to put the Committee out of business, which I might privately sympathize, is -- excludes an inquiry whether they were engaged in trying to put him out of business?"
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3939.352,3941.686,If --
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3941.686,3944.77,"On the score of remedies, do you think that's excluded as a lawyer?"
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3944.77,3945.352,Yes sir.
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3945.352,3946.707,You do.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3946.707,3946.934,I --
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3946.934,3954.031,I must say you have very strict notions of relevance.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,3954.031,4000.277,"I suggest that the Congress -- that the court below erred in claiming that this was a legitimate area of investigation by the Committee because the Committee had not -- the Congress cannot legislate to force disclosure of motivation, of a person carrying on activity to petition Congress for redress of grievance under the First Amendment, or at least this Court stated and has that it would narrow and to burn lobbying to avoid the constitutional question under the First Amendment upon --"
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4000.277,4003.924,"But that's a very different thing, statutory construction."
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,4020.543,4036.81,I would like to suggest further that among all the multitude in these activities that this Subcommittee was claiming it had the power to investigate in excess of the mandate given it by the Committee itself.
1960.37,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4205.955,4212.06,I'm not quite sure that I understand how broad your argument is in this -- on this aspect of the case.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,4240.016,4258.995,I think that's no immunity for -- from interrogation by the Committee in any other field than what is his motivation in carrying on a campaign against the Committee.
1960.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4300.22,4315.446,"Whether what the Committee is trying to get at -- this Committee is trying to get at is his activity, motivation (Inaudible) some other activity (Inaudible)."
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,4315.446,4317.427,"Perhaps so, but I think --"
1960.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4317.427,4319.012,(Inaudible)
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,4319.012,4319.246,I --
1960.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4319.246,4320.999,(Inaudible)
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,4320.999,4322.768,"I think not, Your Honor."
1960.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4328.426,4337.286,And I'm so (Inaudible)
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,4337.286,4338.999,In our position to the Committee.
1960.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4338.999,4339.802,Yes.
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4339.802,4341.592,"But Mr. Watts, there's very little doubt."
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,4396.047,4399.977,"Not by compulsory process, Your Honor."
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4399.977,4403.393,I can assure you the past is against you.
1960.37,2,40696,rowland_watts,,4403.393,4403.411,Isn't -- isn't the --
1960.37,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4403.411,4406.988,The future may not be but the past is.
1960.37,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4406.988,4421.466,"Is -- isn't the law -- the subtle stated law kind of against it too, If you -- couldn't Congress require the disclosure of paid lobbyist for example?"
