2015.14-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.09,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-1406, Nebraska v. Parker. Mr. Smith."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,8.09,44.69,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For over a century, the following three things have been true in the disputed area. First, the non-Indian population has always been greater than 98 percent. Second, the Tribe never exercised jurisdiction. And third, by contrast, the State of Nebraska has governed the disputed area. The story of the disputed area is that of a land that long ago lost its Indian character, if it ever had any."
2015.14-1406,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,61.485,66.605,"If I understand your position correctly, you're not asking us to overrule Solem?"
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,66.605,67.97,No.
2015.14-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.62,112.82,"From what -- from what you just said and from your brief, I gathered -- perhaps I was wrong -- that you are arguing for a de facto diminishment test; that is, you pointed out the area has been overwhelmingly populated by non-Indians and they -- they -- they haven't attempted before to exercise governing authority."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,112.82,127.55,"Your Honor, we think the de facto diminishment does fit within the third element of the Solem test, which is the subsequent circumstances of -- of after the enactment."
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.65,192.88,"It's a different Congress. I mean, to say, you know, a later Congress did thus and so, and therefore the earlier Congress, when it enacted a particular statute, must have diminished."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,194.86,195.29,It --
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.29,237.44,"And -- and -- and moreover, if -- if the third factor is dispositive, as -- as you assert, you would not -- we would not need the -- the -- the de facto diminishment doctrine whereby, by a sort of, you know, adverse possession, a jurisdiction, whether it's Indians or -- or even a State that used to have a jurisdiction over a particular area has forfeited it by long-, long-accepted usage to the contrary. If -- if that is true and -- and if -- if the third factor is as important as you say, we would not need that doctrine."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,241.29,266.67,"Well, and that would be consistent with the concept that, if a party just -- if they belatedly assert a claim to having sovereign authority over this, as in this case it's over a hundred and some years after the land was open for settlement, that -- there -- at least the Sherrill case, some of the principles in this case would be supportive of de facto diminishment."
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.67,267.19,As far as --
2015.14-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.19,273.355,That case didn't involve the -- the diminishment.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,275.49,277.04,That -- that is true.
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.525,303.37,But that's not what you're arguing here.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,310.215,314.29,We are arguing that it's no longer part of the reservation.
2015.14-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,333.15,339.9,You don't -- the other side says you did not raise a City of Sherrill argument.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,342.55,345.98,We have -- we have --
2015.14-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,345.98,356.355,"A lot of the -- a lot of the arguments you make seem to sound more in a City of Sherrill-type proposition, but you haven't raised that argument, have you?"
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,356.355,379.3,"We, I -- I believe in paragraphs -- or pages 22, I think it's 25 of our brief, we are at least citing Sherrill as -- as precedent for the principle of loss of sovereignty, loss of sovereign control by the fact that the State has long exercised the jurisdiction. But our focus --"
2015.14-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,379.3,381.98,But that's based on what Solem said.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,427.52,429.439,Yes.
2015.14-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,430.9,441.66,And may I -- may I ask a preliminary question? We're talking about a liquor license or alcoholic beverage license and a sales tax on alcoholic beverages.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,450.105,455.005,The State itself does impose liquor license requirements.
2015.14-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,461.99,466.56,This tax was not imposed by the Tribe -- Tribe.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,470.375,484.56,"My recollection was the Interior Department approved the Tribe's request to have such an ordinance, and then -- the Tribe's ordinance then was in -- in effect."
2015.14-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,484.56,488.22,"Without jurisdictions, Tribes can't tax at will."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,491.795,494.04,"Your -- your point would be correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,508.5,530.42,"What -- what else -- what else do you lose if this ruling is against you? We've already circumscribed the powers of the Tribes on their own reservations greatly, so what powers do you lose? You've already ceded to the Federal government criminal prosecution powers."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,536.42,559.12,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I take this -- it would be in the context of what are the justifiable expectations of those who live in the disputed area? What would be significantly disrupted as far as their justifiable expectations? I would start off with the first thing -- principle is just who governs you."
2015.14-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,571.76,581.29,"Mr. Smith, can -- can I take you back to Justice Scalia's question? You know, because usually, at least now, we don't think much of subsequent history of any kind."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,606.41,622.94,"The Court's precedent, I believe, recognizes in the area of land surplus acts that Indian land surplus acts are a unique animal from your normal legislative analysis."
2015.14-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.23,696.76,"When did this diminishment idea as a legal concept -- you said when Congress acted, they weren't thinking in terms of diminishment. When did diminishment become the big question?"
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,696.76,706.5,"Well, it becomes -- it becomes a big question when the issue is is it part of the reservation --"
2015.14-1406,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.5,718.465,But at what point in time? Because you -- I thought you just made this statement that in 1882 Congress wasn't thinking in terms of diminishment.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,718.465,747.89,"It becomes a big issue when the issue is who -- frankly, who has authority to govern? Is this still part of the reservation or not? Does the Tribe have any authority over this area at all? And if it's part of the reservation, it has authority; acknowledged, it is limited authority, but it would have authority over it, because if it's part of the reservation."
2015.14-1406,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,748.41,762.51,"On that question, as a practical matter, if the Tribe were to exercise -- go to the outer limits of its authority, what could it do in the city of Pender besides opposing this liquor tax?"
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,762.51,774.45,"Well, what it can do, it can displace State jurisdiction over environmental regulations that this is a rural farming area."
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.84,812.625,What about municipalities? What about self-governing -- or more or less self-governing municipalities? Are there any of those within this area?
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,812.625,813.18,Yes.
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.21,823.59,What -- would happen to them? Would they continue to -- to exist?
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,823.59,835.65,"They would continue to exist, but you're going to have, what I would say, the ambiguity of the extent of their authority versus the extent of the Tribe's authority."
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.55,862.335,"Why would they continue to exist? I mean, aren't they creatures of the State? Can the State create municipalities on Indian Reservations?"
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,862.335,867.22,I believe -- I believe the State can create the municipalities.
2015.14-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,875.24,875.83,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,890.605,892.53,Not yet.
2015.14-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,895.605,899.13,This Tribe is awfully small.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,920.57,921.87,"Well, I don't think it's --"
2015.14-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,921.87,925.96,"I mean, it's nice to have the power of taxation, but they still need the government's approval."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,925.96,931.13,I don't think it's simply the test of being what -- what will they do.
2015.14-1406,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,935.43,947.65,"Well, the question of the City of Sherrill says if they try to exercise their powers in a way that's harmful to settled expectations, they might have a remedy in law."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,964.245,986.56,"Well, if you say we've introduced a tribe that in theory has authority, but because they've never exercised it, they really have no authority that -- that by itself, I would say, is the inherent ambiguity of what is actually the limits of their authority."
2015.14-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1020.005,1025.195,Does the Tribe exercise authority in the part of the reservation that's not at issue here?
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1025.195,1025.73,Yes.
2015.14-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1075.12,1076.79,In the -- in the western part?
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1076.79,1077.725,In the western part.
2015.14-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1077.725,1079.12,"Well, what about in the eastern part?"
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1079.12,1085.44,"I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. In our -- in the eastern part, the Tribe does have its ordinances."
2015.14-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1134.525,1142.445,"Mr. Smith, I -- I can understand why people might be concerned, for all the reasons that you're talking about."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1202.04,1209.95,"Appreciate that, Your Honor. And -- and yes, the standard diminishment test starts with looking at the Act."
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.255,1324.67,"Counsel, do you agree that City of Sherrill did nothing more than deny particular equitable relief and did not repudiate the proposition of Indian sovereignty over the land in question? Because if you agree with that, then I guess I'm more inclined to give greater weight to the third factor. But if you disagree with it, as I think you ought to, then -- then I don't see why we need the third factor."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1324.67,1332.25,"Well, City of Sherrill, it does have the element of the Tribe trying to unilaterally just --"
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.25,1337.354,"Yes, but it says the Tribe doesn't have sovereignty, is what it says."
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1337.354,1348.09,"It -- well, it says the Tribe doesn't have sovereignty just to buy land back and get back sovereignty that it had long ago lost --"
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.09,1348.64,That's right.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1348.64,1350.79,-- and it applies equitable principles to say you're --
2015.14-1406,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.79,1353.83,To say -- to say that the Tribe does not have sovereignty.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1353.83,1354.765,Yes.
2015.14-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1455.2,1473.01,"Mr. Smith, on the City of Sherrill point, the Chief Justice asked you before do you agree whether this was -- whether this is waived. And you said, well, we cite City of Sherrill on page 25 or something like that. Below, what was the status of the City of Sherrill argument in the lower courts?"
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1473.01,1481.72,"The -- in the lower courts, the argument -- the argument was made as far as that de facto diminishment can be found."
2015.14-1406,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1485.91,1488.0,I'm not sure quite what that means.
2015.14-1406,0,62647,james_d_smith,,1499.16,1504.76,We talked about de facto diminishment as an independent ground.
2015.14-1406,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1527.265,1532.37,Thank you. Mr. Clement.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1532.37,1542.985,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether an 1882 Act of Congress diminished the Omaha Reservation and redrew its boundaries."
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.965,1608.335,What number? What -- what is the number?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1608.335,1608.74,There are 15 --
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1608.74,1609.47,Nine?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1609.47,1615.255,"No, 15, I think -- excuse me -- between 10 and 15, about 850 to 900 acres."
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1616.11,1619.14,Out -- out of how many that took allotments?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1619.14,1622.86,Out of how many Tribal members? I think there were roughly 300-plus allotments.
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1649.3,1653.38,"Why would that be odd? They -- they could have taken allotments anywhere, couldn't they --"
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1653.38,1653.575,Anywhere --
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1653.575,1657.8,-- within the area that was opened up? Couldn't they have chosen to purchase their --
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1657.8,1658.41,I don't think --
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.41,1660.405,-- or take allotments outside the reservation?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1660.405,1699.09,"I don't think that would have been a logical assumption, given the conception of the time, where I think Congress was thinking in the main that Tribal ownership or Indian ownership went with the reservation status. And I think, again, if you think of this as being a Surplus Land Act that simply opens the reservation up, a portion of it to settlement, then it makes perfect sense to say the Tribal members can take their allotments anywhere on the reservation. But if you think you've really drawn a new boundary to the reservation, then I think it's more than passing strange that you can take allotments to the west of it, or you can take allotment and the new boarder is smack dab through the middle of it."
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1699.36,1703.815,I don't understand the -- your answer to the Chief Justice's question.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1716.72,1717.67,No.
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1724.205,1726.685,Allotments were only open to non-Indians?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1726.685,1727.45,"No, no."
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.295,1734.56,All right.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1734.56,1738.27,And they were allowed to take their allotments anywhere on the preexisting reservation.
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1738.27,1738.5,All right.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1741.25,1741.4,No.
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.46,1742.1,Thank you.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1742.1,1744.83,And -- and this is clear from the proviso in Section 8.
2015.14-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1766.18,1766.76,What do you mean --
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1766.76,1768.195,"I mean, my friend on the other side --"
2015.14-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1768.195,1775.105,"But what do you mean, Mr. Clement, of the language that I read from Solem itself which seems to fit this case?"
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1775.105,1805.545,"Well, I take that language, Justice Ginsburg, as Justice Marshal writing for the Court saying that when you're in the third factor, when you witness de facto immunity -- I'm sorry -- de facto sort of diminishment, that that may ultimately support a conclusion that there was in fact diminishment as a matter of law. I don't take him to be opening up an entirely different route to finding immunity -- diminishment, rather, that doesn't go through an act of Congress."
2015.14-1406,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1838.11,1842.275,Did -- did -- did we cite Solem in Sherrill? I -- I don't really recall.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1842.275,1843.82,I -- I -- I don't recall. I --
2015.14-1406,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.82,1848.295,"If it held that, it would have been -- it would have been cited and Sherrill would not have been any big deal."
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1848.295,1849.2,"Well, I -- I -- I think that --"
2015.14-1406,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.2,1851.055,I thought Sherrill was a big deal.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1851.055,1852.37,"Well, I think -- I think --"
2015.14-1406,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.37,1855.64,Justice Ginsburg wrote it. I think she thought it was a big deal. (Laughter.)
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1855.64,1857.66,I'm not here to tell you it's not a big deal.
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1903.99,1907.25,But -- but Solem did talk about de facto diminishment.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1917.625,1923.585,"I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think there's two ways to talk about de facto v. de jure."
2015.14-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1944.56,1950.185,Except that it's -- it's presented before the Court turns to apply the principles.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1950.185,1951.28,Exactly.
2015.14-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1954.27,1956.485,It's -- it's not -- it's not tied to the third factor.
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1956.485,1960.66,"Well, I -- I -- I take, though, that it actually is, in my view, tied to the third factor."
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2023.53,2025.52,"Well -- well -- well, please correct me if I'm wrong from the record."
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2041.425,2042.66,"Well, I -- I -- I --"
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2042.66,2046.115,"And I mean, is -- is that reading of the record mistaken?"
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2046.115,2056.04,"Well, I -- I think what there is is a practical understanding -- as Justice Sotomayor indicated, this is not a wealthy Tribe that's looking to assert jurisdictions in places that are impractical."
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2064.11,2074.5,"What -- what -- but does the fact that nothing, if -- if the record is correct -- let's assume the record shows that the Tribe exercised no jurisdiction over the western portion until this alcoholic Beverage Control Ordinance."
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2077.13,2078.58,I don't think it's dispositive.
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2079.2,2079.86,Is it relevant?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2079.86,2080.56,"Yes, relevant."
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2080.56,2083.07,Why is it -- why is it relevant? To what point?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2083.07,2103.78,"It -- it -- I think it could be relevant to the third factor of Solem in a case where the situation was very cloudy. But one of the things also to keep in mind is that even before Montana, the authority that a Tribe would have over a principal non-Indian settlement on a reservation is fairly limited."
2015.14-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2104.5,2105.24,Limited to what?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2105.24,2105.88,What's that?
2015.14-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2105.88,2119.475,"What -- what -- what does it state beside the alcohol tax -- sales tax? What else, on your theory, could the Tribe do in the way of governance in this area?"
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2119.475,2139.755,"I think as a practical matter, Justice Ginsburg, there's two other things that are at stake here, and they both go to the equities of the Indians on the reservation, not the non-Indians, because the non-Indians on the reservation, the Tribal authority is very, very limited. So one thing that is at issue here is the potential to continue the revenue-sharing agreement with the State."
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2166.67,2169.58,"You -- you -- Justice Ginsburg asked you a question, you said, as a practical matter."
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2181.255,2182.39,"No, not at all."
2015.14-1406,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2201.59,2201.99,If the City of --
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2201.99,2202.7,-- rather than the State court.
2015.14-1406,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2202.7,2210.245,"If the City of Pender is on a reservation, under what authority could the Town of Pender regulate things that go on in Pender?"
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2210.245,2225.12,"Under -- under its authority -- first of all -- I -- I mean, you know, let me say two things: One is: I'm not even sure, because of the retrocession under -- after Public Law 280, it's not even clear to me that Nebraska ceded its civil jurisdiction that it enjoyed under 280."
2015.14-1406,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2250.37,2253.575,"Well, just educate me because I -- I don't know the law on this point."
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2259.68,2260.135,Yes.
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2277.385,2283.185,Does that displace Tribal authority in that area?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2283.185,2283.87,No.
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2288.89,2296.555,"Well, the -- the -- we're talking about the area. Can Tribal -- Tribal police patrol within the municipality?"
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2296.555,2305.57,"I think they probably could. The only, really -- with an eye towards seeing if there were Indians there who were, you know, needing patrolling."
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2325.185,2328.86,So there's overlapping jurisdiction? The municipality and the Tribe --
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2328.86,2329.17,Yes.
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2329.17,2330.48,-- within the city?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2330.48,2331.24,Within the city.
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2331.97,2333.405,Doesn't that create conflict?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2333.405,2333.81,No.
2015.14-1406,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2343.16,2351.275,"But the -- the liquor tax that we're talking about is not imposed only on Indians, right? It's imposed on everybody who buys liquor in Pender."
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2351.275,2362.01,"It -- it is, but that is the exception that proves the rule, because alcohol on reservations has been a unique Federal authority for as long as there's been Indian Reservations."
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2368.745,2377.595,"So on Indian Reservation lands, I take it Tribal police have jurisdiction over non-Indians as to minor offenses?"
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2377.595,2384.43,"I -- I don't think that's actually true on the ground in Nebraska, at least as to the highways."
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2387.77,2389.73,"Well, you -- you have the example of a scuffle."
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2405.205,2409.75,I -- I don't think that it would within the Village of Pender.
2015.14-1406,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2416.38,2420.85,And that's true with reference to all Indian tribes? Can you cite me any proposition for that?
2015.14-1406,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2420.85,2426.16,"Well, ultimately, it might be -- it might turn on the scope of the Montana decision."
2015.14-1406,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2454.06,2464.17,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem."
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2464.17,2486.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Solem v. Bartlett, this Court explained that once a block of land is set aside as a Indian Reservation and no matter what happens to the title of individual plots within the area, the entire block retains its reservation status until Congress explicitly indicates otherwise."
2015.14-1406,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.685,2552.825,"That's what -- what the State can do, but the State wouldn't be obliged to do that, wouldn't be obliged to provide schools?"
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2552.825,2561.715,"I see no basis for the State to refuse to provide services to its own citizens, especially if they are not members of the Tribe."
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2561.715,2564.17,"Well, it would be a question of sovereignty."
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2564.17,2565.06,The State --
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2565.06,2566.93,This is -- this is the reservation.
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2577.355,2585.09,The State retains regulatory sovereignty to make laws with respect to its own citizens and nonmembers on a reservation.
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2612.48,2615.62,"The Environmental Protection Agency, which -- the State or Federal?"
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2615.62,2616.115,Federal.
2015.14-1406,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2625.61,2633.01,"But our -- our questions have been, suppose that you prevail, what can the State do? And we say, oh, it's a practical matter."
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2638.53,2639.675,What could the Tribe do?
2015.14-1406,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2639.675,2643.815,"Yes, to regulate nonTribal members."
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2643.815,2649.955,So the things that the Tribe could do would be any express delegation of authority from Congress.
2015.14-1406,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2656.95,2659.87,We heard about the fuel -- the revenue sharing of the fuel.
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2659.87,2660.26,That's right.
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2677.745,2685.635,"I suppose one reason the Tribe might -- might not provide services is because the area is 98-point-whatever percent nonTribal, right?"
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2685.635,2687.195,I think that's absolutely correct.
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2687.195,2693.745,So they would be -- any services would be for the -- how many? Nine -- nine Indians in the area or 15?
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2693.745,2694.46,Pardon?
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2694.46,2698.53,How many non-Indians own land in the western part?
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2698.53,2701.46,It's almost entirely non-Indian in the western part.
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.58,2709.455,Couldn't the Tribe enact ordinances that govern the Indians in the -- in the western part?
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2709.455,2717.11,"They could, but if we're talking about the effect on nonmembers, they would have to fall under the one -- one of the two Montana exceptions."
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.11,2717.555,Okay.
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2720.73,2721.09,That's right.
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.56,2726.56,-- they would be subject to the Tribe's jurisdiction which they otherwise would not?
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2726.56,2732.365,"I think that that's accurate. If I could go to the City of Sherrill argument, which got brought up a lot today."
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.48,2775.485,I don't understand that. Try -- try it again.
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2775.485,2776.055,Sure.
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.055,2778.395,Principles of equity do not apply here?
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2778.395,2779.88,They do not apply in the same way.
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.255,2791.97,Why not?
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2791.97,2808.1,"Because that's what the Court said, for instance, in the copyright decision that Justice Ginsburg recently wrote, which is that when you have background principles of equity, they are presumed not to be -- apply and be displaced when there is a substantive law that Congress passes to deal with the same issue."
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2808.1,2814.005,There's a law that authorized the imposition of these taxes in the western part of the reservation.
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2814.005,2825.71,"The law authorizes the exercise of this authority if there is a reservation and if the Tribe applies to the Department of the Interior, which has to approve the ordinance."
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2825.71,2829.985,"Well, doesn't that beg the question? The question was whether or not this reservation has been diminished."
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2831.565,2835.035,"Well, that's the question with respect to the application of the statute."
2015.14-1406,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2846.6,2849.39,If the City of Sherrill did apply --
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2849.39,2850.355,Pardon?
2015.14-1406,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2850.355,2859.11,"If the City of Sherrill did apply, hypothetically -- I'm not nay-saying all the differences you're pointing out -- would you lose?"
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2859.11,2859.92,No.
2015.14-1406,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2860.53,2861.36,Explain why not.
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2861.36,2865.63,-- we're not talking about just what the Tribe can do.
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.19,2911.19,"Frankly, I'm more -- I'm more inclined to vote your way if the City of Sherrill does apply than if the City of Sherrill doesn't apply. What you're telling me is, unless you get there through Solem, it doesn't matter whether the State and non-Indians have for generations viewed this land as their own."
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2913.55,2922.565,"Well, I'm telling you that to the extent City of Sherrill applies, it applies to a very different question, not the question as to where the borders of the reservation are."
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2933.44,2935.95,That's not what city -- that's not what Sherrill said.
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2941.7,2968.825,"Again, the diminishment question goes not just to the Tribe's sovereignty but the jurisdiction as well of the United States. And if we're talking about expectations, another point that I would make is that the single best evidence of what these parties could have expected is the retrocession, because that was a unique moment in which the State of Nebraska and the United States talked directly and officially to one another about the burdens and responsibilities for exercising jurisdiction in the reservation."
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2989.77,2992.63,That determines the meaning of the 1882 statute.
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2992.63,2993.82,Not in the least.
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.82,2996.35,That's what I think.
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,2996.35,3011.37,"I was simply responding to the point that the expectations here might be all in the same direction. I would also point to 30 years of Nebraska revenue rulings, all of which say, point blank, Pender is still part of the reservation."
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.48,3107.66,"Well, is that saying there's no such thing as de facto diminishment?"
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3107.66,3119.1,"I think that de facto diminishment, if you think of it as some sort of freestanding alternative path to change the boundaries of a reservation, I do agree that it doesn't exist. But if you're talking about it --"
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.1,3122.835,How is that consistent with the language in Solem that Justice Ginsburg read?
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3122.835,3128.725,I -- I think it's a little bit hard to know exactly what the court meant. This Court has never found de facto diminishment.
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.725,3141.925,What about Sherrill?
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3141.925,3142.605,Pardon?
2015.14-1406,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.605,3143.72,What about Sherrill?
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3143.72,3147.03,"Sherrill is very explicit, but it is not a diminishment ruling."
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3153.84,3167.13,"What's -- what's vague about the language where non-Indian settlers flooded into the opening portion of a reservation and the area has long since lost its Indian character, we have acknowledged that de facto, if not de jure diminishment may have occurred."
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3167.13,3181.47,"I think you have to read that sentence in light of Yankton Sioux, which says that when you're talking about the subsequent treatment of the area and pattern of settlement, those are relevant only insofar as they bear on the touchstone of the inquiry, which is congressional intent. If I can make one final --"
2015.14-1406,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3181.47,3196.31,"Well, I think if you look at the passage, it goes on, then, to discuss in addition to that, then we look to subsequent demographic history as an additional clue as to what Congress meant. I -- I read those as the two different paragraphs as making two different points."
2015.14-1406,2,56065,allon_kedem,,3196.31,3198.885,I think you could definitely read it that way if you just had Solem.
