1998.98-131,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.978,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 98-131, United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California."
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,11.059,13.762,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,81.115,105.19,"Well, counsel, I thought that the section we're looking at, (c)(1)(a), says that it covers the situation where the defendant directly or indirectly gives anything of value to a public official for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by that official."
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,105.19,106.482,--Justice O'Connor--
1998.98-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.482,110.356,There is a link there between an act performed or to be performed.
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,120.273,122.654,"--Justice O'Connor, you are correct."
1998.98-131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.186,162.161,"Well, but that's quite different from linking it to an act performed or to be performed."
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,168.178,183.275,"Only, Your Honor... and that was why we answered the question presented by the Court in... in a qualified way: only when it is the official's position, understood as the capacity to act, do we believe that there is an equivalence, that they are coextensive with one another."
1998.98-131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,183.275,197.666,"But isn't... isn't the difficulty, or one of the difficulties, for your position, at least with respect to these instructions, that the judge, in giving the instructions, went so far as to say that there... literally, there need be no link with any act at all?"
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,222.01,224.201,"No, Justice Souter, for the following reason."
1998.98-131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,235.751,237.031,"Well, he sure did that."
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,257.366,264.181,"--Your Honor, but it was in the portion of the charge where the judge was trying to explain to the jury that no such link was required."
1998.98-131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,271.597,271.877,But that isn't what he said.
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,274.18,276.171,"Your Honor, our... our position--"
1998.98-131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,276.171,277.372,Which... which seems to go much further.
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,277.372,286.028,"--Our position is that if it is the prospect of official conduct that motivates the gift, it's enough to find that to satisfy this offense."
1998.98-131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,290.913,293.754,"Well, I know that's your position, but why does it make sense?"
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,339.696,341.529,"--Let me answer the ""why"" question first."
1998.98-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.995,405.489,"Mr.... Mr. Ray, my... my... my problem is just the opposite of... of Justice Breyer's."
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,454.385,455.577,"It is not, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.719,457.791,"What's the difference between those two, then?"
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,457.791,469.599,"--The difference under 7353 (a) is that the statute is simply asking there, as a fact, whether or not those interests were ones before the public official."
1998.98-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.843,476.915,"Well, this one is included within the other one, you mean?"
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,479.286,479.837,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.98-131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.827,495.608,To the employee.
1998.98-131,0,40368,robert_w_ray,,495.608,496.239,--to the employee.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,1783.474,1785.116,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.98-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.854,1839.485,But do you... do you--
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,1840.343,1840.984,--Yes.
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1842.844,1844.156,Do you contend that was erroneous?
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,1844.156,1844.827,--I'm sorry?
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1844.827,1847.709,"Do you contend that that statement was erroneous, about the direct nexus?"
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,1847.709,1849.579,"Yes, Your Honor, we do."
1998.98-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.579,1853.802,"Well, that's way, way back in time in... in the proceedings."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,1861.961,1862.692,I understand that.
1998.98-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.406,1866.487,We've got half an hour.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,1868.218,1868.488,--I understand.
1998.98-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1906.923,1910.636,--it's the United States that's the Petitioner here.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,1910.636,1913.808,I'm sorry... after 4 years... the United States.
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.058,1975.062,Do you say it has to be because of some particular official act?
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,1975.062,1985.479,"--Ultimately, that's not Sun-Diamond's battle, but we do believe that... that the statute calls for a link between a gift on one hand and some specific or identifiable official act."
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.479,1985.98,Specific or identifiable.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,1997.898,1999.02,Well--
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.02,2000.161,That doesn't violate this Act?
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2000.161,2000.809,"--Well, two answers--"
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.809,2003.152,"Saying, you know, I'm not asking you to do anything in particular."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2005.764,2006.305,--Two answers--
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.305,2009.738,I just... I just want you... just... I just want you to be a friend; that's all.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2010.489,2022.837,"--I strongly suspect that if I had matters before the FCC or before any department, it's not going to be terribly difficult for the prosecutor, especially with the resources of the grand jury, to be able to identify matters."
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.789,2023.909,"No, no."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2047.352,2053.386,"--Well, I strongly suspect that a jury could find that it was for an act, if one were identified."
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.378,2054.958,No particular act.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2054.958,2055.449,"--I understand, sir."
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.088,2072.42,My question was... was not whether he could be charged under one of the other statutes.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2074.494,2074.714,--Right.
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.685,2076.326,Is no?
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2076.326,2076.857,Is no.
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2076.857,2086.562,"Now, in your view, what's the... tell me what the distinction is between the requirement of... the specificity requirement of this statute and the specificity requirement of the bribery statute."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2086.562,2091.116,"Under bribery, you need a quid pro quo, there's clearly strings attached."
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2091.116,2098.741,"Well, the quid pro quo is the agreement that connects the... the thing given with a specific act."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2098.741,2099.912,"Right, I understand."
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2099.912,2104.574,It doesn't have to... the act doesn't have to be completed to violate the bribery statute--
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2104.574,2104.804,Right.
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2104.804,2105.084,--We agree on that.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2116.393,2126.488,"Let us hypothesize that I'm giving a lot of gifts, not in exchange for, not with any implicit or explicit agreement that the government official is going to do me a favor in return."
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2139.798,2142.432,"Well, then there is no... then I... maybe I misunderstood your position."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2150.477,2150.707,No.
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2157.713,2159.563,"Okay, we're back to the specific."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2167.419,2169.77,"Under the bribery statute, there's a quid pro quo."
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2169.77,2181.828,"Well, the quid pro quo... and correct me here... I thought quid pro quo meant that there was an agreement that the... that the gift would be in exchange for action in this particular instance."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2181.828,2182.619,That is correct.
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2182.619,2183.13,All right.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2192.186,2192.837,There is no agreement.
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.837,2213.09,"You've got an... you've got an explicit... you've got a... you've got a particular gift, and you've got a specific act in mind, and the prosecutor has got to show it and prove it, but we just don't get down to so many words in identifying... when... when we're giving the gift, we don't get down to so many words in identifying the connection between this gift and this act; that's the difference?"
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2213.09,2213.341,Right.
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2226.103,2226.233,Okay.
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2232.647,2234.538,"Well, not even articulation."
1998.98-131,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2235.83,2238.941,Then why does the prosecutor have to prove specific acts?
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2238.941,2243.263,Because we believe that the statute almost cries out for it.
1998.98-131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2244.775,2256.833,"When you were asking... if you're arguing this, then you're going beyond where the Court of Appeals went, because the Court of Appeals didn't say it had to be this act or that act."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2266.94,2279.058,"--In the appendix, the Court of Appeals decision is attached and... at page 8... and whatever degree of intent to influence may be necessary for a bribe."
1998.98-131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.737,2292.266,And you say that's... that's wrong?
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2292.266,2293.418,"No, we say that's correct."
1998.98-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.418,2295.03,"Well, why?"
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2338.129,2339.03,Well--
1998.98-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2339.03,2341.101,"--independently, and I give him a tip."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2361.317,2361.608,--No.
1998.98-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2402.647,2405.595,"Well, how... how about the ""to be performed"" part of the statute?"
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2405.595,2413.141,"--Well, what the courts have done that interpret the gratuity statute as merely a reward... in fact, there was an Eighth Circuit case that affirmed an instruction."
1998.98-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.9,2430.283,"Well, but committed to perform is bribery."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2430.283,2432.553,"No, because--"
1998.98-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2432.553,2436.257,"That's simply reading out the part of the statute that says ""to be performed""."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2436.257,2437.589,"--Well, let me give you the hypothetical."
1998.98-131,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2438.901,2441.162,"Well, don't ask me questions."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2443.513,2449.159,"--Let me give you an example of what it is I'm talking about, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2473.134,2484.792,"But then the dif... the difficult... why this case isn't so totally obvious, is because... take a gratuity statute... you'd say that that... that, okay, I understand perfectly well you're giving a person a tip."
1998.98-131,1,21972,eric_w_bloom,,2533.76,2535.63,And certainly it's a legitimate question--
