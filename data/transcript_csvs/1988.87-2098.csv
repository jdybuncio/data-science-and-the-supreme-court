1988.87-2098,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.856,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-2098, Samuel Skinner v. the Mic-America Pipeline Company."
1988.87-2098,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,17.176,22.128,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-2098,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.624,251.461,"Mr. Merrill, you keeping referring the... to these charges as fees."
1988.87-2098,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,257.615,258.932,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-2098,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.932,274.91,And I must say there is language in National Cable Television and other cases that would indicate that fees are imposed on identifiable beneficiaries for particular benefits.
1988.87-2098,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,284.265,285.801,"Well, as I... I mentioned--"
1988.87-2098,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.801,288.451,--I find it difficult to look at this as anything but a tax.
1988.87-2098,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,288.451,297.49,"--As I mentioned very briefly, the Appellees really have to sustain two propositions in order to win here, and if they don't sustain on... sustain both propositions, they lose."
1988.87-2098,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.0,314.202,"Well, you refer... you continue to refer to it as a system of fees."
1988.87-2098,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,328.794,330.163,"That's true, Your Honor."
1988.87-2098,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,381.363,384.715,Can it enact a tax under the Commerce Clause?
1988.87-2098,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,384.715,390.119,I don't think that Congress could enact a... a pure tax under the Commerce Clause.
1988.87-2098,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,390.119,391.202,Why would it ever need to?
1988.87-2098,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,395.606,402.943,"The truth is I think, Justice Rehnquist, that Congress doesn't specify what clause of the Constitution it's proceeding under when it adopts these sorts of things."
1988.87-2098,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.494,430.779,"Well, then you should have no hesitancy in referring to these exactions as taxes."
1988.87-2098,0,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,430.779,433.731,"Well, I refer to them as fees because Congress referred to them as fees."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1583.762,1589.582,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-2098,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1668.884,1670.07,"Well, this one did."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1670.07,1673.938,Section 7005 originated--
1988.87-2098,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1673.938,1674.372,Right.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1674.372,1677.64,--but the decision that we're complaining about did not.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1693.685,1707.243,Hasn't the President been given the power on some occasions to establish the... the levels of... of importation fees on oil and on other matters as well?
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1710.778,1724.37,"Well, if we take the Hampton case, for example, in Hampton, Congress said that they wanted a tariff equal to the difference between the cost of production at home and abroad."
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.262,1735.728,Right.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1735.728,1737.145,--of production abroad and at home were.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.855,1752.605,Why is this one less... less arithmetic?
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1758.559,1759.144,No.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.957,1789.897,"--Well, I guess in Hampton there were a lot of different ways of competing whether the goods were being subsidized abroad or whether... you know, whatever the President had to determine there."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1798.419,1807.858,There is a basic difference we think between establishing a rate of tax.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.387,1857.307,Doesn't the President have... he has all sorts of powers under the Trading with the Enemy Act.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1866.747,1867.597,I don't know.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1867.597,1880.073,"Do you think the President could... could be given the authority in the event of a... if he thinks the national interest requires it, to impose an import fee on... on petroleum?"
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1880.073,1884.942,I think the President... let me give two answers to that.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.451,1904.938,"Well, here he's acting under the commerce power, but your... your argument is, yes, he may be acting under the commerce power, but this is raising revenue."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,1925.119,1934.457,"To me, Your honor, the rule basically boils down to whether or not it's a zero sum game."
1988.87-2098,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2101.348,2106.169,"But it doesn't say that the rates have to be fixed in those bills, does it?"
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2106.169,2117.227,"It... well, this Court will have to decide what a bill to raise revenue means."
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.97,2159.887,xxx.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2170.027,2172.479,There is a--
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.479,2174.279,A lot of discretion as... as to how to write them.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2174.279,2194.893,"--There is a profound difference in fact between the regulations of other agencies which this Court has approved as lawmaking or quasi lawmaking and Internal Revenue regulations which, as Your Honor mentioned in Mr. Merrill's argument, are interpretive."
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.39,2221.544,You think... you think that's a constitutional line between interpretive regulations and... and legislative regulation.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2221.544,2222.746,--I--
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.746,2236.904,"So, you... you think this one would be okay if instead of what they said, Congress simply said you shall raise a reasonable amount of money assessed... by assessing... assessing these charges in a reasonable fashion."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2240.374,2243.576,"--No, absolutely not."
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.31,2246.694,"Well, then... then the constitutional line has nothing to do with interpretive or not."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2246.694,2247.277,--No.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.21,2276.297,That depends on... on how broad the word you're interpreting is.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2297.894,2301.246,--Let's take that hypothetical and be specific about it.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.758,2376.329,I agree with that.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2394.208,2398.576,"At a practical level, perhaps."
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2612.15,2613.65,What was that in Mistretta?
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2617.852,2620.937,--The Court in Mistretta--
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.937,2622.356,"It's a good description of the dissent, but--"
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2623.622,2625.458,--The--
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.458,2629.576,--What... what was the executive function that was being performed--
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2629.576,2630.528,--The--
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.528,2633.647,--other than the making of rules?
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2633.647,2638.432,--The quote from Mistretta that I was referring to was this.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.692,2653.192,Writing tax laws may be.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2653.192,2661.881,The Department of Transportation has never been thought of as a expert agency on writing tax laws.
1988.87-2098,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2692.902,2718.051,"Mr. McMillan, supposing in this case that Congress had said this safety program is costing us $100 million a year, we want the... that money raised from the pipeline companies and all of them, and we want it raised on a basis of usage of the pipelines."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2727.776,2728.859,--Yes.
1988.87-2098,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.859,2729.809,Why?
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2729.809,2736.214,It... it is really precisely the New England Power fact pattern in a sense.
1988.87-2098,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.749,2747.534,"Well, but didn't the Court in New England Power say that Congress had not delegated to the FPC?"
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2750.688,2755.49,The Court didn't reach the third... they reached two issues and didn't reach a third.
1988.87-2098,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2790.313,2797.3,But how much... how much discretion really is delegated here if you say that there's $100 million to be raised?
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2814.178,2820.249,--Mid-America is here not because it cares how much the industry is going to pay.
1988.87-2098,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.166,2851.053,"--Well, that simply means we ought to get it right in this case I guess."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2851.686,2853.486,We... we should get it right in this case.
1988.87-2098,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2866.813,2876.086,"Well, supposing in... in this case the Congress had added volume miles so that there really was very little discretion left in that area."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2876.086,2884.691,"If they had said volume miles, then we're... we wouldn't be here because that... there isn't any discretion."
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.367,2906.205,"Mr. McMillan, I don't... tell you the truth, I don't see what's so sacrosanct about taxes."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2941.811,2942.344,Well--
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.344,2945.682,"--Had we not given Transportation all these other powers, I could understand it."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2948.232,2959.49,"--Well, with all due respect, Your Honor, I don't... it's not a question of whether you feel uncomfortable or I feel uncomfortable or even whether the Framers felt uncomfortable."
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.249,2977.384,"Well, no, not legislative accountability."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,2996.865,3001.4,It means legislative accountability and House accountability.
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3016.694,3022.348,"If that decision is to be made by... by law, as opposed to having it made by the executive."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,3038.792,3055.069,"--We are here today arguing that the decision about what Mid-America is going to pay, what its tax rate is going to be can only be made by law."
1988.87-2098,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3060.64,3061.707,xxx so.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,3071.579,3078.852,Offense... offenses are a zero sum game in the way that revenue raising isn't.
1988.87-2098,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.057,3139.99,May I ask?
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,3166.208,3179.05,"The Court in National Cable I think found that if you are talking about a user fee, it doesn't rise to the level of something that the constitutional concerns associated with taxation are concerned about."
1988.87-2098,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.05,3180.484,"So, that would be all right."
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,3180.484,3181.3,Yes.
1988.87-2098,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3181.3,3184.019,Yes.
1988.87-2098,1,39945,richard_mcmillan_jr,,3184.019,3193.81,"In closing, I would just go back to a point that I started with that the decision we are talking here originated in the Department of Transportation."
1988.87-2098,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3202.25,3203.933,"Thank you, Mr. McMillan."
1988.87-2098,2,43047,thomas_w_merrill,,3207.135,3208.32,Two quick points.
1988.87-2098,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.144,3299.694,"Thank you, Mr. Merrill."
