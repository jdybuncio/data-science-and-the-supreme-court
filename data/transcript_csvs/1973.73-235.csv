1973.73-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,67.192,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-1454, excuse me, 72-235, DeFunis against Odegaard."
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,68.517,77.053,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.079,508.164,On the returning servicemen?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,508.164,513.587,"Yes, there were some returning servicemen, except those two, and we’re raising no question about the returning servicemen."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.587,514.009,They are --
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,514.009,518.929,"Most of them had previously been admitted and they were brought back, and we never at any time raised an issue about that."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,518.929,525.5,"Now that I’ve interrupted you, you said during the noon hour you were able to get the 300 or 400 out of the 1,600 total applications."
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,525.5,526.655,That’s correct to look at them.
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,526.655,529.101,And look at them during the noon hour at the trial.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,535.274,542.353,We requested all of the minority groups that were brought in and some of the additional others that were kind of at random.
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,545.348,545.867,Right.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,545.867,554.541,"And so, we got those that we could look and we looked at them in the jury room during the noon hour and there was markings on the cover with most of them."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,554.541,554.711,Right.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,554.711,556.43,"So, we could hurriedly go through it."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.43,562.781,And did this 300 or 400 include all who had been admitted to the law school?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,562.781,567.761,"Yes, I believe so."
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,605.985,608.522,Who decides a Negro were in the minority group?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,608.522,609.079,What was that?
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,609.079,613.388,Who decides Negroes were in the minority group?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,613.388,621.089,"In the minority group, besides the Negroes, they had the Chicanos, the American-Indians, the --"
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,621.089,621.818,Filipino-Americans.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,621.818,626.03,Filipino-Americans and I think that’s it.
1973.73-235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,753.839,758.769,"These are people who were offered admission, not people who actually enrolled."
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,759.455,764.294,"These are the ones that were admitted, that were offered admission, invited."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,790.63,798.125,"Is there in the appendix or anywhere else a copy of the application form, either Black or --"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,798.125,807.753,"No, I don’t think there is, but there is in the special appendix at page 44, I believe it is, a list of all those and their qualifications as to how they appeared."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,807.753,812.984,"On the application form there was a blank for filling in the applicant’s race or ethnic background, was there?"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,812.984,822.506,On the application form you were requested to circle one of the following.
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,878.016,883.691,"Since there were no personal interviews, I suppose if Mr. DeFunis had circled one of these, he wouldn’t have given--"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,883.691,884.62,We wouldn’t be here today.
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,884.62,885.646,He’d be -- he would’ve been --
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,885.646,889.566,"We wouldn’t have any problem, none."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.096,903.425,What is his ethnic?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,903.425,903.968,What was that?
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,903.968,904.941,What is he?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,908.684,910.8,"Well, he comes of Jewish parents."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,935.517,935.767,But as I said to the --
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,935.767,938.236,Was he an underprivileged or disadvantaged?
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.933,954.033,Just circle one of those.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,954.356,955.903,If you just circle one of those.
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,955.903,956.115,That’s you’re point.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,956.115,957.021,That’s correct.
1973.73-235,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,961.386,965.268,Is Mr. DeFunis still in law school?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,965.268,967.362,"Yes, Mr. DeFunis is still in law school."
1973.73-235,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,967.362,971.068,When does your last quarter or semester begin?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,971.068,973.076,"It begins sometime, I believe, in February."
1973.73-235,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,974.345,977.991,And so he will graduate this spring presumably?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,977.991,979.997,"Well, I’m hoping that he will graduate."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1030.276,1030.78,When was this?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1031.159,1038.194,"Right after the Supreme Court of the State of Washington entered their remitter and it came down, and at that time --"
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1038.194,1039.741,That was during his second year?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1039.741,1040.319,That’s right.
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1086.017,1102.781,"Incidentally, Mr. Diamond, somewhere in one of these briefs, there’s hundreds of them, there’s a statement I think by the state that there’s an interval in February within which he must apply for admission to the final semester."
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1102.781,1103.932,Yes.
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.932,1106.108,Has he applied within that interval?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1106.108,1118.231,"Well, I believe that that application for his last quarter, we run in quarters at our school, is sometime this month and I assume that he has applied because there’s a stay and there’s nothing to stop him."
1973.73-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1125.183,1126.072,This month --
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1126.072,1127.345,For the first time --
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1127.345,1129.277,"This month, today and the day after tomorrow."
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1129.277,1131.056,"That’s right, and I think so he must be due."
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1147.225,1149.369,If he makes the application within this interval?
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1149.369,1159.875,"I think that’s right, but if this Court reverses this decision, and assuming they could do it in the next -- sometime before June or before he gets his diploma --"
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1159.875,1160.27,"Well, if he --"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1160.27,1163.992,What have I got to protect Marco DeFunis?
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1182.831,1186.272,"Well, if -- I guess the university should let him finish."
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1187.67,1188.261,I don’t know.
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1188.996,1195.506,"If he should finish and graduate, what about the question?"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1197.07,1197.191,"Well, if this Court --"
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1197.191,1197.337,This is not a class type --
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1197.337,1216.373,"If this Court keeps the decision under wraps until after June and he gets his diploma and graduates, I don’t think even if you then reverse it or what happens, I don’t think anybody will come and take his diploma away from him, but he -- I don’t know whether you’re going to keep it that long."
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1222.575,1223.891,"But this is not a class action, is it?"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1223.891,1227.169,"No, it is not a class action and we’re not concerned with that."
1973.73-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1269.232,1279.197,"Mr. Diamond, would it be possible for you to find out whether or not he has registered and what happened if he did try to register, and let us know?"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1279.197,1282.325,"Oh, I can, but I think you can assume that he either has or he will."
1973.73-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1283.091,1288.421,"I can’t speak for anybody, but myself and I cannot assume anything unless it’s in the record."
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1288.421,1289.405,"Well, of course --"
1973.73-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1289.405,1290.079,You’ll supply it.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1290.079,1291.274,I’ll be glad to supply that to you.
1973.73-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.274,1293.032,"Well, why is it you don’t want to?"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1293.032,1295.462,"I have no hesitancy about it, none whatsoever."
1973.73-235,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1308.414,1330.446,"Mr. Diamond, if he does graduate and if this decision of the Washington Court is affirmed, will he nevertheless be eligible to take the Washington Bar Examination even though your Supreme Court has said he has been illegally in law school?"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1330.446,1334.173,"I would think so, but I’m not too sure I can answer that question."
1973.73-235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1378.969,1384.849,But nothing in Justice Douglas’ stay order required the university to give him passing grades.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1384.849,1387.185,"Oh no, not at all.[Attempt to laughter]"
1973.73-235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.185,1387.647,I don’t see how --
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1387.647,1388.602,"No, he’s earning them."
1973.73-235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.602,1393.602,I don’t see how you could call his degree one by default then if we held the case were moot.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1393.602,1397.322,"No, I’m not saying that his degree would be one by default."
1973.73-235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.992,1508.26,Mr. Diamond.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1508.26,1508.513,Yes?
1973.73-235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.513,1509.973,Let me interrupt you just a minute.
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1522.406,1523.499,"No, sir."
1973.73-235,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1557.016,1563.7,"And was it found here, Mr. Diamond, but for the special consideration given to minority groups, he would have been admitted?"
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1563.7,1564.172,That’s right.
1973.73-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1628.316,1630.238,"Mr. Diamond, you’re now impinging into your rebuttal time."
1973.73-235,0,30005,josef_diamond,,1630.238,1636.554,"I better save a little time, thank you."
1973.73-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1636.554,1644.298,Mr. Attorney General.
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1644.298,1648.152,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-235,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1673.589,1673.985,No.
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1673.985,1676.355,Mr. DeFunis will enter --
1973.73-235,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1676.355,1678.958,That wouldn’t follow.
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1678.958,1684.054,"It will, at least as far as this group is that -- students are concerned subject to some further challenge --"
1973.73-235,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1684.054,1689.734,"But if we find it moot, I expect we’d vacate it and send it back for reconsideration."
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1689.734,1694.906,"If you found it moot on the grounds that he was already graduated, Mr. Justice Brennan, or were about to graduate?"
1973.73-235,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1694.906,1700.196,"Well, what do you and your state do if the case becomes moot as far as final?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1700.196,1704.051,I suppose the original action might have dismissed -- might have simply been dismissed.
1973.73-235,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1704.051,1705.564,Well -- [Laughter]
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1705.564,1706.222,That would validate --
1973.73-235,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1706.222,1708.775,We might do that if we found it moot.
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1708.775,1710.427,It might very well.
1973.73-235,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1714.028,1714.975,Why would it?
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1714.975,1715.77,For the past.
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1715.77,1716.521,For the past.
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1716.521,1717.006,Yes.
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1717.006,1728.184,"Until someone else brought another challenge and came back here, probably under the same circumstances which is the principal ground on which we regard the case not as being moot."
1973.73-235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1796.248,1803.602,"What if a decision of this Court came down, say, on May 1 affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1806.482,1807.278,Nothing.
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.694,1839.817,"How about the others who had 76.4, would they have an equal protection claim, not having been given a special dispensation here?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1839.817,1845.826,"I suspect that they have probably rested on their rights too long at this point, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1923.56,1929.712,Does the State of Washington have a pro rata system for the admission of the minorities to practice law?
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1929.712,1932.908,"It does not, Mr. Justice Douglas, of the --"
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1932.908,1935.989,Is the race disclosed on the examination?
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1935.989,1937.18,It is not.
1973.73-235,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1969.918,1972.583,Maybe that in and of itself doesn’t prove that.
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1974.761,1979.464,"The percentage of all, last year, was extraordinary, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1973.73-235,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1988.42,1990.802,"Well, 3 out of 13 is 20 --"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1990.802,1992.727,"21%, something like that."
1973.73-235,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1992.727,1993.873,Substantially more than 92%.
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1993.873,1996.042,The difference between 92 and 79.
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2004.258,2011.24,Is this policy of the university the outcome of an increasing demand --
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2011.24,2012.177,A tremendous --
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2012.177,2017.264,For minority lawyers among the public at large?
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2017.264,2031.872,It is in the sense that the law school and the university itself has recognized their almost total exclusion from the Bar in the society as a whole and in the State of Washington.
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2062.96,2065.856,Perhaps that was because they didn’t apply.
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2067.773,2069.661,"I don’t believe we do, Your Honor."
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2093.591,2099.309,Some of the most common members of your bench in the Seattle-Tacoma area are Black?
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2099.309,2103.282,There is a Black judge of the Court of Appeals.
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2115.917,2127.227,"Your record, somewhere, indicates I think a Negro population or at least one of the minority group populations of 2.2 or some such figure."
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2147.129,2151.034,"I do not, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, feel that way."
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2212.031,2217.048,"Mr. Attorney General, is this policy limited to the law school by the university?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2217.048,2225.492,"No, there are similar policies in other schools of the university but I cannot describe them in the detail which I can describe the one as the law school."
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2225.492,2233.602,"An Indian has, under constitutional laws, a reservation of so many seats."
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2238.861,2241.322,"I am not, Mr. Justice Douglas."
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2245.29,2248.804,"The pro rata system, we’ve had another cases."
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2248.804,2257.203,"Alright, but we are not -- we do not operate such a system and we are not asking you to validate such a system."
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2381.559,2389.483,"Does it really make any difference, the basic issues of this case whether he was number one or number 290?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2389.483,2391.672,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1973.73-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.876,2427.485,"Do you think past discrimination, either in Washington or elsewhere, as an educational consideration?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2427.485,2437.057,"I think that it is, Mr. Justice White, as long as it is relatively narrowly conceived, remember to gain --"
1973.73-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.057,2443.346,"I understand your education -- your argument on educational consideration and otherwise, but I don’t quite understand that."
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2445.089,2445.542,Alright.
1973.73-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.542,2449.943,"-- qualification, I just wonder why you call it education, why do you think you have to?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2449.943,2453.261,Let me answer the question more precisely.
1973.73-235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2504.889,2526.176,"But when you say qualified, Mr. Gorton, really by the time you’ve diluted that phrase as much as you have in your approach to admissions, it doesn’t mean a whole lot, does it, when you consider the minority applicants separately and really don’t have any base -- any cutoff point on the predicted first year average?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2526.176,2529.924,"Neither of those assumptions are correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.545,2555.7,These were the only groups that were automatically excluded because they were below 74?
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2555.7,2558.355,"That is not true either, Mr. Justice White."
1973.73-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.355,2560.045,"Except for veterans, you're right."
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2560.045,2562.509,"No, even beyond veterans."
1973.73-235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2578.385,2582.534,"But it took the Dean’s intervention to do that with a White person, and it did not --"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2582.534,2584.431,"It did that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.431,2587.289,"And that was -- so that was a difference in treatment, was it not?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2587.289,2601.277,"That was clearly a difference in treatment, but it was a difference in treatment which was required by the admissions policy which, of course, was based on the particular educational and professional rules which the university adopted."
1973.73-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.331,2730.921,"Mr. Attorney General, what do you do with the findings that there were minority people below this man, inferior to him?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2734.03,2755.397,"What we do with those findings is to admit that, on the statistical basis of predicted first year averages, they were below, but that the law school was not simply looking for the 150 persons with the highest predicted first year averages, that it had other valid social values."
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2791.934,2804.863,"Mr. Attorney General, when I was teaching law many years ago, I discovered to my consternation that these tests, these so-called tests, had built in racial bias."
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2810.017,2817.441,"There is no finding in this record, Mr. Justice Douglas, because neither party wished even to bring that subject up."
1973.73-235,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2835.618,2844.271,"No, but when I was teaching I couldn’t find out how they did it, but it was very subtle built in system to see that certain minorities didn’t get into the school."
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2844.271,2852.963,"Mr. Justice Douglas, I don’t think that there has ever been, at least in this school, any kind of such deliberate attempt."
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2961.049,2965.934,Is there anything in that context that would keep anyone out of any school however?
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2965.934,2971.953,"There is not, Your Honor, but lots of people are kept out of the University of Washington Law School."
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3027.315,3028.645,Did you personally --
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3028.645,3031.829,-- he was in exactly the same position as the school children in Swann.
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3031.829,3052.809,Did the university or the law school conduct any sort of generalized study to determine whether grades had a direct correlation with success and defectiveness in the practice of law?[Laughter]
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3052.809,3075.246,"The university did not do so in connection with this particular program, Mr. Chief Justice, but the amici -- many of the briefs of friends of the Court here have indicated that the statistics, both grades in college, for that matter grades in the law school frequently, together with the law school admissions test, do not make such predications."
1973.73-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3138.517,3145.473,"But you haven’t pointed out how that would exclude anyone, as Mr. DeFunis would has been excluded?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3145.473,3165.606,"It is clear that, at the primary school and secondary school level, no one is excluded, but whether or not that is a greater or a lesser rate than was -- than we are concerned with here is really a question -- a distinction without a difference."
1973.73-235,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3275.273,3280.86,"Mr. Attorney General, I think you haven’t told us who has formulated this precise policy?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3283.2,3283.52,"No, sir."
1973.73-235,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3288.606,3293.343,"When you say the law school itself, you mean the Dean or the Admissions Committee or the Faculty, who?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3293.343,3299.355,"The Dean – the Dean, the faculty, and the Admissions Committee."
1973.73-235,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3310.045,3314.361,"Now, how many are on the Admissions Committee?"
1973.73-235,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3314.361,3316.466,Mr. Anderson?
1973.73-235,2,15355,anderson,,3316.466,3317.647,Five or Seven.
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3317.647,3321.844,"I think it was -- at this particular time, it was five faculty and two students."
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3321.844,3322.533,Two students?
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3322.533,3324.018,Yes.
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3324.018,3333.72,"So you do have some who are not members of the faculty, although just now you said it was the faculty that set the policy for the school."
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3333.72,3340.332,"The -- I think under those circumstances, in that narrow sense, I would have to say the Admissions Committee didn’t set the policy."
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3342.699,3347.823,"And these students, how far along in their law school careers?"
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3347.823,3352.322,Each of these students were first year law students.
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3352.322,3356.371,So they’re passing on the admission of the next succeeding class.
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3356.371,3364.908,"Of the next succeeding class, that’s right, but they are passing it on only in the sense that they are a minority of the members of the Admissions Committee."
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3377.455,3381.325,So one denial vote on the committee would keep a person out.
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3381.325,3382.99,"No, that is not true."
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3383.749,3387.303,And no one was admitted without the approval of all members of the committee?
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3387.303,3392.515,A few people were denied admission without everyone reviewing it.
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3416.75,3420.335,You’re speaking in terms of viewing it.
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3423.311,3424.61,That’s right.
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3425.331,3430.2,"What I’m trying to find out is, how is a person denied admission, by vote?"
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3430.2,3441.899,"A person was denied admission in one of two fashions; either if his predicted first year average was below 74.5 and he did not fall in one of three categories, he is --"
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3441.899,3442.748,Yes I understand.
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3442.748,3451.524,"Minorities and so on, including some of the late students or, alternatively, by action of the entire committee."
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3451.524,3452.792,A majority vote?
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3452.792,3454.832,"Majority vote, I believe, yes."
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3454.832,3457.241,So that the students do vote --
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3457.241,3457.598,The students --
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3457.598,3458.991,On their successors in the next class.
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3458.991,3464.322,"-- did vote on their successors, all of their successors, White as well as minority."
1973.73-235,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3464.322,3469.99,"Mr. Gorton, you said the Admissions Committee just executed the policy, it didn’t formulate it."
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3472.005,3482.129,The faculty of the law school and I’m sure that it went through the Board of Regents and was generally approved by the Board of Regents.
1973.73-235,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3490.186,3492.663,How many other state law schools are there in Washington?
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3492.663,3493.725,There are none.
1973.73-235,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3501.435,3502.868,Rather more expensive than the state?
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3502.868,3505.6,They are more expensive than the state law school.
1973.73-235,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3505.6,3511.336,Then Mr. DeFunis would have to rather have a Hobson’s choice?
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3511.336,3515.091,"Some students would’ve had a Hobson’s choice, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3525.442,3529.657,You made the statement a while ago that the law school was a national school.
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3534.406,3535.458,We do.
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3535.458,3538.884,"So to that extent, it is something less than a national law school?"
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3538.884,3545.249,"Well, to that extent, Michigan is something less than a national law school I suppose, too."
1973.73-235,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3559.149,3563.038,"Well, certainly, it discourages non-residents from coming, doesn’t it?"
1973.73-235,3,41407,slade_gorton,,3563.038,3565.017,It is -- it is an element.
1973.73-235,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3577.273,3579.242,"Mr. Diamond, you have about six minutes remaining."
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3579.242,3582.486,Thank you.
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3662.706,3664.706,Is he the President of the law school?
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3664.706,3665.428,"The President of the university, I’m sorry."
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3665.428,3666.131,"You mean, the President of the University, don’t you?"
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3666.131,3668.694,"Excuse me, president of the law school.[Attempt to Laughter]"
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3712.655,3715.206,What are the qualifications you’re talking about?
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3715.206,3716.047,What was that?
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3716.047,3717.896,What are the qualifications you’re talking about?
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3717.896,3722.536,"The qualifications are what were in their application file, filled out by them."
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3735.969,3741.314,Can the record show that you or the Court or somebody went through all of them and you found it up?
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3741.314,3742.342,"No, sir."
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3746.2,3750.817,"Well, how do you know that there was some with lower qualifications?"
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3750.817,3751.756,How do we know what?
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3751.756,3757.72,"That there was some minority people with lower qualifications, not lower averages."
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3757.72,3760.31,"Because the university, in their testimony stated so."
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3766.659,3767.811,Without qualifications?
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3767.811,3775.939,"Yes, without qualifications, they testified that students with lower qualifications and without lower grades were accepted."
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3779.103,3783.336,Do I understand that what they meant for qualifications were just what you said?
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3783.336,3785.027,They had nothing else to go on.
1973.73-235,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3790.189,3794.392,"Well, as I understand it, the phrase was in the interrogator’s question and the answer was yes."
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3794.392,3797.526,"In some case, and that one I read, but the others it was not."
1973.73-235,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3805.43,3813.254,"In terms of the university -- in terms of the law school’s policy, these people were fully qualified."
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3813.254,3814.812,"Well, that’s a relative matter."
1973.73-235,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3848.814,3869.691,"Yes, but perhaps by old standards the -- perhaps by the standards that part of the people were judged by, these people were qualified, but in terms of the overall policy, admissions policy of the school, the school district people were distracted by their purposes."
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3869.691,3876.186,"I think if you look at the record and you look at the findings of the Courts, you’ll find that they did not."

1973.73-235,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3879.587,3883.663,"In terms of the law school’s goals and their policies, they challenge the people who would --"
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3883.663,3883.969,Let me --
1973.73-235,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3883.969,3884.632,-- satisfy those policies.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3884.632,3885.751,Let me answer that with this --
1973.73-235,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3885.751,3890.759,The question really is whether the law school may have these priorities as preferences.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3890.759,3898.004,"I think if they use the same test for everyone, they would have that right, but let me answer you that with this notation --"
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3898.004,3900.046,"The same test, what test?"
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3905.074,3915.994,"Whatever they use, when you have 1,600 people making application, and you only have room for 150, you’re going to have to make some determination of which are the best qualified."
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3929.013,3931.169,I submit that’s not all you had.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3932.189,3933.143,Let me --
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3933.143,3936.989,"You had all the discovery you could use, if you wanted to use it."
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3936.989,3938.359,We got enough.
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3938.359,3945.003,"Well, I want to show exactly what any of these -- what this has meant for the worst qualifications --"
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3945.003,3945.215,Well --
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3945.215,3946.2,In the record.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3946.2,3949.315,Let me cover this one for just a moment.
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3950.643,3952.123,For the two?
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3952.123,3952.91,What was that?
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3952.91,3953.615,There were two.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,3953.615,3954.968,"Yes, I owned there for two."
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4011.892,4013.602,You have my permission to forget it.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,4013.602,4014.769,Thank you.
1973.73-235,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4014.769,4015.919,May I ask you a question?
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,4015.919,4017.668,Yes.
1973.73-235,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4017.668,4019.439,You don’t want to repeat it?
1973.73-235,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4019.439,4020.629,No.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,4020.629,4022.443,"You may, Justice."
1973.73-235,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4022.443,4034.221,The guide for applicants that you have referred to does not suggest that race is a controlling criteria.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,4079.42,4080.727,"Yes, I think they can."
1973.73-235,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4083.317,4089.148,"Is it your position that if the guide had been followed, you wouldn’t be here today?"
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,4089.148,4090.451,There is no question about that.
1973.73-235,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4090.451,4096.629,"In other words, you’re claiming that the guide, promulgated by authorities, would not in fact apply."
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,4096.629,4097.787,That is correct.
1973.73-235,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4099.015,4099.624,Mr. Diamond.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,4099.624,4099.952,"Yes, sir?"
1973.73-235,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4099.952,4103.644,The Chief Justice will permit me with the red light on.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,4181.188,4182.796,Not at that level.
1973.73-235,4,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4220.202,4223.425,My question was an attempt to get away from race.
1973.73-235,4,30005,josef_diamond,,4235.267,4245.125,I’m not ready to subscribe to the theory that minority clans are looking for minority lawyers or doctors.
1973.73-235,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4258.138,4258.874,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
