2002.02-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.43,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-94, William Overton v. Michelle Bazzetta."
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,9.166,16.968,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the lower courts in this case were wrong for two reasons."
2002.02-94,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,112.243,119.839,"Well, does the right to association while in prison survive in some form, do you think?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,119.839,136.02,--In... the right to have the relationship which is what was actually at issue in Safley with marriage and in the Jones case with prisoner... with the union membership.
2002.02-94,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.206,146.55,"Noncontact visits, aren't we talking about here?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,146.55,154.702,--Noncontact visits but it involves activities inside the secure prison walls in furtherance of the relationship.
2002.02-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.521,170.41,What would exist outside... what relationship are you talking about?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,170.41,186.84,The relationships that the prisoners are asserting are family members beyond the definition of the Michigan prison system... has adopted particularly minor nieces and nephews.
2002.02-94,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.646,194.726,"Well, presumably children of the prisoner are included, are they not?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,194.726,196.333,--Children of the prisoner are included within the definition--
2002.02-94,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.333,200.67,"There are limited... they have to be accompanied by, what is it, a legal guardian?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,200.67,207.933,"--By a family member within the definition or a legal guardian, that's the Michigan regulation."
2002.02-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,207.933,217.964,"As I understand it, the regs originally would have prohibited visits from minor siblings of the prisoner and that has been changed by statute; is that correct?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,217.964,235.797,"There was a statute passed, right at the close of the district court opinion that permitted the Department to permit visits by siblings, the Department changed the regulation to include siblings, minor sibling visits, so that issue is no longer before the courts."
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,235.797,236.047,Excuse me.
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,237.905,238.255,Pardon.
2002.02-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,238.255,244.842,"On the class of visitor eligibility then, what were I going about is nieces and nephew, minor nieces and nephews?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,244.842,254.38,"That is the class with respect to minor children, they also have a contention about former inmates and--"
2002.02-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,254.38,261.726,What is the State's interests in... in restricting visits from minor nieces and nephews of the prisoner?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,261.726,274.935,"--The prison officials testified uniformly that there were serious overcrowding problems, prison management problems, concerns about safety, so the overriding interest was to reduce the volume of visitors."
2002.02-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,274.935,277.786,So it's simply a means of reducing volume?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,281.788,282.881,That's correct.
2002.02-94,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,282.881,286.041,You just want to keep the numbers down and this is one way to do it.
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,286.041,289.84,"To keep the numbers down, the Department is permitted to draw lines."
2002.02-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.955,297.642,Is it also of some concern with the activities of children within the prison as opposed to adults?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,297.642,298.385,"--Oh, absolutely."
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,308.788,316.589,"Mr. Casey, I would like to back up to go where you were when you were responding to Justice O'Connor's question."
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,343.3,344.126,Yes.
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,344.376,350.775,"There is no right to visitation, noncontact visitation at all?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,350.775,351.23,--That's correct.
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,351.23,359.57,So everything that we're arguing about... you... in your view of this is a matter of administrative grace?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,359.57,360.6,That's correct.
2002.02-94,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.6,363.035,Do you have a fallback position from that?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,365.969,371.392,The Court specified three issues and the first issue is whether there is a right to visitation at all.
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,387.35,408.732,"Mr. Casey, would you explain... you have been very clear of what is your position about... round one of this case in the lower courts, when you clarified that your regulations went only to contact visits and then you came around and said it applies to all visits."
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,408.732,415.214,The way the case evolved... the regulations on their face apply to all visitation.
2002.02-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,441.797,445.778,"Well, I got the impression that the State had represented that they... that they covered only contact visitation?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,445.778,455.338,"There were statements in the brief referring to contact visitation, largely because that was the evidence that was adduced at the summary judgment proceeding."
2002.02-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,465.081,466.817,But the Court thought it only applied to contact visitation--
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,466.817,471.851,In the court of appeals' first opinion it held that it applied only to contact.
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.417,485.597,--In the district court the first time around the district court didn't think it was limited to contact?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,485.597,489.684,The district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety on our motion.
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.426,509.253,"But the district court understood that it was dismissing the complaint with respect to any visitation, contact and noncontact, or we just don't know?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,509.253,515.485,--The first order of the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.
2002.02-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.717,541.036,May I ask this question?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,558.043,559.324,Yes.
2002.02-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,573.442,575.178,111 of the joint appendix?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,575.178,576.497,Of the joint appendix.
2002.02-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,576.497,576.785,I see.
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,576.785,580.583,"And it varies... excuse me, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.583,582.729,It limits the number at any one time.
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,587.438,588.014,Yes.
2002.02-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.014,594.618,Why isn't that sufficient to solve the problem of overcrowding and too many... too many people?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,603.617,605.763,That would have been one solution.
2002.02-94,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.221,630.245,"Is there any evidence they found out how many nephews and nieces would be excluded by the rules and, therefore, worked that into the quantity determination, that's a strange way to regulate quantity."
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,630.245,634.248,--They did not know in advance how many nieces and nephews.
2002.02-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,635.613,639.328,"Is there a specific anti-niece... I didn't understand this case, I guess."
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,648.737,650.678,That's essentially what they did.
2002.02-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,650.678,664.507,"And the reason had nothing to do... it had something to do with a lot of people, but basically they think children are more dangerous to the child or more disruptive, because they're younger, harder to discipline, they might run around in the room."
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,677.306,677.799,No.
2002.02-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,678.17,679.573,This is quite interesting to me.
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,679.573,684.941,"--No, that's one of the bases, it would possible to prohibit all children in prisons."
2002.02-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.941,687.253,"No, they don't prohibit all children."
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,692.993,693.159,That's correct.
2002.02-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,693.159,694.662,So we draw a line.
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,697.617,698.277,That's correct.
2002.02-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.277,699.203,Right.
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,699.203,699.403,That's our position.
2002.02-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,699.403,702.425,"So why don't you defend it on that basis, if that's what it is?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,702.425,706.14,"Well, I thought I was, I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,755.097,759.927,Is there any limit on the number of times the same person can come in a given month?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,759.927,760.382,--No.
2002.02-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.447,778.587,What adults are permitted?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,784.818,792.166,The rule permits an inmate to designate immediate family members as defined by the Department and 10 other individuals.
2002.02-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.166,793.447,"Ten others, okay."
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,793.447,801.842,"Now, there are certain prohibitions, former prisoners are prohibited, I think, unless they're a family member and receive the ward's permission."
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.201,826.884,"In relation to the family, this one last question, a child must be accompanied by an adult and you cut that back from any adult on the filing of the affidavit to only an immediate family member."
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,834.808,839.349,"--No, it includes spouses, but it would include, it would include--"
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,839.349,841.661,But an unwed father would not be a spouse?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,857.061,865.81,"--The child can visit if the child, you know, is the biological child, but the child has to be brought by a member of the immediate family."
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,865.81,870.807,But the unwed father would be a member of the child's immediate family.
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,870.807,871.3,That's correct.
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,871.3,873.074,Although not of the mother's immediate family?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,873.074,873.446,That's correct.
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.07,880.632,The mother is in prison?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,880.632,884.885,But someone other than the unwed father would have to bring--
2002.02-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,884.885,886.826,The unwed father would not qualify?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,886.826,888.312,--He is not qualified--
2002.02-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.312,889.593,Unless he's the guardian?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,889.593,891.701,"--If he is the legal guardian, yes."
2002.02-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.701,892.544,"If he's the legal guardian, he would?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,892.544,892.71,Yes.
2002.02-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.047,903.939,"A close enough family relationship despite the lack of the wedding bond, he would probably be the guardian, I would guess, wouldn't he?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,903.939,914.153,"The guardian in fact, perhaps, but the Department is permitted to insist on enough evidence to demonstrate the legal relationship."
2002.02-94,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,924.168,927.883,This is a facial challenge not as an as-applied?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,935.851,944.601,--These rules could be challenged as an... on an as-applied basis but we did go through a complete trial on the merits here.
2002.02-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,959.878,963.982,"A particular person brought this action, did they not?"
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,965.347,966.666,--Yes.
2002.02-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.266,971.374,And she was an inmate somewhere?
2002.02-94,0,42549,thomas_l_casey,,971.374,972.117,--She was an inmate.
2002.02-94,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,986.439,987.942,"Very well, Mr. Casey."
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,988.957,1002.703,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
2002.02-94,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1015.334,1030.733,"But, Mr. Lamken, you are then agreeing with Mr. Casey that there is right of... no right to any visitation, contact, noncontact, that what right... what privilege is extended is a matter of administrative grace?"
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1030.733,1032.507,"That is our initial position, yes."
2002.02-94,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1034.448,1046.997,"On your initial position, in your view, under a scheme like this could complete discretion be given to the warden to determine who gets the visitation and who does not?"
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1053.108,1054.965,Not necessarily.
2002.02-94,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1066.77,1068.795,I know it isn't an issue here.
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1081.714,1083.777,--The answer is not necessarily.
2002.02-94,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1095.294,1098.432,"As you read these regulations, does the warden have the complete discretion?"
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1098.432,1101.238,"--Well, it's not a question of what the content of the regulations are."
2002.02-94,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1114.779,1122.648,"And under that standard, do you think the warden should have complete discretion to deny anybody for any reason visiting privileges?"
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1122.648,1124.727,We think that's a very difficult question.
2002.02-94,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.962,1166.27,Then how would you distinguish the holding in Turner against Safley pertaining to the right to marry?
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1166.27,1167.99,"--On two bases, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-94,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1207.204,1212.656,Do all prisons allow some form of visitation for prisoners?
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1216.121,1227.433,"It is a universally accepted practice, that for certain prisoners under proper conditions, certain visits, will aid in rehabilitation and that is the accepted view and one that the Bureau of Prisons firmly supports."
2002.02-94,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1227.433,1228.093,Right.
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1237.835,1243.613,"Well, that, Justice O'Connor, is a matter of penological philosophy, but not a matter of constitutional right."
2002.02-94,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1254.182,1259.383,"Well, why isn't the Turner/Safley rule quite adequate here to deal with this?"
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1259.383,1264.047,"--Well, Your Honor, you could decide it... actually Turner v. Safley, as we read it has two components."
2002.02-94,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1289.022,1311.851,"But to the first, if you're right on the first point, which is what is disturbing about the first point, a prisoner would have no right whatsoever to any kind of visit or communication or association with outside people, even if there were virtually no penological reason for doing that?"
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1315.028,1318.826,"Justice Breyer, I think part... when you say communication, I wouldn't go that far."
2002.02-94,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1319.858,1321.965,You say that because that's what's that the cases seem to say.
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1323.756,1333.028,"--Well, in fact, what incarceration cuts off and what the punishment of incarceration is is the physical separation of the inmate from the rest of society."
2002.02-94,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.103,1354.304,You're thinking of cases where that's justified what the prison is doing.
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1361.446,1370.241,"--Well, I think the answer is, the very essence of the punishment of incarceration is separation from society and the vesting of exceptions thereto in corrections officials."
2002.02-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.34,1391.539,"You would say that even if... even if the prison... even if the prison administration is unjustified in refusing to allow the prison a furlough out into society, even if a thoroughly trustworthy prisoner, you would still say he has no right to?"
2002.02-94,1,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1391.539,1392.654,--Absolutely.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1631.524,1634.291,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court."
2002.02-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1672.679,1680.36,So there's nothing in the district... in the district court's opinion or order that clarifies that?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1680.36,1680.853,No.
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1714.29,1716.769,Did the case go to the Sixth Circuit twice?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1716.769,1717.883,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1741.039,1747.605,Is that particular procedural history significant in what we decide on the issues before us?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1747.605,1755.118,"I think that it is not significant, only to clarify one point, the issue of whether the siblings are before this Court."
2002.02-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1781.246,1786.076,But their position is they have the right to say no to all children?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1786.076,1792.103,"That's correct, Your Honor, including siblings, children, that it is all a matter of discretion."
2002.02-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1792.103,1797.388,"So their position is not different with respect to a child, a grandchild, a sibling."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1810.02,1811.878,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.367,1842.713,"Is it unconstitutional then, and this is why I'm reluctant to get this Court into a whole new line of constitutional law... is it unconstitutional to send a prisoner from the East Coast to a prison far removed from his family and friends?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1842.713,1843.539,"Certainly not, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.539,1844.365,Why not?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1844.365,1849.4,Because that is a collateral consequence of something that happens to prisoners.
2002.02-94,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1853.697,1857.496,Suppose they do it for the purpose of denying the prisoner the contact?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1857.496,1871.53,"I think that if they are targeting the intimate associational rights at issue, if that is the purpose that we are going to target the intimate associational rights, then a fundamental right has arisen and then it's a Turner question."
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.53,1872.85,You're not targeting the rights.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1902.466,1923.066,"I think that, Your Honor, what's going on here is that the decision to slice deeply into the family and to make that decision as to who gets to visit and who doesn't goes directly to, and that's exactly what they did, they said, here are minors and we're going to select out certain intimate associations, we're going to slice--"
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.066,1940.527,"We're going to have to pass on one by one nieces, nephews, grandchildren, illegitimate children, children of... one by one, all of these are constitutional questions, on the theory, I suppose, that what is truly stupid must be unconstitutional."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1940.527,1943.871,"--I think you don't have to for two reasons, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1964.117,1978.522,What... what is the basis of the... is this some kind of a facial challenge to the whole scheme of regulating noncontact visits?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1978.522,1980.296,"No, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1980.956,1981.866,What is it?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,1984.755,1985.498,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.24,1999.632,"Well, what... what happened to Mrs. Bazzetta who wrote this... who brought this action?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2003.498,2007.213,"The... Your Honor, the... it was a class action."
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.039,2008.222,I know it was a class action.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2008.222,2019.845,--one of the... what happened is that she... her sister wanted to bring in her newborn child to visit Ms. Bazzetta and that would have been the nieces and nephews which were precluded.
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2022.157,2023.643,But her sister wanted to.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2026.427,2031.528,--The... Ms. Bazzetta was denied the visit with her niece and nephew.
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.212,2035.986,Ms. Bazzetta is the inmate?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2035.986,2037.201,Is the inmate.
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.069,2051.59,"And what else did Ms. Bazzetta challenge that had happened to her, besides the visit from her sister?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2051.59,2056.047,Ms. Bazzetta challenged only the denial of her ability to see her nieces and nephew.
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.043,2067.565,"Well, how... how can one of them represent an entire class then if each of them is challenging something different?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2067.565,2074.79,"--We had class representatives, Your Honor, that were certified as adequate to represent each of the interests in which we presented to the Court."
2002.02-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2074.79,2078.793,Is the claim a First Amendment claim or what?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2084.616,2098.196,"With regard to the categorical restrictions on the minor siblings, children, nieces and nephews, it is both a First and Fourteenth Amendment claim of intimate association, and family association."
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.032,2130.397,"What, where... where--"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2130.397,2130.852,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.852,2132.709,--Where do you get this out of the Constitution?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2132.709,2138.449,"I think that I get it from the Court's decisions in Moore, in Roberts and that this Court has already said that--"
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.449,2145.052,"Well, Roberts was a case involving whether you can get into the Jaycees or not, not whether you could get out of prison."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2145.052,2152.938,"--I think that you're correct, Your Honor, in that the Roberts edicta, which everyone has relied upon in this case, is what I'm referring to."
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.99,2162.848,"Well, Moore was a zoning case."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2164.827,2173.333,"--It had nothing to do with prisons, Your Honor, but it did identify that there are intimate associational rights involved in families choosing--"
2002.02-94,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2173.333,2189.801,"But... but when in the prison context, we've had specific cases and have tried to articulate some governing principles outlined largely in Turner v. Safley about what the prison can do and not do."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2197.52,2216.346,"--I think that... I think that Turner is the governing case in here and in fact, I think if... further that if these rules, if this is not affirmed it would be... do great damage to the Turner case, because what Turner says is when you have these fundamental rights, that then you look to extreme deference to the Corrections Department."
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.346,2223.238,"But Turner assumes the question that we've been immediately discussing, that there is a fundamental right."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2253.248,2254.817,"No, I don't think--"
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.817,2257.706,"It's a pretty intimate family association that you're cutting off there, isn't it?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2257.706,2265.098,"--I think that although some States certainly allow it, it's certainly not constitutionally required, because there is two prongs of Turner."
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.768,2277.784,You can arrange for it.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2277.784,2277.818,If every--
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.818,2278.677,You can arrange for it.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2278.677,2281.278,--You can arrange for it.
2002.02-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.993,2303.652,"Well, that's where we have... Mr. Lamken clarified that... that there is a right of expression, and that's why he said you couldn't cut off letters."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2338.575,2341.259,"--Yes, I think that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.251,2375.113,"Well, all that is true, but I thought... I thought that this case... it's much more complicated than I thought."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2447.763,2478.228,"--And I think, Justice Breyer, what's wrong with that is that it's not the business of the Department of Corrections to start making decisions once you decide that family members and children can come in, that to make decisions as to which family members are close... which... for those people who are 18, 17, 16, who have no children but wanted to see their only family member, which was their brother or sister, the questions--"
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.228,2480.54,"They've now dealt with that, I take it."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2490.199,2490.488,--No.
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2490.488,2491.231,--an injunction.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2504.317,2510.14,I think that the question is whether it's reasonable to slice off certain family members and there's a penological--
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2510.14,2510.883,"They say, sure, it's reasonable?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2510.883,2511.376,--interest in doing it.
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2511.376,2512.202,Sure it's reasonable.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2522.028,2531.11,Because it is total discretion on what constitutes the family and who comes in and it interferes with the fundamental right at issue here which is--
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2531.11,2550.885,"Can't they... can't they regulate categorically rather than just tuning it to each particular family to say that your own children are in a different class than siblings or nieces or nephews and say one can... I mean, the whole thing is line-drawn."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2553.773,2562.895,"--I think that's true that you can draw lines, and you can draw lines that are content-neutral with regard to the family, because that's what the concern was here, volume."
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.123,2583.95,"Well, of course."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2623.536,2638.685,The... the record in this case is that the warden had neither discretion or at least the wardens that testified felt they had neither discretion to allow minor siblings in and... or do they have any discretion whatsoever with regard to the permanent ban.
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.685,2650.945,"Of course, Ms. LaBelle, once you leap over the... the prior constitutional question, as Justice Breyer has and go immediately to Turner v. Safley, we are in the line-drawing business."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2690.492,2695.116,"I think that, Your Honor, they did arbitrarily here, they denied all minor siblings--"
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.116,2696.436,Solution in search of a problem.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2696.808,2700.03,"--They denied... excuse me, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.828,2714.026,What do you mean they couldn't?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2738.879,2748.0,"The testimony of the warden was if you were not on the... the visiting list, Your Honor, you could come in during the time that you were waiting to get cleared."
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2751.51,2752.624,I don't understand.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2752.624,2759.517,"--The testimony of the warden was that if by policy you were prohibited, then there could be no exception to policy."
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2759.6,2771.943,"He said there's no exception, if, in fact, a prisoner has raised a 6-year old child just as it's his own child, but, in fact, there's no formal adoption paper."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2775.204,2783.377,--There's testimony that... that there was no ability for wardens to make exceptions with regard to policy decisions.
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.637,2810.376,I'm not concerned... although I believe you also said that there were... their own children weren't allowed in.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2811.778,2828.497,The example of that was actually that there was... some testimony with regard to Justice Ginsburg's example with regard to the... the father of the child who was unwed could not... and who had custody of the child but was not the legal guardian could not bring the child in to visit.
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2829.407,2836.466,"No... so, in other words, you have to be the legal guardian of the child if it's not your child, in order to have a visit?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2836.466,2838.202,--If you were not... no.
2002.02-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2853.739,2857.537,"The relationship that counts is the relationship to the prisoner, not to the child?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2857.537,2858.463,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2858.463,2897.911,"And the unwed parent would not be related to the prisoner, but you have on that list, let's assume we're past the basic question and there is some constitutional right, you have on the list a person whose parental rights have been terminated, and you would allow that person a right that doesn't exist outside the prison, in other words, once a parental relationship has been terminated, there is no visitation right, according in the larger society, but you would say that it's arbitrary in the prison setting to deny that?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2897.911,2899.769,"I think... yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2916.897,2938.052,"Well, then it's no right of yours, if... if you... if the legal parent wants to allow someone with no parental rights, but you've... as far as the law is concerned, as far as any right is concerned, a person who has... whose parental rights have been terminated is a stranger to the child."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,2950.212,2956.9,--I think the protection for intimate association on the outside is not limited to legal relationships.

2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3046.685,3052.341,--I think there has to be some reasonable justification for infringing on the right.
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3076.051,3083.344,"Ms. LaBelle, are you asking them to exercise their expertise on a subcategory of children basis?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3141.384,3144.523,"Yes, because that was the concern articulated."
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3157.36,3170.529,"Well, then you would say the burden would be on the... on the prison to say despite the number regulation, this one can't get in as opposed to the burden on the prisoner saying despite your regulation, an exception ought to be made for me?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3171.56,3172.303,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3172.303,3172.669,All right.

2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3198.941,3200.161,"Well, do you think that's fair?"

2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3242.187,3250.443,"Because, first if, in fact, you limited the number of children down to such a minuscule amount of minors that had no relationship with their concerns with--"
2002.02-94,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3250.443,3253.044,"Well, it would be anything under nine just on--"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3258.495,3264.068,"--But they allow that amount, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3286.979,3287.351,Let me ask you--
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3287.351,3288.382,--and there's not.
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3288.382,3288.921,--I'm sorry.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3290.135,3290.961,"No, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3291.621,3300.704,--How do you square your argument on content-neutral with respect to child visitation?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3333.314,3337.751,"I think that the... what they do is, for adults, there's a 10 limit there."
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3337.751,3345.453,"No, no, just as a threshold question, are you going to apply your... your content neutral-theory across the board to adults, as well as children?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3345.453,3350.858,"Yes, absent there being a rationale or a specific security concern, which is--"
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3350.858,3354.135,And it would be the burden of the prison to show that in a given case?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3354.135,3357.917,"--I think that if you're doing a categorical restriction, it is their burden."
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3358.949,3364.029,"I thought you were saying the only categorical restriction you can make is visitors, nonvisitors."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3371.746,3387.639,"--No, I think that you can have individual requirements as many States do with regard to a rational basis to say someone who has been out of this prison for 6 months, we're not going to allow you to come in, because it's... there's a rational basis."
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3387.639,3387.822,Okay.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3396.555,3397.548,I think because--
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3397.548,3399.527,Or are you merely quantifying?
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3399.527,3411.582,"--I think that because there was absolutely no basis, the only concerns... I think because it was a different... a deference to the different concerns articulated, the concern with regard to minors was simply volume."
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3415.092,3422.522,"So you're... so you're saying, look we will take their rationale at their word, and if we take it, this is the only limitation that they could put on?"
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3422.522,3422.977,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3422.977,3423.348,Okay.
2002.02-94,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3423.348,3423.348,And the limitation by the way in--
2002.02-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3423.348,3432.969,"--But if you... but if you spread to other prisoners, then you're going beyond the constitutional right that you've identified as intimate association."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3439.384,3441.037,"May I answer the question, Your Honor?"
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3441.037,3444.092,You may answer the question briefly.
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3444.092,3454.762,I think that the general right there was both a general associational right that you have to companionships with loved ones as well as an equal protection argument.
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3454.762,3455.898,"Thank you, Ms. LaBelle."
2002.02-94,2,21112,deborah_labelle,,3455.898,3456.435,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.02-94,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3456.435,3458.748,"Mr. Casey, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2002.02-94,3,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3458.748,3464.526,I would just like to clear up a couple of points initially.
2002.02-94,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3502.671,3512.785,"And do I understand your position that you don't get to any Turner against Safley question, because there's simply no right to beginning with, no right that can be shown?"
2002.02-94,3,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3512.785,3514.355,"That's our initial position, yes."
2002.02-94,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3639.285,3641.786,"If you have a minute, I have one factual question?"
2002.02-94,3,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3641.786,3642.779,I would be happy to.
2002.02-94,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3642.779,3652.643,"From the brief from the respondents, I just want this clarified, there are a certain number of prisoners who have families and they have children, but they aren't legally married."
2002.02-94,3,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3674.191,3683.729,The... a child of a prisoner is entitled to visit if they're brought by a member of the immediate family or a legal guardian.
2002.02-94,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3683.729,3685.048,Whether they're married or not married?
2002.02-94,3,42549,thomas_l_casey,,3685.048,3685.708,That's correct.
2002.02-94,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3685.708,3686.246,Thank you.
2002.02-94,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3686.246,3687.444,"Thank you, Mr. Casey."
