1988.88-681,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.056,"We'll have argument next in No. 88-681, Tyler v. David Ray Jenkins."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,28.483,33.064,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-681,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.871,121.762,"Mr. Tyler, there is kind of a procedural wrinkle in this case, isn't there, in that... it comes up because your client in effect was held in contempt for disobeying an injunction?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,121.762,121.922,That's correct.
1988.88-681,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,121.922,128.047,"Do you think the Ninth Circuit in this case, or the bankruptcy courts, did more than just interpret the terms of the injunction?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,128.047,140.045,"Yes, I do, for the simple reason that the injunction is circumscribed by the judgment underlying it and that judgment in turn is circumscribed by the pleadings brought by the parties underlying the adversary complaint."
1988.88-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.6,164.08,I don't understand that answer.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,172.327,173.109,--No.
1988.88-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,176.023,182.316,"You mean no court has ever issued a judgment which went beyond what the court could do, legally?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,182.316,186.028,That was not the case presented in this situation.
1988.88-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.364,197.127,"Well, nobody ever means to do that, but the question is whether it did so."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,208.554,208.945,Yes.
1988.88-681,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.375,223.557,"But then the bankruptcy appellate panel reversed that, didn't it?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,223.557,233.915,"Yes, but the Bankruptcy Court itself obviously knew what it had in mind in framing its original order and I think that that construction is one which should be paid deference on appeal."
1988.88-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,233.915,236.799,"Well, we ought to get out of the business of interpreting statutes, then."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,247.129,250.831,But the Bankruptcy Court... what you have here is a nebulous phrase.
1988.88-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,256.397,265.103,Could you have stipulated to an injunction which would forbid you from collecting tax from an ultimate user?
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,265.103,269.544,"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean by the ultimate user."
1988.88-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,269.544,283.035,"Well, suppose... suppose the judge said I'm going to enter an injunction and you can't tax this transaction, and you can't tax ultimate use based on the exempt nature of this transaction."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,284.886,286.118,I believe so.
1988.88-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,287.346,287.517,All right.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,302.497,304.72,No.
1988.88-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,309.605,312.477,"Well, that's the second question."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,330.83,336.443,"--If in fact that was the intent of the court, the Bankruptcy Court, to enter such a judgment, yes."
1988.88-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.231,338.142,All right.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,361.007,380.991,"--It was clear that the intent of the parties and the understanding of the parties and the Bankruptcy Court in 1983, when the original adversary judgment was entered, was simply that it only related... that judgment only related to the taxability of the debtor and the estate through the trustee and that... it begs reason--"
1988.88-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,380.991,386.315,"Well, if that's true then that's the end of the case and we never reach the Goggin principle."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,386.315,386.505,--No.
1988.88-681,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.993,413.086,Is this all part of one proceeding?
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,422.629,428.213,I... it's hard to answer that question.
1988.88-681,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.287,450.239,Okay.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,456.524,458.156,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.658,523.679,Suppose there was no Section 960.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,523.679,524.43,Excuse me?
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,524.43,529.142,Suppose there was no 960?
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,533.817,545.793,"Because the courts, previous to the enactment of 960, had been engaging in essentially Socratic dialogue, splitting hairs over whether or not a bankruptcy trustee was doing business or not doing business."
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.793,547.324,"Well, what if he was?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,547.324,552.219,They were finding states' tax statutes inapplicable on the--
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,552.219,563.486,Is the problem that the bankruptcy trustee is a Federal Instrumentality and there's some argument that you can't tax a Federal Instrumentality?
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,563.486,566.058,--Conceivably that would be the situation.
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.058,568.068,"Well, did any court ever hold that?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,568.068,570.261,Goggin II did.
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.261,570.89,Uh-huh.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,579.245,579.606,No.
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.042,589.322,So they didn't need 960?
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,589.322,600.071,"--No, they did not need it, but the courts had been mired in a construction... essentially, a fruitless construction... splitting hairs over what was the conduct of business, what wasn't the conduct of business."
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.368,619.756,"So absent 960, your submission is that the sales tax could surely have been imposed on the sale of this estate."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,619.756,631.603,"The only question remaining then would be one of intergovernmental tax immunity and that is the only question that actually is in this case, according to our view and we believe that that's a well-founded view."
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.603,634.605,I thought you said that we had already decided that there wasn't any such thing.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,634.605,637.276,As intergovernmental tax immunity?
1988.88-681,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.276,639.067,"No, in this bankruptcy situation."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,646.473,649.045,"Yes, that's true."
1988.88-681,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.777,1468.961,"Mr. Tyler, can I interrupt you to go back to the problem that some of us... some of my colleagues raised at the outset?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1481.337,1484.91,The order I'm seeking is a dissolution of the contempt citation.
1988.88-681,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.91,1488.434,"Would that require a vacation of the injunction, too?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1516.382,1523.988,"Well, obviously our contention is that the injunction entered had nothing to do with the taxation activities at issue in this case."
1988.88-681,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.889,1530.343,"But if that's true, we don't reach all the Goggin issues, if that's true."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1530.343,1543.52,"--Well, under the Goggin analysis you do have to reach them, because Goggin provides this... Goggin utilizes this elaborate hypothetical, or elaborate rather arcane structure of in lieu of taxes and creates these bootstraps, consecutive bootstraps."
1988.88-681,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1568.528,1574.202,"I must confess, I'm still puzzled about how reversing Goggin helps you in this case."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1578.613,1585.938,"Well, on the first line, we felt that we should have won in the Ninth Circuit under the debtor's reorganizer's rationale."
1988.88-681,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.938,1589.902,"--And of course you might have won if you'd objected to the entry of the injunction, or appealed from that."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1589.902,1593.034,But there was no reason to appeal from that injunction.
1988.88-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1595.204,1602.0,Did... did that injunction bar you from collecting a use tax on the purchaser at the time of the sale?
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1602.0,1602.611,--No.
1988.88-681,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1614.84,1614.99,No.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1621.944,1630.272,--But the other parties... in turn it has to be limited by the pleadings underlying the judgment itself and that is all that the trustee asked for.
1988.88-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.413,1665.113,"Well, you litigated that and lost it and didn't appeal, though didn't you?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1665.113,1665.724,That's correct.
1988.88-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.724,1667.744,So it's too late.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1667.744,1669.296,No.
1988.88-681,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.296,1670.809,"No, you want to raise it again?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1670.809,1674.009,"Why... why... why... and, I'm sorry, I don't mean to argue with you."
1988.88-681,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.978,1723.813,That goes to the question whether the use tax can be imposed by the leases by the purchaser of the equipment.
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1723.813,1724.073,Yes.
1988.88-681,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.073,1733.089,"But if you're right on Goggin, your fundamental position, you really could have objected to the injunction against the collection of the sales tax, couldn't you?"
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1733.089,1734.2,That is correct.
1988.88-681,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1742.247,1749.191,"But we don't have to reach that question here and indeed, probably can't."
1988.88-681,0,40615,robert_f_tyler_jr,,1771.747,1777.14,"No, this Court can also state that the previous injunction was improperly entered."
1988.88-681,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1824.522,1827.744,"Very well, Mr. Tyler."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,1829.006,1834.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.88-681,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.96,1854.401,The court of appeals seemed to me in its opinion to have reached the merits.
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,1855.863,1859.346,I think the Court of Appeals discussed the merits.
1988.88-681,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1859.346,1862.165,At great length... not much else.
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,1862.165,1879.489,"Basically, what was admitted before the court of appeal was that the injunction was intended to enjoin whatever Goggin II proscribed and that's why they discussed the merits of what Goggin II proscribes compared to what was going on in this case."
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.326,1925.03,But you didn't read the whole sentence... have liability in connection with the particular transaction before the Court.
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,1925.03,1926.72,--That's correct.
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.72,1930.433,"And this transaction that the tax was imposed on occurred quite a while later, didn't it?"
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,1930.433,1931.154,"No, Your Honor."
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.678,1939.291,"Well, I understand that, but they didn't actually try to collect it until sometime later."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,1939.291,1941.832,--They came back and tried to collect it later.
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.832,1944.443,After there had been leases of the equipment.
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,1944.443,1950.827,"That's correct, Your Honor, but the tax that they're trying to collect is only due because no sales tax--"
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1950.827,1958.064,"Well, I understand that legal argument and the party from whom they're trying to collect it was not a party to the case that you read from the pleading."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,1958.064,1959.055,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1968.942,1973.137,"Well, the district... the judge who entered the injunction didn't think so, but apparently the Court of Appeals did."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,1973.137,1988.937,"I would agree with counsel for the Petitioner that as an ordinary rule of construction, if you're looking at an order or a judgment that's entered by a court, that you ought to give some deference to what that judge thinks it means."
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.6,2045.898,But then is it not correct that either the meaning or the accuracy of the Goggin doctrine is before us because that's what illuminates the meaning of the underlying order.
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2065.672,2070.092,I think that what the Court needs to determine is what the Goggin case means.
1988.88-681,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.893,2094.829,"Well certainly, we aren't going to ordinarily take a case in order to construe something that the Ninth Circuit said 40 years ago."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2094.829,2096.331,I would think not.
1988.88-681,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.331,2111.09,"But as Justice Stevens pointed out, under our Tuttle case it's your obligation, it it's nonjurisdictional point you want to raise, in your response to the petition for certiorari to point out that we can't reach the issue that the Petitioner seeks to reach."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2111.09,2114.252,I did not do that.
1988.88-681,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2126.15,2128.383,xxx.
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2128.383,2128.653,"No, Your Honor."
1988.88-681,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.972,2144.105,"Well, that's sort of like a defense and if you don't ever raise it, you can't just raise it any time you want to."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2144.105,2146.536,"--Your Honor, I did raise that in my brief."
1988.88-681,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.536,2147.257,"No, you didn't."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2151.4,2153.66,"No, Your Honor, I did not."
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2209.93,2221.138,Let me just make one other... ask you one other question about the Court of Appeals opinion.
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2253.778,2258.612,That was not my impression when I argued before them and it's not the way I read that opinion.
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.612,2258.963,It is not?
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2258.963,2264.218,Because they specifically say that they're bound by Goggin I and Goggin II.
1988.88-681,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.218,2271.352,"Right, they're bound by it in a precedential sense and as a panel they don't have the power to overrule a Ninth Circuit precedent that's been on the books for 30 years."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2281.87,2293.287,"Again, my understanding from having been there was that they felt that Goggin II not only bound them but absolutely and very clearly controlled this issue."
1988.88-681,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.746,2319.778,"Let me just refer you to one part of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, at page A4 of the petition where Judge Noonan says the Board suggests that Goggin II was wrongly decided."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2356.463,2360.156,"I must be reading that differently from you, Your Honor."
1988.88-681,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.675,2394.517,"Yes, I believe that, but it seems to me the reason they say they're not going to change it is because the panel can't overrule an earlier decision and doesn't want to overrule it, not that the parties before them have no... have no right to have a decision on the merits."
1988.88-681,1,21038,david_ray_jenkins,,2394.517,2418.623,"In another part of the decision, the court also makes reference to the fact that they could have litigated this issue on an appeal from the injunction and that it's now too late."
