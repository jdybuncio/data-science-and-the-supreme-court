2013.12-696,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 12-696, the Town of Greece v. Galloway."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,8.27,11.122,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-696,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,27.483,41.493,"Mr. Hungar, I'm wondering what you would think of the following: Suppose that as we began this session of the Court, the Chief Justice had called a minister up to the front of the courtroom, facing the lawyers, maybe the parties, maybe the spectators."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,75.848,77.666,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,92.193,92.643,"Well, the question--"
2013.12-696,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,92.643,98.93,The extension just between the legislature and any other official proceeding; is that correct?
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,98.93,107.869,"Well, clearly, Marsh involves legislative prayer, the tradition that we rely on involves legislative prayer, and this case involves legislative prayer."
2013.12-696,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,112.173,121.779,"Suppose I ask the exact same question, same kinds of statements, same sort of context, except it's not in a courtroom."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,145.56,157.302,"I think that's a -- that's a closer question because of the congressional history, but, of course, at least as far as I'm aware, they have this history as it applies to the legislative body as a whole, not to committees, but it would be a different question."
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.106,165.106,We should -- we should--
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,165.106,168.843,"--is that people are compelled to attend and testify under oath, which is a different situation from the one here."
2013.12-696,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,168.843,169.443,"Well, why--"
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,169.443,188.571,"--We should assume -- to, to make it parallel to what occurred here that the next day before the same committee a Muslim would lead the invocation and the day after that an orthodox Jew."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,189.839,190.656,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.656,207.051,--it makes a difference whether it's just one -- one denomination that is being used as -- as chaplain or open to various denominations.
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,207.051,207.801,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,214.955,215.841,"--But the question, Mr. Hungar--"
2013.12-696,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,215.841,249.212,"--Suppose you are correct, Mr. Hungar, for 11 years the prayers sounded almost exclusively like the ones that I read, and one year on four occasions, there was some attempts to vary it up, to have a Baha'i minister or a -- a Wiccan, but for the most part, not out of any malice or anything like that, but because this is what the people in this community knew and were familiar with and what most of the ministers were, most of the prayers sounded like this."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,249.212,251.664,"Well, no."
2013.12-696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.699,265.673,"--But your position is that wouldn't matter, as I understand, because you have -- you have -- you have two limitations, proselytizing and disparaging."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,302.013,305.881,This case is about prayer at the beginning of a legislative session.
2013.12-696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.259,333.532,Why -- why was it that you so promptly answered Justice Kagan's question to the effect that this would be a violation?
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,337.0,337.852,I'm sorry.
2013.12-696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.052,343.773,"The first question Justice Kagan asked you, the hypothetical about the prayer in this Court."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,348.758,363.901,"Well, perhaps I conceded too much, but I think the important distinction is between the -- both the judicial context and the legislative context on the one hand and the -- the absence of a -- of a comparable history that shows that it did not--"
2013.12-696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,363.901,368.455,"Well, is it -- is it simply history that makes -- there's no rational explanation?"
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,370.24,374.525,"--No, it's not -- it's not a question of historical aberration."
2013.12-696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,375.325,377.061,"Well, what's -- what's the justification for the distinction?"
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,377.061,383.398,"--It's a question of what the Establishment Clause has understood, both at the time and throughout history, to forbid and not to forbid."
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.404,396.575,"But you -- but you -- you had no problem, Mr. Hungar, with the marshal's announcement at the -- at the beginning of this session."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,402.277,404.745,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.262,406.362,So that's okay?
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,406.362,407.128,--Yes.
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.128,410.08,Why -- why is that okay?
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,410.08,412.067,Whether -- if -- perhaps I misunderstood the hypothetical.
2013.12-696,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,444.038,453.894,"Would it make a difference in your analysis if instead of, as I understand the hypothetical, there was a point of saying, all rise or something of that sort?"
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,479.193,496.054,"I don't think that is constitutionally significant, unless -- I mean, it might be different if people are compelled to stand, but whether they are or not -- I mean, in the Marsh case itself, Senator Chambers testified that the practice in the Nebraska legislature was for people to stand and he felt coerced to stand."
2013.12-696,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,513.164,523.556,"I wonder how far you can carry the -- your historical argument and whether some of these things are properly regarded as more historical artifacts, right?"
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,530.126,531.395,"Yes, sir."
2013.12-696,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,531.395,539.815,"But wouldn't we look at it differently if there were -- suddenly if there were a proposal today for the first time, to say let's adopt a motto “ In God we trust ”?"
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,566.366,568.351,Not necessarily.
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.316,619.183,I don't really understand your -- your answer.
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,632.61,633.193,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.193,645.084,"If it was constitutional in the past, why -- why would it be unconstitutional if the same thing is done today, even without any past parallel practice."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,650.405,675.02,"I think this Court's precedents have also indicated, at least in some cases, that if -- if a practice is constitutional, as we know it to be the case because of the fact that it has been understood to be constitutional and consistent with our religion clauses from the founding, other practices that have no greater impact, no greater tendency to establish religion, are equally constitutional."
2013.12-696,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,676.753,685.293,Is there -- is there any constitutional historical practice with respect to this hybrid body?
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,715.264,717.264,"Yes, Your Honor, in two respects."
2013.12-696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,745.449,752.353,"Well, if we had a -- if we had a series of cases, what -- what is a -- a utility rate-making board would come to the Supreme Court."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,758.857,778.504,"Well, Your Honor, whatever -- whatever line might be drawn between non-legislative bodies and legislative bodies, what we are talking about here is a legislative meeting of a legislative body, and it would be -- it would be incongruous, as this Court said in Marsh, if Congress could have legislative prayers and the States couldn't."
2013.12-696,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.77,784.491,"Well, the essence of the argument is we've always done it this way, which has some -- some force to it."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,787.626,788.776,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,815.795,818.062,May I ask you about the individual plaintiffs here.
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,834.257,834.624,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,848.934,851.219,"Well, what about the public forum part?"
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,853.803,854.255,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,854.255,855.121,Do we know what they spoke about?
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,855.121,865.895,"Well, on at least one occasion one of them spoke about the prayer -- or on one or two occasions; and then on multiple occasions spoke about a cable access channel issue."
2013.12-696,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,865.895,868.228,And what did they -- what was the issue there?
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,868.228,878.286,Something about -- she was expressing vehement disagreement with the town's decision to award a cable access channel to one entity as opposed to another.
2013.12-696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,878.286,905.62,"Do you have any objection to -- to doing one thing that was suggested in the circuit court opinion, which is to publicize rather thoroughly in -- in the area that those who were not Christians, and perhaps not even religious, are also welcome to appear and to have either a prayer or the equivalent if they're not religious?"
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,907.722,908.655,Certainly not.
2013.12-696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,909.389,916.245,"Well, then -- then there -- is there a disagreement on that point, because certainly, that was one of the concerns."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,934.457,940.193,"--I -- I don't know what the town's position would be on that, but it -- certainly, there would be no constitutional problem with doing that."
2013.12-696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,941.81,942.176,"No, no."
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,958.655,965.976,"--But, Your Honor, it's a perfectly rational approach when -- when any legislative body is going to have a practice of legislative prayer, to go to the houses of worship in the community."
2013.12-696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.976,967.111,I'm not saying it's not.
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,970.013,977.985,"Well, I certainly don't think it is constitutionally required, although I would note that as a practical matter that has happened here in 2007."
2013.12-696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,977.985,991.476,"--Do you -- would you have -- if all that were left in the case were the question of you're making a good faith effort to try to include others, would you object to doing it?"
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,991.476,994.578,I don't know what the town's position is on that.
2013.12-696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.184,1003.501,Yes.
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1009.755,1010.457,--As I say--
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.457,1015.159,"Mr. Hungar, what -- what is the equivalent of prayer for somebody who is not religious?"
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1015.159,1017.444,--I would--
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.444,1019.312,What would somebody who is not religious--
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1019.312,1020.995,--In the Rubin--
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.995,1022.597,--what is the equivalent of prayer?
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1022.597,1027.482,--It would be some invocation of guidance and wisdom from--
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1027.482,1028.334,From what?
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1028.334,1028.868,--I don't know.
2013.12-696,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1036.072,1037.607,I suppose a moment--
2013.12-696,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1037.607,1039.49,Perhaps he's asking me that question and I can answer it later.
2013.12-696,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1041.742,1042.809,I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
2013.12-696,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1042.809,1044.211,Yes.
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1053.7,1059.538,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-696,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1090.825,1101.014,And what was the purpose of Marsh saying that proselytizing or damning another religion would be a constitutional violation?
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1101.014,1101.931,So we agree with--
2013.12-696,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1101.931,1110.87,"So unless you parse the prayers, you can't determine whether there's proselytizing or damnation."
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1118.658,1123.296,"--So, Your Honor, you have to look at -- at the prayer to determine proselytizing."
2013.12-696,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1131.7,1133.418,"Now, seriously, counselor."
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1149.012,1149.812,"--So, Your Honor--"
2013.12-696,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1149.812,1150.647,This is sectarian.
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1150.647,1152.23,--We agree that these are sectarian.
2013.12-696,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1166.389,1168.158,So let's talk about the context instead of prayer.
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1177.347,1182.066,"Your Honor, whether I would sit or not, we don't think that that would be constitutional."
2013.12-696,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1182.066,1187.053,"Do you think -- how many people in this room do you think would sit, talking truthfully?"
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1187.053,1188.739,"I don't think -- I don't think many would sit, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1188.739,1189.305,All right.
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1189.305,1190.489,But we don't think that that--
2013.12-696,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1190.489,1218.008,"So why do you think that someone who is sitting in a small room where hearings of this nature are being held, when the guy who's about, the chairman of this legislative body, is about to rule on an application you're bringing to him or her, why do you think any of those people wouldn't feel coerced to stand?"
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1218.008,1235.034,"--So, Your Honor, I'd like to address the coercion point this way: With respect to town councils, it's our view that as a general matter that the municipal legislatures can invoke the same tradition of solemnizing and invoking divine guidance as Federal and State legislatures."
2013.12-696,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1272.843,1286.168,"Mr. Gershengorn, do you think that if the legislature -- excuse me -- if the town board here just, you know, started it off with a prayer and then kept on going, do you think that that would be a significantly different case and you would switch sides?"
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1286.168,1287.585,"--I don't know that we would switch sides, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.345,1304.53,"--You agree that coercion is the test, however?"
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1304.53,1306.899,"--We don't agree that coercion is the test, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.899,1307.532,If it is the test--
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1307.532,1318.206,"We think it's the history -- we think the history is the -- the principal guidance of Marsh is -- we think there are three pillars in Marsh: First of all, that the history is what the Court looks to first."
2013.12-696,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1332.697,1334.566,"Mr. Gershengorn, could you respond to this?"
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1396.64,1400.008,"So, Justice Kagan, I think we agree with much of what you say."
2013.12-696,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1431.297,1439.152,"Mr. Gershengorn, your -- your brief is the one who brought up -- and you were quite candid about it -- the hybrid nature of that body."
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1483.681,1497.589,"--So, Your Honor, with respect to some of the things we identify which are similar to the ones that Justice Breyer recommended, I think our view is they're more akin to safe harbors, that there are undoubtedly advancement challenges that could be brought."
2013.12-696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1565.549,1570.387,"Of course, your -- your test is whether or not -- part of your test -- is whether or not it advances religion."
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1581.861,1584.813,"So, Your Honor, I think it's a much narrower test."
2013.12-696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1604.46,1608.662,So -- so you -- you use the word “ advance ” only as modified by “ proselytize ”?
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1608.662,1610.697,--What Marsh said was
2013.12-696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1612.264,1615.732,Because that's -- that's not what your -- your brief says “ does not proselytize or advance ”.
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1615.732,1619.886,"That -- that's the language from Marsh, Your Honor, is to proselytize or --"
2013.12-696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1621.786,1623.255,But that's that the test you want us to adopt and--
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1623.255,1624.122,"It is, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1624.122,1639.883,"--I'm asking whether or not it is, in fact, honest and candid and fair to ask the minister or -- or the priest or the chaplain or the rabbi if by appearing there, he or she seeks to advance their religion?"
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1639.883,1643.501,"So, Your Honor, I don't think that's what Marsh meant by advance."
2013.12-696,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1643.501,1644.185,"If not, I'm not quite sure why they're there."
2013.12-696,1,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1644.185,1647.787,"You're not quite sure why “ advance ” is there, or why the rabbi is there."
2013.12-696,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1663.582,1664.782,"--Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1673.438,1676.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1712.663,1714.198,But that's during the public -- that's during the public forum part.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1714.198,1715.315,That's in the public forum.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1715.315,1717.217,Which is not really -- it's not the same thing as the hearing.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1717.217,1719.919,"It's not the same thing as the hearing and that's the point, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1719.919,1724.954,There's another -- there's another part of the proceeding that is the hearing.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1724.954,1725.454,Yes.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1725.454,1728.323,And that's when somebody has a specific proposal.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1734.845,1737.897,The -- the hearing is a particular kind of proposal.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1737.897,1739.797,And that is separated in time.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1739.797,1742.932,That is -- that is somewhat separated in time.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1749.319,1751.821,But that is a legislative body at that point.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1767.75,1768.133,It is -- it is direct democracy.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1784.259,1789.979,"Well, if that is your argument, then you are really saying you can never have prayer at a town meeting."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1789.979,1791.931,That's -- that's not what we're saying.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1792.981,1793.565,How could you do it?
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1797.002,1799.871,--We're saying you cannot have sectarian prayer.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1808.477,1808.86,All right.
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1823.319,1824.752,And atheists.
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.752,1825.469,And atheists.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1829.973,1838.412,"--We -- we take Marsh to -- to imply that atheists cannot get full relief in this context, and the McCreary dissenters said that explicitly."
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1848.018,1848.785,Give me an example then.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1860.426,1863.778,"--About a third of the prayers in this record, Your Honor, are acceptable."
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1863.778,1865.646,Give me an example.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1865.646,1869.181,Can I have the joint appendix?
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1874.919,1876.954,To “ the almighty ”.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1876.954,1878.221,Yes.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1878.221,1884.541,"So if -- if a particular religion believes in more than one god, that's acceptable to them?"
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1884.541,1890.762,"Well, some religions that believe in more than one god believe that all their many gods are manifestations of the one god."
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.183,1903.271,What about devil worshippers?
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1906.723,1911.192,"Well, if devil worshippers believe the devil is the almighty, they might be okay."
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1915.246,1918.448,Who is going to make this determination?
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1923.483,1928.237,I'm just flipping through.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1943.597,1948.05,"74a, “ Heavenly father ”, that's acceptable to all religions?"
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1948.05,1951.502,“ Heavenly Father ” is very broadly acceptable.
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1963.06,1964.843,"Well, I'll repeat mine."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,1975.868,1976.435,No.
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2002.618,2008.856,So there is an official in the town council that is to instruct clergy about what kind of prayer they can say?
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2008.856,2010.541,--That's right.
2013.12-696,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2019.48,2032.054,"And if I'm -- if I'm that official and I think a prayer was over the top for being proselytizing and particularly sectarian, I would say I rather not -- you not come back next week; I am going to look for somebody else?"
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2032.054,2034.239,"Well, you might have a conversation with him first and--"
2013.12-696,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2034.239,2038.608,"Well, so in other words the government is now editing the content of prayers?"
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2038.608,2041.679,--Editing the content of government-sponsored prayers.
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.605,2061.724,"Your point is that it coerces, it's bad because it coerces?"
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2061.724,2067.895,--It coerces the people who are about to stand up and ask for things from the board and--
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.895,2075.65,"If there is -- if coercion is the test of the Free Exercise Clause, why do we need a Free Exercise Clause?"
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2084.839,2087.558,"--Well, I think that's right."
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2088.341,2096.98,So it seems to me very unlikely that the test for the Establishment Clause is identical to the test for the Free Exercise Clause.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2096.98,2098.849,"--Well, it seems to me unlikely as well."
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2108.638,2116.477,"What exactly -- since you are adopting the coercion test, what exactly is coercive in this environment?"
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2120.779,2125.516,There are many coercive aspects here of varying degrees of importance.
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2130.185,2134.772,"They are asked to participate, and -- but not in any tangible way."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2137.557,2142.045,"--They are often asked to physically participate, to stand or to bow their heads."
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.006,2161.539,This is coercion?
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2168.01,2189.441,"What's coercive about it is it is impossible not to participate without attracting attention to yourself, and moments later you stand up to ask for a group home for your Down syndrome child or for continued use of the public access channel or whatever your petition is, having just, so far as you can tell, irritated the people that you were trying to persuade."
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2189.441,2193.06,Let me give you an example of a practice that's a little bit different.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2260.288,2267.709,"Well, if the separation in time really works, that's part of the remedy that we've suggested that is possible here."
2013.12-696,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2269.894,2280.785,"On the remedy, this case was remanded by the Second Circuit for the parties together with the court to work out appropriate relief."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2309.786,2313.422,"Well, we think the town has to have a policy."
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2313.422,2319.66,"Well, just to be clear, are you talking about what would be satisfactory to the Second Circuit or satisfactory to you?"
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2322.362,2327.564,"Well, we've tried to sort out the totality of the circumstances to make it clearer."
2013.12-696,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2327.564,2328.849,What my question was--
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2328.849,2329.832,I'm talking about what would be--
2013.12-696,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2329.832,2339.555,"--your theory, and you say existing situation violates the Constitution."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2345.894,2348.68,--We think--
2013.12-696,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2348.68,2351.631,--that would bring this within the constitutional boundary?
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2351.631,2354.164,--We think the town needs a policy.
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.593,2419.257,"Mr. Laycock, it seems to me that you're missing here is -- and this is what distinguishes legislative prayer from other kinds -- the people who are on the town board or the representatives who are in Congress, they're citizens."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2495.257,2502.763,"We haven't said they can't invoke the deity or have a prayer, and they can certainly pray any way they want silently or just before the meeting."
2013.12-696,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2527.211,2532.199,Are you -- I would like you to take into account an aspect of this.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2562.418,2564.084,That's correct.
2013.12-696,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2622.257,2564.084,All right.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2660.732,2662.75,We think that rotation does not work.
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2725.924,2731.394,"Well, that gets exactly to the -- that gets exactly to the problem with your argument about nonsectarian prayer."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2773.238,2774.173,We--
2013.12-696,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2774.173,2776.073,And you haven't given me an example.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2776.073,2785.296,"--We -- we cannot treat -- I'm not a pastor -- we cannot treat everybody, literally everybody equally without eliminating prayer altogether."
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.921,2796.971,You want to pick the groups we're going to exclude?
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2796.971,2798.122,"--I think you picked them, Your Honor."
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.122,2801.257,"The Baha'i, who else?"
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2805.709,2807.994,"We've already excluded the atheists, right?"
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2807.994,2809.596,"--Yeah, the atheists are out already."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2809.596,2810.23,We've excluded the atheists.
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.482,2813.048,Okay.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2820.452,2824.273,"Well, I -- I think the -- the atheists are inevitably excluded."
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.84,2825.856,Okay.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2828.658,2834.212,--True poly -- true polytheists who don't understand their gods as manifestations of the one god are probably excluded.
2013.12-696,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2871.254,2872.304,Mr.--
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2872.304,2876.056,"We've already separated out, I thought, in our jurisprudence, children and adults."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2876.056,2883.811,"Well, Lee v. Weisman twice reserves the question of whether adults might be subject to similar pressures."
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2883.811,2890.715,"Well, you do accept the fact that children may be subject to subtle coercion in a way that adults are not, right?"
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2890.715,2892.934,In some ways that adults are not.
2013.12-696,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2911.679,2928.59,"Well, I just want to make sure what your position -- your position is that town councils like Greece can have prayers if they are non-provocative, modest, decent, quiet, non-proselytizing."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2930.007,2931.809,"I wouldn't use all those adjectives, but yes."
2013.12-696,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2935.177,2936.279,--Mr.--
2013.12-696,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2936.279,2941.231,Congress has a set of guidelines which you've read and are here in the papers and so forth.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2943.267,2946.735,"We'd like to be a little more explicit, but those are vastly better than--"
2013.12-696,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2946.735,2952.873,"If those are satisfactory to you, then I wonder, are they satisfactory to everyone."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,2982.658,2987.729,"--You know, there are such people and I respect that and they should not be giving government prayers."
2013.12-696,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2993.8,2994.45,--Mr. Laycock--
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2994.45,3009.809,"Well, that's -- that's -- that's really part of the issue, whether they're undertaking a government function or whether they're acting as citizens in a legislative body, representative of the people who bring -- who bring to that their -- their own personal beliefs."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3027.104,3029.473,They're -- they're not praying for their congregation.
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.382,3045.584,"If you had an atheist board, you would not have any prayer."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3045.584,3046.5,--Precisely.
2013.12-696,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.5,3054.44,"I guarantee you, because it is a personal prayer that the members of the legislature desire to make."
2013.12-696,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3054.44,3057.725,"Counsel, assuming that we don't--"
2013.12-696,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3057.725,3058.842,"--Mr. Laycock, would you--"
2013.12-696,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3058.842,3060.26,Justice Sotomayor.
2013.12-696,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3060.26,3074.418,"--Assuming -- you hear the resistance of some members of the Court to sitting as arbiters of what's sectarian and nonsectarian, and I join some skepticism as to knowing exactly where to join that line."
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3091.029,3097.783,"Well, the test that we have proffered is the test from the McCreary dissent, points on which believers are known to disagree."
2013.12-696,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3111.193,3121.466,It just seems to me that enforcing that standard and the standard I suggested involves the State very heavily in the censorship and -- and the approval or disapproval of prayers.
2013.12-696,2,21173,douglas_laycock,,3121.466,3124.685,But it's not censorship when it's the governmental--
2013.12-696,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3124.685,3130.754,That may play ultimately in your position if we say that that's why there shouldn't be any prayer at all.
