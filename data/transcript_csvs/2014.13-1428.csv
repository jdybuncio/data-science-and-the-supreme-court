2014.13-1428,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.105,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 13-1428, Davis v. Ayala. Ms. Urbanski."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,9.105,30.58,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The California Supreme Court's harmlessness determination was an adjudication on the merits because it denied relief on the basis of the intrinsic rights and wrongs of Mr. Ayala's claim. A Federal habeas court is authorized to set aside that final State judgment only if Ayala can show two things.
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,48.89,53.11,"You know, your -- your brief confused me, and it took me a while to pull it apart."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,94.815,98.035,"Well, the issue before the court was a Batson issue."
2014.13-1428,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,118.05,125.15,"Ms. Urbanski, let's say that they -- that the Ninth Circuit is wrong in that respect. Let's say that there is an adjudication on the merits here."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,185.96,196.0,"Your Honor, the reason why that is a proper approach is because on Federal habeas corpus, what the Federal court is doing is deferring to the State -- the final State court judgment of conviction."
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.205,218.54,Why is -- why is the harmless error thing out of -- out of the picture? I -- I don't really understand that.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,234.445,236.45,"The problem, Your Honor -- that is correct."
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.08,250.88,I'm saying you don't have to look at the underlying constitutional issue.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,264.78,266.0,"And that's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,269.55,275.9,"Well, you only do if the harmlessness determination is an unreasonable application under AEDPA."
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.34,283.485,Right.
2014.13-1428,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,283.485,288.185,It obviously doesn't arise if the harmlessness determination is perfectly fine.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,288.185,289.44,"Correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.44,291.805,And -- and don't you contend that it was fine?
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,291.805,292.345,Yes.
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.27,295.97,"So that ought to be the end of the case as far as you're concerned, right?"
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,295.97,297.53,In this case that isn't an issue.
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.15,313.28,We review judgments.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,321.245,329.82,"Well -- and I don't disagree with Your Honor that if the finding of harmlessness is a -- is a reasonable application of the Chapman standard in this case, then that certainly is the end of the inquiry."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,329.82,338.52,"I -- if we were to find that it wasn't a reasonable finding, then we would have to reach the first decision."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,338.52,339.61,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,339.61,343.92,So assume that it was unreasonable.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,407.905,414.01,"That's correct, Your Honor. The State court here did not resolve the underlying constitutional aspect of the claim."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,433.345,434.24,I'm sorry.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,444.6,445.0,No.
2014.13-1428,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,457.57,461.905,"Well, suppose -- I mean, that's a very broad kind of rationale."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,491.68,492.52,And that is correct.
2014.13-1428,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,496.6,498.18,It's a little bit counterintuitive.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,498.18,500.18,A little more challenging case for sure.
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,519.54,537.21,"So why do we bother saying in Williams that there are circumstances -- I happen to think this one of them -- where -- and you do, too -- where a State court hasn't reached an issue, that we don't give it deference."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,541.06,569.33,"No, your Honor, because the -- what this Court also said in Richter is that you look to the -- the decision of the claim as a whole. You do not parse it into its components. And here the decision on the claim as a whole was that no relief was warranted because any error did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation such that the Defendant suffered sufficient harm to grant relief. So that is the decision that the -- that resolves the claim, and that's --"
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,569.33,582.89,Why do we apply AEDPA at all? Meaning -- I think we've said repeatedly that Brecht's actual prejudice standard is higher than the -- the AEDPA standard.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,585.02,602.24,"Your Honor, if -- if the Court were to proceed directly to the question of prejudice, then yes, Brecht would be the standard that applies. However, before you even get to that question, the Court should look to what the State court did here first and determine whether that was reasonable."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,607.97,618.675,"Well, you've -- you've already admitted there's sort of an illogic when the State court says there was a Federal violation but no harmlessness and we say, ""Yes, there was harm."""
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,618.675,619.48,"No, your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,632.33,634.88,So we don't give it deference that there was a Federal error.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,640.305,647.93,"Correct, Your Honor, because the -- what the State court may have thought about the underlying issue on de novo review is not controlling for purposes of AEDPA."
2014.13-1428,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,649.265,657.54,"I mean, would that -- would that also apply -- I'm just sort of trying to figure out the reach of this claim. Just take a case where there was no harmlessness determination."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,684.69,705.4,"That's correct, Your Honor. If there is a denial of relief, then that is all the Federal habeas court needs to look to and then look backwards and ask whether there was a reasonable basis to support it, and that follows directly from this Court's decisions in Richter and Williams. There is no principled way to distinguish between where a State court does precisely that in silence and where the State court does it with a reasoned decision."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,705.4,708.985,"We didn't do that in Wiggins, Rompilla, or Porter, did we?"
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,708.985,709.74,"No, your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,710.6,714.435,So we would have to overturn those cases to accept your proposition.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,714.435,717.3,The results in the cases would not have to be overturned.
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,724.46,725.98,That the State had not addressed?
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,725.98,726.94,Where the State court had left it --
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,726.94,733.885,"Identical to this case. The State had not addressed one prong, and we said de novo review."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,733.885,735.04,"Correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.495,762.6,"We added the question, whether or not -- and the Court of Appeals properly applied the standards set forth in -- in Brecht. Do you want to address that briefly? And I -- if we get into the details of this case, it seems to me that the key person is Olanders."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,762.6,764.035,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,770.145,773.625,"Well, I want you to -- to discuss that -- this argument."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,773.625,774.6,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,869.06,884.835,"I have a bit of a hard time with the -- this -- assume I accept your proposition that it's actual prejudice. In a process claim, generally, we don't talk about what the outcome was going to be."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,965.965,980.505,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, anytime counsel is absented from a portion of the proceedings or anytime a portion of the record winds up missing, it is often going to be the case that you might had a very different record had those things been present."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1020.03,1023.05,But don't -- don't -- don't talk to me generally.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1034.38,1041.5,"Ana L. expressed that she had changed her mind about the views on the death penalty, similar to the fact that Olanders D. did."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1061.55,1065.81,"That's what Olanders D. said, essentially."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1065.81,1068.42,"To the -- I would disagree with that, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1074.82,1075.965,So did she.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1075.965,1085.38,"But now called into voir dire, Olanders D. could not provide the prosecutor with a satisfactory explanation for why his views had changed."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1085.38,1088.735,"He thought -- ""I thought about it and realized I -- I could."""
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1088.735,1119.88,"The -- the -- Olanders D.'s response at page 178 of the Joint Appendix, when specifically asked what caused the change was, ""I mean, examining it more closely, I think -- and becoming more familiar with the laws and the behavior, I mean, the change in people, I think."" That is a far -- a significantly different response than somebody coming in and saying, ""This case caused me to think about it, and now that I have been forced to think about it, I believe that I can choose this as the penalty. """
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1119.88,1127.48,"That -- you see the two of them substantially different? One said, ""I thought. I've listened to what the law is."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1132.045,1132.47,I think --
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1132.47,1145.13,"And do you think that defense counsel wouldn't have been able to point that out to the judge? And, you know, there were a lot of people questioned in this. How many days of voir dire was there?"
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1145.13,1148.555,I believe it was three -- three weeks of voir dire.
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1148.555,1149.99,Three weeks of voir dire.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1158.37,1163.29,"Well, the California Supreme Court did credit this judge as being very diligent, very well-respected --"
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1163.29,1164.09,It's clear he was.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1181.745,1184.43,I would disagree that the comments would have been identical.
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1352.69,1363.615,"How can you be confident? I mean, the whole purpose of an adversarial system is so that the other side of an argument is presented to the judge."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1370.855,1372.85,"Not literally, no, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1379.28,1385.63,Then I -- why don't we just have a trial ex parte? Presumably that's what you're arguing.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1385.63,1386.715,I'm sorry?
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1386.715,1390.86,"We should have the entire trial ex parte, because the judge can do that."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1390.86,1392.59,"No, Your Honor, certainly we would prefer the counsel --"
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.59,1401.545,Before you were arguing the much narrower point that the absence of counsel for this one incident was harmless.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1401.545,1402.84,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.84,1402.93,Right.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1405.365,1405.96,"No, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.96,1406.715,I didn't think so.
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1406.715,1412.48,"We certainly don't condone that approach here, and there is -- we certainly don't condone that approach here."
2014.13-1428,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1413.615,1417.9,Anywhere -- anywhere else? (Laughter.)
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1417.9,1418.355,"No, no."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1420.9,1471.115,"I guess my question is, the Ninth Circuit, at least with this juror -- I'm not talking about the other things, I'm talking about this juror -- as I pointed out earlier, pointed out two situations that were almost identical to the one that the op -- the prosecutor pointed to with this juror. Anna L. also said something that was totally nonresponsive to a question; it was like, ""that's correct,"" rather than answering the question. So you can say with complete confidence that that would never have made a difference to the judge? If he had had a real adversary able to point all of these things out, you're confident the judge would not have made up his mind."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1472.105,1479.065,"Based on the record in this case and what the trial judge had before him and the fact that this was a critical trial judge, yes."
2014.13-1428,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1487.99,1490.58,"No, there -- there's a real problem here, you do understand."
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1502.905,1514.01,"That is true, Your Honor. And certainly, anytime counsel is absent or anytime a portion of the record is missing, it will be the case that it is possible that the record might have been different."
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.95,1532.27,"Three weeks, is that standard? Three weeks? Is that standard out there?"
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1532.27,1533.66,"It's a lengthy voir dire, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1533.66,1535.415,Good Lord. (Laughter.)
2014.13-1428,0,56076,robin_urbanski,,1535.415,1538.55,If I may -- can reserve the remainder of my time.
2014.13-1428,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.55,1543.62,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dain."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,1543.62,1555.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start by answering the question that Justice Scalia, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan asked when this first began."
2014.13-1428,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1702.66,1706.65,I don't -- I don't really understand what you're saying.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,1723.16,1738.89,"Because when the prosecution said, I'll give you my reasons, but I don't want my adversary -- I don't want my adversary to be present to test this in the crucible of an adversarial situation, which is what the Constitution requires."
2014.13-1428,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1748.405,1763.62,"I don't understand that. When you -- when you're trying a case and you're deciding which jurors to exercise peremptory challenges against, do you not take into account what your defense is going to be? What your defense strategy in the case is going to be."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,1763.62,1784.11,"You might -- you might, but from Georgia v. McCollom to -- in this case, the State court analyzed it under its own State law equivalent. Strategy is not why you would say I don't like this person or I don't trust this person, he doesn't dress right, he doesn't fit in."
2014.13-1428,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1858.69,1860.79,Give an example of a strategy.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,1860.79,1871.3,"The trial strategy might be I'm calling -- in near cases of this -- might be calling an informant, and this informant might be living in the same neighborhood as this person."
2014.13-1428,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1883.86,1884.735,As that juror.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,1884.735,1885.35,As a juror.
2014.13-1428,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1914.09,1915.05,"Well, let me give you an example."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,1940.72,1941.115,Two --
2014.13-1428,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1941.115,1942.92,"Now, there may not have been that here."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,1963.16,1964.57,"Well, let me take that from the beginning."
2014.13-1428,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1994.59,2003.46,"Prosecutor doesn't have to say, it's because of planting of police, the pros -- of planting of evidence is going to be at issue."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2008.29,2011.72,"He absolutely could, and that could be heard by the defendant."
2014.13-1428,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2011.9,2013.17,"Actually, it's said quite often."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2013.17,2022.24,"It is a strategy, but that's not the trial strategy we're talking about that in the rare instance, as this Court has said, would require an ex parte communication."
2014.13-1428,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2022.24,2028.4,"Could you at the other side -- I understand the idea that you're saying that just, you know, basically you'd like jurors who are going to be sympathetic with your case."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2032.57,2032.73,No.
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2063.57,2080.99,"Well, even -- even if the strategy was an overblown statement by the prosecutor. Suppose that in this case defense counsel is absent, but what the juror says is clearly grounds for the prosecutor to -- excuse me, the juror says I've thought about this."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2084.97,2086.39,Of course.
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2086.39,2090.16,Then we still look to see whether or not there was harmless error.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2090.16,2091.42,And I'm going to get to that. Absolutely.
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2091.42,2097.12,And it's true that the harmless error in this case looks back in your -- your concern that there was not full cross-exam.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2113.82,2117.17,And that's what -- what I'm going to say in addressing that.
2014.13-1428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.61,2148.04,That goes to whether there was a violation --
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2148.04,2148.22,No.
2014.13-1428,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.22,2150.69,-- not to whether the violation was harmless or not.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2150.69,2151.47,I disagree.
2014.13-1428,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2196.12,2201.36,"But the problem with that -- I mean, you're looking at -- and we have said this often in Batson type cases."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2214.37,2222.4,But that serves our purpose. That serves our purpose because what we didn't have is the adversarial crucible.
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2227.45,2234.11,Suppose the defense counsel were present and the -- a transcript said exactly what it says here.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2242.715,2243.79,The -- what you --
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2243.79,2248.35,"Now, I -- I understand that it would have been a much better record if the counsel were there."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2257.93,2258.67,Absolutely.
2014.13-1428,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2309.72,2316.72,"Well, we're speculating the judge would not -- that defense attorney remained silent or that defense attorney --"
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2316.72,2317.39,No.
2014.13-1428,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2317.39,2318.04,Either way.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2324.385,2338.495,"Had he ruled the same way -- had defense counsel participated and he ruled the same way, we would have a Batson challenge in substance, not, as Your Honor has recognized, a procedural issue."
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2379.18,2380.78,"Well, I'll go back and look at this."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2393.3,2394.17,Or it's -- I can give you that.
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2394.17,2400.12,"I mean, it's a long opinion but Page 678 talks about Olanders just in the term that we're talking about."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2400.12,2408.63,"It said -- the prosecutor had said that he was not responsive -- the Ninth Circuit, to address your question, Justice Kennedy."
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2420.05,2421.455,He meant --
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2421.455,2424.56,The Court disagreed with the statement that he wouldn't fit in.
2014.13-1428,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2426.78,2429.43,"Well, the trial court said that."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2429.43,2432.64,"I'm sorry, but the Ninth Circuit pointed out the trial court said that."
2014.13-1428,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2461.78,2468.14,That's speculation. What the Ninth Circuit did with Olanders B is point to the actual existing record --
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2468.14,2469.13,Understood.
2014.13-1428,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2469.13,2473.8,-- and show that there were contradictions to -- in the record as it existed.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2473.8,2482.79,And that's what our argument -- you can even take the existing record and show the inconsistencies that show Chapman was not appropriately applied.
2014.13-1428,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2482.79,2520.41,"Of course it's speculative that defense counsel, had defense counsel been present, would have been able to point to the other juror, Anna. We've had a number of cases where defense counsel was present at the voir dire, which I think should be the rule in almost every situation, and only later, years later on appeal when -- as particularly when you have many, many jurors questioned, as apparently was the case here, does somebody realize, well, this juror who was dismissed, has answers seem to be somewhat similar to this other juror who -- who wasn't challenged."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2520.41,2523.87,"And then had that been the facts, we lose, under AEDPA, we lose."
2014.13-1428,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2530.465,2535.8,But what reason is there to think that defense counsel would have had better recall of this than the trial judge who was there?
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2535.8,2538.71,"Defense counsel -- first of all, there were two of them."
2014.13-1428,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2775.63,2776.18,Thank you.
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.18,2780.62,This doesn't relate to the issues you've been arguing.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2786.115,2789.73,"1996, yeah, very close."
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2789.73,2793.515,"Has he spent time in solitary confinement, and, if so, how much?"
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2793.515,2798.04,He has spent his entire time in what's called administrative segregation.
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2803.37,2805.025,Is that a single cell?
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2805.025,2806.49,It is a single cell.
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2826.18,2828.865,Is it the same thing as solitary confinement?
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2828.865,2834.435,"No, it's 23 hours out of the day, that probably is the same."
2014.13-1428,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2842.52,2842.97,One hour.
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2842.97,2845.15,-- of activity.
2014.13-1428,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2845.15,2847.625,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-1428,1,56077,anthony_j_dain,,2847.625,2848.42,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2014.13-1428,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2848.42,2851.979,"Four minutes, Ms. Urbanski."
2014.13-1428,2,56076,robin_urbanski,,2851.979,2857.275,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice: Just a few brief points."
2014.13-1428,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.46,2886.925,What was the trial strategy that displayed itself in his strikes?
2014.13-1428,2,56076,robin_urbanski,,2886.925,2893.7,"I cannot tell the Court what it was, but I don't think there is any reason to take the trial -- the prosecutor at anything less than his word."
2014.13-1428,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2964.92,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
