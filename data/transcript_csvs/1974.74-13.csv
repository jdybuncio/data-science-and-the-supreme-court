1974.74-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.823,"We'll hear arguments next in Mullaney against Wilbur, 74-13."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,44.453,44.926,"Arey, Your Honor."
1974.74-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,44.926,46.307,Arey.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,46.307,48.768,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,114.279,117.62,"Well, you can hardly call that a contention in the traditional sense, can you?"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,125.111,128.334,"Well, Your Honor I think that depends upon tactics of counsel."
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.248,361.929,"Mr. Arey, your statute -- am I correct your statute doesn't speak in so many words of felonious homicide?"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,361.929,363.582,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.74-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,702.057,709.33,"Do you have any other crime in Maine, Mr. Arey, where this is also true?"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,709.33,716.371,"The single generic concept Your Honor, yes I believe arguably in the situation of assault."
1974.74-13,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.34,898.536,"Mr. Arey, as I understand one of your opponent's contention is that taking the Maine court at its word as to -- in your explanation of how the criminal statute is to be construed, and perhaps conceding for the sake of argument that if that had taken place in this case, there'd be no violation of Winship."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,922.874,925.251,To the extent that it says that I would have to say yes.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.13,1140.298,"But I take it that it can't be both, but if there's a provocation, it can't be murder."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1140.298,1141.224,That's correct.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.281,1153.568,"And so that if there is provocation that you can not find a felonious -- a murder, you can't find murder."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1153.568,1154.766,You can not find a murder.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.766,1159.536,"You can not find whatever element it is that makes it murder, what is it?"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1159.536,1161.452,That is the --
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.452,1162.056,Malice --
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1162.056,1164.435,"The aspect of the maliciousness, yes."
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.712,1207.647,"Let's assume that you as a jury man was a -- sitting in jury, when you thought the evidence on provocation was absolutely evenly balanced, and you thought that “Well, I've been instructed not to find this man guilty of murder except beyond a reasonable doubt -- unless I'm convinced beyond a reasonable doubt."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1222.675,1223.56,That's correct.
1974.74-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1225.607,1226.014,Well --
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1226.014,1227.272,And the reason we say that is --
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.272,1237.679,Well isn't that a fairly -- isn't arguably that's a -- isn't that an invasion of the reasonable doubt standard?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1253.09,1266.491,"I would say no to that -- I'd say yes, even we balanced evidence creates a reasonable doubt, but when you're talking within the concept of a punishment category, instead of the concept is to whether or not the verdict is going to be guilty or not guilty."
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.491,1269.292,But you would still have to find him guilty of murder.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1269.292,1272.633,And you do that quite apart from the fact as which bearing heat of passion --
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.633,1275.874,"Yes, but the jury still brings in a verdict, guilty of murder."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1275.874,1277.321,That's correct.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.321,1290.255,"But -- and that the juryman says to himself though “If I could've let this evidence on provocation which is evenly balanced create a reasonable doubt, I would've found him innocent -- of murder.”"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1290.255,1291.863,Would've known.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.589,1298.131,He would've found him innocent of murder.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1309.616,1310.508,Manslaughter?
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.508,1311.885,Of manslaughter.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1311.885,1313.442,It's guilty of manslaughter.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.442,1316.373,And what about -- is it not guilty of murder or not?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1316.373,1318.636,"No, it is just guilty of manslaughter."
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.235,1321.65,But I suppose you can't try him for murder again?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1321.65,1322.129,Pardon?
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1322.129,1323.646,I suppose you never try him for murder again?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1323.646,1324.884,No you could not.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.884,1328.984,"So, it's implied that they have found him innocent of murder?"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1328.984,1331.735,"As far as double jeopardy provisions are concerned, yes."
1974.74-13,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.735,1335.927,"Where they given three forms of verdict, guilty of murder, guilty of manslaughter and not guilty?"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1335.927,1337.903,Depends upon what the evidence in the case shows.
1974.74-13,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1350.658,1353.7,What about this case were there three forms submitted?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1353.7,1354.526,That's correct.
1974.74-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1406.821,1407.587,You can --
1974.74-13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1407.587,1408.562,In an unlawful killing?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1408.562,1410.872,An unlawful killing nothing more.
1974.74-13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1410.872,1417.551,"But the jury is never given a verdict form that talks about felonious homicide, is it in any case?"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1417.551,1419.289,"No, it is not Your Honor."
1974.74-13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1423.818,1424.945,It is not a practice.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1424.945,1431.213,And I think the reason for it is because it's easier to talk to a jury and have them comprehend in traditional terms.
1974.74-13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1438.521,1446.353,"In those traditional terms coming down to that common sense language, this charge put upon the defendant the burden of proof."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1446.353,1447.983,"Now, we maintain that it did not."
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1490.82,1497.01,"Mr. Arey, I could understand that better if these were bifurcated crime, but this is all in one crime."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1497.01,1498.028,That's correct.
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1498.028,1500.794,And the judge has got to sought all of these out.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1500.794,1502.179,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1505.892,1513.001,"And those sorting out in a criminal trial, there is a burden of preponderance of evidence."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1513.001,1514.426,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1514.426,1516.539,And that doesn't get you in any trouble?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1516.539,1526.094,"We say no, and we say no first of all because the case of In re Winship has been defined, as we see it, as bearing up on punishment elements."
1974.74-13,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1559.605,1565.641,"You're saying then in effect, this element is like the defensive insanity in Leland against Oregon or --"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1565.641,1569.112,"Precisely, that the same analysis could apply."
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1605.155,1608.473,The jury is doing all of this at one time.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1608.473,1609.299,"Yes, Your Honor and --"
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1609.299,1620.658,"In one room, and you think that the jury first goes through his part about his guilty of a felonious murder, and then will get to the sentencing part."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1623.967,1624.267,Well we --
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1624.267,1632.545,And that jury can very well be all fouled up in between where we use preponderance and where we use reasonable doubt.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1632.545,1633.264,That was discussed in Leland --
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1633.264,1635.355,And they certainly will get confused.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1635.355,1647.738,"That was discussed in Leland versus Oregon Your Honor, and I think the assumption has to be that juries follow the instructions that we give them, that juries have been given conflicting burdens in criminal cases for years and have managed to --"
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1647.738,1652.109,"Well, I was talking about preponderance as a reasonable doubt."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1661.987,1667.41,Well that the determination of what proof was beyond reasonable doubt is defined.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.778,1695.981,Then you don't even incur that he's innocent and murdered though.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1695.981,1699.813,Not after we've proven an intentional and an unlawful killing because that definitionally is murder.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.813,1712.867,I would suppose -- I suppose you really ought to answer that the jury when it finds a defendant guilty of manslaughter does not find him innocent of murder.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1713.107,1718.245,"It does not -- he does not find him innocent in the criminal sense, Your Honor he has committed exactly the same acts."
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.245,1722.26,I would think you would say he could be put back on trial for the -- in the same offense?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1722.26,1738.402,"Because there's a matter of -- the fact that we say that if the jury in fact finds him guilty of manslaughter that the state as a matter of simple, call it procedural fairness of dues without any reference to double jeopardy concepts, will not allow the state to retry him for murder."
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.724,1751.592,"Well, if the jury finds him -- would you -- the two elements of murder the way you say are just an intentional killing --"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1751.592,1751.843,Unlawful.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.843,1753.213,And intentional?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1753.213,1753.916,Right.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.916,1761.164,"Now, when the jury finds, in a trial like this, finds him guilty of manslaughter."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1761.164,1765.942,"Intentionality remains, unlawfulness remains, everything remains but the law has --"
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1765.942,1768.877,So you say the jury has found him guilty --
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1768.877,1769.072,Of everything --
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.072,1771.194,Of those two elements beyond a reasonable doubt?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1771.194,1771.51,Right.
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.408,1781.43,Well then you ought to be able to try him again for it if it were reversed on appeal for some error.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1781.43,1789.873,"Well that may be so, but I would maintain that we probably could not under the Maine law, because we would say as a matter of fairness, it's not fair for the state --"
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.873,1792.417,Under the Maine law of double jeopardy?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1792.417,1796.549,"Under the Maine law of what constitutes fairness, now the issue is never been presented."
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.549,1801.415,Well that would only be because they found him innocent once at murder.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1801.415,1804.925,If it could not be.
1974.74-13,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1861.826,1863.269,Well it's a little different in Maine.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1867.75,1875.902,I'm just -- I'm just citing that for the proposition that the concept of felonious homicide and of voluntary manslaughter as being only a mitigating factor is not unique.
1974.74-13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1876.062,1880.361,"The other states were Oregon, Louisiana and proposed in Michigan, is that it?"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1880.361,1883.845,"I believe they proposed in Michigan, the ALI Model Penal Code, they're all in my brief Your Honor."
1974.74-13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1883.845,1884.254,Right.
1974.74-13,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.254,1896.252,Well don't almost -- don't the large majority of the states when you're talking not about mitigation but about self-defense put the burden on the defendant to prove justification on that sense?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1896.252,1906.007,"A great number do but Maine does not, and that's why we say we're consistent with the theory because self-defense goes to criminality, we require the state to negative."
1974.74-13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1906.007,1907.885,Most states it's in affirmative defense.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1907.885,1909.649,"I'm not sure if it's in most, but I know in a great many."
1974.74-13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1909.649,1912.451,You post again to the question of guilt or innocence.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1912.451,1914.427,That's correct.
1974.74-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.668,1936.26,"What you point on that is that this Court has approved Oregon specifically submitting to the jury two different elements of the case, I won't say to the crime of the case, with two different standards, one beyond a reasonable doubt and one by preponderance to the evidence by way to confirm it."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1936.26,1936.679,"Oh, No."
1974.74-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1944.152,1946.111,"Well, but they have changed the statute right after Leland."
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1946.111,1946.895,"Subsequently, yes."
1974.74-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1946.895,1947.451,Yes.
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1952.5,1957.398,"Right, I'm not sure that their analysis is the same Your Honor, but clearly the burdens are."
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.398,1978.369,I suppose you would really should -- I would think to say that Maine could also put the burden on the prosecution to prove the absence of provocation by a preponderance to the evidence?
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1978.369,1988.13,"I suppose that under the theory that the state could do that, because the absence -- presence or absence of heat of passion is not an element of anything."
1974.74-13,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.13,1990.017,"Except for just for a penalty, you say?"
1974.74-13,0,43543,vernon_i_arey,,1990.017,1993.328,For penalty.
1974.74-13,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.753,1996.071,Very well Mr. Arey.
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,1999.532,2002.47,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2135.075,2141.645,"Well, are you saying that the State of Maine cannot construe its own law in that way?"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2141.645,2147.263,"I -- certainly the State of Maine could construe its law that way, I think perhaps prospectively."
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.03,2204.599,"But the courts you won in below had really repudiated that type of analysis now, haven't they?"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2204.599,2207.953,Judge Gignoux never has because he'd probably never been given to the opportunity to.
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.953,2210.336,"The turn of the chair, is it?"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2210.336,2219.845,"The First Circuit yes, but I don't ready anything in that second decision which says we now agree with the Maine court if we were free to interpret the law."
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.752,2244.561,Do you read anything in the remand at this Court?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2244.561,2253.305,"Well, I took the position with the First Circuit that all the remand said was reconsideration, I'm sorry, further consideration it did not say reconsideration."
1974.74-13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2374.889,2379.844,"You use fact, the word fact Mr. Rubin, as if -- as essential element?"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2379.844,2380.311,Yes.
1974.74-13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2380.311,2380.61,Yes.
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2380.61,2381.188,Yes.
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2398.434,2411.955,"In response to a question by Mr. Justice White, Mr. Arey said that if there was provocation shown, then there could never be a murder, at least that's the way I understood him."
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2428.769,2432.662,"It has to be -- yes, I think it has to be a reasonable response to the provocation."
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2432.662,2448.698,Suppose there was a provocation and the man provoked who was on trial is shown then to have gone back into his house and got a shotgun and came out and shot the provoking party dead.
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2451.68,2454.614,I believe on the facts it could be.
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2454.614,2457.369,On that -- the ones I've postulated?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2457.369,2457.597,Yes.
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2457.884,2464.89,Or perhaps he wasn't -- he may clear that up later.
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2469.999,2470.16,Right
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2470.16,2470.753,Do you agree?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2470.753,2473.564,"I agree with that, yes."
1974.74-13,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2514.626,2523.189,"Mr. Rubin on your thesis, do you think the trial tactics would've been any different?"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2529.596,2530.375,I'm not sure.
1974.74-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.081,2595.53,The Court of Appeals finally got around to accepting the law of Maine the way the Supreme Court of Maine interpreted it?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2595.53,2610.116,"Again, I don't know if I'm making a distinction without a difference, but I would submit that the First Circuit merely said “We understand that we are obligated to accept that law, but we do not necessarily agree that that would be our interpretation of it if we were free to do so.”"
1974.74-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.116,2612.32,But you're suggesting that we should take a different of the Maine law?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2612.32,2612.907,Yes.
1974.74-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.194,2615.59,From either the Supreme Court of Maine or the Court of Appeals?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2615.59,2621.327,"No, I would suggest that the first decision by the First Circuit Court of Appeals is the correct one on this particular issue."
1974.74-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2621.327,2623.471,"Now, that's different from the Supreme Court of Maine."
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2623.471,2625.016,"Yes, that's right."
1974.74-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.016,2626.142,About Maine law.
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2626.142,2626.37,Yes.
1974.74-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2627.385,2639.864,"Well now, let's assume that we accept the Maine law as the Supreme Court of Maine ultimately found it to be, and at the end that the Court of Appeals recognized."
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2639.864,2640.68,Fine.
1974.74-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.68,2645.204,Then what fault do you find with the Court of Appeals?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2645.204,2649.812,I find no fault with the Court of Appeals on -- if accepting that.
1974.74-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.852,2653.861,"Well, let me ask you this then."
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2690.872,2691.711,"Yes, I would."
1974.74-13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2692.058,2695.025,"Well, then I would think you would find --"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2695.025,2707.421,I believe the First Circuit said that that is impermissible at least in the context of a single trial and I would suspect the rationale of the First Circuit would apply equally to a separate bifurcated trial on that issue.
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2707.649,2713.386,"Then that takes away some of the reason for having bifurcated trials, doesn't it?"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2713.386,2715.53,I'm not sure I understand.
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2715.53,2725.527,"Well, if you must do it exactly the same way on the second on the penalty trial as you do in a trial on the issue of guilt --"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2725.527,2733.252,"Well, certainly there're other reasons, for instance in the insanity area to have a bifurcated trial other than merely question of burden of proof."
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2813.994,2815.192,What page in the record appendix?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2815.192,2818.952,"Its page 61, Your Honor and also on page 62."
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.699,2909.035,Of course there is something to what your opposing counsel says that you don't simply seize one instruction out of context and the questions whether the instructions as a whole fairly charged the jury.
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2909.035,2910.4,And I wholeheartedly agree with that.
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.248,2945.23,Was exception taken?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,2945.23,2946.967,I don't believe that there was.
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2993.92,3000.328,Well you're saying that it's conflicting with a charge that says one thing at one point and another thing at another point.
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3000.328,3004.088,"Well I'm saying that it says -- no I -- well, yes in one sense."
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3008.16,3018.28,"Well, but isn't there some obligation on a defendant to accept if he feels that way about the charge?"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3018.28,3036.14,"The Maine law court accepted this issue under Maine law even though there was no -- I don't believe there was an exception because it presented a serious issue, and under the Maine rules, the court itself could recognize and decide an issue which it felt raise serious constitutional question even though objection had not been raised."
1974.74-13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3050.62,3057.255,Well and then too isn't it true that as of the time this trial there really wasn't much to accept no basis in which to accept?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3057.255,3059.739,"That's correct also Your Honor, yes."
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3113.59,3118.488,"Of course in Leland against Oregon, it's a difference between guilty and not guilty."
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3120.081,3134.871,"Well, I think that gets into the third consideration for the court which is whether or not there're any counterbalancing factors which do not warrant shifting the burden of proof or putting the burden of proof on the state."
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.626,3343.411,Would you agree with your opponent that many if not a majority of the states put the burden of self defense in a murder case on the defendant?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3343.411,3345.268,I don't believe he said a majority.
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3371.403,3375.463,Do you think those rules are all invalidated by Winship?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3375.463,3389.044,"I think that certainly the question of self-defense, a holding in this case that Winship is applicable to the question of heat of passion and sudden provocation certainly would have applicability to the rule of self-defense."
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3389.044,3398.492,But isn't self-defense the type of thing just like you say insanity is that the defendant is much more capable of coming up with evidence of than the state?
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3398.492,3410.289,"No, because I think self-defense is again a question where there are objective facts, because if you, for instance you may have the victim charging at the defendant there are -- and self defense is not --"
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3410.289,3411.834,Well the victim isn't there to testify.
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3411.834,3422.481,"No, but if there are other witnesses that the state certainly has a burden of showing that the defendant killed the victim and the process of doing so would presumably show some of the facts that surround it."
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3447.428,3460.947,"So then in your view, a defendant in every criminal case is entitled to a charge from the trial judge that unless the state has proved the absence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, he's entitled to a judgment of acquittal?"
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3460.947,3466.444,Only if there has been some evidence introduced into the case which raises the issue of self-defense.
1974.74-13,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3480.636,3499.726,"But then you don't treat self-defense exactly as you dot the proof of the killing where presumably you don't say that you say the state has to prove the evidence of the killing beyond a reasonable doubt, not if there's some evidence of a killing the state has to go ahead and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt."
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3499.726,3509.986,"I think that's true, but I believe that the question of self-defense can very easily go to one of the elements of the crime in terms of the intent, the unlawfulness of the killing."
1974.74-13,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3604.893,3605.971,Thank you Mr. Rubin.
1974.74-13,1,38271,peter_j_rubin,,3616.33,3618.965,It's been my pleasure Your Honor.
