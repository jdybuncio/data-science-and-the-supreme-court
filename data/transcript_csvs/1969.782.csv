1969.782,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.995,"Number 782, Morris against Schoonfield."
1969.782,0,39252,robert_g_fisher,,20.995,21.879,May it please the Court.
1969.782,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,119.231,120.879,$2.00 per day?
1969.782,0,39252,robert_g_fisher,,120.879,121.633,I'm sorry?
1969.782,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,121.633,122.727,$2.00 per day?
1969.782,0,39252,robert_g_fisher,,122.727,125.537,$2.00 per day.
1969.782,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,125.537,129.597,Your statute has been substantially amended and I -- but I expect you're going to tell us about that in due --
1969.782,0,39252,robert_g_fisher,,129.597,130.776,That's right Your Honor.
1969.782,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,170.563,173.178,"It gives a judicial -- excuse me, excuse me."
1969.782,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,173.178,176.709,"I'm just going to ask does it have a date and rate, in the new statute?"
1969.782,0,39252,robert_g_fisher,,176.709,181.355,It has a minimum rate of $10.00 per day.
1969.782,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.355,190.167,"So, it gives a judicial potential, judicial remedy to those now in jail, and it also for the future sets up a -- quite inconsistent doesn't it?"
1969.782,0,39252,robert_g_fisher,,190.167,190.92,That's right.
1969.782,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,203.595,204.511,-- now you told him.
1969.782,0,39252,robert_g_fisher,,204.511,211.904,Our people that are locked up in jail where they don't have television or newspapers or radios supposed to find out about it.
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1343.034,1345.495,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.782,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1454.003,1455.762,When did that legislation become effective?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1455.762,1468.18,"April 15th, immediately upon signing by the governor and that is the reason that my brother anticipated the mootness statute because we propose that this is the law of the case under prior Supreme Court rulings."
1969.782,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1472.964,1478.05,It would hardly be moot technically because they're still in the jail?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1478.05,1479.234,"Well, that is true."
1969.782,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1479.234,1486.464,Is more -- be more accurate to say that there is a new state remedy?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1486.464,1492.48,They have this remedy available to him upon application or by general order of the court.
1969.782,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1503.473,1506.163,Has there been any such general order?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1506.163,1509.332,"Not to my knowledge, no sir."
1969.782,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1509.332,1520.285,"The true mootness perhaps could have done right on -- by action yesterday by an appropriate general order, could it not?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1520.285,1528.295,Except to the extent that substitute punishment as a philosophy is not a denial of equal protection of the law.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1536.225,1548.604,"Mr. Russel, if you did have the alternative in the State of Maryland, you have a judicial order which would have released this man yesterday, is that right?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1548.604,1549.531,That is correct sir.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1549.531,1556.145,"Well, what reason are you here other than seeking to get this Court to approve a law that doesn't apply anymore?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1556.145,1566.595,I understood that my brother was raising the issue that the theory of substitute punishment is a denial of equal protection of the laws.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1581.026,1593.294,"Well it makes no difference as to whether we agree with the petitioner or the Chief Judge of the supreme bench issues an order, either way, this petitioner that gets out if it?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1593.294,1607.036,"These petitioners already out except for the one petitioner who is serving 21 years in the Maryland penitentiary, and he alleges that he will have difficulty getting parole because a fine is been imposed upon him."
1969.782,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1622.443,1631.487,"But the new law your point is, the new law with all its ameliorations nonetheless still does preserve the theory of substitute punishment?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1631.487,1632.595,Yes sir.
1969.782,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1633.1,1641.212,And that if you understand your brother on the other side attacks continues to attack in that it is that that you're here to do -- to defend?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1641.212,1643.994,"Address myself to, yes sir."
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1753.458,1763.462,"Well, how is it that a man who's a millionaire commits the exact same crime as the pauper, and the millionaire pays a fine and the pauper goes to jail?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1763.462,1764.252,The problem is --
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1764.252,1766.763,Is it that simple?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1768.886,1777.586,"The problem as I view it sir, is what sanctions does the State of Maryland have to prevent people from violating the laws?"
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1777.627,1786.694,"By saying that everybody who violates this law goes to jail; that's one way of doing it, and that wouldn't violate the constitution?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1786.694,1808.103,"That may well be the result if the Court finds as that many cases upheld, particularly the New York case and it's been suggested in a Washington case that any conclusion that the alternative punishment theory is not constitutional would cause the kind of irreparable harm what would result from imprisonment for everyone."
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1808.103,1814.086,You mean it would be irreparable harm to imprison a millionaire?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1814.086,1817.963,Imprisonment results a irreparable harm to anyone in my judgment Your Honor.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1817.963,1837.396,"But the only thing I see here in my case in yours is I say that when you put a poor man in jail and let the man who can pay his fine, pay his fine or you can say everybody that commits this crime shall go to jail?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1843.612,1845.65,"Well, that's I think that in theory --"
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1845.65,1848.977,"Under the Equal Protection Clause, it doesn't hurt anybody?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1848.977,1857.154,"Well, the answer I would propose is that the Equal Protection Clause does not require the same punishment for all people."
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1857.154,1858.255,Absolutely not.
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1858.255,1872.558,It does not require -- it simply requires that when you make a classification of a group of people that this classification be a reasonable one in that the -- it's be related to a legitimate state interest.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1872.558,1882.336,I'd be interested in the case you'll cite to me which says that you can make poor people a class that the state can --
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1882.336,1884.345,"Well, this is why we're here Your Honor."
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1887.756,1887.881,You got anything close?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1887.881,1889.879,-- that poor people can be made a class.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1889.879,1890.961,You got anything close?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1890.961,1896.251,"Oh, we have the authority that Chief Judge Thompson relied on the Privitera case."
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1935.287,1953.336,"Do you mean that in the State of Maryland in its criminal process can say that a pauper is in a class by himself, and shall have sentences based on him solely because he's a pauper?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1953.336,1957.808,A sentence may it please the Court is not being imposed upon him solely because he's poor.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1957.808,1957.825,Why?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1957.825,1961.333,It's being imposed upon him because he's violated the law.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1971.677,1977.119,The alternate punishment is also given to the rich man.
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1981.383,1982.484,That is correct sir.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.484,1987.452,"So, the poor man doesn't have that alternative?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,1987.452,1993.43,"Well, this is true, but I do not view this as being such a disparity as to violate the constitution."
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1993.43,1996.999,Is it solely because he's poor that he goes to jail?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2012.704,2013.858,"Under the statute, he --"
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2013.858,2015.746,"Well, how can you justify it?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2015.746,2024.453,I justify it because the State of Maryland otherwise would be powerless to impose sanctions upon people who are unable to pay fines.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2025.695,2031.044,"So, you take away the right of a man to be considered the equal of every other man."
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2037.289,2038.433,"That's just true, he has his --"
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.433,2039.558,How could he?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2041.383,2044.401,"Well, he ends up in jail because he violated the law."
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2044.401,2045.439,No.
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2061.761,2064.155,We give special treatment to other people also.
1969.782,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2075.681,2082.139,I don't assume that recidivist is a recidivist because he wants to be and did it deliberately.
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2084.398,2087.112,I would concur that this should not be assumed for pauper.
1969.782,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.155,2135.453,Can the judge allow him to pay the fine on installments?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2135.453,2135.902,Yes sir.
1969.782,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2322.745,2335.4,"Well, would a traffic -- would the statistics and traffic violators really be your fair showing are the pattern of statistics in all kinds of crimes?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2335.4,2339.372,I think that the statistics of traffic violators would be lower.
1969.782,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2344.968,2370.456,"And that it is true wouldn't it that you'd assume that if you had a law for instance that made every company, wholesale nation, they won't say a company or the nation be a license of $15.00, you wouldn't have much trouble for that $15.00, and you wouldn't have much trouble collecting the fine that could be imposed as a rule on a traffic violator, would you?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2370.456,2371.359,This is true.
1969.782,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2372.404,2373.243,Same offense?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2373.243,2374.25,Yes sir.
1969.782,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2389.315,2392.993,"Now, the figures you gave us first, that 3 %, was that --"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2392.993,2393.918,0.3 % Your Honor.
1969.782,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2393.918,2397.366,"0.3 %, was that traffic or non-traffic?"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2397.366,2399.652,That was traffic.
1969.782,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2429.578,2435.602,Out of the total of how many?
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2441.952,2451.936,It's about 4%.
1969.782,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.936,2454.904,"Well, go on with your argument, and if that shows up --"
1969.782,1,25967,george_l_russell_jr,,2454.904,2481.327,"Well, my brother has indicated in his brief that he felt that the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution was violated as well as the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, and just to -- because I only have one appearance here, I would like to state that vis-a-vis these cases that we feel that the Maryland statute that we believe was the law of the case now, in anyway violates either those amendments to the constitution."
1969.782,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2540.441,2544.732,Thank you Mr. Russell.
1969.782,2,39252,robert_g_fisher,,2545.914,2550.846,"Your Honor, Mr. Russell and I are talking about different statutes."
1969.782,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2576.256,2585.299,"But it furnishes them with the -- it does furnish in the administrative means of softening that, does it not?"
1969.782,2,39252,robert_g_fisher,,2585.299,2605.65,"It does not furnish any interpretation that I can see of the power to release these people by general order because one of the provisions of the new statute is that each case has to be decided on its own merits, and the $10.00 figure is only a minimum figure."
1969.782,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2613.667,2617.538,So let's lay aside the general order mechanism.
1969.782,2,39252,robert_g_fisher,,2629.492,2629.756,Well --
1969.782,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2629.756,2634.192,Quasi judicial remedy?
1969.782,2,39252,robert_g_fisher,,2634.192,2637.313,They do if they find out about it.
1969.782,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2648.254,2655.822,"Well obviously, the people that you're talking about, the people you're representing here today now before us do know about through you?"
1969.782,2,39252,robert_g_fisher,,2655.822,2684.095,"Well, we representing the whole class of people who are defined as those people that are in the Baltimore City Jail, and those people that have detainers against them and we also submit that our request for declaratory judgment covers all of those people who have been in jail since the beginning of the lawsuit because they have an interest in this case."
