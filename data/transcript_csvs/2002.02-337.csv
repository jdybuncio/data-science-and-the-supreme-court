2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.528,"We'll hear argument now in Number 02-337, Phillip T. Breuer versus Jim's Concrete of Brevard."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,10.168,14.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,105.596,109.086,"But there are unworkable aspects to your position, Mr. Pinaud."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,133.48,136.584,--Well--
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,136.584,141.259,The equal pay would be governed by the same thing as--
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,141.259,141.738,--There is--
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,141.738,143.183,--the Fair Labor Standards Act.
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,143.183,159.961,"--There is, I think, no question that the Equal Pay Act and the Age Discrimination Act... Age Discrimination Enforcement Act would be covered by the Court's decision in this case because the enforcement provisions of those statutes are tied to the Fair Labor Standards Act."
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,159.961,170.358,"And if you're right... if you're right... the equal pay case would have to stay in the State court, although the Title VII case could go forward in the Federal court."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,170.358,171.339,That would be correct.
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.586,294.695,"Well, one can certainly maintain an action in the Florida courts, and unless it's removed, it will continue there."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,301.646,312.025,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, obviously it's our position that maintain in this case does mean that it should remain in State court, and we think it's for a couple of reasons."
2002.02-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.652,360.425,"Well, except... except that you have a later statute that says that it's removable unless... unless it is expressly provided otherwise."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,360.425,361.867,Justice--
2002.02-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.867,365.581,And I don't think something that is ambiguous expressly provides otherwise.
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,365.581,379.424,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think what you have to do, though, is I think when looking at the expressly... expressly otherwise provided language, you have to... first, you have to apply Shamrock Oil to that language."
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,412.509,431.788,"And your reading of the word maintain... and your whole case hangs on that word, maintain... suppose the case were brought initially in a Federal court, and there were... there was a motion, a 1404(a) transfer motion, to transfer the case from one district court to another."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,444.224,451.297,"--Justice Ginsburg, I... I don't think that would be the case."
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.82,490.504,"But if you're relying on the language of the statute, maintain in any Federal or State court, any State court, any Federal court."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,501.39,513.668,"--Well, I think then my... my answer to that would have to be the rule from Shamrock Oil says if there's two reasonable interpretations, we... we make a decision that limits removal."
2002.02-337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,591.367,593.693,That was just a magic language case.
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,669.185,675.202,"--I... I don't have... there... there is no case that I know of that would be on point in... in this situation, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,725.483,726.517,What's the reason?
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,746.084,752.009,We believe that the word maintain--
2002.02-337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,752.009,754.022,I understand the linguistic point.
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,756.665,760.238,"--Justice Breyer, I'm not exactly sure why we--"
2002.02-337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,760.238,767.515,"What... what reason would there be that people would want to make an exception for the statute, the normal... I'm not saying there is none."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,773.89,774.944,--I... I think I understand what you're saying now--
2002.02-337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,774.944,775.443,"Yes, all right."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,775.443,776.105,--Your Honor.
2002.02-337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.845,789.933,"Or Federal, yes."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,791.161,791.76,--Well--
2002.02-337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,791.76,792.646,Is because?
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,796.118,797.92,"--Well, they can... they can bring it in... in either place."
2002.02-337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,799.819,812.228,"The reason why Congress would want employees to have a choice, but would not want the defendant to have the choice or bring it to State court, unlike other Federal statutes is?"
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,812.228,825.358,"--Because in 1938, when this statute was passed, it was difficult for many employees around the country to... to effectively vindicate their rights for unpaid overtime if they had to go to Federal court."
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,826.139,840.134,"Mr. Pinaud, that's the same thing with respect to the FELA, and... and Congress therefore expressly provided that if a railroad worker brings a case in State court, it cannot be removed."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,864.977,872.467,"--Justice Ginsburg, I... there are certainly cases... certainly statutes where Congress has said this is not removable."
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,886.65,891.145,But... but before the... the 19... what was it... what?
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,900.507,902.961,--I'm not sure.
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,931.298,943.789,"But we have a string of specific statutes, and then we have 1445 that lists in a row non-removable actions, a catalog of actions that are not removable."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,948.356,949.697,Well... I'm sorry.
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.51,1082.376,"--When... when you say that the... the provision said it could be maintained by an employee, that sounds more like a synonym for brought by the agent of the employee, that the action could be brought an agent of the employee, which of course does not help you."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1082.376,1095.155,"--Well, the way I think we look at it, Mr. Chief Justice, is certainly Congress could not have meant by saying it could be maintained by an agent of an employee that he can file it, bring it, and then somehow have the case ripped from his control."
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.848,1106.368,"Well, but that... that's the case in any case of a Federal statute covered by the removal statute unless... unless Congress says otherwise."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1113.13,1113.546,"--Oh, no."
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.275,1155.03,"Well, ripped from him in what manner?"
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1155.03,1157.589,"--Well, that's exactly it, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.117,1179.612,Are... are you talking about removal?
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1179.612,1180.271,No.
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1180.271,1183.285,So you... you... when--
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1183.285,1183.759,I'm--
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1183.759,1186.817,"--you say ripped from him, you're not talking about the effect of removal."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1186.817,1187.185,--No.
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1187.185,1188.036,What are you talking about?
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1188.036,1196.103,I am talking about what could the word... I... I was responding to a... a question by Justice Ginsburg about the definition and... and so forth of maintain.
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1239.56,1245.13,"But you won't if the employee that you're representing says, I don't want you, I want another representative."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1247.445,1257.572,"Well, I... that's... I suppose that would probably be the... be the case, but I... I think that's... I think that's more... that's more akin to dismissal."
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1266.692,1267.217,No.
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1272.214,1276.628,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but that would be the employee's decision."
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1281.468,1291.781,I'm just questioning your... your saying no one could... you couldn't wrench the case from the agent because the word maintain is used.
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1296.661,1298.381,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1310.658,1312.502,But nobody else could appoint an agent.
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1316.253,1343.993,"--Well, if the... the point I... I am trying to make is that if this representative is maintaining the suit for the employee, if it only means bring, then one could conceivably fashion reasons why that person wouldn't have a... would not be able to continue on foot that suit aside from the employee."
2002.02-337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1462.35,1472.882,"No one would suggest that a State court isn't competent to hear an ordinary tort case, an ordinary contract case, but if there's a diversity of citizenship, it can be removed to the Federal court."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1478.355,1481.556,I agree.
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1525.45,1526.241,"Fine, Mr. Pinaud."
2002.02-337,0,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,1526.241,1526.673,Thank you.
2002.02-337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.673,1529.653,Mr. Hament.
2002.02-337,1,16182,andrew_s_hament,,1529.653,1534.895,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1785.225,1787.372,But the Wage and Hour Division didn't.
2002.02-337,1,16182,andrew_s_hament,,1796.104,1817.745,"Number one, Justice Ginsburg, at this point the Department of Labor has changed their position, and I think that's because of the addition in 1948 of the very express standard that except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of Congress, this type of case would be removable."
2002.02-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.745,1819.819,"Well, what do we care what their position is?"
2002.02-337,1,16182,andrew_s_hament,,1827.997,1829.512,"No, Your Honor."
2002.02-337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.512,1838.061,"So, you know, their... their view on that matter is... is no more persuasive than... than yours, if may say so."
2002.02-337,2,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2394.284,2406.854,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-337,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2517.336,2520.249,What you're saying sounds so sensible.
2002.02-337,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2534.653,2538.883,You want to be very careful about answering how Federal courts don't get things.
2002.02-337,3,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,2682.469,2685.11,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-337,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2715.22,2716.115,I didn't ask whether they intended to.
2002.02-337,3,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,2725.179,2725.762,"--Oh, no."
2002.02-337,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2776.604,2791.693,Was there ever a proposal made in Congress to give workers who have FLSA claims the same express provision that is there for railroad workers?
2002.02-337,3,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,2791.693,2809.621,"Not that we know of, but it's our position that that would be because Congress, at the time it passed this law, believed it was express, that that was the prevailing opinion, and that even now that was still the opinion of about half of... about half of the courts, half of... half of the district courts."
2002.02-337,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2838.088,2839.45,"Thank you, Mr. Pinaud."
2002.02-337,3,21337,donald_e_pinaud_jr,,2839.45,2839.672,Thank you.
2002.02-337,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2839.672,2840.611,The case is submitted.
