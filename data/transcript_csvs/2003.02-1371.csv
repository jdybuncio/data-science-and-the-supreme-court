2003.02-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.052,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1371, Missouri v. Seibert."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,51.62,54.304,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,108.979,109.601,May I just interrupt?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,115.378,116.864,"Going forward, Your Honor, yes."
2003.02-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,116.864,118.722,"Going forward, but not going backward."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,118.722,119.093,No.
2003.02-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,122.165,124.727,So that you still have the presumption that the earlier statement was involuntary.
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,124.727,125.22,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,130.383,136.616,And is that true if the... if the conversation after the warnings includes interrogation about what he said before?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,136.616,142.476,"--It would depend on how that happened, but under the facts of this case, yes, it would still remain true."
2003.02-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.444,196.812,"Would it... would it affect it if the officer said, now, an hour ago you told me X?"
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,200.261,200.798,I think so.
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,209.177,211.063,"No, please finish."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,211.063,219.458,"--because it does not... it is not sufficient to overbore the individual's will, which is the question at that point because we're at the voluntary analysis at that point."
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,219.458,240.551,"The difficulty I have with the argument is the premise that you state... is in accepting the premise that you state, and that is that a second interrogation that falls on the heels of the first... here, I think there was a 20-minute break... can really be separated as a matter of simple psychology."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,268.599,273.762,"Well, first, Elstad addressed that exact issue and came to the opposite conclusion."
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,273.762,277.31,"But... but Elstad... I mean, let me... and maybe that's the way I should have focused the case."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,306.101,307.198,"It is different, Your Honor."
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,336.92,343.153,"But that's... comparatively speaking, I... I think maybe that was... that was relatively easy to tell in Elstad."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,390.873,392.525,"Well, two observations on that, Your Honor."
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,400.305,401.486,But you want us to wade deeper.
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,410.94,419.279,--I... I don't know that I agree with that because I don't see this as different from where you are in Harris where you still have to do a full-blown analysis of voluntariness.
2003.02-1371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,441.942,453.831,"Ms. Mitchell, do you take the position that we have to conduct a voluntariness inquiry in... as to the second statement--"
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,453.831,453.914,Yes.
2003.02-1371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,453.914,455.112,--after the warnings were given?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,455.112,455.567,Yes.
2003.02-1371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.567,456.476,You agree with that.
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,456.476,457.032,Absolutely.
2003.02-1371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,457.032,479.694,"And in doing that, do you think that the officer's use of the initial confession to get the defendant to admit what went on is irrelevant to that voluntariness inquiry--"
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,479.694,480.232,I would not--
2003.02-1371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,480.232,483.425,--or just that it isn't sufficient to determine the outcome?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,483.425,484.251,--I think it--
2003.02-1371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,484.251,485.654,What... what is your position exactly?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,485.654,488.066,--I think it is not sufficient to determine the outcome.
2003.02-1371,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.885,490.667,But it is relevant in the inquiry.
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,490.667,507.385,"I would not say it's irrelevant because I think, as the Court has looked at totality of the circumstances and what is necessary to show coercion, basically the Court has looked, I believe, at two elements: the conduct of the officer and if it is coercive, and the effect on the individual considering their personality, character traits, and so forth."
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.076,529.926,I... I don't... I don't understand your... your position on that point.
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,551.596,554.94,"I don't think it can control, Your Honor, and I don't--"
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.94,555.849,I didn't say control.
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,568.109,573.932,"--And I suppose I would draw the distinction between the questioning and the answer, which I think is a distinction this Court drew in Elstad as well."
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.733,615.187,"What... what you're inviting courts to do is to say, well, he wouldn't have made the second confession had he not made the first one which was unwarned under Miranda and therefore the second one is also presumptively... that's what you're inviting."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,615.187,615.725,I don't think so.
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.298,625.384,"Of course, it can't carry the day, but it's... it's one of the totality of the circumstances."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,625.756,626.461,--Correct.
2003.02-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,635.582,639.176,May I ask you just a broader question?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,651.269,655.356,--I think... I think there are lots of reasons why... why police departments would not do that.
2003.02-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.356,655.894,Why not?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,655.894,662.209,"There is a risk associated with taking this type of an approach, and as our officer indicated here, he was rolling the dice."
2003.02-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.462,667.205,So what has he got to lose is what I have to understand.
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,676.66,676.826,--What--
2003.02-1371,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,676.826,679.427,Why would you not... why would you not always adopt that policy?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,679.427,685.454,"--Well, what officers want when they do an interrogation generally is an admissible statement for all purposes, not for some limited purpose."
2003.02-1371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,707.707,712.165,"But not if you get the rule that... that you're asking for here, other than this factor."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,727.497,728.406,--In and of--
2003.02-1371,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.406,731.378,It is a factor in the totality of the circumstances?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,732.493,732.864,--No.
2003.02-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,753.009,760.622,"When you say reference back, Ms. Mitchell, you mean the interrogator refers back to the--"
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,760.622,760.872,Yes.
2003.02-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.872,762.191,--earlier statement.
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,762.191,763.389,As occurred in this case.
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.389,771.357,And the reference back could cause it... could cause the later statement to be involuntary because?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,771.357,776.559,"Well, I don't think it would cause the... the statement to be involuntary in and of itself, but--"
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,776.559,785.763,"I know not in and of itself, but it... it tends to show that the prior statement... that the later statement is involuntary."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,790.843,809.047,"--I think if the Court were to consider that, it would be one factor bearing on how the other circumstances or other parts of the police conduct affected that individual because in the analysis in Elstad, the Court looked at this question of the effect on the individual of having spoken before."
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.474,821.679,"The... the only way it could have any bearing, it seems to me, is that the person would have said, what the heck, I've already coughed it up, I may as well... I may as well do it again."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,824.734,826.553,--I don't think that makes the second--
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.553,827.379,"Well, I don't think it does either."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,827.379,827.751,--I don't--
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.751,830.352,"And if it doesn't, I don't see how it can at all be relevant."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,830.352,836.296,"--Well, Your Honor, if the Court is looking at the totality of the circumstances, what we're saying is that may be one circumstance the--"
2003.02-1371,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.296,844.264,"When we said totality of the circumstances, I... I had always thought we meant totality of the relevant circumstances, you know, not whether it's a Tuesday afternoon or not."
2003.02-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,844.264,846.493,Is time relevant?
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,880.856,882.137,--Correct.
2003.02-1371,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.137,888.536,"Suppose it had been one continuous episode, but in the middle of it, they gave her Miranda warnings."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,888.536,891.153,"We do not believe that that would make any difference, Your Honor."
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,905.171,911.653,"It's... it's simply that the closer the interrogation, the less likely that there is in fact a voluntary waiver."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,911.653,922.139,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because what... what you're looking at to determine if there's a voluntary waiver is whether the individual had the information, specifically the legal information, they needed to make a decision."
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,929.735,938.569,"No, but it's... it's more than simply a... I mean, there's... there's no question that the... that the crucial element is a decision made with appreciation of legal rights."
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,944.43,944.968,Correct.
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,944.968,954.999,"And it seems to me the closer you are to the prior statement, the closer you are to saying to yourself, what have I got left to waive?"
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,957.312,958.138,I think--
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,958.138,962.634,And... and that's not a... that's not a function of... of knowledge of law.
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,966.061,967.258,"--Well, two things on that."
2003.02-1371,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,993.513,997.328,"Do you know... do you know why we... we have the common phrase, I think I'll sleep on it?"
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,1005.94,1012.749,"--But on the other hand, Your Honor, I think this could be more equated to buyer remorse where someone has done something and they thought, wow, I wish I hadn't done that."
2003.02-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.353,1030.665,"That... you're reserving your time, Ms. Mitchell?"
2003.02-1371,0,33908,karen_k_mitchell,,1030.665,1030.781,Yes.
2003.02-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1030.781,1031.775,Very well.
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1033.92,1042.771,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.021,1082.757,May I ask whether you... you to comment on one... what if we required that the second warning include a statement that you realize what you said up to now would be inadmissible in your trial?
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1082.757,1098.193,"That is exactly the requirement that this Court rejected in Elstad, and the only difference between this case and in Elstad identified by the Missouri Supreme Court is that here the initial failure to warn was intentional."
2003.02-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1131.221,1142.161,"That's... that's what's not clear to me, that... that... it seems to me you're absolutely on the right track in saying that Miranda has, as one of its basic purposes, dealing with cases where there may or may not be compulsion."
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1201.278,1202.393,"--No, Justice Breyer."
2003.02-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1202.393,1202.576,Because?
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1202.576,1208.215,Because start with Elstad which rejected any requirement of a break.
2003.02-1371,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1254.633,1255.005,It does not.
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1271.889,1287.41,--But the difference between this situation and Miranda is that what Miranda addressed was a situation where you were relying solely on a voluntariness inquiry to determine whether the statements that were admitted were compelled.
2003.02-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1302.187,1303.096,"Mr. Gornstein, I--"
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1303.096,1303.385,--totally on the--
2003.02-1371,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1303.385,1318.328,"--Mr. Gornstein, I... Miranda, whatever it has become, has all over it inform at once, and what we're talking now is, no, Miranda isn't inform at once at all."
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1348.345,1362.053,"--Justice Ginsburg, how I... how I would describe it is that you are required to give Miranda warnings if the government is going to be able to introduce this... the statements as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt."
2003.02-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1362.053,1366.178,"But, Mr. Gornstein, you're just making a different compelled inquiry."
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1392.556,1405.725,"But the difference, Justice Stevens, is that... that yes, there will be inquiry into the voluntariness of the first statement and the second statement, but the difference is that the only statement that is being admitted is the second statement."
2003.02-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.718,1409.44,But you... you agree that's inadmissible if the earlier one was compelled.
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1409.44,1414.248,"--Well, not automatically inadmissible if it was compelled, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1414.786,1415.446,"Oh, I misunderstood you."
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1415.446,1415.612,--No.
2003.02-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.979,1421.096,No.
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1426.092,1426.258,--No.
2003.02-1371,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1426.918,1429.314,Would it not automatically follow the second would be inadmissible?
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1429.314,1429.973,--No.
2003.02-1371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1441.49,1442.399,Mr. Gornstein--
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1442.399,1443.392,But what... what I... I'm sorry.
2003.02-1371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1443.392,1443.597,--No.
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1444.34,1454.371,"I... I just wanted to get this one... one thing answered which is that when you are looking at the second statement and admitting it, you... it is a statement that has been preceded by Miranda warnings."
2003.02-1371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1483.804,1497.716,"Mr. Gornstein, you in... in the answer you just finished giving and I think throughout your argument, you were making... I think you were making the assumption that there are two inquiries that should be made in the situation that you envision."
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1511.175,1512.29,Yes.
2003.02-1371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1512.29,1513.199,Okay.
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1513.199,1518.317,There has to be an inquiry into the... there has to be a knowing and intelligent waiver.
2003.02-1371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1529.712,1546.885,"And... and don't you think that the... the situation presented by this kind of case... for purposes of... of judging the voluntariness of the waiver, don't you think that the situation presented by this kind of case is significantly different from the situation presented by Elstad?"
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1567.235,1572.808,"Well, I... I think what is fair to say is if it has crossed over into compulsion, yes."
2003.02-1371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1585.522,1586.887,I'm trying to keep it simpler.
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1618.315,1623.062,"--The longer the interrogation, that makes it relevant to the inquiry."
2003.02-1371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1631.197,1634.829,It's... it's... but that's... you're... you're getting to question three again.
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1637.058,1637.884,I'm sorry.
2003.02-1371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1638.627,1640.651,--the likelihood of a voluntary waiver.
2003.02-1371,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1640.651,1641.023,--No.
2003.02-1371,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1641.106,1645.481,We've got to... we've got to touch that base before we ask the question about compulsion.
2003.02-1371,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.481,1646.846,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1651.016,1652.009,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2003.02-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.009,1652.464,We'll hear from you.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1652.464,1655.436,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.518,1667.325,What do you mean by a systematic interrogation?
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1667.325,1682.268,"Well, I think what Elstad said and why this situation is so much different from Elstad is that it cited cases where there had been a systematic interrogation where there was a deliberate elicitation of questions--"
2003.02-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.268,1689.616,"I... I realize there may be cases, but how about you defining what you mean by a systematic interrogation?"
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1689.616,1695.189,"--When police officers deliberately elicit incriminating statements from a suspect, then--"
2003.02-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.189,1699.73,In other... it... it doesn't have to go over any period of time?
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1699.73,1704.067,--I don't believe... I don't believe time is the critical factor.
2003.02-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.067,1706.872,"Isn't that the whole point of interrogation, is to elicit statements?"
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1706.872,1715.334,"Not in all circumstances, and I... I think sometimes, especially what the Missouri Supreme Court said there's a risk to this practice."
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1750.134,1751.537,And... and why should that be?
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1809.456,1835.008,"--Well, Your Honor, the... in Elstad, this Court cited Westover which the cardinal fact of Westover, as you said in Mosley, was that the failure of police officers to give any warnings whatsoever to the person in custody before embarking on an intense and prolonged interrogation of him would result in coercion."
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1835.008,1838.723,So... so what we're... so what we're concerned about is the fact of coercion.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1839.921,1842.688,"I think in this case you have coercion, but I think--"
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1842.688,1846.536,Let's talk about the... as a general rule.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1846.536,1848.56,--No.
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1848.56,1858.303,"So all we're talking about is the risk of coercion, or are we talking about preserving the... the integrity of Miranda by not circumventing it, et cetera?"
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1858.303,1860.161,All of those.
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1862.74,1864.598,"Well, but I thought Miranda was only concerned with coercion."
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1864.598,1866.167,No.
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1867.282,1870.42,As an end... as an end result.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1872.494,1880.906,--Miranda was certainly concerned about the risk of compelling statements being... and also being admitted at trial.
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1902.099,1903.008,But... but can you tell me why that is?
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,1927.445,1943.215,"--Well, Miranda... and in Dickerson it cited this portion of Miranda where it said custodial interrogations by their very nature generate compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and compel him to speak when he wouldn't otherwise do so freely."
2003.02-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.215,1976.902,"The question I think... or at least mine is that if you're talking psychology, the policeman who knows from nothing, never heard of Miranda, accidentally says, did you commit the fire?"
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2014.919,2026.314,"Well, Your Honor, I think we're worried about suspects being coerced and compelled into giving statements that aren't according to their free will."
2003.02-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2026.48,2028.049,Which statements are you talking about?
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2029.535,2030.361,--Both.
2003.02-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2030.361,2032.84,"Both, okay."
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2034.409,2040.082,"I'm not sure I understand the question, Your Honor."
2003.02-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.082,2052.408,"If in fact you're worried about policemen subtly coercing the first statement, why do you have to stop admission of the second statement?"
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2052.408,2057.237,"Well, the first statement is automatically excluded pursuant to Miranda."
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2087.496,2088.612,Work to do what?
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2094.972,2098.11,"Well, it undermines the free will."
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2110.909,2118.172,"Well, could you argue that once you know what questioning is like for, say, an hour and then you get the warning, you have a better idea of whether you want to go through with this or not?"
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2125.276,2149.07,"--I think, Your Honor, once... once she had been subjected to the lengthy interrogation and they got that statement from her that they had pressured out of her, then when she... they said, you know, for... for instance, they would have an incentive to say, okay, now what you just told us we're going to put on tape and I will be back here with a tape recorder and we will put it on tape."
2003.02-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.994,2155.369,It's true if... if we accept that... that the first statement was pressured out of her.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2178.608,2199.951,"I don't think the mere failure to administer the warning may create the pressure, but it's when the officer embarks upon the... the specific questioning and interrogation to get... deliberately elicit an incriminating response, then you have this type of coercive environment or coercive manner of questioning that Elstad was concerned with."
2003.02-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.242,2219.641,"Well, and... and if it did coerce, then... then Elstad said its rule would not apply."
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2247.095,2279.084,"I'm just looking at the language of Elstad and when it said it's an unwarranted extension of Miranda, it was saying just the simple failure to administer the warnings unaccompanied by the actual coercive tactics or the manner of questioning when that is coercive or if... if the environment that it's being done in is coercive, such as the, you know, station house, then... then there would be no presumption, then the second statement wouldn't be compelled."
2003.02-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2292.253,2303.233,"Well, when it speaks of coercive environment or coercive tactics, I... I assumed that what it meant is that the prior confession was coerced."
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2303.233,2323.667,"Well, Your Honor, I... I believe that under Miranda when the Court said that the custodial... custodial interrogation exerts inherently coercive pressure, I think that means when they question and deliberately elicit an incriminating response that is compelling, and--"
2003.02-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.667,2345.669,"Well then, why have we allowed admission of so many statements, you know, impeachment, public... public interest, that sort of thing, that result from a situation where there weren't Miranda warnings given if... if simply station house interrogation always produces coercion?"
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2345.669,2358.468,"--Because there, Your Honor, I think that the Court was balancing the interest of law enforcement against the interest of allowing a suspect to get on the stand and later lie at trial."
2003.02-1371,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.291,2368.128,We... we have not balanced if there were actual coercion.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2374.255,2384.619,"--In... in terms of whether you're going to admit the second statement, in the presence of the potential for coercion or actual coercion, then the burden needs to shift to the State."
2003.02-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2392.459,2398.57,"But you're... you... you... in what you just said, you say, you know, potential for... for coercion, coercion."
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2413.059,2423.795,"I'm saying that if in this context where it was actually coerced, then no, her statement would not have been admissible to impeach her at... at all if she had been... testified at trial."
2003.02-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2423.795,2432.778,But... but no lower court has found that the statement was actually coerced or that the confession... the statement was involuntary because of tactics of the government.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2432.778,2441.006,"Well, I believe the Missouri Supreme Court found that only in circumstances other than these would that first statement have been found voluntary."
2003.02-1371,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2449.429,2469.036,"Well, I thought what the court did was make its decision on the basis that the Miranda warning was intentionally not given and that that was the reason that the supreme court found that the statement could not be admitted."
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2476.178,2476.511,--The--
2003.02-1371,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2476.511,2477.664,No actual coercion.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2477.664,2482.305,--The trial court didn't make any specific fact-findings about voluntariness.
2003.02-1371,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2486.952,2500.864,"Wasn't given, and the reason that the supreme court felt that it had to be suppressed was because the decision not to give Miranda was an intentional decision by the officer."
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2500.864,2512.298,"I believe that was part of the analysis, but the reason they found the waiver involuntary was because of the continuous nature of the interrogation, and it cited the Westover-type cases for that."
2003.02-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2512.298,2514.406,What about... suppose our reason--
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2514.406,2524.187,--We took the... we took the case to answer the question of whether or not Oregon v. Elstad is... is abrogated when the initial failure to give the Miranda warnings was intentional.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2526.416,2554.834,"And I think, Your Honor, when a police officer deliberately embarks upon a tactic to undermine the free will of a suspect in a coercive setting that Miranda acknowledges is a coercive setting, that that does make a difference because it... it impels the police officer into using tactics that otherwise wouldn't be permissible, such as referring to the unwarned statement to get a waiver--"
2003.02-1371,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2554.834,2566.995,"Well, I would have thought you'd look at what happened in the second discussion after Miranda warnings were given to determine whether it was voluntary... a voluntary statement or not."
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2576.943,2579.255,"--I believe it is, Your Honor."
2003.02-1371,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2590.112,2593.993,But... but the question presented is based on Oregon v. Elstad.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2605.223,2610.629,"--Well, Your Honor, maybe the premise of the question presented was incorrect that there was no--"
2003.02-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2610.629,2620.577,Did you... in... did you in your brief in opposition make the point that you thought that it was... it was coerced?
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2620.577,2621.486,"--Yes, Your Honor, we did."
2003.02-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2622.685,2624.747,You're talking about the second one now.
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2628.091,2629.289,"Well, I don't want to--"
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2629.289,2629.661,Finish the Chief Justice's--
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2629.661,2637.174,--I don't want to leave any doubt that I... that the first statement we are asserting in the first instance was actually coerced.
2003.02-1371,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2638.289,2642.83,"--Well, as I... may I interrupt you and ask you to... whether this distinction captures your case?"
2003.02-1371,2,15478,amy_m_bartholow,,2691.416,2699.922,"--I don't believe that what the police officers did here would have rise... rose to the level of Fourth Amendment due process involuntariness, no."
2003.02-1371,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2706.36,2712.099,"To go to the question that I think was presented, let's make my assumptions and let me overstate a little bit."
