2008.07-1372,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.404,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1372, Hawaii v. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,8.487,25.048,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A 1993 congressional apology resolution did not alter Hawaii's right to transfer its public lands or repeal, by implication, prior congressional enactments that had extinguished all competing claims to those lands."
2008.07-1372,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,71.263,72.863,Excuse me.
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,78.25,89.558,"Your Honor, what the Respondents have contended from day one of this case is that they have a property right in this -- in the land, and the Newlands Resolution conclusively settled that question."
2008.07-1372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,101.616,117.792,"But would the State of Hawaii, under Hawaii law, be entitled to take the position, if it so chose, that as the new owner of the lands, it has a special duty as a trustee that some other owner might not?"
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,117.792,124.481,"--Your Honor, the Admission Act gives the State the right to manage and dispose of the lands according to State law."
2008.07-1372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,130.718,152.549,"But then -- then it's just a question of whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court -- assuming that it made the decision that I hypothetically stated -- whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court, as opposed to the Hawaiian Legislature, could make the determination of whether or not there is some special trust obligation imposed on the State of Hawaii by reason of its own duties."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,152.549,166.558,"--But, Your Honor, in this case what Respondents urged was that the Apology Resolution changed the legal landscape and commanded the State to hold these lands possibly in perpetuity without alienation."
2008.07-1372,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.338,200.296,"But, General Bennett, if I understand correctly, looking to your question presented, the only thing before us is the effect of the Apology Resolution."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,220.609,230.251,"--Your Honor, that certainly is one question before the Court, but we believe fairly included in that question is the issue of the nature of the State's sovereign authority."
2008.07-1372,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,243.141,243.708,Why is it necessary?
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,254.58,263.02,"Because, Your Honor, the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision also rests on a premise foreclosed by Federal law, that is that there are competing claims to title."
2008.07-1372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,284.849,292.189,"General, the difficulty I have is that not only do they not say so, the Supreme Court of Hawaii didn't say so either."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,329.545,340.92,"Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii Supreme Court, at page 69a of the appendix for the petition, said that this was a claim seeking an injunction -- injunctive relief with regard to property rights."
2008.07-1372,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,351.56,364.285,"There -- there may well be, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds, and it said at one point the resolution dictates the preservation of the ceded lands."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,412.349,434.945,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that Respondents' attempt to trivialize this Court's jurisdiction -- they say, for example, in the brief in opposition that even if this Court were to reverse, the Hawaii Supreme Court will simply reinstate the exact same decision, and presumably they would press upon the Court the exact grounds they've pressed for 14 years, that is--"
2008.07-1372,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.945,437.445,We don't -- we don't know that for sure.
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,505.422,520.551,"--Your Honor, I agree that this decision clearly rests on Federal grounds, but we would also suggest that the question presented talks about whether the State's sovereign authority is stripped, and the State's sovereign authority, we would submit, is clear."
2008.07-1372,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,555.372,562.561,"Well, I'm not sure it would be prudent when the great bulk of the opinion is based on the Apology Resolution."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,592.461,628.135,"--Well, with -- with respect, Your Honor, the Court certainly could limit its ruling, but in a case that has gone on for 14 years and which, in virtually every pleading, the Respondents have filed they have asserted essentially that the State lacks title to these lands because the United States lacked title, the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii was illegal, and that that's the precise reason for 14 years the State has either been through an injunction or, as a practical matter, not been able to alienate its lands, that this Court certainly has the ability for a question that we believe--"
2008.07-1372,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,628.135,634.038,"If the Apology Resolution is put aside, I'm not quite sure what is left, other than State-law issues."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,634.038,635.473,"--Well, what's left--"
2008.07-1372,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,635.473,654.702,"You could -- would there be anything to prevent the Hawaiian Legislature from passing a law that says, we have absolute -- we have title to these lands, but we are going to impose a five-year moratorium on any transfer of the lands because we want to promote a reconciliation process?"
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,654.702,668.778,"--Your Honor, certainly under the terms of the Admission Act, the authority given the political branches for the management and disposition of the lands is broad and would run up against only the Federal common law of trust that the Ninth Circuit says governs--"
2008.07-1372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,668.778,678.317,"But that's not what the Hawaiian Supreme Court said, and I'm reading from page 98a of the petition appendix, the concluding portion of the opinion."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,714.508,721.346,"--Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii Supreme Court did say that this is an injunction based on property rights."
2008.07-1372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,723.114,726.333,But trust law is based on somebody's property rights.
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,736.589,751.616,"--Well, Your Honor, at page 85a of the appendix to the petition, the court said that the Congress recognized that Native Hawaiians had unrelinquished claims to the ceded lands, and as a result of that recognition, the Apology Resolution dictated the entry of this injunction."
2008.07-1372,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,764.275,775.916,"But, General, I think -- with respect, I still don't know what the position of the Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to be if this Court rules that the Apology Resolution does not support the proposition that you just read."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,813.806,824.33,"Your Honor, what our response would be is a simple one: That the issue of the State's title would in our view be undisputed."
2008.07-1372,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,846.845,857.218,A point on which both you and your adversaries seem to agree is that the Apology Resolution really is not critical to the decision of the Hawaii Supreme Court.
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,878.698,881.916,"Yes, Your Honor, and they have not asked this Court to affirm."
2008.07-1372,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,881.916,890.006,And isn't it true that you don't think that just saying the Apology Resolution did not change anything would be insufficient?
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,890.006,914.704,"Your Honor, because it seems to us clear that both the Respondents and the Hawaii Supreme Court believe that there are property right claims that Native Hawaiians have, we believe those property right claims are clearly inconsistent with Federal law, the Newlands Resolution, and the Admission Act, and that there is no reason for this Court not to reach such a clear claim."
2008.07-1372,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,914.704,923.893,"But they don't say the -- I mean, nothing in the resolution and nothing in the -- does anything in the court's opinion or the resolution say that the claims are valid?"
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,935.301,939.938,"The -- the only thing is the position of the Respondents, who assert--"
2008.07-1372,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,939.938,941.388,"Of course, they think they are valid."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,953.346,954.296,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2008.07-1372,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,954.296,960.166,And all we can say is that this Resolution of the Apology doesn't really say who's right.
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,971.207,983.282,"--Well, Your Honor, it is certainly true that the Apology Resolution does not, as Respondents state, recognize the validity of any claims, but Federal law forecloses the validity of any claims."
2008.07-1372,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1001.726,1006.63,Could the Hawaiian Legislature pass a law saying the Native Hawaiians had claims?
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,1026.609,1033.447,"--Your Honor, the -- the legislature has wide discretion in managing and disposing of the assets of the State."
2008.07-1372,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1033.447,1042.053,"And the legislature, if it wanted to -- as I understand the Admission Act, it lists five purposes; it says any one purpose."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,1064.317,1066.336,"That would not violate the Admission Act, Your Honor."
2008.07-1372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1066.336,1067.853,That -- that would not?
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,1067.853,1068.62,That would not.
2008.07-1372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1068.62,1077.393,"Would it violate the Admission Act if the legislature did not -- said -- said we are giving it to them because we want to, because we think it's a good idea."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,1081.262,1083.214,Your Honor--
2008.07-1372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.214,1086.916,And we feel that we must give it to them because it's theirs.
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,1086.916,1088.966,"--Your Honor, if the--"
2008.07-1372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1088.966,1090.618,Would that violate the Admission Act?
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,1090.618,1098.907,"--If the legislature believed that it bettered the condition of Native Hawaiians to provide proceeds from land to the Native Hawaiians, the Admission Act gives them that ability to do it."
2008.07-1372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.907,1101.676,Did you answer my question just then?
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,1101.676,1103.759,Yes.
2008.07-1372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.246,1108.346,"Please, let me put my question again."
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,1125.141,1127.676,"--I think that would be contrary to Federal law, Your Honor."
2008.07-1372,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.676,1128.643,I think it would be.
2008.07-1372,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,1128.643,1133.897,"Your Honor, if I -- if I may reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal."
2008.07-1372,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1133.897,1134.713,"Thank you, General."
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1148.49,1158.345,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three binding Federal laws make clear that the State of Hawaii has absolute fee title to the lands in the Federal trust."
2008.07-1372,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1162.564,1165.332,What do you think on the question-presented issue?
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1172.105,1175.823,We think that they have been in the case from the beginning.
2008.07-1372,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1213.932,1216.967,"Well, I don't see what those -- where those laws get us."
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1244.967,1247.317,"Let me answer that in two steps, Justice Alito."
2008.07-1372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.617,1278.271,Is -- is it the function of the Hawaiian Supreme Court to declare moral obligations?
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1278.271,1280.088,"Well, Justice--"
2008.07-1372,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.088,1289.662,Would there be any problem -- certainly there is none if the legislature deems there to be a moral obligation and gives the land away on that basis.
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1302.554,1318.413,"--Well, Justice Scalia, that gets to the second half of my answer to Justice Alito as well, which is that the State supreme court is not free, as a matter of State trust law or otherwise, to formulate obligations that don't relate to the State's obligation as trustee of the Federal trust--"
2008.07-1372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1318.413,1322.55,--isn't it perfectly clear that's a question of State law?
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1322.55,1328.787,"--I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because that State law has to comply with the limitations set out in section 5(f) of the Admissions Act."
2008.07-1372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1362.358,1366.329,"Let me just -- are you saying that the State court couldn't do it, but the legislature could?"
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1366.329,1371.381,"--I'm saying that the -- no, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.018,1378.303,Could the legislature do it?
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1378.303,1390.211,"--The legislature could determine that the wisest use of the lands today, the way that would best further -- promote the welfare of Native Hawaiians today would be not to sell it."
2008.07-1372,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.926,1470.147,The State power -- the State legislative power to act depends on the validity of its reasoning.
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1470.147,1476.651,"--Well, Justice Stevens, the State -- the State is given authority to act for particular purposes."
2008.07-1372,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1485.987,1486.589,What if it's the State's position--
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1486.589,1486.939,--It's a State--
2008.07-1372,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1486.939,1506.317,"--that it's -- it is imposing a moratorium on land transfers because it thinks this is the best way to promote the interests of the Native Hawaiians, and part of their thinking is that there was an inequity done when absolute title was transferred to the United States and then to the State of Hawaii?"
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1507.935,1528.516,"--Well, I think, Justice Alito, that if the State made that determination with respect to the class of Native Hawaiians who are defined in the Admission Act as -- as one of the present-day beneficiaries of the trust, and determined that it was -- that that was the best way to act for the betterment of Native Hawaiians, which is a permissible trust purpose, that that would be permissible."
2008.07-1372,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1550.746,1553.864,But that doesn't seem to be what the Supreme Court of Hawaii has done.
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1595.275,1604.631,"Well, the court said, Justice Souter, that there is a fiduciary obligation not to make these land transfers at any time until this indeterminate point in the future at which reconciliation is achieved."
2008.07-1372,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1614.736,1622.692,But doesn't -- isn't the fact that you and I are having this exchange a pretty good indication that we don't know what they -- they meant exactly by that?
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1647.208,1655.045,"Well, I wholly agree, Justice Souter, that the State supreme court thought the Apology Resolution had significance and that the Apology Resolution--"
2008.07-1372,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1655.045,1655.495,More than--
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1655.495,1656.147,--dictated the injunction.
2008.07-1372,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1656.147,1656.83,--More than significance.
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1709.779,1727.491,"Well, I certainly agree, Justice Ginsburg, that the State supreme court thought the Apology Resolution dictated the entry of the injunction, and the -- also on page 85a, the State supreme court says that the Apology Resolution gives rise to the -- to a fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians."
2008.07-1372,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1755.993,1757.41,"Thank you, Mr. Jay."
2008.07-1372,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1757.41,1758.612,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-1372,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1758.612,1763.164,Mr. Shanmugam.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1763.164,1777.822,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The only issue properly presented in this case is whether the Hawaii Supreme Court concluded that the Apology Resolution created an affirmative federal obligation not to sell ceded lands."
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1797.651,1803.139,"So, they relied on Federal law to create a fiduciary obligation."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1808.793,1811.061,Then the Court should vacate and remand.
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1824.536,1826.404,All Federal law?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1830.372,1832.788,--As the source for fiduciary duty?
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.788,1833.824,Do you think those -- yes.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1833.824,1838.542,"The source for the fiduciary duty, according to the Hawaii Supreme Court, was State law."
2008.07-1372,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1841.144,1852.868,"Mr. Shanmugam, on page 99, the State supreme court is saying, inasmuch as the Apology Resolution and related State legislation give rise to a fiduciary duty."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1857.439,1864.026,"--They did say at various points in the opinion that the Apology Resolution, together with State law, gave rise to the fiduciary duty."
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1883.757,1898.266,"Then how to you explain the language, just over and over again -- I won't repeat it -- but they said this resolution of ours is dictated by, compelled by, the Apology Resolution?"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1940.426,1943.711,"--Well, it was more than mere window dressing, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1968.344,1969.594,That's what you relied on--
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1969.594,1969.81,--of the Hawaii Constitution.
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1969.81,1987.406,"--but it's not what the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on, and I would repeat the point I made in the prior argument: What's worrisome about this is they are fastening on a piece of Federal legislation and say, we are compelled to do this because of Federal law."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2014.223,2029.799,"Let me -- let me be clear about this, Justice Ginsburg, if the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion is read to construe the Apology Resolution as creating some affirmative duty or obligation as a matter of Federal law, we agree that that would be erroneous."
2008.07-1372,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2030.917,2037.571,Would you agree that there would be a Federal question if the Hawaiian Supreme Court said the Apology Resolution dictates our result?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2037.571,2047.343,"--No, because we believe that read in context, Justice Kennedy, that that statement is consistent with our theory of the Hawaii Supreme Court's reliance on the Apology Resolution."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.343,2066.221,"Well, why doesn't the Hawaii Supreme Court's reliance upon Hawaiian law to establish that there is some property right on the part of these Native Hawaiians -- why doesn't that conflict with Federal law?"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2066.221,2076.612,"The Hawaii Supreme Court relied on Hawaii law only for the existence of a fiduciary duty, and that fiduciary duty has repeatedly been recognized by the Hawaii Supreme Court."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.1,2083.45,I don't care what you call it; it's a property interest.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2083.45,2084.968,Well--
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.968,2099.561,"As I read the Federal law, it extinguished all property rights in these lands; the lands were transferred to the Federal Government; and the Federal Government transferred them in absolute fee without any encumbrances to the State of Hawaii."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2119.975,2121.591,"--There are two separate issues, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.004,2172.341,You concede -- you concede that the Apology Resolution does not say that the Hawaiian people's claims are valid.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2172.341,2174.026,The Apology Resolution--
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2174.026,2174.576,Does it say that?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2175.142,2179.427,"--does not directly speak to the merits of any underlying claims, whether--"
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.427,2180.16,"All right, so if that's so--"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2180.16,2180.727,--or otherwise.
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.727,2209.06,"--do you object to a three-sentence per curiam opinion in this case where we say, to the extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court could be read to suggest that the Apology Resolution either resolved or cast a cloud, legally speaking, on the title of the trust land, or suggested in any way that land be enjoined -- the sale be enjoined, the court made a mistake; and insofar as it is resting on State law, that's up to them."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2209.06,2212.596,"I -- I think so, with one caveat and I don't mean to quibble--"
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2212.596,2214.364,Do you think you would -- you would object to that?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2214.364,2228.291,"--I think we would acquiesce in that with one small quibble, which is that I think that the issue that is being debated here is not whether the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on the Apology Resolution as creating some cloud on title."
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.887,2252.339,How could it have done that?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2275.189,2275.589,--Yes.
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.676,2286.877,--You agree that the Apology Resolution does not say who's right about the claim?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2286.877,2287.912,--No.
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.0,2295.483,Like what?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2295.483,2297.102,"It is, after all, significant that Congress--"
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.102,2297.535,What?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2297.535,2308.41,"--Congress expressed its support for the reconciliation process, Justice Breyer, and that would provide an obvious boost in the Hawaii Legislature for the ultimate resolution of those claims."
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2315.747,2334.977,"If -- if you took Federal law, the Apology Resolution, out of the picture, the Hawaii Supreme Court could reach the result that it reached, and then we might have questions about its consistency with the Admissions Act and the Newlands Resolution."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2352.439,2353.072,Yes.
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2353.822,2362.211,"And the political process question I think is really bothersome, that the Hawaii Supreme Court chose to use this Federal crutch."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2365.913,2376.202,"And it's for that reason, Justice Ginsburg, that we freely concede that if the Hawaii Supreme Court had relied on the Apology Resolution as creating some Federal duty, that would be problematic."
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2376.202,2376.971,What about the--
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2376.971,2377.471,We certainly do not--
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2377.471,2381.023,"--What about the Newlands Resolution, the Admission Act, and the Organic Law?"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2386.576,2392.396,"--Well, it's hard to say because it would depend on how they relied on them, but I think that the critical point--"
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2392.396,2398.55,"They relied on them the same way you say they relied on the Apology Resolution, to give rise to a fiduciary duty under State law."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2398.55,2405.638,"--Well, I don't think that those Federal acts could be read as creating a fiduciary duty not to sell the ceded lands."
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2423.266,2442.263,"So you would have no -- just to carry on the opinion-drafting process, you would have no objection to an opinion that said no source of Federal law gave rise to a duty under State law, fiduciary or otherwise; that any further proceedings on remand should be based solely on State law?"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2442.263,2452.685,"--Well, I think that that is right in the sense that we certainly think that the Hawaii Supreme Court in the first place intended to rely on a State law of fiduciary duty."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.141,2463.077,What if they do nothing at all?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2494.246,2496.564,"--Well, I don't think they would do that, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.564,2496.964,You don't?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2496.964,2506.253,"On remand, I think that they would consider the issue of whether the injunction could be grounded on State law, which after all was the basis of our complaint from day one in this case."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.705,2509.807,"Not if we said ""to the extent that""."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2520.579,2521.698,"--Well, presumably--"
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.698,2526.733,"But if we just said, to the extent that it may be grounded on that, we take no position on whether it's grounded on that or not--"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2526.733,2528.352,"--Presumably, Justice Scalia--"
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2528.352,2530.035,--why would that require any action on their part?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2530.035,2546.397,"--If the Court were to write that opinion, I assume that the last line of the opinion would be to vacate and remand, and that would eliminate the injunction, and so the Hawaii Supreme Court would have the case once again; and at that point the Hawaii Supreme Court could clarify that the source of the fiduciary duty at issue was State law."
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2546.78,2549.948,"No, but it's not simply a question of the source of the fiduciary duty."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2568.91,2583.503,"--And if the Hawaii Supreme Court on remand, Mr. Chief Justice, addressed the merits of any underlying legal claims, then this Court could review the decision, and at that point it might have some sense of, for instance, what those legal claims actually are."
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2583.503,2606.185,"But if we told them that these various Federal resolutions, including the Apology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a particular way that precluded the burdening of the State's title on the basis of Federal law, then they would have to find a basis under State law that was not inconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect title."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2606.185,2621.795,"Well, that is presumably always true, but, you know, I think for purposes of the current posture of the case, Mr. Chief Justice, the only Federal issue that is before the Court is the question of whether the Apology Resolution was the source of the underlying obligation."
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2621.795,2622.462,And do you think--
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2622.462,2623.164,Petitioners did not--
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2623.164,2640.239,--Do you think that that resolution is distinguishable in any way from the apology that the United States made to the people of Japanese ancestry who were interned after World War II?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2668.176,2675.512,--The -- the Apology Resolution in this case does not speak directly to the merits of any underlying claims.
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2699.73,2712.704,"So if I said that just in the opinion and said just what you said, and nothing else about the resolution, say we don't see any other way in which the resolution could have supported this, would that -- is that okay with you?"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2712.704,2742.307,"Yes, that would be okay, Justice Breyer, and I do think that it would be important for this Court to make clear that to the extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court, in any subsequent remand, relies on the Apology Resolution only for what are essentially factual findings, its acknowledgment that Native Hawaiians have unrelinquished claims, which is undoubtedly true as a factual matter -- I don't hear Petitioners to suggest otherwise -- and its recognition that there is an ongoing reconciliation process, that is entirely proper."
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2743.624,2763.22,"But then it would also have to just -- the opinion we're drafting would go further, I suppose, and since we are interpreting all these Federal provisions, it may not be sufficient to say that it did not create this obligation and the Hawaiian Supreme Court was wrong to do that, but that it precluded the creation under State law of this type of obligation."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2763.22,2764.672,"--Well, that is essentially--"
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2764.672,2783.551,"And if the Hawaiian Supreme Court wants to create, under State law, a particular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the status of the land prior to admission, then it has to run -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be consistent with the Federal provisions."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2783.551,2792.157,"--But the Hawaii Supreme Court, in the opinion under review, did not ground that duty on any judgment about the validity of the original conveyance of title."
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2793.074,2793.557,"No, I'm not saying they did."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2805.731,2826.043,"--But I do think, Mr. Chief Justice, that that is an entirely discrete question from the question presented, and it's entirely discrete precisely because this argument concerning the Newlands Resolution could have arisen, even if the injunction were, as we believe it was, unambiguously based solely on State law with nary a reference to the Apology Resolution."
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2827.227,2828.727,The Native Hawaiians--
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2832.112,2833.214,--That's correct.
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2833.214,2835.75,And what -- that comes out of Hawaii legislation?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2835.75,2837.3,"Yes, that's right."
2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2855.395,2860.616,"The -- the $5.5 million figure, is that the subject of litigation?"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2860.616,2868.221,"The valuation of the Leiali'i parcel was challenged in this litigation, and it remains pending before the trial court."
2008.07-1372,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.885,2897.491,"It also, I guess, has a -- there -- in the Admission Resolution, it set up a trust."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2927.926,2934.097,"Well, no -- but let me say something about that, because I do think that it is relevant to our interpretation of the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.609,2979.493,Is the court the trustee?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2979.493,2981.728,The State is the trustee.
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2981.728,2982.561,The State is the trustee.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2997.087,3006.193,"Well, article 12, section 4, we would respectfully submit, Justice Scalia, does place Native Hawaiians in something of a privileged position vis-a-vis the other beneficiaries."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.472,3029.226,And saying that the trustee must direct it primarily to -- to that among the five ends.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3029.226,3050.991,"All that the Hawaii Supreme Court said was, in light of the very realistic prospect that lands may be returned to Native Hawaiians as part of the reconciliation process that Congress recognized in the Apology Resolution, it would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty to sell those lands for another trust purpose, for the simple reason that once those lands are gone, they are gone forever."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.978,3065.584,And all this comes from the fact that Congress made reference to and approved a so-called reconciliation process?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3065.584,3066.817,"--Well, Congress did support that--"
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.817,3074.439,"So in -- in perpetuam, this land can't be transferred because Congress approved the this reconciliation process?"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3074.439,3077.391,--Only until the claims of the Native Hawaiians are resolved.
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.391,3078.824,I see.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3078.824,3091.799,"--regardless of the degree of reliance upon the Apology Resolution, Justice Scalia, is that the Hawaii Legislature has substantial discretion to act and to act in a way that essentially vacates the terms of the injunction."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3104.542,3105.409,Or denying it to them?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3105.409,3106.626,--Or denying it to them.
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3187.363,3190.748,So the decision of the Hawaii Supreme Court would then be vacated?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3190.748,3193.766,--The petition would be dismissed under Munsingwear.
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.766,3195.385,Under Munsingwear.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3195.385,3195.985,Yes.

2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3196.468,3197.468,"If there is, in fact, mootness."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3204.991,3205.891,I don't quite understand.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3214.847,3215.63,"Well, if--"
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3215.63,3217.132,--except to live under that injunction?
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3217.132,3226.071,"--If a Federal court enjoined you from selling your house without any underlying legal authority for doing so, presumably that injunction would be invalid."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.421,3227.94,"No, no."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3232.659,3242.949,"--Well, here the lawsuit was commenced by Respondents, because Respondents believed that the State was going to imminently sell the Leiali'i parcel."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3253.138,3266.832,I don't think that -- I don't think that the State has to have an immediate intention to sell any particular piece of land in order to object to an injunction against any sale of land by the State in the future.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3270.85,3275.92,"--Well, it just -- it merely suggests that the -- that there is no longer an underlying dispute, Justice Scalia."

2008.07-1372,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3367.93,3380.655,--Can I go back to your -- your suggestion that this is a moot case because the government -- because the -- the governor agrees with your position.
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3391.713,3396.665,"A lot of money was sunk into this parcel, at least according to the record below."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3482.621,3492.678,"Mr. Shanmugam, you -- you didn't raise in -- in your opposition to the petition the -- the question of mootness."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3492.678,3500.767,"Well, the governor's statements about the lack of an intention to sell ceded lands were only made literally in the days before we filed our brief."
2008.07-1372,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3507.171,3508.504,"Well, you don't have to preserve it."
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3522.431,3533.905,"--Well, I would submit that even if the Court does not believe that this rises to the level of jurisdictional import, that it is at least significant in assessing the -- the substantiality of the burden on the State."
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3542.594,3549.498,"--Mr. Shanmugam, just as a matter of curiosity, do you know what percentage of the Hawaiian population is comprised of Native Hawaiians?"
2008.07-1372,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3549.498,3557.271,I think the most recent figures from the 2000 census are that there are something like 1.2 million people in the State of Hawaii.
2008.07-1372,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3567.776,3568.661,"Thank you, counsel."
