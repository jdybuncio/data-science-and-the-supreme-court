1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.509,"We'll hear first this morning in argument No. 90-89, the International Primate Protection League and Its Members, et al., v. the Administrators of Tulane Educational Fund."
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,13.56,19.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.73,88.351,But what do you mean on a questionable appeal?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,88.351,94.855,"Mr. Chief Justice, I will try to explain to you what I myself have never understood."
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,96.866,97.928,That may be a difficult task.
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,98.759,107.205,"--When this case was first removed to Federal court, NIH accepted service."
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,162.58,164.66,Do you oppose the motion to dismiss?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,164.66,167.912,"Yes, Your Honor, we did oppose the motion to dismiss."
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.912,173.737,"I would think that if you hadn't wanted to name them in the first place, you wouldn't have wanted them in the case."
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,173.737,184.435,"Mr. Chief Justice, NIH takes the position that our having named them as a party in this suit is an unretractable admission against interest."
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.675,218.546,"So, you... you named NIH as a party."
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,218.546,219.708,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.109,222.56,And you later decided you didn't want them as a party?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,222.56,223.691,--That's correct.
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.691,226.303,When did you notify the district court of that?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,226.303,229.934,"Your Honor, we notified the district court immediately."
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,231.836,237.37,Can't you dismiss on your own motion under the rules if you could... haven't served them?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,237.37,248.416,It was NIH's position that it would intervene as an indispensable party and it was addressing that issue as well as our questioning of their interest in this case.
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.208,269.751,That's what you mean term questionable appeal.
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,269.751,270.832,--It goes further than that.
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,292.194,293.066,A stay of what?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,293.066,305.364,"--A stay of the temporary restraining order, and more pertinently at that time, a stay of the discovery on NIH's interest in the case that had been ordered by the district court."
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.433,362.032,"Well, I wonder if perhaps, Ms. Woodward, if perhaps very likely in response to my question, we aren't getting somewhat away from the question that's presented here... whether the removal statute authorizes NIH to remove?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,362.032,364.773,"--We are, Your Honor, and... and time is very short here."
1990.90-89,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,396.203,402.688,"Now, as the case comes to us, it's been determined that the petitioners lacked standing."
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,402.688,403.779,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-89,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,403.779,409.97,How is it in that posture that we are able to consider the removal question?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,409.97,413.444,"This is one of the interesting ironies of the case, Your Honor."
1990.90-89,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,414.735,417.357,"Yes, I'm very interested in how you overcome that."
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,417.357,424.731,"--Article III standing requirements only apply, of course, in Federal court."
1990.90-89,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.464,434.868,And you take the position that there is standing... there would be standing as a matter of State law in State court--
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,434.868,437.069,"--Yes, Your--"
1990.90-89,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.069,440.953,--but the Federal courts have determined that you have no standing under article III.
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,440.953,449.297,"--The Federal courts have determined that we have no standing and this Court did not grant writs on that question, although we attempted to bring it up."
1990.90-89,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,538.396,560.199,"Are you arguing that the district court and the circuit court and this Court is really required... are really required to reach the removal issue at some point, because if you base the case simply on lack of standing, it goes back to the State court, at which point NIH removes back to Federal court which goes back to State court based on standing."
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,562.793,566.246,"Your Honor, I would be happier if I were on that kind of treadmill."
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.95,625.201,"Well, Ms. Woodward, why... why isn't it reasonable, assuming that the removal issue was decided correctly, why is it unreasonable for the Federal Government to say, we only want our agents and agencies to be sued by somebody who has standing to sue them as we view standing?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,625.201,627.374,Your Honor--
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.374,632.527,The State can allow other people to be sued on the basis of whatever standing rules they want to develop.
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,645.196,646.436,--I would have no objection to--
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,646.436,647.278,You would have no problem with that?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,647.278,650.9,"--I would have no problem with that, but that is a very large assumption."
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.9,653.22,"Well, are you sure that that assumption is not correct?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,653.22,655.611,I'm sure that assumption is not correct.
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.611,670.251,"You think that when a Federal court upon removal dismisses the case for lack of standing of one of the... of one of the parties, the suit cannot be rebrought in State court against the other parties, absent the one who didn't have standing?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,670.251,672.314,That's not the premise with which I'm disagreeing.
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.399,681.999,But that's a totally different argument.
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,701.132,701.851,--I agree with that.
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.851,702.371,Okay.
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,702.371,731.373,But to get to the basic question of whether or not section 1442(a) does permit removal by a Federal agency... I believe that the Court yesterday announced the rule that decides this case in West Virginia University Hospitals v. Casey when it says that the best evidence of congressional purpose is the statutory text adopted by both Houses of Congress.
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.97,824.842,"Assume it means ""her"", too, doesn't it?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,824.842,826.042,"--Yes, Your Honor, to be sure."
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.076,831.827,"I mean if ""her"", then maybe ""it""."
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,831.827,835.349,"Maybe ""it"", and in some cases, ""it""."
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.852,886.403,"How far back does this statute goes, Ms. Woodward?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,887.855,888.805,It goes way back.
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.805,898.08,"--It... you know in the bad old days, you... you couldn't... there was no question of suing the agency or suing the United States in its own name."
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,909.828,911.23,That--
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.23,920.657,"So, you know, once upon a time when this was drafted, might it not be that... that the anticipated effect of it was exactly what the other side is arguing for today?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,920.657,921.408,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.844,951.809,"What kind of agencies... I mean, other things other than the Tennessee Valley Authority and the quasi-private agencies?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,962.294,969.641,"Many, many, many real agencies have been created during the period immediately prior to the passage of this act."
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.133,974.031,And sued... and sued as such.
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,975.203,977.794,--Sued as such under Reifer and Burr.
1990.90-89,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1252.033,1258.507,"Well, now you do concede, I suppose, that the word ""person"" has a broader meaning than just an individual?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1258.507,1266.231,"--Your Honor, it can, but to construe ""person"" to include the sovereign as they have done, is something more."
1990.90-89,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1311.782,1314.203,Of course you're really making two arguments with respect to Tulane.
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1322.779,1323.82,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-89,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1323.82,1324.291,Is that what you're saying?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1324.291,1326.662,I just think that's far too broad.
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.747,1362.84,What do you mean when you say that language has no real currency today?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1362.84,1370.995,--That State courts are hostile to the Federal Government and that Federal defenses cannot be safely entrusted to the State courts.
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.956,1378.798,"Well, then if Congress were to follow your view, it should repeal the removal statute I suppose?"
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1378.798,1387.443,"--No, Your Honor, because I think that there is a distinction to be drawn here between an officer and an agency."
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1390.526,1399.252,"Yes, but surely the hostility of State courts doesn't depend on whether it's an officer or the Federal officer before them... or a Federal agency before them."
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1399.252,1405.466,I believe that that part of the removal statute is somewhat antiquated.
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.516,1448.626,Who is this revisor?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1452.259,1459.182,"This is in the House report, volume 8, number 308, at page A133."
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.182,1464.878,Is that a reproduction within the House report of the notes by whom?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1464.878,1465.967,The revisors' notes.
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.967,1467.419,Who is the revisor then?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1467.419,1469.449,"Your Honor, I don't know who the revisor is."
1990.90-89,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.449,1470.431,Does it say we agree with all of these notes?
1990.90-89,0,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,1470.431,1471.83,These are very brief.
1990.90-89,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.764,1524.156,"Very well, Ms. Woodward."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1526.207,1534.162,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-89,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.931,1626.862,Is that clear?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1656.984,1661.876,"--This Court hasn't often addressed the phrase ""officer of the United States""."
1990.90-89,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1685.351,1698.611,"But at the time this was first... this language was first employed, isn't it reasonable to assume that that narrow meaning of the word, ""officer of the United States"", was intended in this language?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1698.611,1699.222,It's--
1990.90-89,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1699.222,1705.186,And that would certainly explain the language of the statute or agency thereof.
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1705.186,1707.607,"--It's plausible, and we concede that."
1990.90-89,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1727.141,1729.912,"Well, the language was... has been on the books a long time... that language."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1735.105,1747.885,"Actually, in some of the early... ""officers of the United States"" has been a phrase employed from early times, although in the removal provisions that was not the invariable phrase."
1990.90-89,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1765.416,1787.82,"Well, isn't plausible and a permissible inference for this Court to make that Congress was very careful in drafting the statute to exclude agency removal as you now argue, because they were concerned that there might have been a construction of the statute that would be an implied waiver of sovereign immunity?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1787.82,1793.924,"That's also plausible, although petitioners haven't raised that argument."
1990.90-89,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1808.203,1817.059,"Well, you say it's speculation, but sovereign immunity is a well-documented, fundamental doctrine of our jurisprudence."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1839.205,1847.539,--We concede that the statutory language is... can be read to draw some kind of distinction.
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1878.16,1891.277,Do you take the position that the notion that the category of officers of the United States and the category of officers of agencies are identical with one another is plain from the face of the statute?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1891.277,1892.84,--No.
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1892.84,1899.504,How do you... how... what is it that we look to to determine that that's what Congress... that Congress thought those two categories were co-extensive?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1899.504,1901.265,"First, let me clarify."
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.953,1910.131,"Oh, all right."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1915.076,1916.415,"Yes, that's correct."
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.415,1919.528,Is that... is that point plain from the meaning... from the text of the statute?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1919.528,1931.355,"We believe it is among other reasons because subsections (a)(2) through (a)(4) speak in terms of officers of the House and Congress, officers of the court."
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1946.467,1948.948,By that do you include all lawyers who are members of the bar of the court?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1948.948,1949.368,--I'm sorry?
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.368,1953.751,Do you include all lawyers who are members of the bar of the court when you talk about officers of the court?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1953.751,1958.425,I believe that members of the bar would be officers of the court.
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1960.626,1961.755,Are they officers of the United States?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1961.755,1965.288,--It would depend on the circumstances.
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.288,1967.261,"Well, can we tell from the face of the statute?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1967.261,1975.997,We can tell from the face of the statute that officers of agencies in our view are officers of the United States.
1990.90-89,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.94,1990.295,"Mr. Seamon, before we get off of sovereign immunity, what Justice Kennedy was asking about, did the Government raise sovereign immunity as a defense in the State court?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1990.295,2002.434,"--We didn't raise sovereign immunity as a defense in the State court primarily because when... when you are sued in State court, as NIH was, the first thing you have to do essentially is remove."
1990.90-89,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.397,2010.278,But you don't think it was waived?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2010.278,2011.961,--In no sense.
1990.90-89,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.629,2015.791,"Because if it was waived, I assume there's no Federal question here."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2021.355,2024.566,--It's the filing of a petition and that effects the removal of the case.
1990.90-89,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2037.495,2050.473,"When... after removal if there's no jurisdiction, isn't... doesn't the statute require that there be a remand rather than a dismissal?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2050.473,2058.981,"We don't believe that remand was appropriate in this case, because petitioners lack standing."
1990.90-89,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2065.134,2067.746,Is that the same as subject matter jurisdiction... lacking standing?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2074.219,2075.751,That's correct.
1990.90-89,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.81,2120.55,"Well, presumably they still had a cause of action against Tulane, and they also say that the rules for standing in State court are not as strict as article III standing."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2120.55,2133.227,--We would take the position that they cannot refile this suit simply omitting NIH and any other Federal entity from their... from their complaint and their allegations.
1990.90-89,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2139.242,2145.325,"Well, why aren't they entitled to... to sue NIH if there's just... if the only ground is no standing?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2150.42,2164.389,"That... that would be... if the Fifth Circuit, having ruled on both standing and removal, means that they can't NIH either in Federal court or State court."
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.387,2197.941,"But that... that's a matter of State law, isn't it?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2201.822,2202.844,"Yes, that's correct."
1990.90-89,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2209.339,2217.003,"Mr. Seamon, may I go back to the text for a moment on a phrase that hasn't been discussed."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2241.459,2242.969,"No, we wouldn't agree."
1990.90-89,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2250.225,2254.817,The agency acts under color in the same sense that an individual acts under color?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2254.817,2263.002,"--That's right, and to the extent that it exceeds its officers defined by statute, it is... it is subject to suit."
1990.90-89,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2276.802,2290.06,Do you have any examples of identical or substantially identical usage in other statutes that... that has been held to refer to agencies rather than to officers acting under color?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2290.06,2291.402,I am not aware of any.
1990.90-89,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2291.402,2299.748,"So that so far as you know, this would... this would be a unique example of that usage, if we were to agree with you?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2299.748,2304.74,"Again, as far as I know, that... that's correct."
1990.90-89,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2336.623,2352.16,"But how... I don't want to cut you off, but how does that relate directly to the question whether the concept of acting under color of office is a concept which can be associated with the agency rather than with the individual?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2352.16,2369.484,"Our position would be that an agency... any time an agency takes or purports to be an agency action, such as the promulgation of regulations [inaudible] informal adjudication, that it is acting under the color of its office."
1990.90-89,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2400.773,2408.179,"Well, suppose we don't agree with your reading of this officer or agency and we have to look at the ""person"" clause."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2418.836,2432.043,"--We define person to include natural persons, but not only natural persons, also agencies and corporations and associations."
1990.90-89,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2432.043,2434.644,And in this case... Tulane as well?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2434.644,2436.576,"Yes, that's correct."
1990.90-89,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2453.768,2459.392,"So you interpret the word ""person"" here to include the sovereign?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2459.392,2462.163,"Yes, that's correct."
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2570.426,2577.93,"Well, you say that... what is the connection between Tulane and the United States that would justify Tulane in removing here?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2577.93,2582.902,"--There are two justifications, I'm sorry to say only one of which is in the record."
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.601,2601.925,The acting director of NIH and to... a letter from the acting director of NIH to Tulane?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2601.925,2603.114,That's correct.
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2621.717,2627.932,Did you say that makes Tulane a person acting under him for purposes of the removal statute?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2627.932,2629.074,"Yes, that's correct."
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2631.154,2633.815,Him in that case would be what?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2636.036,2642.55,"--Under our reading it could be... it could be NIH, but it clearly also is the acting director."
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.822,2647.894,"May I ask, Mr. Seamon, just to get it straight in my mind?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2663.105,2663.886,That's correct.
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2663.886,2669.99,So we don't whether the Fifth Circuit would accept your rationale on the Tulane argument.
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2669.99,2671.0,That's correct.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.794,2703.69,"Could I ask you, the court of appeals decided both the standing question on the removal question?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2703.69,2705.363,"Yes, that's right."
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.363,2707.744,And decided the standing question first?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2707.744,2711.598,It... the standing discussion is first in its opinion.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.598,2722.513,"Yes, but... but do you agree that... that if the court of appeals was right about standing, it nevertheless could reach the removal question?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2722.513,2725.295,I'm sorry.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2726.837,2731.71,"Well, do you agree that the... with the court of appeals' decision that there was no standing with these plaintiffs?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2731.71,2732.611,"Oh, certainly so."
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2734.151,2740.356,"All right, if you agree with that, do you then agree that the... that it was proper to reach this... the removal question?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2740.356,2741.818,--Absolutely.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2741.818,2755.945,Because I take it an officer who's entitled to remove... let's assume that there is an officer here that was entitled to remove... that officer is entitled to litigate in the Federal court.
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2755.945,2757.387,That's right.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.387,2760.119,But only against a plaintiff who has standing.
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2760.119,2760.978,That's right.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.978,2775.849,"So that the... if the district court finds that there is no standing, the district court should dismiss and not remand."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2775.849,2777.181,That's right.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2777.181,2781.953,"And to let the suit go on in the State court, even though the plaintiffs might have standing there."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2781.953,2782.804,That's right.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.803,2834.188,The standing... the question here... it's a jurisdictional question I guess.
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2834.188,2835.117,"Yes, that's correct."
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.117,2838.319,What kind of a jurisdictional question is it?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2838.319,2841.312,I think it goes to subject matter jurisdiction.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2841.312,2847.666,"Well, what about 1447(c)?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2847.666,2849.228,We would--
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.228,2855.58,"It says that there's a finding... if at any time it appears that district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case should be remanded."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2855.58,2861.835,--We believe that the case should be remanded unless it would be futile to do so.
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.918,2902.263,"Well, subject matter jurisdiction doesn't ordinarily include the concept of standing, does it, Mr. Seamon?"
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2913.118,2920.512,"--It includes those, but it also includes defects in standing."
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2920.512,2922.165,What's your authority for that proposition?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2922.165,2926.407,No authority immediately comes to mind.
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.407,2927.789,Then why do you assert it?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2927.789,2937.696,Because my experience is that you would seek to dismiss a case on standing grounds under 12... rule 12(b)(6).
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2938.235,2947.331,Which would be based on subject matter jurisdiction and not a lack of... so you say motions are commonly made under 12(b)(6) which goes to subject matter jurisdiction.
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2949.474,2958.509,"--It occurs to me that there is authority in terms of... no, I'm sorry, no case is coming to mind."
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.487,2973.748,Sovereign immunity goes to subject matter jurisdiction?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2976.319,2981.844,"--We take the position that sovereign immunity also goes to jurisdiction, so--"
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.844,2988.597,"Well, it may... it may go to jurisdiction in some senses, but the word ""subject matter jurisdiction"" is a fairly technical concept."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2988.597,2990.049,--That's true.
1990.90-89,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.813,3002.919,"Well, of course the First Circuit must have thought it was subject matter jurisdiction to go through all those contortions."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3002.919,3004.388,That's... that's correct.
1990.90-89,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3004.388,3008.991,12(b)(6) of course is also a very understated claim on which relief can be granted.
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3008.991,3011.264,That's correct.
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3045.114,3050.728,May I ask you another question about 1447(c) which seems to require remand rather than dismissal?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3059.605,3065.328,I have not considered that question before.
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3065.328,3069.572,It seems to me if it's a question of State law that would be a reason to remand and let the State court decide it.
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3072.813,3076.816,That may well be.
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3076.816,3091.176,"I can see why if you said for some reason there are no... there are no defendants except Federal defendants who have properly pleaded sovereign immunity or something like that, that it's perfectly clear as a matter of Federal that the State action couldn't go forward and then your futility exceptancies make a lot of sense."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3097.288,3108.698,"It may be... it may be appropriate under certain circumstances to remand to State court, for example, to determine whether a Federal entity is an indispensable party under the State law."
1990.90-89,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3184.557,3191.552,"Mr. Seamon, suppose you get a judgment from a State court against an agency as such, not an individual... not an officer... but an agency as such."
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3195.112,3210.713,"I'm not sure that... I think that, assuming that you were willing to proceed as petitioners have in this case, is that you simply... you file to execute under whatever applicable State laws there are."
1990.90-89,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3216.236,3219.519,You move against the Treasury... the Federal Treasury?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3233.647,3241.043,There is in the... with respect to agencies entitled to sue and be sued in State court and in own name.
1990.90-89,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3267.441,3269.912,May a State court issue an injunction against a Federal agency?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3269.912,3270.883,I'm sorry?
1990.90-89,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3270.883,3273.604,May a State court issue an injunction against a Federal agency?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3273.604,3283.59,"Our position is clearly it would not be entitled to do so, although we... it's quite plausible that had NIH been served as--"
1990.90-89,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3283.59,3285.192,Is there... meaning... what is that Tarbell's case?
1990.90-89,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3285.192,3290.264,--I think that would stand for that proposition.
1990.90-89,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3290.264,3293.117,"Thank you, Mr. Seamon."
1990.90-89,2,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,3296.83,3299.561,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.90-89,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3366.695,3367.366,Does your brief cite that?
1990.90-89,2,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,3367.366,3368.437,"--It does not, Your Honor."
1990.90-89,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3373.71,3376.762,Would you please file copies of that with the clerk [inaudible] the court?
1990.90-89,2,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,3376.762,3377.162,I'd be glad to.
1990.90-89,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3377.162,3377.713,Thank you.
1990.90-89,2,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,3377.713,3387.829,"And to revisit the question that you addressed, Mr. Chief Justice, about Tulane's interest in this case."
1990.90-89,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.111,3426.675,Perhaps you should have thought of that before you filed your lawsuit naming them as a defendant.
1990.90-89,2,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,3426.675,3431.857,"--Your Honor, we thought they were an interested party and we named them as an interested party."
1990.90-89,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3524.589,3525.672,"Thank you, Ms. Woodward."
1990.90-89,2,36840,margaret_e_woodward,,3525.672,3526.455,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.90-89,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3526.455,3527.939,The case is submitted.
