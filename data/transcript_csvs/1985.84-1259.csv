1985.84-1259,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.006,"Ms. Gootee, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,36.006,38.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1259,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,130.282,133.101,"Now, that was an on the ground inspection?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,133.101,140.324,"Yes, it was, Justice Brennan, and during that inspection the EPA people received full cooperation from Dow personnel."
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,249.961,252.83,"But isn't the question in the case, whether it had such a duty?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,256.282,257.149,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-1259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.295,335.234,"Ms. Gootee, what if the EPA inspector here had been able to go to a nearby hilltop and just look over the fence?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,339.269,340.488,"--No, we do not, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-1259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.488,344.673,Why is it any different if they fly over the premises?
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,344.673,352.778,Dow has absolutely no objection to a naked-eye viewing of its plant from anywhere that the government or the public may have a right to be.
1985.84-1259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.718,372.09,"Okay, so you have no objection to the flying over and taking a look, but to the... your sole objection is to the taking of the photographs?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,372.09,376.394,"--Yes, it is, and that... that's both constitutional and statutory."
1985.84-1259,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,394.355,398.057,"Well, would you object to standing on the hillside with a camera?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,398.057,400.593,"Justice Brennan, that's an interesting hypothetical."
1985.84-1259,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,413.617,416.971,Or taking pictures from that spot?
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,416.971,418.205,--Not necessarily.
1985.84-1259,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,421.607,426.493,And it would be more with a camera from a hillside as well as on a fly-over?
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,426.493,427.51,I think it depends on the camera.
1985.84-1259,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,429.528,437.551,"Let's take it that they have one of these... I don't own one, but one of these very... that pick up everything?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,437.551,443.705,--Generally a lateral view from the ground is the view that Dow has chosen to give.
1985.84-1259,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,446.574,447.89,Go ahead.
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,447.89,455.68,"--As we go into the sky at varying levels, it's going to depend more and more on the degree of intrusion."
1985.84-1259,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,456.98,458.132,Forgive me.
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,472.974,476.093,--I have to come back to degree of intrusion.
1985.84-1259,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,494.888,506.446,"Well, what about an airplane, as we read in here, whether they're accurate or not, stories about the phenomenal accuracy of photography now from three, four miles up."
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,527.959,528.576,"Yes, it is."
1985.84-1259,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,529.728,534.446,"I mean, it's the taking of the picture, not the invasion of your air space?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,534.446,535.382,Exactly.
1985.84-1259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,553.959,564.215,Do you object to any enhancement of to person's normal senses in making an inspection?
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,564.215,564.684,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-1259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,589.849,608.394,"What about a case like the following of an automobile by the use of a beeper, which this Court has said was all right under the Fourth Amendment, and yet the police with their natural senses might have lost track of the vehicle they were trying to follow?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,608.394,616.231,"--Except that I think the distinguishing factor, as this Court has held, that the police could have followed it with their visual sense."
1985.84-1259,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,643.484,649.888,"Before you go on, may I put another hypothetical that I suspect you will say is difficult."
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,681.609,689.013,"--Justice Powell, again an excellent hypothetical and one we've obviously thought about."
1985.84-1259,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,701.004,703.189,It's really a matter of privilege?
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,703.189,709.26,"It's purpose, and in this case... it's mostly military satellites that have that capability."
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.59,733.292,"May I interrupt, just to follow up on Justice Powell's question."
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,740.981,743.516,Then we get into problems with the FAA regulations.
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.516,747.218,"No, the helicopters are not bound by the 1,000 foot regulation."
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,749.587,765.013,"I think that the question there, even though it's not binding on this Court, has been answered in the case of People versus Sneed in California where a helicopter did descend 20 feet above a residential back yard and that was clearly held to be an intrusion into the--"
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,765.013,772.1,Is it your view that even if you descend low enough so that you see with the naked eye and see the same half-inch pipes?
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,775.821,779.023,--I think it would be an unreasonable violation.
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.891,783.891,I'm just directing it at the Fourth Amendment.
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,783.891,788.962,"On the Fourth Amendment issue, I think it would be obviously an unreasonable intrusion into--"
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.962,791.847,"Well, what makes it so obvious?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,791.847,797.067,"--The Western Alfalfa case, and somehow in Karo, they are using technology to get--"
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.067,797.5,"No, no."
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,799.686,801.919,"--Well, the helicopter itself is technology."
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.919,802.804,"Oh, oh."
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,806.09,817.898,"Right, we have no problem if they are used in the normal events that society accepts, but if they are used as a battering ram or as an invading tool, then we have a problem."
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.898,819.681,I really have some difficulty.
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,824.052,825.435,You obviously can look.
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.435,828.003,But cannot constitutionally?
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,835.073,848.083,"I think that they would have... it would be an invasion of privacy, just as in NORML versus Mullen, that the use of helicopters to go down and look at people's windows and in their back yards was an invasion of privacy."
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.869,857.939,"And that's because a helicopter is a sophisticated device, is that it, just as though it were a high-powered telescope?"
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,857.939,871.865,"--Well, again, I think I would draw back from the exact technology utilized and focus in on the fact that it's an unreasonable intrusion into a reasonable expectation of privacy."
1985.84-1259,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,879.402,882.904,What about catching speeders by following them with a helicopter?
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,882.904,890.51,"Well, they have a moving car from whatever height is, I think, plainly visible with the naked eye."
1985.84-1259,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,890.51,892.61,We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock counsel.
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,892.61,910.572,Thank you.
1985.84-1259,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,910.572,912.923,You may proceed.
1985.84-1259,0,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,912.923,919.343,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, we have been discussing various types of aerial overflights."
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1694.694,1698.296,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1776.915,1782.319,"Mr. Horowitz, tell me if we can sort of sharpen the focus of this case."
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1810.236,1811.086,If you would like me to--
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1811.086,1821.194,"--On a company protecting a trade secret, and what... and when there is no other option but an overflight, what is the government's answer to that?"
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1821.194,1824.229,"--I'd be happy to talk about trade secrets now, if you'd like."
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1855.582,1858.434,If they are trade secrets that cannot be covered up--
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1858.434,1863.454,"--Well, let me assume that there are some sort of, at least proprietary information there."
1985.84-1259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1990.203,2005.213,"--But what if the government... I know it's not true in this case, but what if there were a secret that the government was interested in acquiring, went over and took a picture and then went ahead and developed its own plant to make whatever the chemical might be or something."
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2007.832,2021.258,"Well, I think the claim is probably... I'm not sure I would agree with it, but I think it's probably more of a taking claim than anything else, and there was a Fifth Amendment claim in this case that was dismissed without prejudice that they can bring."
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2232.409,2237.063,"It wouldn't have been business of the government to obtain an administrative warrant, would it really?"
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2237.063,2238.513,It wouldn't be much of a burden?
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2238.513,2244.417,"It wouldn't have been burdensome to have obtained, as you did in Barlow, an administrative warrant?"
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2244.417,2253.955,"No, you're setting up a whole new regime, basically, where you have to have magistrates involved in this and you have to decide what sort of showing has to be made by the government in order to do it."
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2263.728,2269.032,This whole area is very puzzling in light of the scientific development.
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2292.348,2292.831,I understand.
1985.84-1259,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2379.336,2395.612,"--Mr. Horowitz, do you think the standard should be the same in flying over an industrial complex of this type as it should for the police to fly over someone's residential back yard and take photographs?"
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2397.714,2400.166,"--If anything, I think it's a lesser standard."
1985.84-1259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.22,2513.255,May I go back to Justice Powell's example.
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2529.432,2548.928,"Well, I think there are two different aspects here that come out of Katz, and one is whether there is an expectation of privacy in the sense that you can expect that what you have in there can't be seen from the outside, and then there's a second aspect, which is whether what you're seeking to protect is really something private."
1985.84-1259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.169,2611.869,"I'm a little puzzled on that, on the Dow case."
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2625.942,2629.211,"No, what I have said is, they have taken steps to keep people out."
1985.84-1259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.654,2663.384,"--But if 99 and 99 one-hundredths of the passengers in airplanes, and pilots who flew over really couldn't see anything, it's only the one case out of a million in which you take a sophisticated camera and take a picture, would you say they have no expectation that in general their privacy would be respected?"
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2668.621,2671.907,"--Well, I don't know that comparing it to commercial air flights is very relevant."
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2780.878,2791.15,Would it be fair to say that they are interesting in protecting a trade secret and they think the trade secret would not be revealed from someone taking a photograph from the hillside?
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2791.15,2791.867,I agree.
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2801.292,2803.392,I appreciate the facts can vary widely.
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2855.842,2857.044,"--Well, that's certainly one of our answers."
1985.84-1259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2924.937,2928.825,We had a couple of cases a couple of years ago.
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2953.94,2965.331,"--The pictures were taken by a local photography concern and they were immediately... negatives were put into a parcel and air freighted to EPA, and since that time I think it's been under control of EPA."
1985.84-1259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.244,3073.1,"--Mr. Horowitz, you seem to agree that if there were space age technology used, it might be so unusual that it would be unconstitutional."
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3085.658,3098.481,"--Well, I think a sort of answer to that is that as long as you're going to have a standard where it depends on people's expectations, it's inevitable that those expectations may change with the development of technology."
1985.84-1259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3116.677,3127.418,"Perhaps if that's the rule, the government could do a very good job of educating everybody as to their great capacity for sophisticated investigation and people would realize that they'd have to just take those risks."
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3127.418,3127.918,I understand.
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3195.895,3203.901,"Mr. Horowitz, what I'm now going to ask you is immaterial to the case, really, but you were talking about this garden variety type camera."
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3212.007,3216.542,"It is special, but it is not special for aerial photographers, is what I'm trying to say."
1985.84-1259,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3229.6,3237.372,Could that identify a pipe one-half an inch in diameter?
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3240.491,3247.578,"The finding of the district court, we have a footnote in our brief about the dimensions here."
1985.84-1259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3316.37,3325.308,"--Well, that's a little vice versa from our usual ruling, is that if it doesn't violate the constitution you don't have to get into statutory--"
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3325.308,3338.552,"--I understand, but I mean... I'm saying that the statutory argument there is subsumed in the constitutional argument But I think the statutory argument has to rest on the assumption that the photography was in fact constitutional, which we believe it was."
1985.84-1259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3358.799,3360.666,--Let me ask you one last question.
1985.84-1259,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3370.439,3374.758,"I hate for the last question to be one that I cant's answer, Justice Stevens, but I don't know."
1985.84-1259,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3376.26,3378.293,Do you have anything further?
1985.84-1259,2,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,3378.293,3380.795,"Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3392.437,3394.639,Do you think Judge Merritt just made that up?
1985.84-1259,2,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,3394.639,3395.489,--Your Honor--
1985.84-1259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3395.489,3397.257,"He flies airplanes, I understand."
1985.84-1259,2,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,3397.257,3410.981,"--Your Honor, in our motion for summary judgment we did admit, being reasonable as we think we are in this case, that obviously planes fly over or near the plant, but that's a fair step from saying it's on an airport takeoff and landing pattern."
1985.84-1259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.383,3414.885,How far is it from an airport?
1985.84-1259,2,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,3414.885,3418.17,"It's about ten miles, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-1259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.17,3419.604,Thanks a lot.
1985.84-1259,2,35925,miss_jane_m_gootee,,3419.604,3424.824,The one-half inch detail that was mentioned is visible on the original EPA photographs.
1985.84-1259,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3480.895,3482.113,"Thank you, counsel."
