1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,16.543,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-5014, Jose Gomez v. The United States and Number 88-5158, Diego Chavez-Tesina v. The United States."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,16.543,20.917,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-5014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.305,167.682,"Counsel, the Court did uphold the use of the magistrate for suppression hearings in criminal cases."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,167.682,167.922,"Yes, ma'am."
1988.88-5014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.922,179.822,"Often those also require determinations of credibility of witnesses, and certainly in many cases can determine the outcome of the trial itself."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,186.714,187.826,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-5014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.544,201.947,"Unless you say that it's an additional duty, within the additional duty language."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,201.947,207.611,"--Yes, Your Honor, and we say that it's not an additional duty for a number of reasons."
1988.88-5014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.3,273.606,"Well, certainly there is evidence that Congress meant to give District Judges considerable flexibility in the additional duties they could assign."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,273.606,293.301,"Your... Your Honor, they use the language that we intend to permit district judges to innovate or to experiment, but the question is whether or not the innovation and the experimentation that they had in mind was the assignment of constitutionally important adjudicative functions that elsewhere in the statute it declined to authorize magistrates to perform."
1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.564,336.463,"When you get down to it, Mr. Rudin, a judge presiding at a felony trial can sit there for a couple of hours and he may make a couple... maybe a ruling or two sustaining an objection to evidence."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,341.546,344.899,"--You... you... Mr. Chief Justice, you mean the jury selection phase?"
1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.899,345.349,No.
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,357.219,372.196,"Well, I believe that this Court in in numerous cases has referred to the criminal trial as... well, first of all the criminal cases involving the most important Article III values and also to trials as involving the most fundamental Article III values."
1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.149,398.436,I'm not suggesting that a criminal trial isn't of the most extraordinary importance to the Defendant and to the state too.
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,411.515,416.427,"--Well, it may not necessarily be the most intellectually demanding role."
1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.16,433.2,"But I think a district judge is called upon for many more intellectually demanding tasks than can frequently occur during periods of a criminal trial, when the judge just isn't called upon the to do much."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,433.2,438.413,--But not necessarily the most important role under Article <III> [= III].
1988.88-5014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.164,826.332,"The only thing that sort of rings false is... is, if that's all their talking about it seems rather pretentious to say such insignificant duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of The United States."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,834.396,849.667,"Well, Justice Scalia, the... Congress attempted in the balance of the statute to indicate in each... during each phase of the process, whether the trial or the pretrial phase, what duties it had in mind."
1988.88-5014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.513,874.925,"Let me repeat my question, because you're not answering it."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,885.29,886.182,"--Yes, essentially."
1988.88-5014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.182,901.803,"But if that's the case, why couldn't they have just said, such additional administrative duties, instead of saying, such additional administrative duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States?"
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,919.654,935.516,"Well, I think they had in mind duties that were not covered in the balance of the act and duties that were of an administrative or ministerial nature, otherwise they would not have omitted the language that they included in the pretrial section of the Act, notwithstanding any laws to the contrary."
1988.88-5014,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1030.176,1036.31,I take it the parties could have stipulated to have the magistrate select the jury?
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1036.31,1043.685,"Well, I think that the analysis of of... that question is different than the constitutional and in the statutory context."
1988.88-5014,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1053.793,1058.545,So then it's not necessary for the validity of a criminal trial for the district judge just to be there?
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1058.545,1086.194,"--I think that the... in Shore, this Court stressed that under Article III, that... the... from the litigant's individual point of view certain rights, such as the right to the presence of the district judge under Article III or the right to a jury trial, are required, but that because those rights are essentially for the benefit of the individual litigant, they may be waived."
1988.88-5014,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1086.194,1094.02,"Now, in this case there was no particular decision that the Defendants complained of?"
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1103.058,1109.143,"Well, there were, Your Honor, although they were not objections made to the district court based upon those events."
1988.88-5014,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1135.212,1138.954,But that objection was not... that matter was not renewed before the district court?
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1138.954,1139.765,"No, it wasn't."
1988.88-5014,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1198.903,1211.702,"I take it you don't see any problem with assigning the voir dire to another judge, another Article III judge, for convenience of the judge's schedule, or something of that sort?"
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1211.702,1218.197,"Your Honor, I would see a problem in that and the problem is the constitutional interest that underlies Rule 25A."
1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.277,1313.152,"On an instant of de novo review of the prisoner there wouldn't be a whole lot more than that to be challenged, would there?"
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1313.152,1320.548,"--Well, there... there... I believe that there are a whole host of matters that could be challenged and there are--"
1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.548,1320.698,Like what?
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1320.698,1325.152,"--There's another group of matters that, or... potential prejudice that could not be challenged."
1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.368,1375.459,"Well, that's a form of challenge."
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1384.896,1387.969,--Questions that the magistrate asked or did not ask.
1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1441.504,1444.047,What do you do if you think they're not candid?
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1456.543,1470.812,"No, the problem is that... that where the magistrate is handed the function of jury selection, the only function that the district judge is handing to him as far as the jury is concerned, and the magistrate is the one who's giving the legal instructions and the magistrate is the one who is asking the questions of the jurors."
1988.88-5014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1516.903,1535.706,"Mr. Rudin, I suppose that in order to accept your position that this is not a pretrial matter for purposes of (b)(1)(a), I don't have to accept your position that it's not a pretrial matter for any purposes, including Rule 25, for example?"
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1535.706,1538.808,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't understand your question."
1988.88-5014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1538.808,1544.101,Well your... your... your argument has said this is just clearly... this is clearly part of the trial.
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1548.736,1550.385,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that the--"
1988.88-5014,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1550.385,1557.351,"But we're only talking here about (b)(1)(a), whether it is a pretrial matter within the meaning of that particular statute, right?"
1988.88-5014,0,32664,joel_b_rudin,,1565.386,1581.476,"--This Court could decide that it's a pretrial matter for constitutional purposes, but that would not answer the question of what Congress had in mind, and given that the prevailing view in... in this Court's decisions and the... certainly the common usage that trial is... that jury selection was part of trial."
1988.88-5014,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.412,1680.104,"Very well, Mr. Rudin."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1681.286,1685.268,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.888,1754.995,"Well, what I was thinking of when I was when I was making that comment earlier is that this (b)(1)(a), which is what you're now referring to, says a judge may designate a magistrate... it just doesn't say pretrial matter."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1768.525,1769.256,Not really.
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.99,1791.111,"Well, you hear arguments on both sides and you make your determination."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1801.68,1808.374,"Well, Congress, of course, anticipated that there was a certain amount of ambiguity in the phrase, pretrial matters."
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1859.006,1860.808,You keep talking about experiment.
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1871.884,1874.466,"Well, if the experiment proves--"
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1874.466,1885.155,"To be an experiment, does that give it some backing or does it mean we should take it easy, or that means we should rubber stamp it?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1885.863,1896.262,"--Well, Congress specifically provided that duties may not be delegated to the extent that they violate the Constitution or the laws of the United States."
1988.88-5014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.409,1950.49,"It's a little strange, I think, Mr. Kellogg for Congress to have been quite precise in the other section of the act saying what magistrates can do by themselves, what they can do with de novo review, and then have a catch-all provision which really would make all the rest unnecessary, as interpreted by you."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,1950.49,1953.782,"Well, we don't say that it makes all the rest unnecessary."
1988.88-5014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.454,1993.359,"Well, how... how about the provision authorizing a judge to designate a magistrate to hear and determine any pretrial matters pending before the court?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2001.233,2014.062,"Well, the point of (b)(3) was to pick up other additional matters that were not covered in the broad category of pretrial matters, to permit further experimentation in innovative ways Congress might not even have anticipated."
1988.88-5014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.062,2030.756,"Isn't there some sort of a ustem generis principle working here that if Congress has specified these several things it would be unusual for still a larger thing... or what many people would think is even a more important responsibility, to be found in a catch-all clause?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2030.756,2035.27,"Well, the question would be just how important is that additional responsibility."
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2035.27,2039.133,Is a motion to suppress a pretrial motion?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2039.133,2044.636,A motion to suppress is a pretrial motion specifically covered under (b)(1).
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2044.636,2050.219,"The average dope case, if you lose that you lose the case."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2050.219,2053.931,"It is ordinarily a case dispositive motion, that's correct."
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.931,2057.245,I was waiting for you to emphasize that.
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2057.245,2059.426,I was... I was planning to.
1988.88-5014,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2059.426,2072.393,"Mr. Kellogg, do you think that if your position were correct that this was an additional duty which could be assigned, that de novo review is necessary to sustain it?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2072.393,2077.79,"Well, of course the additional duties clause does not specify what the standard of review."
1988.88-5014,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2092.208,2099.772,"Well, do you take the position that it can be assigned without de novo review to a magistrate in a felony case?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2099.772,2100.733,--Yes.
1988.88-5014,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2118.676,2137.148,"Well, it's... it's a little odd that Congress would have assigned certain pretrial matters that can be heard but subject to de novo review and yet something in the nature of voir dire in a felony case, that they would have said nothing about it."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2137.148,2140.51,"Well, it's... it's... it's not particularly."
1988.88-5014,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2161.536,2163.246,"Well, it depends."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2173.955,2177.097,"In most federal courts, I believe that is the practice, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-5014,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2202.235,2208.419,I don't see how that's the case in the Federal system when the presiding judge or the magistrate does the voir dire.
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2211.611,2230.542,The voir dire is very important in the sense that questions have to be asked to elicit sufficient responses both to elicit any sort of bias or... and to give the parties sufficient understanding of the jurors to exercise their peremptory challenges in a... in a intelligent way.
1988.88-5014,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2242.202,2245.721,Do you think that trial lawyers would say that there's no art to a voir dire examination?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2245.721,2246.463,No.
1988.88-5014,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2265.006,2278.977,"Mr. Kellogg, you... you... you noted that a substantial number of district courts have local rules allowing the use of magistrates for conducting voir dire."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2278.977,2280.366,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-5014,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2280.366,2289.743,Do those rules generally provide that the consent of the parties is necessary for voir dire in felony cases?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2289.743,2302.111,"No, 51 of the 91 federal districts expressly provide that voir dire may be conducted by magistrates without any limitation... for civil cases, criminal cases."
1988.88-5014,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2302.111,2303.531,Do you know what the practice is?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2309.464,2314.129,It's not my understanding that that consent of the parties is required in most cases.
1988.88-5014,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2332.843,2345.622,I take it in many districts in complex cases there are written questionnaires that are the beginning of the process and magistrates spend a considerable amount of time with counsel reviewing the answers to the written questionnaires?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2345.622,2350.194,--You're asking it they could?
1988.88-5014,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2350.194,2353.065,I take it that that's a frequent practice.
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2353.065,2354.076,"Yes, I believe so."
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.35,2374.551,"Mr. Kellogg, it seems to me in the clause you're addressing now what we're really discussing is the meaning of the word additional, and you've already acknowledged... it can have two possible meanings, I suppose."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2396.179,2401.651,"What we mean is, additional duties not specifically covered in (b)(1)."
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.604,2409.716,"Well, felony trials aren't specifically covered in (b)(1), so you don't mean that."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2417.252,2431.524,"Felony trial by negative implication is precluded by the structure of the rest of the act, because the act specifically provides for the trial of misdemeanors with consent and the trial of civil cases with consent."
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.524,2438.306,"Why doesn't additional naturally mean... isn't there a second, quite reasonable natural meaning of additional?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2459.751,2461.994,I think that's a fair reading.
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.994,2463.174,"It comes out the wrong way though, for you."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2463.174,2464.947,It's not inconsistent with what we're saying.
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.947,2465.915,I think it is.
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2465.915,2472.002,Because there's no indication that Congress considered jury selection to be part of the felony trial.
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.002,2474.363,"No, I'm saying it's... it's either trial or pretrial."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2479.946,2491.175,"I wouldn't concede it in the following sense: the inquiry under (b)(1) of pretrial draws some sort of line, obviously, at which point the trial starts."
1988.88-5014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2558.154,2561.376,--Would a motion to suppress be collateral to the core?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2566.48,2577.627,"--Well, this Court in Raddatz made clear that the act permits the delegation of suppression hearings to magistrates under the... under the pretrial provisions."
1988.88-5014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.627,2578.218,"That's quite correct, but--"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2578.218,2593.258,The mere fact that it arises... happens to arise late and during trial does not make it part of the core functions that... that Congress was not going to allow judges to delegate to magistrates.
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2593.258,2605.985,--Is it not true that some criminal convictions have been reversed solely on a juror's being put on the court who should not have been there?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2608.967,2609.197,That's correct.
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2610.83,2613.1,How do you get that in the pretrial category?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2617.504,2634.644,"--The selection process of the juror, if a challenge for cause is not sustained... that should have been sustained... and a biased juror sits on the jury, then that can be grounds for overturning the conviction."
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2654.167,2656.699,How about death penalty cases?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2656.699,2657.44,Pardon?
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2657.44,2664.745,Would you make an exception for death penalty cases under the Witherspoon decision?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2664.745,2674.51,"There is at the moment, so far as I understand, no death penalty in federal court cases and therefore the issue would never arise."
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2680.945,2697.835,"You don't... in other words, the whole importance about questioning for jurors is a pretrial matter, even if it involves the Constitution of the United States?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2697.835,2719.83,"If there is a constitutional right to have a particular juror excused because of some statement of bias or partially, certainly that is a matter not only that the magistrate can handle, but it is also subject to review by the district court judge."
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.83,2727.395,It... I did... you mean the magistrate can decide it and then you rely on the de novo-point?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2727.395,2733.01,Certainly challenges for cause can be reviewed by the district court judge.
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2734.64,2737.783,And that is saving the district court judge's time?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2737.783,2745.556,"--Well, it certainly could well, because disputes will not arise in the run-of-the-mind cases."
1988.88-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2770.603,2775.889,"If you ask the juror, is he under 21 and he says yes, that's not the point I'm talking about."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2795.771,2802.666,"--It's not altogether clear just what the requirements of Article III are, Justice Marshall."
1988.88-5014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2871.523,2875.316,"The district judge, if he reviews de novo, reviews on the transcript?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2875.316,2878.348,"He could, depending on the circumstances."
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.388,2881.119,"Well, how else would he do it?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2881.119,2885.002,"He could question the jury himself, if he wanted to."
1988.88-5014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2885.002,2890.706,But you still lose some of the nuances that happened the first time the question arose.
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2890.706,2914.581,"That's certainly true, but not nearly so much, I would assume, as in a suppression hearing where you have a credibility argument... two witnesses arguing back and forth... and the Court has already said that there's no objection to having the magistrate decide the case as an initial matter and for the judge to exercise de novo review, based on a reading of the transcript."
1988.88-5014,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2918.304,2933.255,"Mr. Kellogg, at one point in your argument you started to stress... or, I understood you to start to make an argument based on the relative importance of this part of the whole process and suggested it was less important than the... than the main event that starts after the jury's selected."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2943.413,2946.505,"That I don't know about, Justice Stevens."
1988.88-5014,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2950.268,2952.73,My impression is trial counsel consider it rather important.
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,2952.73,2956.503,I suspect it would be a rare instance.
1988.88-5014,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2979.347,2979.958,That's true.
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3002.591,3003.332,"Well, that's true."
1988.88-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3026.78,3030.272,"Mr. Kellogg, are you going to argue harmless error?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3030.272,3035.037,"I'd be happy to address that if you wish, right now."
1988.88-5014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3105.753,3111.026,"Of course, you could make roughly the same argument if a magistrate had sat up there and tried the whole case."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3111.026,3118.042,"--Well, I don't think we would try to make the argument in that instance, because that would be the entire proceeding."
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.107,3142.679,But doesn't this go to the very jurisdiction of the tribunal?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3160.082,3161.273,--It's a question of degree.
1988.88-5014,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.273,3165.596,"It's not a trial, and if you don't have an Article III judge to judge, it's not a court."
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3165.596,3171.719,But the trial proper we would say it was conducted by an Article III judge.
1988.88-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3240.093,3244.346,"Do you think the constitutional issue in this case is just frivolous, is that it?"
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3244.346,3249.188,"No, not frivolous, but not very substantial."
1988.88-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3249.188,3249.329,Substantial?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3249.579,3250.831,Not after Raddatz.
1988.88-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3257.166,3262.651,So you don't think there's a serious enough constitutional question to affect how you construe the statute?
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3262.651,3268.874,"Well, the statute itself provides for additional duties up to the limit of Article III."
1988.88-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3276.36,3276.521,I know.
1988.88-5014,1,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3285.858,3297.624,"--It would be very difficult to do that given that Congress has said, we want this interpreted up to the limits of what's provided by the Constitution."
1988.88-5014,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3315.316,3317.006,Thank you Mr. Kellogg.
1988.88-5014,2,32664,joel_b_rudin,,3319.299,3320.218,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.88-5014,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3396.35,3397.38,"Thank you, Mr. Rudin."
