1979.78-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.503,"We will hear arguments in Ford Motor Company, et al. v. Dennis Milhollin, et al."
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,62.65,66.709,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,223.646,227.361,"When you say ""disclosed,"" just what do you embrace in that?"
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,232.665,254.211,"Well, the provisions of the Truth In Lending Act require certain types of disclosures of contractual provisions in consumer credit contracts; as an example the pre-payment disclosure semantically what the Act and regulation require is that the creditor provide on the front side and on one page a disclosure of his pre-payment rebate policy."
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,264.803,267.407,Is it the regulation that requires that one side --
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,267.407,269.675,"Yes, 226.6 (a), Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,269.675,271.05,"That is not in the statute, is it?"
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,271.05,273.981,It is in Section 226.6(a).
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.162,460.63,"In the same manner, or in no less burdensome manner."
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,460.63,465.258,"No less burdensome manner; you are right, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,508.486,510.29,"Sum of the digits, or some of --"
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,510.29,512.015,"Rule 78, the sum of the digits are interchangeable."
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,512.015,514.272,S-u-m of the digits.
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,514.272,515.578,"Yes, s-u-m."
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.578,519.198,Not s-o-m-e.
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,519.198,523.466,We submit that the Board's official staff interpretation should be followed.
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,653.5,656.705,"Well, when a demand is complied with, it is a pre-payment."
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,656.705,662.26,"If there is a pre-payment following acceleration, that the Board has said is essentially a pre-payment."
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,662.817,665.544,"It is a grievance, compulsory perhaps."
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,665.544,667.791,A payment following acceleration is a pre-payment --
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,667.791,669.211,In response to a demand.
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,669.211,670.7,That is right.
1979.78-1487,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,670.7,671.475,Voluntary.
1979.78-1487,0,44086,william_m_burke,,671.475,680.868,"Mr. Justice Stewart, the exercise of a right of acceleration may lead to a pre-payment but itself is not a pre-payment."
1979.78-1487,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,750.468,752.55,Mr. Smith.
1979.78-1487,1,42090,stone_a_smith,,752.55,755.151,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.743,1229.145,"At this point, with all this is disarray, the Board hasn't really done very much by way of rule-making to straighten out the disarray, have they?"
1979.78-1487,1,42090,stone_a_smith,,1229.145,1236.588,"Well, the Board has spoken in OSI FC-0054 which it believes is the --"
1979.78-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.588,1238.796,"But nothing by formal, rule-making."
1979.78-1487,1,42090,stone_a_smith,,1238.796,1252.018,"Nothing by formal rule-making although, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I would think that once the litigation commenced on this issue the Board might have -- it might have been inappropriate for the Board then --"
1979.78-1487,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.018,1256.628,The less the agency is going to do.
1979.78-1487,1,42090,stone_a_smith,,1256.628,1257.643,"Well, yes."
1979.78-1487,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1293.777,1299.571,"The courts rather typically and frequently have simply disregarded the OSI's, haven't they."
1979.78-1487,1,42090,stone_a_smith,,1299.571,1303.115,"Yes, although -- no, no, I think not."
1979.78-1487,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1390.801,1397.615,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1399.632,1402.332,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may is please the Court."
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.026,1414.667,May I ask you a relevant question at this point - Is your client's name misspelled all the way through on court records?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1414.667,1424.116,"The Milhollin's spell it with two L's and we have spelled it with one L throughout the litigation, from the District Court, to the Ninth Circuit, up to and including all the briefs."
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.116,1425.721,They haven't discharged you yet.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1425.721,1427.366,They haven't discharged me yet.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.366,1428.689,It isn't M-u-l.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1428.689,1429.547,It is M-i-l.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.871,1434.32,So it' is all right with you to stay with misspelling.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1434.32,1437.865,That is correct.
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.145,1543.999,"Mr. Slottee, I don't mean to get anecdotal about this but supposing you have the most consumer-oriented court or Board in the world and it is trying to figure out what has to be disclosed and what hasn't."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1593.87,1605.294,"I certainly agree with Your Honor and, in fact, it has been raised by some people that what in fact the Truth In Lending Act is doing is making disclosure statements more confusing rather than simpler."
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1627.81,1632.704,But isn't it from fear of litigation like this that they insert them?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1632.704,1633.481,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.36,1726.199,Why don't they follow the OSI?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1726.199,1729.941,There has been one OSI official staff interpretation that was issued.
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1731.859,1734.482,Have the Courts of Appeal followed that?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1734.482,1736.585,We have had basically three different positions.
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.096,1889.863,"Well, he could by reading paragraph 19, I suppose."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1889.863,1901.938,"On the reverse of the contract, and that is one of the things that Regulation Z says, that is that if you are going to have meaningful disclosure, the disclosure has to be on the face of the contract."
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.851,1907.125,If there is room.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1911.824,1916.241,"It is very easy to have, for instance, a separate disclosure statement separate from the contract."
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1917.482,1919.01,Have a bigger front page.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1919.01,1919.81,Pardon?
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.81,1921.508,Have a larger and longer front page.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1921.508,1923.238,You can have a larger and longer front page.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.519,1936.789,Two words -- you mentioned that before.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1938.595,1947.924,"I would put the two words, Your Honor -- in paragraph 14, it says buyer may pre-pay his obligations, etc.,"
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1960.392,1968.616,Do you really think the automobile purchasers would be motivated to go ahead and compare contracts on the basis of these two words being added?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1969.612,1972.284,"I think in fact they will, Your Honor, and --"
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1972.284,1976.581,Have you ever known a purchaser of an automobile to read all the fine print in one of these contracts?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1980.95,1984.102,Reading the fine print on a contract is exactly the problem.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.959,1993.831,"Well, it is just as fine on the front."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,1997.553,2002.417,Well this is slightly reduced down for the purpose of the appendix.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.417,2005.091,It still looks like a lot of fine print to me.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2005.091,2007.913,Compared to the back of the contract it is very large.
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2007.913,2015.741,"Well, if it is bigger print, it is a longer page too."
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.741,2019.391,I think the size of the print is the same; there is a little more space between the lines.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2019.391,2023.194,I don't think the size of the print is the issue.
1979.78-1487,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.284,2059.937,"Counsel, you just said something about it being easily understood."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2089.347,2097.538,"I think it is understood except for ""the sum of the digits method,"" which if you read in most State statutes is really confusing."
1979.78-1487,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.101,2137.451,"What ordinary buyer would know what the word ""acceleration"" means, except in connection with a car, you put your foot on the foot feed."
1979.78-1487,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.451,2146.568,"That is one of the principal advertising factors, of cars that will accelerate from zero to 40 miles an hour in 18-1/2 feet."
1979.78-1487,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2146.568,2154.689,"It might be a person might eventually learn what ""acceleration"" is on a note; but it isn't an article of nature, is it?"
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2154.689,2163.074,"I agree but putting ""acceleration"" or some term other than acceleration, it explains the consequences of default."
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.72,2205.01,I hate to be slow on this but frankly I am.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2216.064,2218.988,"Well, in fact you may have to change the words around in the paragraph."
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.988,2221.002,"So it isn't just a matter of adding two words, then."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2221.002,2223.671,"Well, in a number of contracts it would be a matter of simply adding --"
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.671,2225.014,"Well, in this contract."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2242.575,2248.2,"I could change the words around in the paragraph very slightly to make it -- put ""or acceleration"" or ""payment after acceleration."""
1979.78-1487,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2248.2,2255.0,"Well, you can just add a sentence saying the same terms shall be applicable to repayment after a demand after an acceleration demand."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2255.0,2256.849,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2389.414,2394.904,Does the record show how long the Ford Motor Company has been using this form?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2394.904,2402.778,"I don't think it does, Your Honor, unless you look at the bottom of the contract which will say --"
1979.78-1487,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2402.778,2403.317,Give a date?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2403.317,2408.872,"-- a certain addition, and I think it is 1973."
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2408.872,2411.757,Any idea of how many contracts are out-standing?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2411.757,2417.872,"How many contracts are outstanding, I assume that they number in probably the millions."
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2417.872,2424.558,Is it a contract that is fairly general in the industry or is this unique to Ford Motor?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2424.558,2435.036,"In the early 1970's acceleration clauses were normally on the back of the contract rather than on the front, and that is in fact what fostered most of the litigation that has worked its way up to the circuits."
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.678,2491.707,There are still millions within the year.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2491.707,2493.416,There are still millions within the year but --
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.416,2495.266,"Well, that is all you need, then."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2499.289,2501.937,But there is a second protection to cover those millions.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.451,2531.689,"Was there a conflicting case in this; there was, wasn't there?"
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2531.689,2532.387,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.387,2538.11,Wasn't there a conflicting decision with the Ninth Circuit?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2542.015,2548.021,There are several Courts of Appeals who have interpreted the official staff interpretation different than the Ninth Circuit.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.021,2550.843,"Well, what about in those circuits?"
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2550.843,2552.192,The rule would state the same.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.192,2553.792,Why would it?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2557.835,2560.347,"Well, they haven't struck down the section of the Act."
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.347,2569.439,How could you rely on those circuits upon any staff interpretation that has been invalidate by a court?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2569.439,2576.414,Because the statute specifically says that a creditor who in good faith relies on an official staff interpretation --
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2576.414,2582.58,How can you be in good faith if the Court has told you that a staff interpretation is not worth a nickel?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2582.58,2588.616,"For those creditors who relied on the staff interpretation after the Circuit Court opinion came down, I think I agree with you."
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.616,2593.249,"I know, but that has been quite a while."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2593.249,2594.11,I am sorry.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.11,2600.955,"Well, there has been a long time go by since those cases have decided that the staff interpretation was wrong."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2606.236,2609.616,The official staff interpretation in this case was in 1977.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.616,2610.08,Well --
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2610.08,2611.14,"Now, any person --"
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.14,2618.044,"Well, how many millions have bought automobiles since then, or even Fords?"
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2618.044,2625.147,Any creditor who relied on that staff interpretation would be protected regardless of a subsequent Circuit Court opinion.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.147,2627.185,I didn't say subsequent.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2636.715,2638.93,And before the official staff interpretation.
1979.78-1487,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.93,2640.189,No.
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2640.189,2645.07,How does the average purchase of an automobile even go back to a staff interpretation?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2645.07,2647.115,It don't.
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2650.171,2663.855,But does your point have any significance that this is an out for the companies who have these contracts outstanding?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2663.855,2666.395,"Well, I am not sure what --"
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2666.395,2667.961,"All right, forget it."
1979.78-1487,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2667.961,2675.053,My question may be off the mark.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2684.079,2691.428,The Milhollin contract was signed before the Act was amended to allow for that type of credit to be made.
1979.78-1487,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2691.428,2692.712,I see.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2692.712,2694.582,"So there is no interpretation to rely upon, Your Honor."
1979.78-1487,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2694.582,2695.385,I see.
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2695.385,2701.469,Let's try again.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2708.6,2711.368,As a creditor -- I had a client who was a creditor?
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2711.368,2712.576,Yes.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2712.576,2716.322,If I could put myself in that situation --
1979.78-1487,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2716.322,2718.327,"It would be difficult, would it."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2718.327,2720.176,Probably.
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2788.389,2797.855,"But then there is no rule of law I have ever heard of that doesn't have close cases and that sort of thing, that breed litigation."
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2816.395,2819.826,"I think that is the heart of the matter, Your Honor."
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2862.74,2867.631,To uphold a part of the staff interpretation but not all of it.
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2867.631,2869.616,"Exactly, Exactly."
1979.78-1487,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2869.616,2872.496,"Well, how do you reach that result?"
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2877.409,2892.36,"The deference that is to be accorded to a Federal Reserve -- to an agency interpretation, or the opinions of an agency, it would depend on a number of factors, the evidence in consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with prior and future pronouncements."
1979.78-1487,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2892.36,2896.399,Did we put all those conditions on the Mourning opinion?
1979.78-1487,2,40541,richard_a_slottee,,2896.399,2901.088,"It wasn't in the Mourning opinion, it was in another case, the Skidmore case."
1979.78-1487,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3026.37,3030.838,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Burke?"
1979.78-1487,3,44086,william_m_burke,,3030.838,3033.479,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
