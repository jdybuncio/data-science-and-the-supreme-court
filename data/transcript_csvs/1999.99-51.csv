1999.99-51,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.928,"We'll hear argument next in No. 99-51, Carl C. Gutierrez, Bordello... Bordallo... pardon me... v. Ada/Camacho."
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,39.836,44.87,Mr. Chief Justice... excuse me... and may it please the Court:
1999.99-51,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,163.3,167.208,"Where can we find the statute in the materials before us, Mr. Hufstedler?"
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,167.208,170.486,--The... the governing statute 1422?
1999.99-51,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,170.486,171.219,Yes.
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,171.219,180.884,"That's in... the statute is quoted in the blue brief, in the initial brief, on the statutes involved, and it's also quoted in the initial argument."
1999.99-51,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,180.884,185.163,Thank you.
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,185.163,189.141,"The statute is first shown on page 2, Your Honor."
1999.99-51,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.141,189.516,Thank you.
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,189.516,192.411,And that's the one in the opening brief and that governs it.
1999.99-51,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,238.265,246.52,And I take it you'd then have to have a... a second election under the Ninth Circuit's view even though only two people were running in the first place and it'd be among the same two people.
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,246.52,250.294,"Absolutely and specifically, that's exactly what they said, Justice Kennedy."
1999.99-51,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.294,263.021,"Mr. Hufstedler, as a preliminary matter, would you clarify for us the status of some case pending now before the Guam Supreme Court that affects this case?"
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,263.021,263.221,"Be happy to, Your Honor."
1999.99-51,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.273,283.864,And what... what are the issues before the court there?
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,283.864,286.924,Two... two basic sets of issues.
1999.99-51,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.422,415.518,"But, Mr. Hufstedler, even if we agreed that in any election means in any gubernatorial election, why shouldn't the people who didn't vote for Governor be counted the same way as someone who voted for Donald Duck for Governor?"
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,422.505,434.779,"The first proposition I think, Your Honor, is that there is no authority whatsoever for the proposition that a non vote is something that should be counted in an election."
1999.99-51,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.989,442.762,The terms is votes cast.
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,444.958,445.392,--Precisely.
1999.99-51,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.392,451.354,"--whether if you vote for nobody, as opposed to voting for Donald Duck, you have cast a vote."
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,451.354,453.909,"That's precisely correct, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-51,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.073,469.177,"It would... your case is stronger, is it not, by virtue of the use of the word votes rather than ballots?"
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,469.177,470.324,I think it clearly is.
1999.99-51,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.951,575.777,"Mr. Hufstedler, I guess the Ninth Circuit was persuaded by what it read into the words, in any election--"
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,575.777,576.346,Absolutely.
1999.99-51,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,576.346,578.736,--that phrase in section 1422.
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,578.736,579.644,Absolutely.
1999.99-51,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,579.644,586.364,"Now, if that phrase were entirely omitted from the statute, would it make any difference in your view?"
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,589.493,593.285,"Perfectly appropriate question, and it might very well be the same."
1999.99-51,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,607.975,609.492,"Well, I thought that they were... sorry."
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,610.694,611.607,--Thank you.
1999.99-51,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,697.501,706.782,"--Does it mean... probably not, but I'm just... but the... imagine on a particular day we get our ballot and there are 14 different offices."
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,726.872,729.137,"Well, that would be 14 elections I think--"
1999.99-51,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.137,729.526,Yes.
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,733.318,733.563,--Sure.
1999.99-51,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.563,739.566,"So... so, we look and see how many people filled out ballots because that's the number cast in any election."
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,744.205,744.405,I understand that.
1999.99-51,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.816,768.924,--But I--
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,768.924,779.472,"The only point was that there was a total of 46,666 ballots issued and whether people voted on them or not, they were returned, and therefore we ought to use that for a majority."
1999.99-51,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.472,792.536,"--I suppose under the respondents' theory... well, I can ask respondent... but it seemed to me that it... it could be that 1,000 people were very interested in the school board, and a different 1,000 were very interested in the water bonds."
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,804.046,805.204,Precisely what happened.
1999.99-51,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,827.643,840.226,"--Are there any cases you've found where if... if there's fraud in one contest, Governor... for the Governor, that the... the entire ballot is thrown out for all other issues?"
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,840.226,841.114,No.
1999.99-51,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.956,1106.121,"Yes, but they... they did go on to say by a majority of the votes cast for the office of delegate."
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1106.121,1106.645,"Well, you're quite right."
1999.99-51,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.563,1110.352,That... that is one of the points against your case--
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1110.352,1110.641,Well--
1999.99-51,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.641,1117.666,"--that... that in this statute where they intend to limit the vote cast to those cast for that office, they say so."
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1117.666,1118.22,--Yes.
1999.99-51,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.22,1124.786,"And the implication is that where they don't say that, they... they don't mean to limit it to... to the votes cast for that office."
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1124.786,1125.095,And I think that's quite right.
1999.99-51,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.561,1140.81,"Yes, it does... does seem to indicate--"
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1140.81,1146.832,"Now, the question about this statute also saying, well, we talked about the majority of votes cast for the office of the delegate."
1999.99-51,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1167.173,1174.004,"--Doesn't... doesn't your view, which makes sense of every word, make still the words, in any election, surplus?"
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1184.447,1195.259,"Well, I think... I think you're right about that, Justice Breyer, but it doesn't say it applies to all of those elections until you put in the in any election."
1999.99-51,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.259,1195.598,Did anyone doubt it?
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1195.598,1196.97,I don't doubt it.
1999.99-51,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1196.97,1198.607,Even without those words?
1999.99-51,0,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,1198.607,1200.727,"I don't doubt it, that that's what it means."
1999.99-51,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.2,1406.492,"Very well, Mr. Hufstedler."
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1408.458,1412.374,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-51,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1456.276,1458.207,Where... where are you?
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1458.207,1463.476,"--Your Honor, I'm at... I'm going to refer to the second sentence of the statute."
1999.99-51,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1466.6,1467.464,Blue brief?
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1467.464,1469.979,--cert petition or... or of the blue brief.
1999.99-51,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1507.285,1519.753,"Well, can't that be read as just saying that if you're entitled... something like the Federal Constitution... says if you're entitled to vote for the members of the lower... of the legislature of Guam, you're entitled to vote for Governor?"
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1525.166,1532.212,"Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, that is true, but it is the definition of a majority."
1999.99-51,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.439,1558.571,"But it just repeats the same question you have in the next sentence, that is to say, when... when it says votes cast, does it mean votes cast for this office, or does it mean votes cast in the election generally?"
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1567.123,1570.851,"Well, Your Honor, I simply... but... but my point would be this."
1999.99-51,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1582.057,1586.123,"Yes, but doesn't it obviously mean... I mean, doesn't it cut against you, that sentence?"
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1595.43,1595.863,Right.
1999.99-51,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1595.863,1602.035,They don't mean... they couldn't mean... votes cast by all the people on the island who are qualified.
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1605.757,1607.024,Your... Your Honor--
1999.99-51,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1607.024,1615.732,"I mean, isn't it somewhere between obviously meaning votes cast for Governor or meaning just what Justice Scalia said, repeating the ambiguity?"
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1615.732,1634.112,"--The... the reason it is not is that... is that we agree that... that after Cass and... and there is no case in this country that, absent a very specific statutory provision, says that... that the relevant universe is... is eligible voters including those who stay at home."
1999.99-51,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.942,1670.337,"Where... where do we find that, Mr. Riordan?"
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1670.337,1682.68,"--1422(a), Your Honor, is found at... in the beginning of the respondents' brief on the merits at page 2 I believe."
1999.99-51,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.574,1737.172,"Yes, but that doesn't explain this question that arises in my mind."
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1745.238,1747.036,"Well, Your Honor, the reason--"
1999.99-51,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.036,1750.259,"And what is the policy reason behind it, that congressional choice?"
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1750.259,1764.938,"--Well, a... the policy that suggests itself is that once a Governor is... is elected, the specific number of votes that... that were involved in electing him shall constitute the... the frame of reference if you're going to have to recall him."
1999.99-51,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1777.816,1781.039,But that's not the... maybe I'm... I don't have it in front of me.
1999.99-51,1,21397,dennis_p_riordan,,1786.362,1787.974,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1999.99-51,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1787.974,1789.635,Where... where is it?
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3207.11,3210.283,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-51,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3251.361,3255.773,"Of course, that involved no Federal statute at all, did it?"
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3264.446,3265.254,No.
1999.99-51,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3300.894,3303.333,"--The case was a diversity case, was it not?"
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3306.177,3306.442,No.
1999.99-51,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.357,3339.263,"He said it wasn't absolutely clear, but this is by far the better reading."
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3339.263,3340.331,--Doesn't make it absolutely... absolutely was the word.
1999.99-51,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3346.748,3349.363,"What if his... what if the language really is by far the better reading, his... his way?"
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3354.533,3355.566,--Well--
1999.99-51,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3355.566,3357.237,--certainly the language tilts in his--
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3357.237,3366.597,"--I could not argue, Justice Stevens, if the statute said you take all of the votes that were cast in the general election and determine the majority, of course, we're bound by that."
1999.99-51,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3391.519,3394.529,"--What happens in your opinion, to go back to Justice Scalia's point?"
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3404.966,3406.688,I think you don't have an answer.
1999.99-51,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3408.409,3409.113,In any election.
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3413.967,3414.217,--Precisely.
1999.99-51,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3414.217,3415.769,"No, not because... not because of that."
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3425.458,3426.537,"No, you're quite right."
1999.99-51,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3517.315,3523.042,"What about his countervailing policy argument, which is where it's that close, think about it twice?"
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3523.042,3524.459,"--Well, that's right."
1999.99-51,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3630.749,3631.323,Thank you.
1999.99-51,2,41457,seth_m_hufstedler,,3632.381,3633.124,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
1999.99-51,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3633.124,3634.002,The case is submitted.
