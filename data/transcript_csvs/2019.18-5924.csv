2019.18-5924,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.92,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-5924, Ramos versus Louisiana. Mr. Fisher."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,8.92,29.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Last term in Timbs against Indiana, this Court reaffirmed the well-settled rule that incorporated provisions of the Bill of Rights apply the same way to the states as they apply to the federal government. Taking that rule as the given, the state does not defend Justice Powell's pivotal vote in the Apodaca case."
2019.18-5924,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,166.28,167.4,"Well, but still that --"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,167.4,168.76,And I think --
2019.18-5924,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,168.76,182.12,"I mean, to give them -- to be fair, even if you see some have unanimity, some don't, and you've got a draft that says unanimity, I don't understand why you would take it out and just then be able to argue later, well, it doesn't matter whether it was in or not."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,184.24,190.72,"Well, the best historical evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, is that it was -- it got latched onto a debate about the vicinage requirement."
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,254.32,261.04,"You are asking us to overrule Apodaca, so we do have to think about stare decisis."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,316.68,334.12,"Well, I think Justice Alito, I'd like to make both a legal comparison and a factual comparison. So starting with the law, I think it's important to note that the state here is claiming to rely on Apodaca, but they are not defending the rule of Apodaca, which is that the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't require states to have unanimous verdicts."
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,348.56,349.56,"Well, but that's --"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,349.56,351.72,But here the state is asking for a brand-new rule.
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,351.72,352.88,I -- I don't want to interrupt.
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,371.52,377.64,"Yeah, so let me give you three reasons why, even if you take that as a -- as a given, stare decisis shouldn't carry the day."
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,389.36,389.88,So could I ask you --
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,389.88,390.44,-- eight justices on the Court.
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,390.44,407.72,"This is so unfair, Mr. Fisher, but could I ask you to take that out of your analysis and just pretend for the remainder of your analysis, I -- I think that's an important consideration, which I'm not quite sure how to think about, but if you assume that this was, you know, just any old 5-4 decision."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,407.72,417.68,"So I would then move to my second point, which would be that the -- the -- that Fourteenth Amendment rule, even if it had been adopted by a majority, is a derelict in the law."
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,430.44,430.64,Well --
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,430.64,435.52,-- opinions from this Court that say the same standards have to apply to the states as the federal government.
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,435.52,437.24,"I mean, it would be an outlier."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,477.12,495.04,"Well, Justice Kagan, I think -- let me respond one thing I hope isn't fighting the premise, but what I would say is if the -- if you look at the Court's incorporation jurisprudence, that is the one place the Court has not accepted anomalies and where the Court has said that stare decisis is at a very low ebb when it comes to states following the fundamental rules of the road of the Bill of Rights."
2019.18-5924,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.32,502.12,Did Timbs recognize that exception?
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,502.12,502.96,Pardon me?
2019.18-5924,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.96,516.88,"Timbs, in saying the Excessive Fines Clause applies to the states, recognize Apodaca as an exception? Recognized the Sixth Amendment was the one exception to complete incorporation?"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,516.88,518.52,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,527.16,528.32,What else have you got?
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,528.32,529.72,-- Fourteenth Amendment footing.
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,564.48,565.28,"Well, we don't know --"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,565.28,566.72,-- in those past convictions.
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,566.72,589.52,"-- how a decision in your favor in this case would play out in collateral review, either in federal court or in state court. But do you think -- I mean, I -- I can well envision seeing you up here in a term or two arguing this is a water -- the rule that you are trying to persuade us to accept today is a watershed rule of criminal procedure. Do you think that's a -- a frivolous argument?"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,589.52,591.28,"I don't think it's frivolous, Justice Alito."
2019.18-5924,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,642.64,643.28,What about --
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,643.28,644.0,-- incorporation.
2019.18-5924,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,644.0,644.24,Sorry.
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,644.24,645.12,"No, go ahead."
2019.18-5924,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,645.12,656.44,"What about the size of the jury, if we were to accept your argument here, how or could we draw a distinction between this case and the precedence on size of a jury?"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,656.44,660.24,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I think Williams itself tells you how you would do that."
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,692.96,693.12,Do you think --
2019.18-5924,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,693.12,693.56,What -- what --
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,693.56,694.68,-- we would have to --
2019.18-5924,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,694.68,694.96,Sorry.
2019.18-5924,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,694.96,701.04,"Mr. Fisher, Williams, I think, is a problem for you."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,709.44,713.2,"Justice Ginsburg, the key principle is not how many."
2019.18-5924,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,727.52,728.16,And that's --
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,728.16,728.72,-- maybe it would help --
2019.18-5924,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,728.72,732.8,You prefaced that by saying that's a key part of the distinction you are trying to draw?
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,732.8,734.4,"Well, maybe it is the very distinction."
2019.18-5924,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,734.4,736.76,"Well, I know. But, I mean, I guess I'm not sure that's self-apparent."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,753.04,784.44,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, can I give you a legal answer and a practical answer? So as a legal answer, the -- the unanimity required even of a six-person verdict is more consistent with -- and, in fact, is the only consistent outcome -- with the purposes of the jury trial clause because the core purposes are effective deliberation towards an accurate decision and a cross-section of the community. Now, remember what happens in Louisiana and in Oregon is that a cross-section of the community, somewhat by design, can be left out of and canceled out of those deliberations."
2019.18-5924,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,816.88,835.96,"Mr. Fisher, let's say I am not entirely persuaded by your functionalist arguments about the distinction between unanimity and numbers between this case and Williams. Have you got anything else besides these functionalist arguments about the real great importance about unanimity and the relative lack of importance about numbers?"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,835.96,844.24,"I think what I would say to you, Justice Gorsuch, is the text of the Sixth Amendment understood through its purpose distinguishes this case from Williams."
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,925.76,941.96,"Do you think, Mr. Fisher, that we would also have to overrule Ludwig versus Massachusetts if we overruled Apodaca? If I understand it right, that was another case in which Justice Powell's unusual approach to incorporation ended up being the deciding vote in the case."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,943.8,944.88,"That's right, Justice Kagan."
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,976.36,976.44,You --
2019.18-5924,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,976.44,976.44,Do you --
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,976.44,1000.92,"You -- you started off and then I told you to stop, but I thought I'd give you an opportunity to do it again. I mean, what are we to make of this 4-1-4 reasoning of Apodaca and -- and -- and what do you think the rule should be about stare decisis going forward? Do you need a majority? Do you just need a controlling rule? What's -- what's the right way to think about that?"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1000.92,1004.04,"Well, I can tell you what I think and I can tell you what the Court has done."
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1049.52,1078.24,"Well, what about a party that has to make decisions about how it's going to order its affairs in the wake of a decision that it wins but does it in a 4-1-4 decision? What are they -- what is that party supposed to do? Say, well, all right, we won this case, but we really can't rely on it because we don't know what -- because it has no stare decisis effect, and then what happens as the years go by and nothing happens, the Court doesn't come back to that question?"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1078.24,1106.8,"Well, Justice Alito, I think that at least in the ordinary case, the -- the -- the party would have every -- every right to rely on this Court's decision, subject to the ordinary principles of stare decisis that we're deciding. I think the one thing that makes this case unusual is you would think that if the party did rely on that prior case they'd at least come up and defend it instead of ask the Court for a different rule. And I think that just tells you something about how -- how discredited the fifth vote in this -- in this case is, which I think makes it almost a universe of one."
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1122.36,1171.88,"Can I come back to the -- the math question that was alluded to earlier? I am not myself, I must confess, capable of doing this math, but somebody could. So if you hypothesize a jury pool with a certain percentage of jurors who were inclined to acquit, and you ask is there a greater likelihood of acquittal with a 6-0 verdict than a 10-2 verdict or an 11-1 verdict or if the state decides to have a jury that's bigger than 12, a 15-1 -- a 15-person injury, 14-1; 19-1, when we get to the point where the chance of acquittal is -- is in favor of the non-unanimous rule, would that be unconstitutional?"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1171.88,1179.08,"My rule is that any time the state deviates from unanimity, it is unconstitutional, so even if a state were to go beyond the number of 12."
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1199.92,1200.76,"I mean, you really --"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1200.76,1202.48,"-- and at least in a jury room, that would be case."
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1202.48,1214.84,"You really want to argue that? So if a -- if a petit jury had to be as big as a grand jury and you were representing a criminal defendant, you would rather -- you would say we want -- 6-0 is better for us than 21 to 1?"
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1214.84,1231.24,"Justice Alito, perhaps there'd be a number where that argument would start to be difficult, and I think that -- that what I would tell you is the history and tradition of this country makes it highly unlikely that we're ever going to see a system like that. What we have uniformly, almost, throughout the states is a ceiling of 12."
2019.18-5924,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1256.52,1262.32,Do the racial origins of this rule have an impact on how we think about stare decisis in this case?
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1262.32,1264.0,"I think they do, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.18-5924,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1264.44,1267.36,How? How do -- how should we factor those in?
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1267.36,1291.04,"I think in a couple ways. I think, when you talk about how reasonable the reliance is from the state, I think it's perhaps justifiable to look at the origins of the law that it's defending. But I also think more directly, if you're asking whether Justice Powell's Fourteenth Amendment reasoning should stand, he didn't even consider this history."
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1307.12,1307.4,You really --
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1307.4,1308.84,-- think that.
2019.18-5924,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1308.84,1314.76,-- want to make that argument? You made a big deal of it in your brief. I thought you'd -- I thought you would abandon it here today.
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1352.92,1355.12,"No, Justice -- Justice Alito."
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1411.36,1429.2,"You -- you mentioned a couple of times earlier in your argument where the Court has said that a decision is entitled to less stare decisis effect because the parties have come into Court and tried to kind of improve the reasoning, so the Court has said, of the earlier decision. And as I understood what you were saying, you were saying that this even goes beyond that."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1429.2,1429.44,Right.
2019.18-5924,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1429.44,1433.56,Could -- could you explain why or is it the same as that or -- because I've never liked that argument.
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1437.36,1437.64,No.
2019.18-5924,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1499.08,1500.72,It was unsettled --
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1500.72,1503.36,"So, Justice Kagan, I think this is different in kind."
2019.18-5924,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1503.36,1505.32,It was unsettled until Apodaca.
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1515.52,1516.16,My --
2019.18-5924,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1516.16,1522.96,"So it was Apodaca, the fifth vote being Powell's vote, that said -- set the precedent for you to require a unanimity in federal trials."
2019.18-5924,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1522.96,1530.8,"Let me say something about before Apodaca and then after, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.18-5924,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.48,1574.84,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Murrill."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1574.84,1604.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with Petitioner that this case presents two issues: whether the Sixth Amendment requires unanimity and, if so, whether that requirement applies to the states. The Court should decide this case on the first issue because nothing in the text, structure, or history of the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts. Nor has this Court ever held that the framers wholesale adopted the common law."
2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1676.96,1694.96,"Are you asking the Court to take up a question that five justices answered in Apodaca? That is, that the Sixth -- Apodaca, five -- there were five votes to say that the Sixth Amendment requires jury unanimity in federal trials. You are asking to -- us to reject a rule that five justices adhered to."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1694.96,1701.0,"Justice Ginsburg, we don't think that Justice Powell's decision was entirely clear with regard to the rule as it would apply historically."
2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1705.92,1706.24,But --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1706.24,1706.72,-- we're happy --
2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1706.72,1712.04,-- there were -- there were four justices who said unanimity was required.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1722.24,1729.68,"Justice Ginsburg, we don't believe that that was central to his holding or to his position in his plurality opinion."
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1742.52,1784.32,"Then aren't we -- aren't we in -- having to address this fresh, just as you really seem to want us to do? I mean, that -- that -- that seems to me an admission that we are in a proper place to -- to take this up afresh. If precedent weighs for anything, what do we do with Andres? What do we do with those 14 cases throughout Supreme Court history that seem to treat unanimity as part of the Sixth Amendment? And what do we do as well with Hughes and with Seminole Tribe and a lot of other cases where we have been facing similarly splintered decisions and the Court has come back and addressed the question fresh without considering stare decisis in those cases? Sometimes the -- the Court can't reach majority opinion."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1793.64,1809.64,"Justice Gorsuch, I think that Louisiana reasonably relied on a decision of this Court that it -- that non-unanimous juries were constitutional."
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1818.4,1819.28,"Well, we're not dealing with a --"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1819.28,1819.72,And -- and I don't --
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1819.72,1822.72,"-- a six-person jury, so we can put that aside."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1853.96,1857.52,"Well, for one thing, I think that incorporation doctrine evolved over time."
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1875.96,1877.28,I appreciate -- I appreciate that.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1878.2,1878.44,Yeah.
2019.18-5924,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1878.44,1920.64,"Well, just on that, General Murrill, so, I mean, you don't really want us to take that up afresh, do you? I mean, aren't you -- I'm sort of confused because there is the sentence in your brief that says neither party is asking the Court to accord Justice Powell's solo opinion in Apodaca precedential force. Is that right, that you're not asking us to accord Justice Powell's solo opinion precedential force? Because if that's right, then -- I mean, are you basically just saying to me: Forget Justice Powell's opinion in Apodaca; just decide what the Sixth Amendment requires?"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1920.64,1938.2,"Justice Kagan, I -- I think that given the evolution of incorporation theory, we find ourselves in a position where it is even more important to get the text right and to get the history right. So if -- if -- if that means taking that issue up afresh --"
2019.18-5924,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1938.2,1938.64,"But, you see --"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1938.64,1939.52,-- then we should do that.
2019.18-5924,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1939.52,1941.04,-- I think I agree with Justice Alito.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1957.32,1963.04,"Well, we think that the text and the history do not include a non-unanimous jury verdict."
2019.18-5924,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1967.8,1968.76,That's not --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1968.76,1986.52,"And so, you know, that's -- we think that the -- the four Justices, plus Justice Powell's decision, were a ruling that said that it was not unconstitutional to have non-unanimous jury verdicts and it was reasonable for us to rely on that. So we don't -- we don't entirely disavow stare decisis."
2019.18-5924,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1989.36,1992.04,You were relying on Justice Powell's opinion in Apodaca.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1994.04,1995.48,We're also relying --
2019.18-5924,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1995.48,2003.64,"For stare decisis that must be what you're relying on, combined with the other four that said the states don't have to provide unanimous juries."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2003.64,2014.88,"Well, I think, Justice Kavanaugh, that we're also relying on this Court's opinions in -- in Williams and in Hurtado that said that the Court -- that has never adopted the common law wholesale. I mean, that's --"
2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2014.88,2015.4,But you -- you --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2015.4,2019.28,-- that is I think critical to the analysis.
2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2019.28,2023.2,"Just to be clear, you are not urging the Apodaca."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2052.88,2057.6,"Justice Ginsburg, I think the Seventh Amendment is a different question."
2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2058.96,2060.12,But just -- just the --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2060.12,2060.44,-- is different.
2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2060.44,2069.88,-- the answer to my question: Is unanimity required under the Seventh Amendment in civil trials in federal court?
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2069.88,2075.08,I don't believe that it would be required in the Seventh Amendment but I don't think you need to determine that here today.
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2075.08,2075.28,Well --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2075.28,2075.92,That's not the issue.
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2075.92,2077.2,"Well, this Court has held --"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2077.2,2078.6,The issue is the Sixth Amendment.
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2078.6,2083.44,-- that it -- there's a -- there's a holding of the Supreme Court that's over 100 years old so holding.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2086.0,2092.0,"Justice Gorsuch, my answer is specifically related to the text and what the text would require."
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2095.4,2096.0,"Oh, okay."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2096.0,2096.8,-- in the Seventh Amendment.
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2096.8,2096.96,All right.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2096.96,2097.4,I just --
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2097.4,2097.64,All right.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2123.24,2134.0,I -- I believe that the structure and the history of both reach -- ultimately on the textual answer reach the same result.
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2134.0,2134.72,All right.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2134.72,2136.16,I -- I -- I don't think that they would.
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2136.16,2138.48,You disagree with the Supreme Court's analysis on the Seventh Amendment.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2150.04,2152.6,I -- I -- I don't think necessarily the rule would be different.
2019.18-5924,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2183.28,2183.8,How far --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2183.8,2184.56,-- actually adopted non-unanimity.
2019.18-5924,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2184.56,2192.44,How far are you willing to depart from unanimity? Would a 7-5 requirement be okay under your theory?
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2192.44,2203.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think this Court has established some of the outer boundaries already in Williams and in Burch and in Will -- and in Apodaca."
2019.18-5924,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2225.84,2255.44,"Can we go back to reliance a moment? Putting aside that in Janus a couple of decisions from the Supreme Court put the unions on notice that things should -- that the constitutional theory was on shaky ground, and here you have a series of cases, much older, telling you that the incorporation theory was on shaky ground. But you're talking about a parade of horribles if we rule against you."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2311.08,2311.4,And --
2019.18-5924,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2311.4,2316.8,"Not our sense, but the history of what happened and why."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2316.8,2327.52,"So I think, Justice Sotomayor, that we have the text and what made the cut after the debates over what was missing."
2019.18-5924,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2327.52,2328.8,But the debates --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2328.8,2329.08,So --
2019.18-5924,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2329.08,2342.88,-- we have a bunch of people who were in favor of the cuts telling everybody else everybody understands that a unanimous verdict is the standard. So we have part of the constitutional debate.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2357.48,2357.64,But --
2019.18-5924,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2357.64,2363.24,"-- history just in terms of what was taken out, but without the context of the discussion."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2363.24,2364.92,"Not exclusively, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-5924,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2374.92,2375.6,Exactly.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2375.6,2383.04,"So, you know, I think that's an example of how we did not adopt the common law in all of its -- its -- its historical terms."
2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.44,2417.68,"But it -- but why was it rejected? I mean, one -- one account is it was totally unnecessary."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2435.24,2465.76,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, we did clutter it up with an impartial -- with the word ""impartial."" And we did clutter it up with a number of other terms. And -- and I don't -- and I think that the history showing that states felt that it was important to write it into some of their constitutions indicates that there certainly was at least a view that -- that it should be written in by some and not -- so I don't think it's a fair reading to -- to assume that that was simply because we would all know that it would be there, especially because they knew that they were writing a document for the future."
2019.18-5924,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2465.76,2470.6,"For the sake of argument, assume that I think the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous jury."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2490.28,2494.52,"Justice Kavanaugh, they are concededly not very good."
2019.18-5924,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2511.92,2512.2,"Well, yes --"
2019.18-5924,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2512.2,2512.92,What about --
2019.18-5924,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2512.92,2513.24,-- and no --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2513.24,2514.0,-- to make that argument.
2019.18-5924,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2514.0,2518.2,"Yes and no, General Murrill, because you have this stare decisis, except you're giving it away."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2519.76,2520.12,I --
2019.18-5924,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2520.12,2527.56,-- because I would think what you would do is to say something like: This is an outlier in our incorporation doctrine.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2561.8,2590.52,"Justice Kagan, I agree with everything that you said about the reasons why this Court should affirm Apodaca and that it should be given stare decisis effect. I -- I think that we are struggling with the fact that Justice Powell's decision doesn't seem to be the view of the Court and -- and that it -- the text and the history also, I -- we strongly and firmly believe, are on our side."
2019.18-5924,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2590.52,2593.2,"Well, you're not the only state who has an interest here."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2617.32,2627.64,I -- and I think that Oregon finds itself in a position where the democratic process has stalled in anticipation of this decision.
2019.18-5924,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2648.12,2649.2,"I mean, it's true --"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2649.2,2651.32,We believe that the judgment was correct.
2019.18-5924,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2651.32,2661.48,"It is certainly true that we, in recent years, have rejected the two-track idea about incorporation, but the opposite isn't a crazy argument."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2683.44,2687.56,"Well, Justice Alito, if you're telling me that there is a little bit of daylight, then I'll take it."
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.76,2697.92,Is --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2697.92,2703.4,So I -- we are not entirely repudiating the -- the Apodaca judgment.
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2719.0,2720.84,"Do you think 32,000 people were non-unanimous?"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2720.84,2722.04,"No, no, no, Justice Breyer."
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2722.04,2734.44,"Or how -- I mean, I can't -- I don't understand why it would apply to people who were unanimously convicted, maybe, but -- but I think the stronger case would be those people convicted by juries that were not unanimous."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2736.52,2737.92,"We don't know, because they --"
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.92,2737.96,I mean --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2737.96,2738.44,-- there wasn't --
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2738.44,2750.2,"-- have you any idea? Is there -- with all the work gone into this, has anybody got any rough idea of what percentage of those people who are convicted are convicted by non-unanimous juries?"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2750.2,2752.16,There's just no reliable data.
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2752.16,2752.96,"Well, if there's --"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2752.96,2753.68,But I can --
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2753.68,2771.52,"-- no reliable data, we'd think -- can I fairly think if there had been some data, even if you just take a sample, you would be telling us? And, therefore, the fact that you're telling us that there are a lot of people in jail, which I did know --"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2771.52,2772.28,Well -- (Laughter.)
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2772.28,2774.32,-- that that suggests something.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2774.32,2774.68,Well --
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2774.68,2778.8,"Now, then you say there's you, there's Oregon, that they're waiting."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2803.32,2805.6,"Well, we have the same tradition, but I -- but the -- the --"
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2805.6,2816.08,"You have the same tradition, but you don't have as a matter of fact the whole system of trials that grows out of the civil tradition."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2816.48,2819.16,"Well, that's why I think all 32,000 --"
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.16,2821.12,"Well, all right, skip that."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2821.72,2824.96,-- are at risk because we do have a system built around --
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2824.96,2826.56,"I got past the 32,000."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2833.36,2834.84,I believe --
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.84,2834.96,If we --
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2834.96,2835.68,-- there is.
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2835.68,2837.04,I know you believe there is.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2842.28,2868.4,"Because the territorial decisions were based on the authority of Congress to write laws that were different for territories notwithstanding the fact that they still came under the protection of the Constitution, I think that there's a problem. So it's the same -- I mean, the issue here is, does the -- the Sixth Amendment require unanimity? And unless you're going to continue a special carveout for the territories, then they have the same question."
2019.18-5924,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2868.4,2876.48,"Is the -- the 32,000 -- is the reason you don't know because the jury is not typically polled or -- or what?"
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2876.48,2881.32,Because it is not always polled and because the defense -- that is a responsibility of the defense to do that.
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.12,2923.56,All right.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2924.04,2925.72,-- that every one of them could file.
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2926.92,2929.48,I -- I've got the -- the reliance point.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2929.48,2930.36,Okay.
2019.18-5924,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2930.36,2955.72,"The -- if I believe, one, contrary to what you say, assume it, I believe that, in fact, the federal right in the constitution does include unanimity in the Sixth Amendment. Then, two, I think that thereafter it was fairly clear in the law that same -- the federal rules apply to states, if we incorporate."
2019.18-5924,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2994.84,3008.76,Just a footnote. That's not taken care of by Teague and the other doctrines your adversary talked about.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3008.76,3017.96,"Your Honor, I think that one of the -- the -- the significant lines of jurisprudence that comes to my mind is Rowe."

2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3088.28,3096.96,"No, Justice Gorsuch. But we don't believe that it was a right that was given to them in the Sixth Amendment."
2019.18-5924,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3096.96,3099.6,I understand that. I'm talking about a reliance argument.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3112.2,3121.6,"No one, and least of all me, is going to stand here and diminish anyone's liberty interests."

2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.96,3150.8,But that's -- that's not -- the case of retroactivity to convictions that are already final is not before us.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3166.36,3175.72,"Justice Ginsburg, we certainly do appreciate you not addressing that issue without our opportunity to brief it."
2019.18-5924,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3198.92,3206.0,Can I pick up on Justice Gorsuch's question a second? So assume that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimity.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3280.56,3310.68,"So as -- as to the first question with regard to unfairness to defendants, I just do not see how you can separate this from the six-man jury that -- that was approved of in Williams, which is a six-man jury for all crimes less than capital, and six, granted, unanimous rule but still only six, and Louisiana's rule will -- still requires ten. So I -- I don't think it's fundamentally unfair, nor do I think that this Court in any precedent has ever held that it is."
2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3310.68,3320.2,"But Williams held that the number, the number of jurors was not at the heart of the jury trial right."
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3339.44,3344.24,Mr. Chief Justice?
2019.18-5924,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.24,3346.36,You may respond.
2019.18-5924,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3346.36,3350.76,"Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think that it was not an historical accident."

2019.18-5924,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3365.68,3372.6,It's hard to say you disagree when Williams described the number 12 as a historical accident.
