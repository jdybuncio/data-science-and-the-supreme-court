1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,17.526,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-124, Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium v. FCC, and Number 95-227, Alliance for Community Media v. FCC."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,18.545,21.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-124,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,103.216,116.958,"May I ask you on that one point, is it clear that those channels are offered pursuant to this section within the meaning of the statute we're looking at, when the locality imposes those conditions?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,116.958,119.093,"--In other words, does section 10 apply to these channels?"
1995.95-124,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,119.093,124.814,"Well, it's the part of subsection (h) that precedes section 10 which was in the statute all along."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,133.586,133.986,Yes.
1995.95-124,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,140.924,145.478,Even if these restrictions you describe were imposed by the locality rather than the Federal Government?
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,145.478,146.161,--Yes.
1995.95-124,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,146.161,146.794,Okay.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,146.794,163.105,"As well as insisting upon leased public access channels, as we noted in our reply brief, by 1982 over 350 jurisdictions, municipalities, had insisted that leased channels be set aside."
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.247,178.949,"You say this came, too, at the instance of municipalities--"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,178.949,179.249,--Yes.
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,179.249,180.015,--rather than the National Government?
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,180.015,180.515,That's correct.
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.163,255.965,"Well, what do you mean when you say they sanctioned it?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,255.965,261.603,They said that communities may have public access programming.
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,266.84,268.49,They just kind of ratified what was in--
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,268.49,270.792,They ratified what the cities had already done.
1995.95-124,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,270.792,275.112,--Are you making this point in order to lead up to your State action argument?
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,277.395,279.23,"Yes, I am leading up to that point, because--"
1995.95-124,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.23,286.551,Because it seems to me there might be State action even if the Government had enacted this statute in the very first instance.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,286.551,309.5,"--I agree with you, Justice Kennedy, and I will address that point, but the one thing I want to make clear is that in banc court of appeals and the Solicitor General's brief refuses to acknowledge what is clear from the record and nobody disputes, is the prior history of there being no editorial control by cable companies over public and leased access."
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,315.32,318.122,"Well, but you refer to the in banc court."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,329.263,349.911,"Right, and the fundamental mistake I think that the nine judges made who didn't agree with us below is they refused to recognize... the in banc said the 1984 act took away editorial control in the first instance, it was required by the Federal Government, and all the 1992 act did was restore editorial control."
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.657,370.557,What does that have to do with anything?
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.557,370.874,Yes.
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.874,372.942,Does that have to do with the constitutionality of it?
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,372.942,373.526,--It certainly--
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.526,380.013,"I thought Congress, so long as it passes the words by majority vote, the words can come from nowhere as far as we're concerned."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,380.013,394.772,"--Justice Scalia, when Congress acts against the prohibition of the First Amendment that Congress shall make no law, if it's a content-based discrimination, which we argue this is, there must be a compelling interest and the least restrictive means."
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.772,395.539,I understand all that.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,395.539,415.936,"Now, this Court said in Sable, and the plurality repeated again in Turner, that it's not an agency proceeding but there must be some record somewhere, either in the legislative history or in the bill itself... Congress often makes findings in bills as they did in the '84 act... that there is a compelling interest--"
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,415.936,421.857,"You mean, you're saying that the bill itself has to make a finding that there's a compelling interest?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,421.857,422.273,--What I'm saying--
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.273,423.892,I don't think we've ever held that.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,423.892,444.955,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think that this Court has been flexible and said both in Sable, which is the majority opinion of this Court, and in the plurality in Turner, that Congress can do this any way it wants, but when it treads on the rights of the First Amendment it has an obligation to let this Court know some way whether there's a compelling interest and whether the least restrictive means--"
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.955,454.311,"Well, it may have to make factual findings, but you can make factual findings in a bill that originates on the floor."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,462.0,462.384,--No.
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,462.384,464.119,--I don't think has any foundation in our cases.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,464.119,474.158,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, I didn't understand that was the... I agree with you completely that the findings can be in the bill on the floor and, of course, in this legislation, there were no such findings."
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.158,478.46,"Wait, I'm... the findings have to be in the bill, you say."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,478.46,480.479,They can be anywhere.
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.029,482.247,In the floor debate?
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,482.247,497.923,"--In Sable... I know that you had a separate opinion in Sable, Justice Scalia, but in Sable eight justices of this Court said somewhere in the floor debate, in the hearings, in the bill, somewhere, this Court has to be told that Congress has a compelling interest."
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.923,499.708,Congress only speaks through its statutes.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,502.577,503.01,That is--
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.01,503.927,That's so silly.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,506.546,508.831,"--If that's the prevailing view, Justice Scalia, that it can only--"
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.831,521.789,"--It seems to me that a bill that comes to the floor, which has so clearly a compelling interest that it is immediately adopted by acclamation, you're telling me that bill is weaker than one which is debated on the floor."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,521.789,553.943,"--The minority is protected not by acclamation votes but by an explanation that there's a compelling interest, and this Court has insisted that the Congress, when it act pursuant to the First Amendment, if it has a content-based statute, which this statute is, that it outline... not posit a disease, as Justice Kennedy said in the Turner Broadcasting case, they have to show that there's real harm, and they have to show, if it's content-based discrimination, that the least restrictive means are used."
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.054,579.327,"How would Congress go about, in your view, showing that it was using the least restrictive means?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,586.648,594.635,"--Mr. Chief Justice, in the Sable case, Justice White said that they could go about it in any way they want to, but they have to--"
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.635,595.77,Go about what?
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,602.658,615.648,"--It doesn't have to make a finding, but it somehow has to allow this Court, when it makes a review, and this Court has frequently said it has independent judgment over what Congress does, not de novo review in this area, but an independent judgment."
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.61,642.549,"You're telling me that Sable holds that Congress has to find that what it's doing is ""the least restrictive means""?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,642.549,647.27,"I... Sable does, and Sable follows many precedents, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,650.638,659.177,"Well, to say there must be a record from which this Court could make that determination is quite different from saying that Congress has to make the determination."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,659.177,666.766,"--No, it's... the cases make it very clear that it's Congress that's abridging the speech, and Congress must make the record--"
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,666.766,667.233,"Well, but--"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,667.233,668.25,--and this Court reviews the record.
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.25,673.77,"--Including, in your view, a finding that what we are doing is the least restrictive means?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,673.77,674.137,I--
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.137,685.662,"I don't recall any case in which I've seen, in the 20 years I've been on the bench, that I've read a record where Congress has said we find what we're doing is the least restrictive means."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,685.662,688.514,"--Your Honor, they may not have to say it with those exact words."
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,688.514,691.048,"Well, what... then what are we coming to?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,691.048,732.542,"But they have to say... for example, in Sable, which dealt with dial-a-porn, which is, we believe, basically a much more serious indecent problem than we're dealing with here, but in Sable the Court said there they had an existing means to regulate the problem... credit cards, access codes... and Justice White, speaking for substantial members of this Court, said that in order to put a total ban in effect, which is what Sable did, Congress must somewhere explain to this Court in a meaningful way why the existing regulation is no longer the least restrictive means."
1995.95-124,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.542,747.552,"The trouble that I'm having with this, and you may come to this later, in which case at some point... I just... is, it seems... I'm having... I find this very difficult, this case, in part because it seems to me there are First Amendment rights on both sides."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,773.202,783.575,"No, I don't feel the same way, and I will give you three reasons I believe that the First Amendment rights here of the so-called cable companies are at least accommodated, if they exist at all."
1995.95-124,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,784.091,788.462,"Do they... how... that's important, because it's a question of what framework we think about--"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,788.462,804.139,"--As I mentioned originally, and as this Court recognized in Turner, to be able to speak in the first instance, cable companies had to come to municipalities and say, we want to get on your property, we want to lay and string cable, before they had any rights to speak."
1995.95-124,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,822.083,843.364,"--Now, why... look, I'm not certain that this is a correct way to view it, but they are people who provide to other people lots of messages, and they have to, of course, use a cable, and NBC has to use a piece of property where they broadcast through the air."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,860.225,862.241,"Well, the First Amendment rights--"
1995.95-124,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.241,863.177,--not First Amendment rights against something else.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,863.177,863.86,"--I'm sorry, Justice Breyer."
1995.95-124,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.86,864.243,Yes.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,864.243,871.247,The First Amendment rights are being dealt with in a completely different case that's like the must-carry case that this Court handled in Turner.
1995.95-124,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,957.0,963.404,"Mr. Greenberger, do I misunderstand the D.C. Circuit's in banc decisions on this point?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,983.517,990.99,"--With regard to the leased access, the cable company either must ban, which is a total ban for adults and children--"
1995.95-124,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,990.99,992.873,But I'm asking you to forget the either.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,992.873,993.859,--All right.
1995.95-124,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,993.859,996.727,Just suppose they had had (a) and (c) and no (b).
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,996.727,1005.916,"If it's... we think there are three things the in banc court did not deal with when it decided this decision, three decisions of this Court, the Turner case, the Sable case, and the Skinner case."
1995.95-124,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1006.482,1013.653,"But am I right in thinking that there was not a one of them that said, if all you had was (a) and (c), it would be unconstitutional?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1013.653,1027.829,"--Judge Wald and Judge Tatel did agree that (a) and (c) were unconstitutional in and of themselves, and Judge Edwards and Judge Rogers said that (a) and (b) were unconstitutional because they work together, must block or... must ban or block."
1995.95-124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1061.753,1070.125,"Mr. Greenberger, how does the 1996 act affect this situation?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1081.667,1091.522,"--You can... well, that goes to our least restrictive means argument, but for nonaccess channels what they've said, is if you've got indecent stuff and you don't want it in, call up the cable operator and tell them to scramble it."
1995.95-124,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1126.109,1134.648,But just explain to me what change the new law makes now that applies across the board to all kinds--
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1134.648,1149.725,"Well, with regard to public and leased access specifically, it did not affect these regulations but did give the cable operator the independent power to ban editorially for obscenity, nudity, or indecency, which would not be affected by this case."
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1258.313,1263.898,"--Mr. Greenberger, in judging the burden, may I ask you just to advert to (a) and (c) for a moment."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1277.824,1285.513,"--Except that this was created an exception to the editorial ban in fact, de facto exception."
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1297.571,1298.338,Okay.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1318.984,1319.884,That's exactly right.
1995.95-124,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1392.383,1407.292,"But Mr. Greenberger, isn't all precedent relevant to the issue of harm, so that really your concentration should be on the means used to check that harm?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1413.113,1413.413,Right.
1995.95-124,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1413.413,1417.783,--I'm thinking it was pretty well accepted that there is harm to children.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1417.783,1420.469,"It's accepted, and we don't dispute that."
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.289,1437.478,"Well, but your argument on least restrictive means I think leaves out one ingredient of the Government's argument, and the Government's argument is the argument from inertia."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1453.17,1455.272,"That's a very good question, Justice Souter."
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.125,1487.91,We're back to whether there have to be findings again.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1487.91,1489.779,"Justice Scalia, I use the word--"
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.779,1495.516,We're back to whether there have to be findings or simply evidence from which this Court could make a reasonable conclusion.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1495.516,1496.099,--I stand corrected.
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1501.151,1501.97,Is it illegitimate--
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1501.97,1503.07,"I agree with you, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1503.07,1503.82,--I'm sorry.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1510.193,1515.978,"In the Sable case, Justice White made it clear this Court cannot make de novo judgments."
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.702,1526.885,But it has to be a finding.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1528.82,1529.27,--Substantial evidence.
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1529.27,1530.67,You keep going back and forth on that.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1530.67,1531.772,Substantial evidence.
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1531.772,1534.474,So Congress doesn't have to make the judgment.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1535.324,1536.76,"No, no, no, that's wrong, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-124,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1536.76,1538.543,Congress does have to make the judgment.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1538.543,1542.128,Congress has to make... provide substantial evidence in the first instance.
1995.95-124,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.286,1554.12,Let me interrupt you.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1573.016,1575.135,--The outcome of the case would be much more difficult.
1995.95-124,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.107,1588.209,You don't think that's something we could take judicial notice of?
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1588.209,1595.982,"Your Honor, my reading of the Sable case and the term plurality make it absolutely clear that Justice White said you can't take judicial notice."
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1595.982,1596.382,Well--
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1608.956,1610.558,"You could, Your Honor, but here the question is--"
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.558,1619.997,"But... well, if we can take judicial notice of a fact like that, surely we can take judicial notice of other facts, too, so long as they meet the standard for judicial notice."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1619.997,1631.186,"--You can take... my question is, can you take judicial notice that public and leased access channels throughout the country are purveying indecency, and indecency is coming from those channels?"
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.555,1642.577,"Well, but then your position is that in some cases the Court cannot possibly make its own finding but in others it can."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1642.577,1643.862,"Your Honor, my view is that--"
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.862,1644.778,Is that right?
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1645.628,1648.664,--In others it can when it's so obvious as to be unarguable.
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1653.468,1656.836,--But I... we don't have to find... maybe I misunderstood you.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1683.354,1687.539,I think you do have to look those findings over if you're applying the least restrictive means test.
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1687.539,1704.484,"Well, are you claiming that the statute is going to be... maybe you are claiming that the statute is going to be applied on a pretextual basis, not because necessarily there's indecency, but that this is going to be a pretext to keep the people in the jeans and the earrings from broadcasting, period."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1704.484,1704.917,Right.
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1705.434,1706.686,"I mean, is that the argument you're--"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1706.686,1707.853,"--No, it's not the view."
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1707.853,1708.253,--Okay.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1708.253,1719.411,"The definition of indecency, which is another argument here, is so broad it's way beyond the definition used in Pacifica, that the public has to decide what the cable companies--"
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1719.411,1722.796,"I grant you that, but that is, too, a separate argument, isn't it?"
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1722.796,1732.051,"--Yes, it is, so a lot is swept into this point, but our basic view is that no matter what happens a content-based distinction has been made here."
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1747.096,1758.119,"Okay, but you... I suppose you win, accepting your premises, if we assume there is one instance of indecency somewhere on some channel across the United States."
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1758.119,1764.506,"Again, the Sable case made it absolutely clear that you don't have to prove that the world is perfect."
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1779.401,1779.684,Okay.
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1779.684,1781.817,--and this Court has to see whether they've done it.
1995.95-124,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1781.817,1783.819,May I ask you just a different question?
1995.95-124,0,28557,i_michael_greenberger,,1834.335,1842.406,"You can take those studies into account, but the fact is that even if that were true, total banning is not the least restrictive means."
1995.95-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.16,1850.677,"Thank you, Mr. Greenberger."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1855.581,1862.652,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-124,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2009.349,2020.639,"Well, do we have any cable operators and programmers here arguing that their First Amendment rights are being protected by this legislation?"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2020.639,2026.21,Time Warner in an amicus filing in our support is an example of that.
1995.95-124,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2029.662,2052.877,"Of course, it's kind of a curious arrangement, because I guess on a nonaccess channel of a cable operator the cable operator can charge a premium for channels that have indecent material on them, and many do, don't they?"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2053.927,2054.46,That is correct.
1995.95-124,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2054.46,2055.396,They earn more money for it.
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2055.396,2056.096,That is correct.
1995.95-124,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2056.096,2071.172,"So there would be a real incentive for them, then, to think that this is a dandy scheme because they can keep it off the nonaccess channels and make more money by selling their own."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2071.172,2091.752,"The leased access channels are one which the cable operators also collect a fee from the users of, and that fee can be adjusted based on how many viewers are attracted, what kind of commercial rates the programmer may be able to charge, et cetera."
1995.95-124,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.752,2096.806,"And those channels are blocked, I take it, unless you pay the fee."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2096.806,2097.389,That is--
1995.95-124,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.389,2100.175,That's how the cable owner makes his profit on it.
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2100.175,2100.591,--That is--
1995.95-124,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2100.591,2106.345,"He blocks them unless you take the affirmative action of paying a fee, and asking for them to come into your home."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2106.345,2112.483,"--That is correct, and fee disputes can be taken to the Commission on that."
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2113.049,2117.887,"To pay the fee you've got to give your name, right?"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2117.887,2119.92,--To the cable operator.
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2119.92,2123.641,"Is that... and that's correct, if--"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2123.641,2124.774,As far as I'm aware.
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2124.774,2127.993,"--I mean, there's no way to put a penny in a box or something, is what I'm saying."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2127.993,2133.079,"I'm not talking about viewers, I'm talking about the programmers who lease the access."
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2133.079,2134.029,"I'm sorry, I misunderstood."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2134.029,2137.181,The lease is a fee-paying arrangement.
1995.95-124,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2137.181,2157.595,"Mr. Wallace, I understand your point about the cable operators up to a point, and it's this, if the statute were simply, you can ban it if you want to, that's your judgment, but the argument, as I take it, on the other side is, it isn't pre-choice for the operator."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2169.236,2200.291,"Precisely so, Justice Ginsburg, and I... what I want to try to clarify in leading up to addressing that is what we see as the scope of governmental action involved here that is subject to the restrictions of the First Amendment, that does have to comply with the First Amendment, and what is in our view not governmental action."
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2310.012,2323.086,"Why isn't Congress influencing it, because if Congress did nothing, there would be complete freedom to... for either party to censor or not, as he sees fit."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2331.259,2342.298,"Well, it is leaving it solely to the option of the operators whether... we're talking about 10(a) and (c) now, not the blocking provision of 10(b), which of course is governmental action."
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2344.4,2360.659,"Yes, but you can't, I suppose, assess... certainly your opponent's position is that you can't assess the significance of (a) without noticing what's going to happen in the default situation provided by (b)."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2360.659,2361.661,"Well, there--"
1995.95-124,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2361.661,2370.467,"So there is a tendency to require censorship, editorialization, however you want to characterize it, that is positive."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2393.499,2402.521,"--Well, I would have to differ with that in... but it will take a moment to explain it."
1995.95-124,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.743,2532.506,"So is it one of the justifications for the bill that is under the law as enacted, it is easier for the subscribers, the viewers, to hold people to account for what they say, whereas without the act it's not very clear to whom we can object?"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2533.373,2548.516,"Particularly on the access channels, which are typically not channels where any one programmer is on the whole time, but they're made available in blocks of time that people can afford to buy."
1995.95-124,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2548.516,2550.968,--Was this argument made in the briefs?
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2565.127,2569.329,"Well, I would have to say the argument is more implicit than explicit--"
1995.95-124,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2569.329,2570.229,That's what I thought.
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2570.229,2571.548,--when you articulate it that way.
1995.95-124,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2645.246,2657.221,"But isn't it... the most vulnerable part of your case is the or block option, because the argument is made, I think loud and clear, that the Government isn't being a neutral arbiter."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2673.164,2704.452,"--Well, that goes to the 10(b) segregation and blocking requirement, which we have argued is not subject to the strictest scrutiny, but it can pass muster under the strictest scrutiny test because of what Justice Souter quite aptly called the inertia problem."
1995.95-124,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2706.404,2714.408,"But Mr. Wallace, before we get into that, isolating it is not what I'm asking you about."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2734.471,2751.116,"--Well, that gets us back to the State action question in the attack on the conferral of discretion on the operator in 10(a) and 10(c)."
1995.95-124,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.116,2768.644,"It's not the question I meant to address, Mr. Wallace, because I'm powerfully confused by talking about State action when you're dealing with a statute, and a statute that concerns speech, so that statute is subject to First Amendment controls--"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2768.644,2769.344,"The... well, I--"
1995.95-124,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2769.344,2771.429,--and I don't know how State action got into this.
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2771.429,2809.971,"--I have explained that of course the readjustment of discretion itself is governmental action that is subject to First Amendment restrictions, but what the argument below was on 10(a) and 10(c) is that while, on the face of it, the operator would be the one deciding whether or not to carry the indecent programming, that could have been the way the 1984 act was written in the first place."
1995.95-124,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2873.795,2893.208,"I would like to understand what your position is on the pushing the cable operator to make one choice, that is to ban, and also putting the subscriber, the customer, in the uncomfortable position of having to list yourself as someone who wants to subscribe to indecent programming."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2893.208,2903.664,"Well, that is something that is not a disclosure to the Government, but something that--"
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2903.664,2907.135,Would the answer be different if it were a disclosure to the Government?
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2907.135,2922.494,"--Well, it would be a closer analogy to Lamont v. The Postmaster General, it would be more of a problem of possible stigma, but this is something that the cable operator is required to keep confidential."
1995.95-124,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3030.53,3045.873,"Well, that's precisely the argument here, and there is some indication that when you look at the whole scheme that's what's happening, that the thumb has been put on... the Government's thumb has been put on the scale to eliminate--"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3045.873,3046.475,Well--
1995.95-124,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3046.475,3050.377,--a certain type of protected speech.
1995.95-124,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3050.377,3059.616,"And it would seem to me that you might be better advised to spend your time defending the scheme rather than saying that it's not State action, Mr.--"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3059.616,3078.161,"--Well, when we look at what... at the elements of what are said to be the Government's thumb on the scales, they seem to us not to be substantial enough to meet this Court's test."
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3098.674,3102.562,"--Well, but aren't there three elements that have got to be weighed here?"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3136.366,3136.766,The--
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3136.766,3138.485,There are three sources of burden.
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3140.101,3150.457,--The obligation is on the programmer rather than the operator to notify the programmer... to notify the operator.
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3153.492,3154.059,Right.
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3154.059,3161.18,"--that it's going to be broadcasting anything indecent, so there's no burden placed on the operator."
1995.95-124,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3169.87,3183.594,"But the operator does have the burden of the choice of saying okay, once I find that this is going to be coming over my cables, I've either... I either have got to say, you can't do it, or I've got to block it."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3183.594,3188.582,--That... segregate and block it.
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.694,3233.411,"Mr. Wallace, can I just ask one question?"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3259.011,3259.678,Well--
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.678,3261.563,Under the statute.
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3261.563,3263.646,--I don't think a medical program--
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.646,3264.682,"Well, some, you know--"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3264.682,3269.986,--has been anything ever found indecent by the Commission.
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.986,3279.942,"--Well, but there are certain kinds of programs that would have a public value that would nevertheless fall within the definition of indecency, wouldn't you agree with that?"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3279.942,3280.625,It depends on--
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3280.625,3285.745,"It isn't exactly indecency, it's got different words in the statute to describe the kind of program."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3285.745,3286.978,--It depends on what--
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3286.978,3288.697,"Live births, for example, might be covered."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3288.697,3291.315,--is meant by a public value.
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3311.46,3311.827,"No, I understand, but I'm asking you about the program that's on the borderline."
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3340.296,3341.312,Well--
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3341.312,3343.514,Or are you saying that category doesn't exist?
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3343.514,3349.818,"--Well, in the first place, it's up to the programmer to notify the operator that a program--"
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3349.818,3350.401,Right--
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3350.401,3351.984,--That it's indecent.
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3351.984,3356.638,--and he notifies that a program that's going to be shown at 7:00 to 9:00 tomorrow night is arguably indecent.

1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3375.432,3375.932,Right.
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3375.932,3378.718,--it would normally be put into that.
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3393.977,3401.465,"But if the decision is made to block the particular program, how does the audience get the opportunity to make a choice to have it unblocked?"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3401.465,3401.981,"Well, that--"
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3401.981,3404.917,"How much notice, and what's... how does it work in the individual case?"
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3406.385,3422.128,"--Well, a subscriber can notify the operator in writing that it wants access to the indecent programming, and will be given access."
1995.95-124,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3422.128,3424.08,And that's on a different--
1995.95-124,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3424.08,3425.213,--How much notice does he get?

1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3563.354,3563.954,Right--
1995.95-124,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3563.954,3566.523,--and I just don't understand the rationality of that.

1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3573.711,3584.917,It's that they can get a lock box if they know of the existence of it and know that there's reason to have one because indecent programming may be coming in which they may not even be aware of.
1995.95-124,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3584.917,3586.167,--lock box?
1995.95-124,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3586.167,3592.321,"If you ask for it, and most consumers do not have a lock box."
