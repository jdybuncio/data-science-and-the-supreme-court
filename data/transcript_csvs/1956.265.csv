1956.265,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.412,"Number 265, United States of America, Appellant, versus American Freightways Company, a partnership composed of Allan J. Resler and Norman Forman."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,16.277,21.793,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,92.12,94.633,What is that?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,94.633,97.984,I think so.
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,153.194,155.307,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,155.307,155.507,Pardon me?
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,155.507,158.528,(Voice Overlap) -- what do you mean?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,158.528,172.212,"Well, he certainly is stating that he is deciding for purposes of this case that there is no jurisdiction, but I think his language that regardless of the wording of the statutes, there is no jurisdiction."
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,404.84,411.679,"Before the elements -- before the elements of that in such certain case, it's certainly not present to this case."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,411.679,415.584,"Well, it was an association as distinguished from a partnership."
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,415.584,425.0,"(Voice Overlap) kind of a collective value and the Express Company for reasoning into the statute, the only Express Company brought in this kind of things."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,425.0,427.805,"Well, I think that is certainly correct."
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,439.938,440.735,Do you suppose that --
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,440.735,441.441,-- to our case.
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,441.441,444.839,(Voice Overlap) in 1957 that Congress wouldn't have that power?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,444.839,451.706,"Well, I certainly intend to turn immediately to the question whether assuming Congress has the power."
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,453.923,458.091,I think the question that you stated is the one we're dealing.
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,458.091,459.066,The latter question --
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,459.066,459.165,Yes.
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,459.165,459.511,"-- presents, Your Honor."
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,459.511,468.874,"You stated it and what the question is that I think is the precise question, namely, this company is interfering in the light of the whole background of partnership, et cetera, et cetera."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,468.874,469.147,Yes.
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,474.379,493.253,"I don't mean to say and that there may not be a question under the due process clause that the property should remain in the (Inaudible) of a certain crime and the (Inaudible) knowledge to this factually in fact, proving innocence of knowledge of -- of their knowledge."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,498.335,498.771,Yes.
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,509.18,510.174,You know what that is.
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,515.635,517.532,"Well, I passed that and turn to the question --"
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,517.532,520.125,(Inaudible)
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,520.125,523.898,"Yes, because I -- I have concluded with that right, Your Honor."
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,606.697,610.482,Did you say how they are operating license was an issue?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,610.482,614.48,"This is a common carrier by motor, Your Honor."
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,614.48,616.337,"Yes, but they have to get a permission to operate it?"
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,616.337,619.269,"Oh yes, they are certificated carrier and many --"
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,619.269,623.022,And they're certificated as a partnership --
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,623.022,629.983,"Well, the certificate does not require a carrier to operate in a particular form of business organization."
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,636.29,638.549,Does the record show that?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,638.549,640.133,"No, no."
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,655.023,662.132,"Just to have no doubt, I'm just wondering how -- how this particular partnership got the right to operate."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,662.132,666.778,Its -- there's no question that it's a certificated carrier by the ICC.
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,668.229,670.938,As a partnership?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,670.938,675.191,"Well, in the partnership, its application would be and its grant would be in the partnership name."
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,676.086,681.252,Were there some reason why the Government preferred not to precede against the partners rather than the partnership?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,681.252,692.869,"Yes, the Government initially proceeded against the individual partners and the motion for a bill of particulars was made at the opening of that proceeding."
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.448,709.52,"In other words, knowing violation that you would prove would be violated, an employee I think."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,709.52,716.671,"We could -- we -- our theory would be that on remand, we can prove that an agent or an employee of the partnership was guilty of a knowing violation."
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,716.671,719.567,That's the agent or the employee I get as not being a partner.
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,719.567,721.136,"Yes, sir."
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,817.749,840.3,"That -- that -- let me hear (Inaudible) to this problem when a statute makes it a penal offense knowingly, not doing something and knowingly do something whether a thought of it having the permission it had generally speaking in the law, whether knowingly a criminal statute defense by -- by the only -- law of agency applicable to civil cases."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,840.3,843.494,"Well, that question certainly alerts in -- in the case and our --"
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,843.494,855.158,(Inaudible) before the defense on how you construe the applicability of whoever with that which the law normally regards and brought the individuals to unite it together --
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,855.158,855.22,Yes.
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,855.22,857.434,-- and that's forming illegal personality.
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,857.434,870.128,"Yes, and our argument on -- on that point is that where Congress has regularly, in regulatory statutes, chose them to define person to include partnership."
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,870.128,873.821,You mean general suspendatory provision of the Section 1?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,873.821,874.184,Yes.
1956.265,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,916.551,923.082,Is this issue of knowingly ever been raise and despite from seeing against the corporation?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,923.082,923.506,Yes.
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,950.129,957.354,You don't have to rely on the generality because it contends to with the reference to construe the Interstate Commerce Act under --
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,957.354,968.613,"Yes, New York Central case 50 years -- so years ago was such a case."
1956.265,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1279.565,1285.515,"Do you think you could prosecute those here, both the partnership as an entity and the individual partner?"
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1285.515,1286.549,I think so.
1956.265,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1297.704,1302.539,That might have something to do with your interpretation of it.
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1302.539,1314.493,"Well, I think that we could only proceed against an individual partner if we could show personal knowledge and participation on the part of that partner."
1956.265,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1323.235,1327.596,"And you proceed against the partnership, you proceed against an employee as divided."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1327.596,1328.422,"Yes, sir."
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1359.827,1371.897,"I hope this gets done in ways that you could constitute and -- and obtain a conviction and fine a $500,000 to reinforce against the partnership."
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1371.897,1372.544,That's right.
1956.265,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1372.544,1373.413,When it gets down?
1956.265,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1373.413,1379.723,"Where we proceed against the entity, of course, it's clear that the only punishment can be applied."
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,1732.861,1758.615,"If the Court pleases, the Government originally filed a criminal information against Foreman and Wrestler doing business as American Freightways Company, a New York partnership."
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2334.221,2345.733,"Supposing the statute didn't have knowingly in it, the effects of 18 -- 835 didn't have knowingly in it, would you say your case was different?"
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2345.733,2346.304,"No, sir."
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2347.393,2348.035,The same?
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2348.035,2349.113,"Yes, sir."
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2758.884,2771.981,Do you mean to say that inherent -- as far as inherent to makeshift things that the law would be treated -- a partnership the way that the continent of Europe (Inaudible) may be is an entity?
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2771.981,2772.733,That -- that's just --
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2772.733,2780.948,"All you're saying is that the general acceptance of our law, partnerships that we adhere to the so called Act is that there is and not the entity theory --"
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2780.948,2781.024,That's right.
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2781.024,2783.479,-- acceptance of all legislation cases.
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2783.479,2783.689,That's right.
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2783.689,2784.44,Is that what you're saying?
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2784.44,2785.146,That's right.
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2785.146,2789.492,I think that I should describe Mr. Spritzer (Inaudible)
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2789.492,2802.845,"Well, is it your position in this case that the employees of the partnership with impunity violate this law as often as they want without any liability on the partnership unless you can bring --"
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2802.845,2803.198,No.
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2803.198,2804.804,-- personal knowledge to the owners?
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2804.804,2816.751,"I just say that if they had done that, it would have come to the knowledge of the partners and the partners would never have been able to escape it but where an individual act takes place --"
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2816.751,2818.452,They might be absent owners.
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2841.828,2845.079,"Your Honor, may I answer this way."
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2898.171,2899.544,I'm not following you.
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2902.395,2902.738,Yes.
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2902.738,2905.393,I'm not following from where you're going.
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2905.393,2906.259,That's right.
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2906.259,2909.633,The Government cites a lot of (Inaudible) cases.
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2912.38,2913.407,That's right.
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2974.612,2976.05,In this case mainly?
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2976.05,2976.765,"Yes, sir."
1956.265,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2976.765,2977.945,I'm not following you.
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2977.945,2981.593,"Well, they let that the other part, Your Honor."
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2986.325,2993.57,But isn't the greater purpose of the Government to sole regulate this business if there won't be any accidents --
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,2993.57,2993.855,The --
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2993.855,3006.343,-- of that time and that this -- this violation that you're talking about is -- is endangering the public to the extent where -- where there might have to be such a project.
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,3006.343,3026.234,"Your -- Your Honor, they -- the -- I think Congress meant to make sure that the persons who actually commit these -- these violations shall be the ones to be punished unless it is authorized, permitted or -- or approved in some form by -- by the employer, Your Honor."
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3062.074,3068.083,Does the Government contend in this case that -- that it could put the partners in jail?
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,3074.497,3074.927,"No, sir."
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3074.96,3075.755,-- against the partnership.
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,3075.755,3081.736,The Government has -- the Government has a right to -- to sentence the partners as I read the statute.
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3081.736,3097.842,"Well, I understood Mr. Spritzer to say that he made no such claim but the only -- the only claim they make is that under this indictment, the -- the partnership itself can be fined for -- for the violation of the Regulatory Act, if there's any --"
1956.265,1,16091,attorney_general,,3097.842,3098.742,"Well, I just --"
1956.265,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3098.742,3099.911,-- if we're not agreed on that.
1956.265,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3102.974,3106.163,It's our position that the only defendant is the partnership.
1956.265,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3108.772,3111.486,There's no question upon how it's imprisonment at all.
1956.265,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3111.486,3112.055,Exactly.
1956.265,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3112.055,3112.95,All right.
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3112.95,3115.03,Your Honor -- if Your Honor will look at the --
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3115.03,3120.677,What the Government said in effect is that this is an action of debt for a $1000 brought within.
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3125.504,3126.253,I don't think so.
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3126.443,3127.209,What?
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3127.209,3128.253,I don't -- I don't see --
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3128.253,3129.767,If they are right therefore.
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3129.767,3133.094,I don't see -- I don't see how they could.
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3134.329,3149.108,"It's all because, the penal provisions enforceable merely to a (Inaudible) and if that is to say, if that is to stay then it's a concluding fact that all common law soon objects."
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3169.17,3171.316,Your Honor -- Your Honor --
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3171.316,3173.485,Is that when it gets done?
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3173.485,3173.69,Excuse me?
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3173.69,3176.606,Isn't that when it gets done?
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3176.606,3183.894,"Well, I -- I can see that -- that this could be turned into a civil action, Your Honor."
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3183.894,3196.808,"Well, actions for penalty are impossible on both the civil and the criminal side counting all the lines in the history of England and the United States."
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3196.808,3201.7,"Your Honor, as I -- as I have argued that even in civil law and I haven't --"
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3201.7,3203.063,I'm not saying this is correct.
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3209.505,3223.111,"Your Honor, even under the civil law and I've only so far touched upon the civil law that a partnership will not be considered as a separate entity according to the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the decisions in this Court."
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3311.995,3327.197,"That was a conviction of an individual and the Government's case was and the Court of Appeals held that an individual can be constantly convicted on the suspension of respondeat superior on short answer, is that right?"
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3327.197,3328.601,"Yes, sir, that's true."
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3328.601,3330.236,But this is a partnership.
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3330.236,3330.696,"Yes, sir."
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3331.113,3360.626,"The question is whether the Congress -- and you argued that the Congress of the United States is debarred by the constitution by confirmation, I don't know why, due process from holding a partnership, the partnership asset liable for violation, criminally liable of offenses, punishment that can be needed out to the extent that can, namely the problem can be gone on the basis of the misconduct of the agent."
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3361.735,3362.105,"No, sir."
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3363.081,3364.084,"So, what are you arguing?"
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3364.084,3386.169,And I -- and I say Your Honor that the part -- the assets can be reached of a partnership whether it'd be in the hands of the partnership or in the hands of the -- the individuals under the Bankruptcy Act or on the theory of marshalling assets because the assets of the partnership and the individuals are subject to the -- to levy an execution for the debts of the party.
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3386.169,3402.001,"Yes, but Congress cannot undersay that if a business is -- kind of business is conducted by a company and I think individual or by incorporation, by two or more people doing business as a partnership."
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3414.021,3414.171,They can --
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3414.171,3415.042,Why they can't do that?
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3415.042,3417.568,"They can say it but they didn't say it in this case, Your Honor."
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3417.568,3421.373,"If that's your case, then why do you talk about constitutionality?"
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3421.373,3423.316,But they didn't -- yes.
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3442.059,3443.154,And you know that's one thing.
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3446.67,3447.115,Yes.
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3447.115,3450.638,It might have landed an individual in jail.
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3480.063,3491.667,"Your Honor, Section 1 U.S. 1 of course was enacted at a time other than 18 U.S.C. 835 and Congress --"
1956.265,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3491.667,3498.365,Unless it was enacted at the time when the partnership entity theory had no hold at all on lawmakers.
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3498.365,3510.044,"That -- that's right, but -- but they do not define partnership in Section 1 U.S.C. 1 nor do they say that a partnership can be treated as a separate entity."
1956.265,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3538.688,3541.467,"Well, that would be true with the corporation."
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3541.467,3549.008,"Well, they -- they enact -- well, the corporation is entirely different as our cases show because the corporation can only act through its agents."
1956.265,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3563.712,3565.277,Thank you.
1956.265,3,16091,attorney_general,,3565.277,3575.804,"Thank you, Your Honor."
