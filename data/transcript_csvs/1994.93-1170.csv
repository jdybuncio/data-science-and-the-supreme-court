1994.93-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.158,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-1170, United States v. National Treasury Employees Union."
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,11.089,14.562,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.09,221.528,"Mr. Bender, in the definitions section, 505(3), which defines the term, honorarium, apparently it was amended to add some parenthetical material so that it now provides..."
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,238.37,239.701,Right.
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.701,247.346,I am unclear what the purpose of that amendment was.
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,267.031,280.508,"When I first saw that, it seemed to me that a person had made a typographical error, and that the parenthesis should have been moved up several words, but the history of the statute shows that it was, in fact, intended to be exactly as it was written."
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.001,298.03,"You mean, you think that it was intended to, as structured with the other provisions of the statute, to prohibit an honorarium if it's a single speech or article, but to allow it if there are several?"
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,298.03,306.718,"--Yes, I think that's the clear intention, because at the time in Congress there was a proposal to apply the nexus requirement."
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.628,327.551,I don't think that makes sense.
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,327.551,327.729,It seems counterintuitive.
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.729,329.382,Is that absurd?
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,329.382,333.585,"I don't think it's absurd, although I admit that it is counterintuitive."
1994.93-1170,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.585,336.706,"You can get hung for a sheep... for a lamb, but not for a sheep."
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,336.706,345.852,"Well, I think the difference is that first of all the reason they did that was that the statute, as originally written... if you just leave out the parenthesis, you will see how it was originally written."
1994.93-1170,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.279,411.73,You can be a consultant without doing any work.
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,414.434,424.672,"There's no question of that, Justice Scalia, and I think it would be possible for Congress to have broadened this and made it a much broader ban on lots of other outside compensation."
1994.93-1170,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.924,435.922,The question is whether it's rational if it just selects one way in which you can get paid for doing nothing and does not select any of the other ways in which you can get paid for doing nothing.
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,435.922,440.747,"--Ordinarily, Congress does not have to deal with all problems."
1994.93-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.533,457.609,"Mr. Bender, on the subject of doing something, I know there was a time when lawyers were paid by the word, but a great man said,"
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,476.461,478.874,--It's obviously not an absolute guarantee.
1994.93-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.73,509.715,"Might not the parenthetical material that we've been discussing, Mr. Bender, have been intended to allow someone to teach a course?"
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,509.715,529.628,"That's one of the functions that... that's one of the functions that it serves, and I think that's a good example of the kind of thing which is not likely to produce a payment made to curry favor with a Federal employee and is much more likely to be made because of some real value that the person has given."
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,570.657,582.755,"Well, Mr. Bender, this... it would make a lot more sense if the opening of the parenthesis were inserted just before ""if"", and after"
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,600.51,602.49,"I agree with you, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,608.046,609.646,"Well, maybe it was just a drafting error."
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,613.769,626.237,"--The legislative history I think makes it clear that it wasn't just a drafting error because, as I say, there was a proposal to add that nexus limitation to the whole thing, and that proposal failed, and this proposal passed."
1994.93-1170,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,634.643,660.47,"But it does present you with a different problem here, and that is, part of your argument for sustaining the breadth of the ban is the difficulty in line-drawing if you were to have a narrower ban, and yet here is an example in which you've got to do some line-drawing, in which Congress in effect is saying, yes, we can draw lines if we want to, because there is a germaneness requirement in the series."
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,660.47,671.307,"In the series, yes, and I think the reason for that, or the explanation for that, might well be that there are many less cases where people do a series."
1994.93-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,682.126,683.165,"Well, I can--"
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,698.865,708.653,"I believe it was, Congress wanted to make the exception for the military, and I think it had to do with... I can explain this much more easily for the faculty than the students."
1994.93-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,729.28,729.971,And the students?
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,729.971,734.223,I have no explanation for the students.
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,779.534,784.487,"Well, but if it's a series, the statute requires that evaluation--"
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,784.487,785.066,"Right, but with a series it's--"
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,785.066,786.438,--so it just doesn't make sense.
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,786.438,790.512,--I think with a series it's easier to know what the subject matter is.
1994.93-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,819.253,820.505,It isn't limited to teaching.
1994.93-1170,0,37685,paul_bender,,822.368,825.821,"Right, and again, it's blunter than it might be."
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,1823.908,1831.002,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2005.155,2012.351,"Did this report, Mr. O'Duden, consider simply appearances as well as speeches or articles?"
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2012.351,2014.992,--The report is very wide-ranging.
1994.93-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.638,2039.32,"Mr. O'Duden, what troubles me about your proposal that it just be limited to things that have what you call a nexus is that it's a different problem from what... I mean, that's a good idea."
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2084.212,2095.75,"Well, it would seem, though, that that same rationale would apply to the situation where someone gave a series of speeches, or a series of articles."
1994.93-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.078,2119.477,"Well, how about the Solicitor General's answer that, with a series of articles or perhaps with a book, you have some more guarantee of authenticity?"
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2128.901,2156.549,"As I understand the Government's argument, it is suggesting that the added volume of material somehow makes it easier to determine a nexus, and I think as Justice Ginsburg noted earlier, that, I think, lacks a rational basis, because someone could easily write a very long, very voluminous, single article with ample material in it."
1994.93-1170,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2173.4,2185.278,"Well, is it your position that the statute would be more defensible if the series exception were not in the statute and there were just a blanket prohibition, whether or not it was a series?"
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2185.278,2185.859,No.
1994.93-1170,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2194.163,2195.776,Which statute is the more defensible?
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2195.776,2197.365,"--I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1994.93-1170,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2197.365,2200.508,Which statute is the more defensible from the Government's standpoint?
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2200.508,2216.118,"I think that they were... they are equally indefensible, but I think that the fact that there is this exception now for a series, that that raises a question about the credibility for limiting payment in the first instance."
1994.93-1170,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2216.118,2226.386,"Would you say a statute with that qualification, the series nexus test just extended across the board, that such a statute would be constitutional?"
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2226.386,2237.362,"We have never questioned that if there was a nexus requirement in the statute that applied across the board, that that would be a constitutional statute."
1994.93-1170,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2237.362,2243.448,So then you would have no objection to the solution that Judge Silberman proposed in the D.C. Circuit.
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2243.448,2248.804,"Quite frankly, Your Honor, as a practical matter, no, we would have no objection to that whatsoever."
1994.93-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.804,2250.947,Why is that statute constitutional?
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2267.408,2289.503,"Well, I think the way the nexus test works, the one that is written in the statute, is that you are not allowed to be paid if there is a direct nexus, so there may well be that there are circumstances where, if somebody is writing generally about something that he has worked on, where it might be appropriate for that person to engage in that kind of activity."
1994.93-1170,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2313.269,2320.822,"Trading on the job in the sense that what you have learned on the job, you're profiting from?"
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2320.822,2326.188,"That's right, using your public office for private gain is the notion."
1994.93-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.188,2332.442,"But if you do it on your own time, why shouldn't you be allowed to do that, under your theory?"
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2332.442,2335.835,For the very reason that I just gave.
1994.93-1170,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.963,2350.206,Why is it different than if you wait until you retire and then write your memoirs?
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2355.081,2362.434,"--Obviously, the statute only governs a situation where you a current employee."
1994.93-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2367.379,2368.488,"--Well, suppose you had a statute--"
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2376.906,2378.265,"That's right, but I think as long--"
1994.93-1170,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.265,2379.397,It's just an appearance problem.
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2379.397,2379.888,--It's an appearance problem.
1994.93-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.932,2393.138,"It's an appearance... is it an appearance... I've been a judge for something like 12 years now, and I've learned a lot of law there, and now and then I talk about the law."
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2393.138,2393.999,--That's right.
1994.93-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.999,2396.813,"And some of the things I know about the law, I've learned in these 12 years--"
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2396.813,2397.422,But you don't talk--
1994.93-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.422,2398.784,--and that's a wicked appearance.
1994.93-1170,1,25857,gregory_oduden,,2398.784,2398.994,"--about your cases, do you?"
1994.93-1170,2,37685,paul_bender,,3615.776,3629.976,"With regard to the commission reports, on page 8 of our reply brief, we quote a paragraph from both of the commission reports, which says that honoraria should be defined so as to close present and potential loopholes."
1994.93-1170,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3639.333,3642.916,Were those reports addressed just to executive branch--
1994.93-1170,2,37685,paul_bender,,3642.916,3643.697,--No.
1994.93-1170,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3646.478,3657.915,"--Well, aren't there quite different problems with respect to the legislative branch, and perhaps the judicial branch, than there is with respect to the executive branch--"
1994.93-1170,2,37685,paul_bender,,3657.915,3658.346,I think if you--
