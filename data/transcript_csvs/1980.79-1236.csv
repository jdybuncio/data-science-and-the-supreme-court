1980.79-1236,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.84,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in No. 79-1236, Carson et al. v. American Brands, Inc.."
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,15.446,18.227,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1236,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,77.017,89.668,"Mr. Williams, I get some impression from the papers that the respondents may have a different view about going ahead with the consent decree."
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,101.398,103.787,"Your Honor, we do not think that they are free to withdraw."
1980.79-1236,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,171.666,177.087,You don't feel there is any inconsistency in that position?
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,177.087,189.549,"No, I do not, Your Honor, for the simple reason that this is a case where the order said so many things that it had the effect of deciding some things on the merits and some things that were collateral to the merits."
1980.79-1236,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,189.549,192.205,"In any event, you would be willing to win on either issue?"
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,192.205,193.517,"Yes, Your Honor, I certainly would."
1980.79-1236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,193.517,199.187,Did you argue the Cohen matter in the Court of Appeals?
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,199.187,201.78,"The matter was presented to the Court of Appeals, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.083,248.276,"Before you do that, counsel, since as I understand the Cohen Doctrine it has to be not related to the merits, if you were successful in appealing this order under the Cohen Doctrine, could you appeal that part that related to the merits, too."
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,248.276,263.159,"Your Honor, I think it's quite clear from the decisions of this Court that once an appellate court has jurisdiction by virtue of the ancillary jurisdiction that the Court has it can then reach out and decide all other issues in the case that require reversal."
1980.79-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.565,502.095,Mr. Williams?
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,502.095,502.548,Yes?
1980.79-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,502.548,505.202,"The merits aren't before us, are they?"
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,505.202,506.217,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.217,514.605,"Just the appealability, whether the district court was right or wrong in what he said about the propriety of the decree."
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,514.605,539.987,"That's correct, Your Honor, The only reason for going into the merits at all is so that this Court can make a preliminary assessment as to whether or not with respect to the argument under Section 1292(a) the merits were touched upon by the decree, and also to see if the collateral interests which the petitioners claim were adversely affected were separate and apart from those merits."
1980.79-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.987,542.55,Had you asked for a preliminary injunction?
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,542.55,561.587,"Your Honor, we had not asked for a preliminary injunction and in view of the determination made by the district court, it is quite clear that a preliminary injunction would not and could not have been granted, because that court found that there were no vestiges of discrimination to be corrected or remedied."
1980.79-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,583.174,592.217,Would you say that a denial of a temporary restraining order was appealable?
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,592.217,596.107,A denial of a temporary restraining order?
1980.79-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.107,601.198,Did you ask for ex parte pending a hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction?
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,601.198,615.989,"No, we did not, Your Honor, but with respect to the denial of the temporary restraining order, I think the law is quite clear that is not appealable under Section 1292(a)(1), although the denial of a preliminary injunction is of course appealable."
1980.79-1236,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,799.462,808.677,"Which way, Mr. Williams, do you think the negative aspects of piecemeal appeals cuts in this case?"
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,808.677,826.873,"Well, I think, Your Honor, in light of your past decisions, it is quite clear that one of the reasons why this Court has decided that piecemeal adjudication is bad is because of the expense and the time that it consumes, and also the cost to the parties and the Court and the public interest as a whole."
1980.79-1236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.994,882.975,"I suppose part of your argument is that if you allow an appeal you avoid piecemeal litigation, because if the appeal comes out a certain way the case is over."
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,882.975,886.146,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that is exactly the case here."
1980.79-1236,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,899.329,911.699,"Is it not generally true that on the problem of piecemeal appeals that one of the propositions is that if it comes out one way, it will terminate the litigation, and if it comes out the other way, it does not?"
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,912.652,923.741,"Well, Your Honor, the only thing that the parties would have suffered in that particular case would have been a certain amount of delay if it comes out adversely, in this case, for example, to the petitioners."
1980.79-1236,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.638,964.756,"But, you're making more of a Cohen's argument now than anything, I take it, and this kind of an argument would lead you to say that any denial of a motion for summary judgment would be appealable; because if that denial is reversed, the case is over."
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,964.756,968.926,"No, we don't think the argument leads to that conclusion, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.517,1025.033,"Could I ask you one question, Mr. Williams?"
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,1025.033,1025.345,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.345,1045.805,What if the district court had said there is now pending in the 4th Circuit a case which will decide the legality of this consent order and I think it will be decided in about three or four months so I'm going to withhold my consent until the 4th Circuit hands down its opinion.
1980.79-1236,0,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,1057.831,1059.581,"It would not be appealable, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1067.063,1077.325,Mr. Dalton.
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1077.325,1079.137,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1236,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1139.472,1152.827,"Mr. Dalton, you don't suggest that EEOC or Title VII actions are governed by different rules of appealability than are set forth in 1291 or 1292?"
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1152.827,1153.575,"No, not at all."
1980.79-1236,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1160.495,1170.162,"Mr. Dalton, before you proceed would you state precisely the elements of the injunction as you perceive them, the injunction that was denied?"
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1170.162,1180.377,"My understanding is that there is a general element of prohibiting discrimination in the future, that there were--"
1980.79-1236,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1180.377,1181.127,Prohibiting what?
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1183.453,1184.0,--Yes.
1980.79-1236,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1207.069,1212.849,"Well, I can ask Mr. Williams when he resumes his argument."
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1212.849,1215.847,I can do it but it's going to stretch me a bit.
1980.79-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.195,1455.533,"Mr. Dalton, I take it that under your argument and that of your colleague, that the denial of the consent decree would be appealable by either party?"
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1455.533,1456.595,"--Oh, yes, absolutely."
1980.79-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.595,1458.516,Or both?
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1458.516,1459.063,Yes.
1980.79-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.063,1467.108,And does that cause you any kind of problem?
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1467.108,1468.935,No.
1980.79-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.935,1470.449,They'd both be taking the same position?
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1470.449,1491.347,"There may be difficulties, as indeed there were in this case, where no one wants to... well, in this case what happened was that the plaintiffs sought to appeal the denial of the consent decree and the respondent defendants wanted to take no position on that in the Court of Appeals, because they felt there were not in an adversary posture."
1980.79-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.718,1510.419,I would suppose that in some cases it might be the other side that would be most eager to have the consent decree entered?
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1510.419,1511.949,"Indeed, indeed."
1980.79-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1521.477,1537.828,"Is there any reason why the parties could not abide all the terms of the consent decree if they were in the posture Mr. Justice White suggested, abide those conditions voluntarily even if a district judge would not accept the decree?"
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1537.828,1543.685,"Well, it is certain it's true that parties can enter into private settlements of lawsuits and any time a party--"
1980.79-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.685,1546.966,"Most times they do, in private litigation."
1980.79-1236,1,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1546.966,1547.997,--Indeed.
1980.79-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1733.811,1736.123,"Very well, Mr. Dalton."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1740.168,1742.48,Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1776.498,1781.778,"What is held up by the district court's action, except its proceeding with the trial?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1786.011,1795.585,"Well, that's correct, but it's also the views expressed by the majority and the dissenting opinions concerning what the trial court did hold."
1980.79-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1850.798,1863.198,At some point would you comment on whether your client wishes to withdraw and if so whether you may withdraw or whether you're bound by some contractual consideration?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1863.198,1888.298,"Well, Your Honor, after 28 months had passed from the time the trial court had this case until it got back, we did file a motion requesting a pretrial conference for the purpose of setting a trial date, and in that motion we stated that we now withdrew consent to the proposed decree."
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1888.298,1890.718,Did you state that you do withdraw consent?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1890.718,1891.108,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1891.108,1896.982,"And did you ask for leave of the court to withdraw your consent, specifically?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1896.982,1904.025,We went to the pretrial conference and the trial date was set for this case.
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1904.025,1906.056,"The answer, then, is, no?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1906.056,1916.973,No further order was entered or no further mention was made of the respondent's motion to withdraw its consent.
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1916.973,1928.687,"Mr. Wickham, then I take it the answer to my question is that you made no formal motion to the court for leave to withdraw your consent?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1928.687,1933.294,We did not make any formal motion except in the motion to ask for a pretrial conference and to set a trial date.
1980.79-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.294,1945.133,"In that motion, although it wasn't a motion to withdraw your consent, did you allege a right to withdraw or take the position you had a right to withdraw by reason of changed circumstances, or you just changed your mind about?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1945.133,1948.07,"We took, actually, no position, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.07,1948.992,I see.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1948.992,1962.141,We feel that changed circumstances would be a consideration for the trial court if we'd made a formal motion to withdraw out consent.
1980.79-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.654,1972.951,I see.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1982.744,1988.164,"Yes, sir, that really has nothing to do with why we're here today, as I see it Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1988.164,1996.206,"--Mr. Wickham, was the request for the setting of the trial date made before or after the Court of Appeals decided the case?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,1996.206,1998.892,It was made after the the Court of Appeals decided the case.
1980.79-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.762,2018.698,What jurisdiction did the district court have after a notice of appeal was filed?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2018.698,2022.493,I don't think it would have any jurisdiction at that time.
1980.79-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2024.258,2033.457,"Once the notice of appeal had been filed, the district court could not address itself to the question whether you have the authority--"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2033.457,2035.253,--That is correct.
1980.79-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2035.253,2037.049,--Or the power to withdraw your consent.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2037.049,2037.94,That is correct.
1980.79-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.94,2040.22,Was that considered by the Court of Appeals?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2040.22,2044.156,The Court of Appeals did not know we had withdrawn our consent.
1980.79-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.355,2054.995,"Mr. Wickham, I don't understand."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2063.914,2073.94,"Well, the district court granted a stay of these proceedings pending the petition for cert in this case, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2073.94,2083.499,"But in the interim, between the time the district court acted initially and the time the Court of Appeals acted, there was no jurisdiction in the district court was there?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2083.499,2083.734,"That's correct; no, sir."
1980.79-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.734,2087.124,"Well, isn't that the issue we're called upon to decide today?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2090.231,2093.652,"Well, theoretically that would be if there was no jurisdiction."
1980.79-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.652,2096.714,"--If it was an improper appeal, then the appeal didn't have any effect on the district court--"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2096.714,2105.304,"Well, then, theoretically, the district court would have jurisdiction, but hardly would the district court assert such jurisdiction pending the decision of the 4th Circuit."
1980.79-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.304,2105.335,--I understand that second point.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2109.1,2110.866,That's correct.
1980.79-1236,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2110.866,2141.523,"It the district court was deprived of jurisdiction and in fact the order... then it must be because there was a right to appeal, and if it retained jurisdiction, it must be because the appeal was improper and it just chose to await the outcome of the Court of Appeals decision."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2141.523,2146.195,That's correct.
1980.79-1236,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2193.971,2203.921,"If you didn't withdraw your consent, wouldn't the agreement that you entered into be enforceable as a private contract?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2203.921,2219.602,"Well, we take that position, that that is one aspect of withdrawal of consent is a contractual relationship, and if we violate it is the remedy a suit for damages or what?"
1980.79-1236,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.302,2270.752,"Well, they could in fact sue you on the contract, I take it?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2270.752,2274.033,"That's certainly a possibility, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.033,2284.592,"Well, I suppose the contract has a clause in it whereby your clients agree to the entry of a consent decree?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2284.592,2286.106,"Well, you know--"
1980.79-1236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2286.106,2287.903,Isn't it?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2287.903,2291.354,--Justice Powell asked what the provisions of the consent decree were.
1980.79-1236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2293.571,2294.258,All I want to know is--
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2294.258,2294.852,--We agreed.
1980.79-1236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2295.367,2296.305,--About the one provision.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2299.492,2302.615,We indeed agreed to the entry of the consent decree; that's correct.
1980.79-1236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2302.615,2306.41,And so that is part of your contractual obligation?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2306.41,2307.753,That's correct.
1980.79-1236,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.753,2327.918,"And yet that part of the obligation, because of Rule 23, can be negated by the trial judge if he refuses to approve it, I suppose."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2327.918,2343.364,"Well, the only part that would be negated, it seems to me... we could still enter into a private agreement-like... a someone pointed out a little while ago, many cases are settled, agreed, and the cases are dismissed."
1980.79-1236,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.735,2376.85,"But if you entered a 25-paragraph settlement agreement and one of the paragraphs says, we will enter a consent decree, and the district court rejects the consent decree, that doesn't necessarily void the other 24 paragraphs of the agreement that you've entered into voluntarily."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2376.85,2386.582,It doesn't necessarily do so unless one of the parties would insist upon a consent decree should always be protected by a contempt proceedings for a violation.
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.582,2400.045,"Well, I take it the Government suggests that it wouldn't enter into any settlements except in connection with a consent degree."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2400.045,2403.575,"I heard that suggestion, but this is a private action case."
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.256,2423.349,Is the consent decree... is the agreement in the record?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2423.349,2424.708,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.708,2426.91,"It isn't in the printed record, is it?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2426.91,2433.767,"You'll find it starting on page 26a, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.767,2439.671,"Oh, I see."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2447.604,2451.15,"Well, that is the agreement."
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2453.43,2454.368,--It really isn't the agreement.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2454.837,2456.444,"Well, that's all we have."
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2456.444,2459.584,There's no separate agreement to enter--
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2459.584,2460.366,"No separate agreement, no, sir, I'm sorry."
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2468.565,2470.472,--And all of you moved for its adoption?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2470.472,2475.297,And we moved for its adoption at that time.
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.795,2495.944,"So there would be nothing... if the judge refuses to enter, the decree, the motions are just denied and there is no obligation on anybody's part from there on, of any kind."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2495.944,2504.566,"There's no obligation on anybody's part, that's correct, but there's also nothing to prevent the parties from negotiating a different type of agreement."
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.566,2506.674,"Well, I know, but that hasn't been done."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2506.674,2507.346,That has not been done.
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2507.346,2509.876,Was there an oral agreement?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2509.876,2513.673,Ah--
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2513.673,2515.249,I take it what you're saying is there's no written agreement.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2515.249,2526.792,"--Well, we agreed to propose the consent decree found in the Appendix to the... to the court, Justice White."
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2540.708,2543.441,"All three of you moved the court to enter the decree, in any event."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2543.441,2544.348,"Yes, that's correct."
1980.79-1236,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2544.348,2545.752,And just filed memos in--
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2545.752,2549.767,And then the court asked us to file memos in support of that decree.
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.063,2553.983,--Are the motions in the printed record?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2562.122,2562.606,--That's correct.
1980.79-1236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2572.915,2574.961,Every party moved for--
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2574.961,2576.117,--And every party moved to--
1980.79-1236,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2576.117,2579.772,"--That must have been by agreement, via--"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2579.772,2580.303,--That's correct.
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2580.303,2582.068,--Was that by oral motion or by agreement?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2582.068,2582.693,It was by oral motion.
1980.79-1236,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2593.252,2601.216,"Is it correct, then, Mr. Wickham to say that the consent decree contained the settlement agreement of the parties?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2601.216,2603.371,"That's correct, sir."
1980.79-1236,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2603.371,2605.714,And you wished to have the court approve it.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2605.714,2612.353,"The district court, yes, sir."
1980.79-1236,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2612.353,2612.697,"Yes, yes."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2612.697,2612.962,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.634,2716.937,"Well, the proposed decree here, the first paragraph, is that, your client agrees that... and a permanent injunction entered against them enjoining discrimination, and then, paragraph 3, it provides for further injunctive relief, doesn't it?"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2716.937,2723.701,"Well, I think that if you read it--"
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.701,2730.933,"You certainly... if you didn't live up to this decree which contained an injunction, you would be subject to contempt."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2730.933,2732.042,"--No question about that, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.069,2745.757,Right.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2745.757,2773.058,"--And if not, this type of injunctive relief is not such that it's covered by the provisions of 1292(a)(1), and it's very clear that if it had effective review, number one, as you pointed out, they could ask for a preliminary injunction."
1980.79-1236,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2782.085,2783.523,Why would that be?
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2797.002,2810.605,"I don't think it is usual procedure, but it shows that... it shows that if you don't ask for a preliminary injunction you must not feel that you have any reparable interest to protect, or to lose, so to speak."
1980.79-1236,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2824.88,2828.239,"Yes, I know, but you have to consider Gardner along with General Electric and--"
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2828.239,2829.457,"--Yes, sir, and it's--"
1980.79-1236,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2829.457,2830.597,--You have to consider them together.
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2830.597,2857.164,"--And that's... and certainly after final judgment it's reviewable, and effectively reviewable, because if after trial on the merits the petitioners got more than the consent decree gave them, they certainly wouldn't be harmed."
1980.79-1236,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2879.734,2884.403,"They're not objecting to the review, they're objecting to the results of review."
1980.79-1236,2,28361,henry_t_wickham,,2884.403,2896.508,"--Well, I'm saying that to have effective review, there's not a final order within the meaning of Section 1292(a)(2), Justice Marshall."
1980.79-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2985.208,2997.343,Mr. Levit.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,2997.343,3000.217,Mr. Chief Justice and Justices of the Supreme Court:
1980.79-1236,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3019.726,3022.96,"Well, the union did not want to undermine the consent decree."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3023.99,3044.747,"Well, I'm talking, Your Honor, with respect... when the case was remanded from the 4th Circuit back to the district court judge, and then at the time that a pretrial conference was requested by the respondents, in that motion requesting a pretrial conference, the respondents stated that they withdrew their consent."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.63,3066.379,"--What do you mean if they did not withdraw it, they said they would."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3075.437,3075.969,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3075.969,3076.531,What does that mean?
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3076.531,3079.202,That means that the consent--
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3079.202,3081.154,That doesn't mean they're withdrawing it.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3081.154,3084.45,"--Oh, I would submit, Your Honor--"
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3084.45,3084.887,"If they want to withdraw, they withdraw."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3086.731,3094.118,"--Well, they do say, Your Honor; that they no longer consent, and I would submit to you that that's the same thing as withdrawing your consent."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3094.118,3095.837,But don't you usually file a motion?
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3095.837,3098.258,"Oh, this was in a motion."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3098.258,3104.351,But this was a motion to ask for a pretrial conference.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3104.351,3104.662,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3104.662,3106.177,That's what the motion is.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3106.177,3106.833,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3106.833,3108.536,This isn't a motion to withdraw.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3108.536,3110.16,"Well, it's a statement--"
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3110.16,3111.91,This isn't a motion to withdraw consent.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3111.91,3114.893,"--Well, Your Honor, the reason--"
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3114.893,3122.076,And they say that this will be presented to the court at the pretrial conference.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3123.279,3125.825,"--There was no need for a motion, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3140.508,3142.665,Then it was unnecessary to withdraw the consent.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3142.665,3147.334,"Well, we wanted to, make it a matter of record that the consent didn't exist."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3147.334,3148.897,"But you didn't sign this, this written consent."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3148.897,3150.489,"No, I signed it, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3156.893,3159.798,"Yes, down at the bottom."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3159.798,3162.452,"We did sign it, Your Honor, the unions did sign that."
1980.79-1236,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.387,3174.807,"Well, there never was any problem about withdrawing consent."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3181.305,3193.236,"We made a... well, at the time that the consent decree was proposed to the district court, there were supporting memoranda filed by the parties in support of the entry of the decree, yes, sir."
1980.79-1236,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.236,3194.924,"But there... was there an oral motion, was there?"
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3196.142,3200.453,"Well, I believe it was posed when we presented it to the district court."
1980.79-1236,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3218.743,3230.175,"--Well, you really... what you're really saying, that you withdraw... you're interested in withdrawing your motion that the consent decree be entered."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3230.175,3231.05,"Well, the two things occurred in such--"
1980.79-1236,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.05,3232.472,But your motion was denied?
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3232.472,3234.862,"--such distant points of time, Your Honor."
1980.79-1236,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3320.062,3321.609,"But Mr. Levit, didn't he tell us why he did so?"
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3326.591,3347.738,"--I think that the reasons that he gave would very well encompass precisely what I'm presenting to you that he felt that it was improper for several reasons that he stated but there's no question that he did review the record, that he did review the extensive discovery involved in the case."
1980.79-1236,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3361.499,3367.512,"Well, but that goes to the merits of whether he acted properly in refusing to enter the decree, it seems to me."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3367.512,3376.119,"Yes, Your Honor, but the point is that the appellate court would have to get involved in the trial process, and the appellate court obviously didn't go through the discovery."
1980.79-1236,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3376.119,3381.1,Anytime you review a complicated matter you have to look at the record.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3381.1,3384.833,"Well, I don't think the appellate court reviewed the discovery in this case."
1980.79-1236,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3399.078,3424.318,"Let me ask you one other question about your point that two years went by after you made your motion, and so that you didn't think it was necessary to allege changed circumstances... if the Court should hold that the order was appealable and sent it back to the Court of Appeals, and if the Court of Appeals should hold that the district court committed error in refusing to enter the decree, I suppose it would have the power to reverse and say the decree should have been entered."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3431.955,3433.674,"Well, Your Honor--"
1980.79-1236,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3433.674,3443.53,"But I suppose the review will take place as of the date that the district judge acted, and he either committed error on that date or he acted properly, one of the two."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3443.53,3450.653,"--I don't think that that's necessarily so, Your Honor, because we can't ignore the terms of the proposed consent decree."
1980.79-1236,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.31,3495.697,"Well, that goes to the merits of whether the district judge should be affirmed or reversed, rather than to whether anything's appealable."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3495.697,3502.617,"--But also, Your Honor, it goes very much to the merits of the proposed decree itself, because the parties weren't getting what they bargained for."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3510.146,3513.52,Are you attacking the consent decree on its merits?
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3513.52,3515.019,--I'm saying that the--
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3515.019,3516.347,The one that you agreed to?
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3516.347,3522.751,--The one that we agreed to we would have been happy with if it had been promptly entered.
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3525.187,3529.593,As of right now you're not quarreling with the merits... with the merits of it?
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3529.593,3532.966,--We're not... what we're saying now is--
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3532.966,3533.653,You did sign it?
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3533.653,3534.699,"--Yes, we did."
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3537.652,3539.573,"You don't want to go behind that now, do you?"
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3539.573,3542.494,We have withdrawn our consent to it.
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3544.837,3546.537,"Well, show me where you withdrew."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3546.537,3550.787,We withdrew when we stated in the motion to the--
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3550.787,3552.254,That you wanted to withdraw it.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3552.254,3553.769,--That we no longer consented.
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3553.769,3559.128,"That's right, and you wanted that to be discussed at the pretrial conference."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3560.595,3562.75,There was no need to discuss it.
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3562.75,3565.795,"Well, why did you ask to do it if you didn't want to do it?"
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3565.795,3572.841,Because we wanted to make it a matter of record that our consent no longer existed on that document.
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3582.492,3584.241,How do we stand now?
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3586.46,3587.74,"Well, we don't--"
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3587.74,3588.99,You're against it now?
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3588.99,3589.645,--Yes.
1980.79-1236,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3591.41,3592.239,You want your signature off of it.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3604.89,3605.483,--That's correct.
1980.79-1236,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3605.483,3613.76,"Well, really none of this goes to the issues before us, which is the appealability of the denial of the entry of the decree."
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3615.714,3616.696,"Well, I think it does."
1980.79-1236,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3619.82,3625.255,"What happened two years later is really not... it hardly bears on that issue, does it?"
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3625.255,3631.003,"--But if there is... I think it does, Your Honor, if there is no existing consent decree, then--"
1980.79-1236,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3631.003,3634.112,There was at the time that it was appealed.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3634.112,3636.392,--But if there isn't one now--
1980.79-1236,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3636.392,3637.157,It's not being appealed.
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3637.157,3639.625,"--If there isn't one now, it's an exercise in futility."
1980.79-1236,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3639.625,3644.123,"So you're really, your argument is really that the case has become moot?"
1980.79-1236,3,31477,jay_j_levit,,3644.123,3644.981,Absolutely.
1980.79-1236,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3648.558,3653.822,"Mr. Williams, do you have anything further?"
1980.79-1236,4,37337,napoleon_b_williams_jr,,3653.822,3656.555,"Yes, sir."
