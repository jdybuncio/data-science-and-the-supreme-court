1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,17.457,20.653,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.805,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,56.196,59.696,"I gather, Mr. Greenberg, when your emphasis is on remedy --"
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,59.696,59.868,Yes.
1967.805,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,59.868,65.447,-- you're suggesting we don't have to decide that this is constitutionally required.
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,65.447,70.558,"Well, it was -- it is perhaps difficult to disentangle the procedure that is required --"
1967.805,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,70.558,72.527,"Well, the principle of desegregation."
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,72.527,73.297,Yes.
1967.805,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,73.297,79.48,But whether or not the Constitution compels a certain way of accomplishing.
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,84.097,85.166,"I -- I might put it that way, yeah."
1967.805,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,85.166,85.974,Is that it?
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,85.974,88.197,"Yes, I might put it that way."
1967.805,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,178.987,186.663,How many -- how many students in each one of the schools?
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,186.663,192.101,The Field complex says the Negro school complex has approximately 500 students.
1967.805,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,200.32,202.089,Probably around 370?
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,202.089,203.911,"It's plus 80 Negro this year, 80 --"
1967.805,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,203.911,205.215,About 80 by?
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,205.215,208.459,"In fact, those facts are in our brief and not in the record."
1967.805,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,208.459,210.668,"In the other school, there are no White children --"
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,210.668,212.945,No White children whatsoever.
1967.805,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,212.945,217.618,"Are there any problems in this case, Mr. Greenberg, of quality of facilities?"
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,217.618,218.205,"Oh, yes."
1967.805,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,226.82,229.432,This is the phase with the difference in salary?
1967.805,0,30616,jack_greenberg,,229.432,234.407,"There's also the difference in teachers' salary, which is explained as they put it on the base of supply and demand."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1236.309,1240.32,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.805,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1538.293,1540.079,What is the population?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1540.079,1541.961,Of the school district?
1967.805,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1541.961,1544.013,"Yeah, the school district or the town."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1545.154,1551.622,"Your Honor, the town is the only incorporated community in a school district."
1967.805,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1572.867,1577.172,How is that divided between the races?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1577.172,1584.323,"Your Honor, there are approximately 66 and two-thirds percent Negroes in the school population, and 33 and one-third percent White."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.83,1594.397,"Mr. Light, are there any White students in Field Elementary School?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1594.397,1596.065,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1596.065,1597.758,Can you give me a reason why.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1597.758,1598.783,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1605.838,1609.465,What could be the reason for that?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1631.177,1640.785,"Your Honor, I hadn't previously been aware that the figures might indicate that there are some disproportionate amounts of money spent on the gymnasium."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1641.439,1646.779,I like to point out to page five of your brief.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1646.779,1652.159,"That gymnasium, I've -- I've been in that facility as I recall."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.069,1661.317,That could have been the reason.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1662.114,1662.526,"No, sir."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1677.86,1678.998,Better than the one?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1678.998,1679.866,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1682.131,1687.023,"But then, why do people have a lawsuit against it?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1687.023,1687.637,Your Honor --
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.637,1689.092,Do you think you're going with them?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1689.092,1689.491,"No, sir."
1967.805,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1699.334,1701.162,Do you have a school bus system?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1701.162,1701.775,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1726.512,1730.242,How large an area is the school district?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1730.242,1736.694,That was the question Mr. Justice Black just asked and I told him I'd have to guess.
1967.805,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1736.694,1743.948,"In square miles, say, from what -- suppose it's in a form of a rectangle, is it, or a square?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1743.948,1750.956,"Your Honor, my recollection is that we've never introduced maps in this litigation of this district."
1967.805,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1772.445,1777.98,"Well, could you tell me how -- what the distance is between the two schools?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1777.98,1778.827,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1780.677,1781.983,Eight to ten blocks between --
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1781.983,1782.499,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1782.499,1784.059,-- those two schools?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1784.059,1788.141,"They are both in the little community, incorporated community of Gould."
1967.805,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1788.141,1793.403,Is the HEW approval of your plan still outstanding?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1794.812,1795.338,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1826.499,1832.438,Was the HEW approval expressed in the form of letter or something of the sort?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1832.438,1834.576,That's my recollection and --
1967.805,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1834.576,1835.169,Is that in the record?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1835.169,1838.617,"This documentation was introduced in the record, Your Honor."
1967.805,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.015,1855.201,But that's in the record that's obliged here with the clerk?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1855.201,1859.98,"Mr. Justice White, I really don't know what came -- what the other side brought up in a way of a record."
1967.805,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1897.494,1905.258,Do these two school complexes have interschool athletics?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1905.258,1908.14,"They -- between themselves, Your Honor?"
1967.805,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1908.14,1909.517,Yes.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1909.517,1911.387,"If they do, I'm not aware of it."
1967.805,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1915.82,1923.71,"I see and but they do -- they do have athletic teams to play other schools, don't they?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,1923.71,1927.39,"Your Honor, there was evidence in the record."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2224.082,2229.765,"Mr. Light, but here you should know as an old Baltimorean, nobody ever knew about it."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2235.223,2245.243,"Your Honor, perhaps the first references that I read, and I don't recall, concerning the Baltimore freedom of choice plan because it was discussed by several of the counsel."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.185,2259.257,"Well, you did have it in Arkansas."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2259.257,2261.552,"I don't know whether we had it in Arkansas, Your Honor."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.552,2262.792,So you didn't have it in Gould?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2262.792,2264.711,"We didn't have it in Gould, Your Honor."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.921,2268.489,You didn't get it until you're up against the wall.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2268.489,2272.441,"Your Honor, we've got it 1965."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2272.441,2276.007,"Well, we'll leave it at 1965."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2285.24,2290.538,"Your Honor, I don't know how you could combine facilities that are eight to ten blocks apart physically."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.861,2296.626,But you could have made one elementary and one high school.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2296.626,2297.019,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2303.329,2311.655,"In 1954 when you built the Field Elementary School, you could have built that around the campus with Gould."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2311.655,2312.81,With Gould?
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2312.81,2313.752,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2313.752,2314.572,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2338.959,2344.691,I assume you have a right to build your school building wherever you want to build them.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2354.902,2360.45,"Your Honor, certainly the proof in the record doesn't support that assumption."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2360.45,2362.438,It's possibility.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2362.438,2364.639,I would certainly concede it's a possibility.
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2365.647,2369.306,And there's one other possibility.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2376.613,2377.258,What really was a --
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.258,2380.358,"If you could put four blocks in either one of them, you'd be in the middle, would you?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2380.358,2391.406,"I suppose that's a possibility. Of course, it's -- as Your Honor knows from the dispute in the prior case when you get into drawing lines, people disagree on whether the line -- where the line should be drawn."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2391.406,2406.297,"But once you draw the line, you could go right down to the middle of the county and detour a penitentiary and set everybody on this side and everybody on this side goes to the other one."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2406.297,2406.769,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2417.102,2424.879,"And finally, once you did that to consider both of them is your school rather than just the Gould school."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2424.879,2431.702,This Board that I represent considered both of the schools now Your Honor.
1967.805,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2760.55,2761.38,Unbelievable.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2805.851,2806.334,"Oh, no sir."
1967.805,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2810.026,2810.708,Yes.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2810.708,2817.171,The motive of the School Board and this has been inquired about before doing the course of these arguments.
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.813,2865.224,How many private schools do you have in your county?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2865.224,2866.841,In -- in that county?
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2866.841,2868.145,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2868.145,2870.061,"None of which I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2870.061,2874.381,"So we don't have to worry about that part, do we?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2874.381,2886.119,"Your Honor, I presume that there are no private schools and in fact, I'm relatively certain from my reading that there are no private schools in Prince Edward County, Virginia until the recent years."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2886.119,2886.734,I understand.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2892.567,2893.98,"Well, Your Honor, I have --"
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2893.98,2898.289,"Well, you don't think that the old county would try to deal with Prince Edward County do you --"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2898.289,2898.774,"No, sir."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2898.774,2901.175,"This Court found that that was wrong, would you?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2901.175,2901.487,"No, sir."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2901.487,2903.485,We wouldn't think of doing that.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2903.485,2910.936,These respondents Your Honor will comply to the extent within their power with whatever order of this Court enter.
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2911.352,2929.705,"Well, look into the future about how long do you think it would take for your county to reach the point where they wouldn't mind the White children attending the school and there's two to one nature -- but how long do you think your county would get around at that point?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2929.705,2946.679,"Your Honor, I'm not clairvoyant not to project that but I imagine that it would largely coincide with the length of time it took the majority of the Negro people in that community to decide that they didn't want to keep their own school and use it as their community center and attend school with members of their own race."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2950.125,2958.395,"Well, doesn't Mr. Arthur Lee Raney -- he isn't not interested and that is --"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2958.395,2968.553,Mr. Arthur Lee Raney is in the Gould school and admitted to the school when he first applied in 1965 and was erroneously listed his plane fair.
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2968.553,2973.15,"But you're not speaking to all the Negroes, are you?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2973.15,2975.885,I'm speaking for all the Negro's in saying what sir?
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2975.885,2980.159,In saying that they want to be themselves in their own little school.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2980.159,2980.738,I'm speaking of all --
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2980.738,2981.996,Then let's all be happy.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2981.996,2987.893,-- I'm speaking of all that are in the field of high school and elementary school in this school district because they've had the --
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.893,2993.115,How many Negroes do you know in that county personally?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,2993.115,2997.261,"Your Honor, it goes out that I have some professional contact with some of the staff."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2997.261,3001.988,How many approximately because you're speaking for all of them.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3001.988,3003.142,That's why I'm not speaking furthermore thinking of --
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3003.142,3006.785,Whom you just said -- I thought you said you're speaking for all of them.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3006.785,3019.397,"And I thought I'd selected the word of, I meant to because I'm sensitive to Mr. Greenberg taking the position that he speaks for all Negro's when I know that he does not and cannot be impossible."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3019.397,3020.641,I'm not talking about Mr. Greenberg.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3033.665,3039.496,I think Mr. Justice Marshall that I respectfully suggest that you've taken some liberty with what I said.
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3052.32,3053.413,How do you know?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3054.713,3055.079,"No, sir."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3055.794,3066.109,"What they first assigned -- the children in Field were first assigned there, weren't they?"
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3066.109,3070.083,"Your Honor, they filled out a child's form to get there."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3077.971,3080.034,And how do they get out?
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3080.034,3081.262,How do they get out?
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3083.366,3085.176,Which they have to have to sign.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3085.176,3086.615,"Well, the parents in some instances, the child --"
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3086.615,3088.764,That's what I mean but it's up to them.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3090.255,3094.705,"If -- that's right, simply signing in there, Your Honor."
1967.805,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3094.705,3097.649,They have to make the move.
1967.805,1,39731,robert_v_light,,3097.649,3107.417,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1967.805,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3107.417,3114.398,Mr. Claiborne.
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3114.398,3118.654,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.805,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.122,3381.323,What if -- what if old fashioned neighborhood zoning produced no integration at all or perhaps the segregation where it was.
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3381.323,3385.968,"That seems to us, Mr. Justice White, presents a quite different problem."
1967.805,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3580.673,3591.352,"Well here, the result of the free choice -- so-called free choice is to place any Negro in a White school, isn't that right?"
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3591.352,3595.057,"In one of these -- in one of these cases, yes."
1967.805,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3595.057,3607.555,"So that's in the Raney cases, I understand that there's about 20% of the Negroes who are in the White school, is that right?"
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3609.339,3613.25,The figures are from 80% to 85% who are --
1967.805,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3613.25,3620.041,So that they become -- I gather that the system did accomplish that much.
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3628.222,3630.931,It did accomplish that much.
1967.805,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3630.931,3637.96,"Now, it left the Negro school all Negroes as I understand it."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3661.158,3664.799,"Mr. Justice Fortas, we are not playing a game of statistics sir."
1967.805,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3664.799,3668.0,"Well, I wonder if -- that's what I'm trying to find out."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3682.295,3686.728,Certainly it is relevant to what results are achieved.
1967.805,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3707.613,3713.282,"Well, what I'm asking Mr. Claiborne, how do you test the adequacy of the result?"
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3743.905,3747.74,"That figure alone will not find meaningless, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.805,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3768.731,3786.075,"Now, tell me in Raney or you could take one of these other cases that's easier for you, what -- the alternative method might be that seems feasible and which would produce a different result."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3786.075,3788.593,"Well, in the Gould case --"
1967.805,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3788.593,3789.706,In which one?
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3789.706,3839.115,"I take it Raney as the Gould case number 805, Gould, Arkansas, either of the two methods already mentioned, one would be drawing a geographical line down in the middle as Mr. Justice Marshall put it four blocks from each of the schools right down the middle of separating this district into two zones and assigning of the students on the basis of geography or alternatively qince this is a system with so few students, one would suppose that economic and educational considerations would normally leave the school district if race were not involved to consolidate or pay and have one of the buildings used for the high school and the other use for the elementary school for every one in the district."
1967.805,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3861.231,3890.508,"What you're really saying is that this -- if I understand it is for the standard of compliance with Brown in a previously segregation school district, should be whether of the alternatives reasonably available, that alternative was adopted which would result of the maximum desegregation."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3890.508,3899.012,"I don't think I have to go even that far Mr. Justice Fortas because here, it's not, these are not equal alternatives."
1967.805,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3957.011,3974.483,"The result in each of these cases unless I'm mistaken, the net result is that every White student in each of these three cases goes to a school where there are some Negro students."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3974.483,3975.231,I'm not sure that's true.
1967.805,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3975.231,3985.414,"But I think -- alright, but you tell me if I'm wrong but about that in each of the three cases."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3991.924,3998.903,That in each case -- so 80% to 85% of the Negroes go to schools in which they are the White --
1967.805,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3998.903,4001.649,Every White student goes to an integrated school I believe --
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4001.649,4002.914,"I submit, there maybe --"
1967.805,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4002.914,4004.662,-- first in my case and the --
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4004.662,4007.02,-- integrated in a token sense.
1967.805,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4007.02,4017.842,"Well, in some of the cases more than a token sense, I would say as far to your definition of token, 30% but moreover --"
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4017.842,4030.696,"Now, let me point out that this free choice which is spoken of as though we were asking that the Negroes and the Whites be denied."
1967.805,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4122.323,4141.343,"Well to say that both are to favor that you assume that if the -- if some alternative plan were adopted, you can either say the Whites would not move out or if they would, it's wholly irrelevant to the question, wholly irrelevant."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4141.343,4156.504,"I have to say first Mr. Justice White that that frightening prospect which is always put forward in these cases, tends to argue against any desegregation."
1967.805,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4156.504,4163.395,"I understand that but you say that that is a matter of fact, you dispute it."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4163.395,4169.402,"Well, I have no basis on which to dispute whether in this particular school district it would or would not happen."
1967.805,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4169.402,4171.975,"If you accepted it, would you say it's irrelevant?"
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4171.975,4174.848,I would say it were irrelevant even if it works.
1967.805,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4217.728,4218.993,"Mr. Claiborne, may I ask."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4246.004,4263.345,"I -- as to the first, it is I suggest, Mr. Justice Brennan, that there is no basis on which -- and there is no occasion for a remand to reconsider the propriety of freedom of choice in those two districts nor of the free transfer --"
1967.805,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4263.345,4266.007,"Yeah, I understood that and you want us to decide that --"
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4266.007,4282.562,"What as to wait what -- what final solution ought to be adopted whether geographic zoning or pairing a consolidation as to that matter, I would think it would be in the first instance a matter for the District Court or perhaps the School Board --"
1967.805,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4282.562,4287.665,"Well, then I'm wrong in reading your brief that's suggesting that we should prescribe."
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4287.665,4292.143,I do think this Court should condemn freedom of choice as an alternative --
1967.805,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4292.143,4295.127,This is on the premise that we did but then what do we do?
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4301.6,4304.964,"Well, I don't know that there are any but those two."
1967.805,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4307.032,4308.236,"Well, then what do you want us to do?"
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4309.844,4315.021,With all those two that is pairing and geographic zoning.
1967.805,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4318.514,4337.55,"But are you -- what you do supposedly appropriate for this Court to say that these two it appears on this record would be satisfactory as a remedy but you go ahead in District Court and choose between them, limiting the District Court to the choice between the two?"
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4337.55,4347.75,I would leave it perhaps a bit more open and if the District Court could device some plan which I haven't thought of which might --
1967.805,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4347.75,4352.547,"Well, don't you think it's singularly inappropriate for us to talk and prescribe these schools?"
1967.805,2,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,4352.547,4360.129,I don't suggest that this Court ought to prescribe the précised plan which any given district ought to apply.
1967.805,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4600.12,4600.994,Mr. Light.
1967.805,3,39731,robert_v_light,,4600.994,4603.687,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.805,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4727.844,4731.237,Do you have any residential segregation in Gould?
1967.805,3,39731,robert_v_light,,4733.492,4734.147,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4734.758,4739.404,The White and colored children play together?
1967.805,3,39731,robert_v_light,,4750.506,4754.312,"Your Honor, I couldn't attest to it or challenge it."
1967.805,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4760.167,4764.519,You have never seen White and colored kids playing together in that county?
1967.805,3,39731,robert_v_light,,4764.519,4773.85,I have not but my occasion to be in Gould which is some 70 miles perhaps from Little Rock would not be frequent enough to make me a reliable observer.
1967.805,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4773.85,4778.122,"Well, have you seen White and colored kids playing in Little Rock?"
1967.805,3,39731,robert_v_light,,4778.122,4780.326,White and Negro children playing in Little Rock?
1967.805,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4780.326,4780.844,Right.
1967.805,3,39731,robert_v_light,,4780.844,4783.517,On the school grounds of our desegregated schools that's a common --
1967.805,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4783.517,4786.761,"I mean the streets, the nearby place where they live."
1967.805,3,39731,robert_v_light,,4797.746,4801.777,"Your Honor, I'm not a psychiatrist or a sociologist."
1967.805,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4801.777,4810.772,I'm not an expert on that but we do know that there is tension and we've seen it and you see it in the daily newspapers the other day and where they got it?
1967.805,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5022.339,5025.255,Mr. Greenberg.
1967.805,4,30616,jack_greenberg,,5025.255,5026.993,I believe that Mr. Gray is going to --
1967.805,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5026.993,5027.86,Oh!
1967.805,4,30616,jack_greenberg,,5028.188,5029.433,"Your Honor, he's going to --"
1967.805,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5029.433,5033.694,I beg your pardon.
1967.805,5,23976,frederick_t_gray,,5033.694,5042.412,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.805,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5106.866,5125.145,"Well, I thought from the California case, the Act simply said that everyone could lease or sell or not lease or not sell to anyone of his choice for any reason."
1967.805,5,23976,frederick_t_gray,,5125.145,5125.577,"Yes, sir."
1967.805,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5151.112,5165.504,But you're assuming of course that there are no subtleties in the situation or no community attitudes or anything of that kind that would deter a person from having a free choice.
1967.805,5,23976,frederick_t_gray,,5165.504,5185.14,"I am assuming that in my case because in my case sir, the record says, they have an unrestricted freedom of choice and I was delighted that you Mr. Justice Marshall point out that there really isn't the hostility, that the children play together and go every thing together, that's not really the hostility that was suppose."
1967.805,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5195.555,5206.911,"Where is the fact, the decision that there are children are made on the basis of the racial composition of the school."
1967.805,5,23976,frederick_t_gray,,5206.911,5208.129,"In some, yes."
1967.805,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5208.129,5209.041,Wouldn't you suppose that to be true?
1967.805,5,23976,frederick_t_gray,,5209.041,5211.235,"In some ways, I think that is true."
1967.805,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5212.377,5222.292,"And -- and so the state is saying that if he wants to choose based on racial considerations, go ahead and do it."
1967.805,5,23976,frederick_t_gray,,5222.292,5224.291,"Any basis, choose on any basis."
1967.805,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5224.291,5225.303,Including of race.
1967.805,5,23976,frederick_t_gray,,5225.303,5227.565,Any basis.
1967.805,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5301.569,5336.481,"Well, isn't it true that what you really say is that if a White child wants to -- White parents who want to send their children to the Negro school, he has a perfect right to make that choice and send this child to that school, the Negro school and then come home and take his chances with his neighbors and this employer -- and this employer --"
1967.805,5,23976,frederick_t_gray,,5336.481,5340.924,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I have to say if I'm trying a lawsuit, I have to try it on my record."
1967.805,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5583.488,5587.396,Mr. Rice.
1967.805,6,40305,russell_rice,,5587.396,5590.416,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.805,6,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5813.807,5819.095,Mr. Greenberg.
1967.805,7,30616,jack_greenberg,,5819.095,5820.534,May it please the Court.
1967.805,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5901.423,5903.397,"Last, that happen with the book?"
1967.805,7,30616,jack_greenberg,,5903.397,5907.21,"Well, no."
1967.805,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5917.339,5919.589,You might not have written it.
1967.805,7,30616,jack_greenberg,,5919.589,5921.256,I might not have written that section of the book.
