2018.17-9572,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.48,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 17-9572, Flowers versus Mississippi. Ms. Johnson."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,8.48,34.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The only plausible interpretation of all of the evidence viewed cumulatively is that Doug Evans began jury selection in Flowers VI with an unconstitutional end in mind, to seat as few African American jurors as he could. The numbers alone are striking."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,102.68,109.8,"The history of the case prior to this trial is very troubling, and you've summarized that."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,141.52,156.24,"The evidence still is clear and convincing that Mr. Evans acted with discriminatory motivation in this case, even if we set aside his history and his -- the reasons that he was unwilling to tell the truth in previous cases."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,156.24,171.16,"I mean, if we look at -- at the jurors in question one by one, there are aspects that I think would cause any prosecutor anywhere to want to get that jury -- that juror off the jury."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,206.88,233.24,"This Court has demanded a sensitive inquiry into all of the circumstances that prove racial discrimination. And, again, even setting aside his history, there are many circumstances here that suggest racial -- racial motivation. First, as I already said, there is an extraordinary record of disparate questioning. And the disparate questioning is not limited to those numbers but to the tone of his questioning."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,266.64,298.68,"But what -- what's wrong with that? Again, putting aside the reasons to be suspicious, if a juror says, I don't -- I didn't work -- I don't work closely with the defendant's sister, I don't work close to the defendant's sister, and the prosecutor has reason to suspect that's not true, is there something wrong with the prosecutor going to the human relations person at that place of employment and bringing that person in to testify they actually work nine to ten inches apart? Is something wrong with that?"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,298.68,303.2,There's nothing wrong with that if there was reason to disbelieve the juror.
2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,334.24,334.68,Wait.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,334.68,337.24,-- and a rich prosecutor might investigate all --
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,337.24,338.6,What is your strongest --
2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,338.6,343.76,"Did he -- did he have that witness ready that same day, or did --"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,343.76,345.76,"No, he brought the witness back the next day."
2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,345.76,346.72,"The next day, okay."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,346.72,348.48,What is your strongest strike?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,348.48,361.64,"I -- I think the most -- the clearest case is that of Carolyn Wright. Carolyn Wright -- about Carolyn Wright, he made three false statements."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,365.12,373.92,"Well, actually, we have found that, in the record with a state exhibit on it, a judgment that shows that her wages were garnished."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,373.92,385.36,"No, the wages -- there's a mark that shows that there was such a request, but both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme Court looked at that record and found that her wages had not been garnished."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,385.48,386.68,"Well, we can look at that."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,398.92,400.04,Correct.
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,400.04,402.16,And the store -- the store sued her?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,402.16,404.36,"Well, the store sued her."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,405.76,407.12,"Well, but the store did."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,407.12,409.48,It's the son-in-law later that sued her.
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,409.48,412.88,"But, normally, wouldn't that -- you know, again, put aside the history."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,428.12,440.6,"I think that if this prosecutor had pursued bias with respect to white jurors as well as African American jurors, and then made that strike, then that would be a strike that would be a permissible strike."
2018.17-9572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.24,475.88,Wasn't there a question asked of the entire array of whether they had any debts to the -- to the store?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,475.88,502.0,"Yes, but there was no question asked about suits or disputes with other -- with the other three victims, nor was there an inquiry into bias that I think any rational prosecutor would have made if concerned, truly, about bias, which was lawsuits, prosecutions of the jurors and their close relatives by his office. The prosecutor made no inquiry about that."
2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,505.88,510.96,Did he even ask Ms. Wright how she felt about that suit and whether it would affect her in this case?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,510.96,513.04,"In fact, she was asked about the suit."
2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,548.76,565.96,"Can you go back, and -- and just slow down a second? You said to Justice Alito that that record in -- that state record that says something about garnishment, that the state courts found that that was not adequate. Could you explain why not?"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,565.96,566.36,Well --
2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,566.36,568.32,"That judgment in the record, what is it or --"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,568.32,569.0,The judgment --
2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,569.0,572.16,"-- that -- it's not a -- it's a form in the record, but what does it mean?"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,572.16,576.52,"The form in the record reflects a suit, and there's a little check by garnishment."
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,589.0,593.76,"What if -- what if it turned out there were a garnishment? How would that affect your argument, if at all?"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,593.76,599.44,"Well -- well, then that would mean that he only made two false statements about Juror Wright."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,646.08,651.12,Didn't Juror Burnside also say repeatedly she didn't want to judge anybody?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,651.12,653.44,"No, she did not -- oh, Juror Burnside said --"
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,653.44,653.8,Yes.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,653.8,655.52,-- that she did not want to judge anyone.
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,657.6,667.2,And you think that's not a legitimate reason for -- for striking a juror who's going to have to judge whether someone who's accused of a serious crime is guilty or not?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,667.2,672.84,"That is a legitimate reason for striking a judge -- I'm sorry, for striking a juror. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,672.84,696.32,"But the problem -- the problem isn't whether the reason is a legitimate reason but whether the reason was pretext. And when we look at what he did with respect to citing the relationship having been sued by the Tardys, it looks like everything he's saying is pretext. And if I could also go back to the rest of your question about Juror Wright."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,723.48,726.6,But isn't it true she also worked with the defendant's father?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,726.6,730.84,"She worked in the same location as the defendant's father, but --"
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,730.84,731.92,"She worked in the same store, right?"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,731.92,732.6,She worked in the same store.
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,732.6,733.64,At the world's smallest Walmart.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,733.64,734.92,That's what the --
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,734.92,735.72,That's what they said.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,735.72,738.36,-- that's what the trial court described it as.
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,746.64,748.76,"Yeah, but did she still work there?"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,748.76,749.96,She did.
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,749.96,751.04,I thought she had left?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,751.04,757.36,"No, that's another juror with respect to -- I believe with respect to Cora Flowers."
2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,763.4,766.84,Compare her with Pamela Chesteen.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,771.04,800.44,"I was about to do that. And so I think that it's true that working with someone under some circumstances might produce bias. It is interesting that the only thing she said that might suggest the closeness of the relationship is that she didn't know whether he still worked, and the -- and Evans did not ask about the closeness of the relationship. Nor did he worry about the closeness of the relationship with Juror Chesteen and four or I think it's maybe even five of Flowers' family members."
2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,808.08,810.08,She said that she knew the father as well.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,810.08,815.88,"Yes, she knew the father and the mother and two sisters and a brother. And Doug Evans --"
2018.17-9572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,815.88,817.28,But isn't --
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,817.28,818.76,-- was not interested in pursuing --
2018.17-9572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,818.76,834.76,-- isn't that -- that relationship of a bank teller to someone who comes to make a deposit different from someone who is a coworker and it would encounter someone in the work set -- setting on a daily basis?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,834.76,839.24,It is a different relationship or it could be a very different relationship.
2018.17-9572,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,861.72,881.76,"All the -- all the -- the questions that we've been addressing here are the same sort of questions you would get in a typical Batson case, looking at the circumstances of the potential jurors that were struck in this case. But, I mean, of course, as -- as my colleagues have recognized, the case is unusual because you have the extensive history."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,914.64,921.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I say one thing about Carolyn Wright that I don't want to forget?"
2018.17-9572,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,921.44,921.8,Sure.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,921.8,937.52,"The other thing that's noteworthy about her is that she put on her death penalty questionnaire that she was strongly in favor of the death penalty. So, when we look at her as a whole, a -- a -- a prosecutor who was looking in a colorblind way would have been attracted to her."
2018.17-9572,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,937.52,938.28,Now for my question?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,938.28,939.48,But now -- now for your question.
2018.17-9572,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,950.44,960.8,"No, no, I know it's -- you're -- you're fighting the hypothetical. My question is 30 years, a Batson violation 20 years ago, is that pertinent to the consideration in the current case?"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,960.8,963.8,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question then."
2018.17-9572,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,991.28,991.64,Well --
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,991.64,1002.28,"So someone who violates Batson before it's announced or someone who violates Batson immediately thereafter, that's less probative than someone who has done so repeatedly."
2018.17-9572,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1002.28,1010.88,"So -- so what is -- what is the rule you would have us adopt as a general rule, not just in a particular case as extreme as this one?"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1010.88,1022.96,"The general rule is a rule that you have already adopted, which is that, in Stage 3, every factor that bears upon credibility is relevant. So that's the general rule."
2018.17-9572,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1043.28,1044.92,Even --
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1044.92,1045.92,Go ahead.
2018.17-9572,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1046.48,1048.4,"No, you go first. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1048.4,1049.76,"All right, all right."
2018.17-9572,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1049.76,1050.64,Justice Gorsuch.
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1050.64,1051.0,All right.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1078.84,1081.24,If there weren't eight misrepresentations of fact --
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1081.24,1081.6,Right.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1081.6,1082.36,-- disparate questioning --
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1082.36,1082.68,"Right, right."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1082.68,1083.36,-- all that stuff --
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1083.36,1083.76,Right.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1085.12,1086.4,-- and there's only the history --
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1086.4,1086.64,"Yeah, yeah."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1095.88,1096.48,And there were no other --
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1096.48,1098.96,-- yet we have this prosecutor with this history.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1102.52,1112.28,"If there are no other indicia of discrimination, then the defendant has not met his burden of proof by proving prior discrimination."
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1112.28,1112.56,Okay.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1116.64,1117.16,Yes.
2018.17-9572,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1117.16,1117.32,Okay.
2018.17-9572,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1119.72,1122.12,My question was about the history.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1146.04,1149.08,"I think that's entirely correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1173.52,1174.76,The court -- the court --
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1174.76,1176.32,"-- the broader point, that everything --"
2018.17-9572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.32,1179.64,-- the court said it took account of the history.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1183.88,1188.8,"Well, if there were -- if the court had taken account of its -- of the history, it couldn't have come to this conclusion."
2018.17-9572,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1266.88,1267.64,Ms. Johnson --
2018.17-9572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1267.64,1273.84,"You say your strongest case is Juror, potential juror, Wright."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1289.6,1291.04,That's correct.
2018.17-9572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1291.04,1291.28,Yes.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1291.28,1301.16,"But I think, you know, it is -- actually, the relevance of the disparate questioning is not merely to ask how many questions this juror was asked."
2018.17-9572,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1335.56,1342.88,"Ms. Johnson, some time ago Justice Alito asked you about the prosecutor's investigation of certain potential jurors."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1349.32,1349.92,Three.
2018.17-9572,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1349.92,1352.12,And all African American?
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1352.12,1353.56,All of them were African American.
2018.17-9572,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1367.52,1374.32,And can I ask you about the disparate questioning? Because you referred to something which struck me when -- as I read through all of this.
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1417.64,1424.28,"The Mississippi Supreme Court said that it accounted for some of the differential questioning, and I think that's correct."
2018.17-9572,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1445.76,1460.92,"Such -- when you say ""such relationships,"" were they relationships because of working at the same place or living in the same neighborhood, in the case of the white jurors?"
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1460.92,1485.96,"They were -- none of the relationships were working at the same place. But when -- when he was asked -- when -- when they were asked in group voir dire about whom they knew, white jurors responded that they knew defense witnesses, and they were not questioned about those witnesses. So we can't really know what the nature of those relationships are if we don't ask questions."
2018.17-9572,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1485.96,1489.64,Do you -- do you have those names or is -- is that in your brief someplace? I don't remember.

2018.17-9572,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1494.2,1511.84,"I found it strange, but maybe you can -- or unusual, I should say, not strange -- unusual that there were some white jurors who had people accused of crimes in jail, relatives accused of crimes in jails."
2018.17-9572,0,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,1515.88,1523.36,"No, there were no questions about that at all of three of them and I think a very brief question about -- for two of them."
2018.17-9572,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1551.12,1554.64,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1554.64,1584.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The history in this case is troubling, but the history is confined to this case, and, as Mr. Chief Justice pointed out, it is unusual. There are -- this is the sixth trial in this small town, a small town of approximately 5,000 individuals."
2018.17-9572,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1622.2,1623.04,Could I just ask --
2018.17-9572,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1623.04,1623.44,We can't be --
2018.17-9572,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1623.44,1641.28,"-- a question of the Mississippi law? Could the attorney general have said, you know, enough already, we're going to send one of our own people to try this case, preferably in a different county, where so many people don't know so many other people? Could he have done that?"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1641.28,1647.92,"Statutorily, the Attorney General's Office is allowed to assist, is allowed to take over, but only upon request by that district attorney."
2018.17-9572,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1650.84,1653.76,You -- you said if -- if we take the history out of the case.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1655.56,1658.8,"No, Justice Kavanaugh. I'm not saying that's what I'm saying exactly happened --"
2018.17-9572,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1658.8,1665.76,"It was 42 -- 42 potential African American Americans and 41 are stricken, right?"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1665.76,1666.92,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
2018.17-9572,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1666.92,1669.08,"We have to -- that's relevant, correct?"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1669.08,1671.76,"That is relevant, yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1677.88,1688.72,So you agree that it's not only the adjudicated Batson violations that are relevant but also the number of strikes such as Justice Kavanaugh listed?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1688.72,1693.08,I do with qualification. There -- the strikes were unique.
2018.17-9572,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1717.28,1752.88,"You have a very strange position on potential jurors who lied because there was the case of white juror, Huggins, who said he had no knowledge of the Flowers case when, in fact, he was on a 2007 voir dire panel. And you say: Oh, well, that doesn't matter that -- that he lied because he didn't admit to lying. I think if someone lied and didn't admit to it, that would be a count against that person, rather than in that person's favor."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1752.88,1782.0,"And -- and the trial court in this case made the distinction that the juror who was struck for lying on her questionnaire admitted on the stand that she lied intentionally, which was not the case with Juror Huggins. And it would seem, it appeared, that he -- his participation in the panel, and he was dismissed long before he got anywhere near selection, that he either forgot that or it completely left his mind at the time he was initially questioned."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1782.0,1785.52,But let's go back to that.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1813.0,1827.8,"Again, Justice Sotomayor, the -- the issue as it reads from the record is that the juror who lied on her questionnaire expressly admitted that she lied for the sole purpose of getting off the jury."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1827.8,1828.32,Well --
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1828.32,1829.88,And -- and that doesn't --
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1829.88,1846.04,"-- I have to tell you, if that were the case, I -- I don't think one could take one juror and not push them on those questionnaires and come up to an intentional understatement or overstatement."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,1846.04,1856.08,"Again, Your Honor, that was -- and this is one of the issues with this case, is that each one of these strikes that we have, we don't have one single reason."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1857.04,1857.4,That --
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1857.4,1857.88,All right.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2005.6,2010.52,"Juror 14, Carolyn Wright, was struck because she was sued by Tardy."
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2010.52,2012.16,Yeah.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2012.16,2019.24,"Juror 14, Carolyn Wright, worked with the defendant's father, Archie, at Walmart."
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.24,2020.0,Yep.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2020.0,2021.04,The distinction would be the --
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.04,2021.92,"Wait, wait."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2035.76,2044.44,"Wright's relationship with the father was a work relationship, an employee/employee relationship."
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2054.52,2057.04,"In other words, it was closer, the first relationship?"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2057.04,2058.16,"Well, the --"
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.16,2065.2,And the record when I read that will bear out that the first one really was a closer relation than seeing them every week or whatever as a bank teller.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2065.2,2066.24,"Well, the record --"
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2066.24,2076.6,"Will -- will it say that? I don't think it will because I think they said, well, how closely physically did you work with the -- the father? And there was no answer to that question."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2076.6,2083.44,The -- the record will bear out that the district attorney only struck those individuals that worked with members of his family.
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.72,2086.0,Okay.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2119.16,2124.88,"Again, Justice Breyer, I would also say that one of the differing things was that she was sued by Tardy."
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2124.88,2125.16,Yes.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2125.16,2126.68,Which was a theme with at least one other --
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.68,2127.12,Right.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2146.6,2151.96,"I think that's enough, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2151.96,2152.08,"I mean, in many --"
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2152.08,2153.68,"Well, I do too. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-9572,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2153.68,2154.32,Is there any --
2018.17-9572,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2154.32,2160.84,"-- in many respects, Mr. Davis, Ms. Wright is a -- is a perfect juror for a prosecutor."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2180.4,2189.88,Not if she works with the defendant's family and not if she was sued by the workplace of one of the victims.
2018.17-9572,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2192.56,2192.84,Counsel --
2018.17-9572,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2192.84,2208.64,"I don't want to imply, I'm sorry, that you have directed me to the two relevant parts of the record, and before I make up my mind definitely, I will read those two relevant parts, both sides. Okay?"
2018.17-9572,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2208.64,2212.8,"Again -- counsel, again, we're sort of conducting this as if it were one -- one case."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2227.72,2228.36,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2247.48,2256.88,But my point is do you -- is there anything in our precedent that suggests that there ought to be a limitation on looking to the history of the prosecutor involved?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2256.88,2260.24,There's no limitation on the history.
2018.17-9572,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2280.16,2321.52,"And -- and along those lines, Justice Breyer's pointed out a dichotomy that in other circumstances might be explicable by an innocent reason. But, if all of the history is relevant, as you acknowledged, how -- does that -- what light does that shed on what otherwise might appear to be an innocent strike? And when -- when should -- what rule would you lay down -- I know that's hard to do, but we're presumably taking cases to guide future disputes, not just to resolve this one. How -- how would you -- how would you write that rule as to the relevance of the past information with -- when we're looking at the current trial?"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2321.52,2347.08,"In responding to that, Your Honor, let me say that when we use the word ""history,"" we are limiting it to this case, this district attorney and his over 25 years of experience, having searched for additional cases and no cases cited by the Petitioner, outside of this case, in regards to a Batson violation. So the history is limited here."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2365.52,2381.52,Is it just the specter of the two violations? Weren't there two cases that were overturned or -- in which prosecutorial misconduct -- at least the first was overturned on prosecutorial misconduct. They didn't even reach the Batson challenge.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2381.52,2381.84,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2381.84,2396.12,"But doesn't that tell you something about this man's passion for this case? I -- I don't even need to call it anything else, but doesn't that tell you how you should be looking at this case?"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2396.12,2399.32,"I -- I can't speak to his passion for the case, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2408.8,2416.68,"But he didn't -- I understand he didn't ask the attorney general to step in, which he could have, to prosecute the case."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2427.96,2429.32,"That's my understanding, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2429.32,2431.4,So he could try the case?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2431.4,2436.72,"Well, try the case outside of Montgomery County."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2436.72,2439.84,Instead of getting the attorney general to try the case?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2439.84,2441.44,And -- and I would again reiterate --
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2441.44,2443.08,In his own county?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2443.08,2443.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2455.48,2456.4,In Batson --
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2456.4,2458.28,-- said you can't do that.
2018.17-9572,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2458.28,2485.84,"Sorry, in Batson, we held that a prosecutor cannot state merely that he challenged jurors in the defendant's case -- of the defendant's race on the assumption or his intuitive judgment that they would be partial to the defendant because of their shared race. That was really the critical sentence in Batson, and the dissent disagreed with that. The critical change."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2515.48,2536.84,"I respectfully, in this case, in no way agree that there was some prior determination made by the district attorney that -- that because of this person's race, they were not going to be favorable. Again, this case has spanned some 23 years now in this small community."
2018.17-9572,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2538.12,2539.84,But I -- I guess I don't understand how you can say this.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2544.32,2545.68,Two.
2018.17-9572,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2545.68,2549.32,"Okay, two. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2549.32,2549.56,Two.
2018.17-9572,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2608.4,2609.12,Did we have some --
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2609.12,2610.84,"I'm sorry, counsel, did you just --"
2018.17-9572,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2610.84,2613.16,-- couldn't we say of this -- go ahead.
2018.17-9572,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2613.16,2613.76,Justice Sotomayor.
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2613.76,2620.76,Did you just say that the same judge who tried the fifth trial also tried the sixth -- the sixth trial?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2620.76,2622.04,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2622.04,2630.0,And wasn't he the judge that ordered Mr. Evans to prosecute the sole holdout juror in the fifth trial?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2630.0,2631.08,There --
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2631.08,2633.84,And didn't Mr. Evans do that?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2633.84,2634.68,There --
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2634.68,2640.28,And the attorney general take over the case and say there was no basis for that prosecution?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2640.28,2646.68,There were two jurors that were bound over to the grand jury on the basis of perjury.
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2657.36,2663.48,But I think the attorney general nolle-prossed it because there was no basis for that prosecution.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2663.48,2666.48,I don't know that there was not a basis.
2018.17-9572,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2668.84,2670.28,May -- may I ask you about --
2018.17-9572,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2670.28,2694.84,"Well, could we say in -- in this case, because of the unusual and really disturbing history, this case just could not have been tried this sixth time by the same prosecutor? That he -- that he just cannot -- in light of the history, you just can't untangle what happened before from the particular strikes in this case?"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2694.84,2696.92,"But, again, Your Honor, you know, hindsight is 20/20."
2018.17-9572,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2739.72,2753.08,"But what -- well, how closely did he look? I mean, let's talk -- talk just about the questioning in this case. The numbers themselves are staggering, the number of questions that were asked to African Americans versus whites."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2824.76,2831.8,I think the questions that the district attorney asked were a direct result of those responses these particular jurors provided in general voir dire.
2018.17-9572,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2832.52,2842.2,"Well, I think what I'm saying is it's not two jurors, one white, one black, says, I have reservations about the death penalty, and he says to the white one: But you could follow the law."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2846.04,2853.88,"Respectfully, Your Honor, that's not the case as I read the record."
2018.17-9572,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2944.72,2959.08,But there were no questions of white jurors who said they had a relationship with defense witnesses.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2966.0,2975.72,"The only -- to my recollection, Justice Ginsburg, is Pamela Chesteen, who indicated that she knew Flowers' family but only because she was a bank teller and she'd seen them come in."
2018.17-9572,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2977.44,2981.76,But we didn't -- we don't know what the relationship of the others were because they weren't asked.
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,2990.36,2991.4,"I -- I'm sorry, I misunderstood."
2018.17-9572,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3029.36,3035.68,"Well, the -- part of Batson was about confidence of the community and the fairness of the criminal justice system, right?"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,3035.68,3037.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.17-9572,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3037.28,3073.64,"And that was against a backdrop of a lot of decades of all-white juries convicting black defendants. Swain said let's put a stop to that but really didn't give the tools for eradicating discrimination, so you had another 21 years of that, until Batson. And then Batson said: We're going to give you the tools to eradicate that so that the -- not just for the fairness to the defendant and to the juror, but that the community has confidence in the fairness of the system. And can you say, as you sit here today, confidently you have confidence in the -- how this all transpired in this case?"
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,3073.64,3076.2,"I have confidence in this record, Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.17-9572,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3096.6,3098.76,Thank you.
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3098.76,3104.4,Do you have confidence in how this case was prosecuted?
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,3104.4,3107.44,"Based on this record, yes, Your Honor, I do."
2018.17-9572,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3107.44,3132.92,"You know, I -- one of the first things I did when I found this case was to try to do some research because at least my former state prosecutor's office would have substituted attorneys long before the fifth, sixth trial. Regrettably, I don't -- wasn't able to find any formalized guidance on that."
2018.17-9572,1,63112,jason_davis,,3144.4,3166.48,"And, again, I would agree completely, Justice Sotomayor, that we have an unusual circumstance, an unusual case with these six trials having been all tried by the same prosecutor. But I would resubmit, again, that the decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court in this instance was not violative of Batson and its progeny. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."

2018.17-9572,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3175.64,3183.88,"Ms. Johnson, did you -- would you be kind enough to tell me whether or not you exercised any peremptories?"
2018.17-9572,2,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,3183.88,3185.4,I was not the trial lawyer.
2018.17-9572,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3185.4,3190.24,"Well, did your -- were any peremptories exercised by the defendant?"
2018.17-9572,2,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,3190.24,3191.4,They were.
2018.17-9572,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3191.4,3195.76,And what was the race of the jurors struck there?
2018.17-9572,2,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,3195.76,3205.12,She only exercised peremptories against white jurors. But I would add that the motive -- her motivation is not the question here.
2018.17-9572,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3208.04,3213.92,She didn't have any black jurors to exercise peremptories against -- except the first one?
2018.17-9572,2,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,3213.92,3214.72,Except the first one.
2018.17-9572,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3214.72,3217.76,"But so did the prosecutor, except that one?"
2018.17-9572,2,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,3217.76,3218.2,Correct.
2018.17-9572,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3218.2,3223.28,"After that, every black juror that was available on the panel was struck --"
2018.17-9572,2,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,3223.28,3223.96,Yes.
2018.17-9572,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3223.96,3224.16,-- by --
2018.17-9572,2,63111,sheri_lynn_johnson,,3224.16,3251.68,"He struck one -- he seated one African American juror, and at the very end struck one white juror. When all of the evidence in this case is considered, just as in Foster versus Chapman, the conclusion that race was a substantial part of Evans' motivation is inescapable, and the Mississippi Supreme Court's conclusion to the contrary is clearly erroneous."
