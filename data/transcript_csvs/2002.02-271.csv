2002.02-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.619,"We'll hear argument next in Number 02-271, the Dow Chemical Company v. Daniel Raymond Stephenson."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,74.94,78.475,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.731,203.981,"What about notice, notice to these respondents?"
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,220.404,234.673,"Well, Justice O'Connor, notice in this case... I think as the case comes to this Court, the Court certainly cannot decide this case on the principle that the notice was constitutionally inadequate."
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.072,318.807,"Mr. Waxman, I'd like to stop you right there, exposure itself has been said to be injurious."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,371.781,383.262,"--Justice Ginsburg, before I answer that, let me just give one more answer to Justice O'Connor, and I'll directly address your question."
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,425.533,430.778,"I'd like to ask you later how that comports with, what is it, Eisen and Jacquelin."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,447.264,447.579,--Well--
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.579,458.118,"--that this Court has said, under the common law, people who were merely exposed, who do not have a current injury, don't have any claims."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,462.604,473.311,"--Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, as you pointed out, the Metro North case, a) long post dated the final judgment in this case, and--"
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,473.311,474.864,But it purported to apply traditional common law.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,474.864,484.156,"--No, I do understand that, and it was looking to traditional common law in order to make a ruling with respect to the FELA."
2002.02-271,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,545.024,558.492,"But were they plainly included within the class, so that the class representatives would have known that they were supposed to represent these people, and as I understand it... maybe you could go to... go to this point."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,599.409,602.863,"--Well, there... I believe there are at least two separate questions--"
2002.02-271,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,602.863,603.436,There are.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,603.436,606.708,--and I'll deal with the respondents in this case first.
2002.02-271,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.758,644.447,"Well, are you saying that even though the notice was improper, since they didn't see any notice at all, they can't complain about it?"
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,644.447,645.267,--Not at all.
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,659.911,660.675,Mr.--
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,660.675,665.343,--to say that we have... Mullane requires that the content of the notice be adequate as well as the--
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.343,667.879,--Actual notice isn't required when you don't know the people.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,693.036,713.055,"--Justice Ginsburg, this point, and indeed most, if not all of the points that the respondents are making in this collateral litigation, were made by my clients in the direct proceedings before Judge Weinstein and in the mandamus petition that went up to the Second Circuit from his class certification decision."
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.067,726.39,"Mr.... Mr. Waxman, that's--"
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,726.39,727.731,--that there was not such a list.
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,727.731,736.831,"--Mr. Waxman, that's well and good that your clients, the defendants in this case did that, but here we have a class of people, potential plaintiffs."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,750.744,753.026,Asymptomatic?
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.026,754.486,"--Yes, were any of them?"
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,754.486,758.14,"The named representatives were not asymptomatic, and by design."
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.166,819.639,"But when we get past that, Mr. Waxman, adequacy of representation has to exist at all stages of the litigation, and we're getting to the point where there isn't going to be any trial."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,835.217,874.128,"--Justice Ginsburg, the distinction here, even at the distribution phase... and remember, the parties, the plaintiffs' representatives and the plaintiffs' lawyers, recognizing the extreme weakness of their legal claims, however great the pathos was, and genuine anguish that they suffered, that their legal claims were so weak they were willing to settle this case and, on the assumption that Judge Weinstein and the Special Master would allocate the formula, and the... I would say the proof in the pudding is that the named representatives included six veterans."
2002.02-271,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,884.93,886.675,"But they were symptomatic, all of the--"
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,886.675,887.038,--They were all--
2002.02-271,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.038,887.204,--Okay.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,887.204,908.737,"--they were all symptomatic, and our submission here is that, as Judge Weinstein found and the Second Circuit found, in response to precisely these arguments, the pervasive, overwhelming, common weakness that all of the plaintiffs had with respect to the legal issues made the representation of asymptomatic veterans--"
2002.02-271,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,908.737,918.533,"Okay, that's get... all right, let's assume for the sake of argument that gets you to the point of... of the settlement, 200, whatever it was, 200 million is fine."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,972.384,988.777,"--Justice Souter, I... I do at some point want to argue to the Court why we think that de novo relitigation of adequacy is not appropriate on collateral review, but even if it were, I believe I have a satisfactory answer to your question."
2002.02-271,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1007.543,1012.644,"Individual veterans were heard, but they weren't representatives, and the court wasn't a representative."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1012.644,1013.544,"--That, to be sure."
2002.02-271,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1056.88,1057.636,"Okay, why didn't it?"
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1057.874,1058.543,"--Okay, for several reasons."
2002.02-271,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1128.108,1146.929,"--No, but I'm posing the question, as at the point... at the point at which the settlement proceeds are being divided, as between those who will get something and those who will get nothing, and so I'm saying, why was there no distinction between them, for our purposes, at that point?"
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1146.929,1185.581,"--I think that there... there... Judge Weinstein recognized, and several people who appeared before him and provided testimony, written and oral testimony in the fairness hearings, in the distribution hearings, in the motion for reconsideration, and written objections, and a motion to certify a class, made him very aware that, and he himself was aware from reading the literature, that the latency period for many diseases is as long as 40 years, and there would be claims that would come up long into the future that some people would attribute to exposure to Agent Orange, and what he did was, he said, I will--"
2002.02-271,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1185.581,1192.143,Then why... why was none of the money held over for such late-blooming claims?
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1192.143,1201.891,"--Well, what Judge Weinstein found, and what... the Second Circuit on appeal insisted that the settlement fund be entirely disposed of within the period."
2002.02-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.004,1270.528,Mr.--
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1270.528,1272.674,As to the other... as to the... pardon me.
2002.02-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.674,1286.273,"--Mr. Waxman, your time is drawing to a close, and you've said a couple of times you think that the standard on collateral review should be much different than on direct review of a class action settlement."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1289.888,1291.02,"Yes, I could."
2002.02-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.764,1293.825,Sure.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1293.825,1294.382,--and I will.
2002.02-271,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1418.847,1419.42,Why?
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1419.42,1420.368,--finality and reliance interests--
2002.02-271,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.368,1426.035,"I mean, suppose I agree with you that notice has nothing to do with this case."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1467.845,1468.557,"--Well, the--"
2002.02-271,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1468.557,1481.474,"Now, to know whether they're right or wrong about that, I guess I have to read 500,000 pages of this settlement hearing and find out everything about this case in order to decide whether they're right or wrong--"
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1481.474,1481.726,--Well--
2002.02-271,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1481.726,1483.305,--about their ultimate judgement.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1484.365,1486.926,"--Justice Breyer, first of all the Second Circuit did not do that."
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1506.963,1508.694,There's one thing--
2002.02-271,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1508.694,1515.224,"--It has to be... I think the answer to my question has to be, is just tell the Second Circuit, wait, Amchem's a different thing, go back and do it over."
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1515.224,1516.703,--Our submission that you--
2002.02-271,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.703,1517.443,Is that what you're saying we should do?
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1517.443,1519.174,--Certainly not.
2002.02-271,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1519.174,1520.618,"Well, I mean, if we... if I reject a), if I reject--"
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1520.618,1521.118,Certainly not.
2002.02-271,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1521.118,1521.307,--Right.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1521.307,1525.37,I'm just pointing out that Amchem didn't redetermine adequacy as a factual matter. It concluded that as a matter of law--
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1525.37,1527.38,And it didn't do anything new.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1563.143,1572.117,"--Justice Ginsburg, with respect, we cited in our brief district court decisions in the 1980's that were--"
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1572.117,1573.437,Two district court decisions.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1573.437,1573.768,--And--
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1573.768,1575.043,Not a single court of appeals decision.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1575.043,1614.479,"--Both the Second Circuit in this case and the Ninth Circuit in the Epstein case on which we rely characterized Amchem as heralding a new era, or being a watershed decision, and our submission only is that for purposes of the new rules, doctrine that this Court announced, for example, in Teague v. Lane and following cases, the burden is on the party that seeks to invoke the benefit of a later-decided case to prove that a conscientious court prior to the announcement of the rule would have been, quote, compelled to conclude that futures could not be included in the class."
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1706.301,1708.112,These were all parties who were there.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1725.055,1728.314,"Justice Ginsburg, this is a representative suit."
2002.02-271,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1758.517,1759.788,If the representation is adequate.
2002.02-271,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1759.788,1767.061,"--He has to make the determination that the representation was adequate, and it was made repeatedly and affirmed repeatedly in this case."
2002.02-271,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.681,1770.124,"Very well, Mr. Waxman."
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1772.087,1775.083,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1802.987,1808.331,"Here, so may I ask you just kind of a preliminary question about the Isaacson case?"
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1827.614,1832.428,"--Mr. Isaacson's here, so I wanted to say that, but I think we do a remand."
2002.02-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1832.428,1833.823,I think you have to.
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1833.823,1834.128,Yes.
2002.02-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1834.128,1835.252,In light of that case.
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1835.252,1836.256,"In light of Syngenta, yes."
2002.02-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.256,1838.311,It was a state court matter.
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1838.311,1841.419,"In fact, it is exactly what we argued at the time--"
2002.02-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1841.419,1842.0,Yes.
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1842.0,1842.924,--when it was being removed.
2002.02-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1842.924,1843.417,Yes.
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1844.166,1846.818,So I will just address Mr.--
2002.02-271,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.615,1848.659,"Yes, okay."
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1848.659,1855.576,"Now, Mr. Stephenson is not here to contest whether the overall settlement is fair or not."
2002.02-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.364,1971.029,"Mr. Smoger, supposing this is back in 1984, when the judgment is about to be entered, and the Dow says in effect, you know, we think you really have a lousy claim on the merits, but we're willing to pay $200 million if we... we know that this will be the last of it."
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1976.131,1978.07,--1996 and 1998.
2002.02-271,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.07,1979.412,1996 and 1998.
2002.02-271,1,26162,gerson_h_smoger,,1992.227,2010.002,"Well, let's say, if the goal is the ability to have unexposed people, people that have absolutely no disease, to somehow take care of them, even in Amchem and Ortiz there were certain back-end opt-out rights that were insufficient."
2002.02-271,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3160.856,3168.816,"Justice O'Connor, the... the Isaacson case can't just be remanded, because we assert jurisdiction under 1442."
2002.02-271,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3202.28,3203.979,I still want to know what to do with this case.
2002.02-271,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3206.445,3209.709,--I... we think that you should reverse the judgment--
2002.02-271,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3209.709,3214.411,"I mean, he's not bound, Stephenson isn't bound by some other person raising that, but it's stare decisis, like--"
2002.02-271,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3214.411,3215.455,--He is indeed bound--
2002.02-271,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3215.455,3215.712,--Because?
2002.02-271,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3215.712,3224.985,"--by the final judgment in this case both because he was adequately represented, and a determination after a full consideration was made."
2002.02-271,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3269.51,3270.715,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
