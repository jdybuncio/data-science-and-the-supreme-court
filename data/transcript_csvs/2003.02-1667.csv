2003.02-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.142,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-1667, Tennessee v. George Lane."
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,8.711,12.509,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1667,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,108.157,132.221,"Let's assume that the... that the state... and it's just an assumption... would concede that sovereign immunity could be abrogated insofar as access to courthouses for handicapped people, so that Congress could have drafted a congruent and proportional statute."
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,154.347,162.603,Your Honor's question focuses on a debate that we really haven't engaged in.
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.192,264.195,"Mr. Moore, does Tennessee provide any cause of action for the alleged violations here, the lack of access to the courthouse?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,264.195,268.569,No private right of action under our State Public Buildings Act.
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.024,282.77,"So you're satisfied that under Tennessee law, there would be no monetary relief available?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,282.77,284.812,I think that is... I think that is right.
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.812,294.287,And would there be any enforcement action at all available to compel under Tennessee law the courthouses to be accessible?
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,294.287,305.145,"No, Your Honor, because under Tennessee law, the... the injunction to build fully accessible buildings applies to buildings constructed after the enactment of the Public Buildings Act in 1970."
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,332.349,348.286,"Well, do you take the position that Title II, even if this Court were to find monetary damages are not available, is there a way to enforce Title II by the Federal Government against the State of Tennessee?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,348.286,356.581,"Yes, Your Honor, there is, in an enforcement action by the United States, injunctive relief and monetary damages would be available against the state."
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.946,358.689,Under what power?
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,363.518,364.754,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,364.754,366.695,--for enactment of this provision.
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,369.091,369.75,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.75,374.951,"And you think it would survive the Commerce Clause challenge, do you, as applied to states?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,374.951,379.675,"Your... Your Honor, of course, this... this case doesn't present that question."
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,379.675,380.047,Right.
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,380.047,380.213,But--
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.213,380.956,But I'm asking.
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,380.956,384.011,--But we have not challenged and do not question Congress'--
2003.02-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.011,385.786,"Other states have though, have they not?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,385.786,389.834,"--I... it's my understanding that that claim has been raised in certain lower Federal courts, yes."
2003.02-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,389.834,392.352,How about an action under Ex parte Young--
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,392.352,393.467,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.467,396.689,"--against a state official, not for money damages, but for compliance?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,396.689,397.636,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,397.636,403.969,"Well, I can understand that if the state official was standing at the door saying, no, you cannot bring a wheelchair in here."
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,415.181,419.889,"Well, of course, Your Honor, Title II doesn't really apply to buildings."
2003.02-1667,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,423.687,433.385,"Well, if the... if the activity... the... the conduct of... of the business of courts is taking place in a courthouse, I think that gets us to focus on the building, doesn't it?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,433.385,454.645,"--But so long as the... so long as the court in question offers the service in... in a... in another venue, for example, as occurred in this case, Mr.... at every step of Mr. Lane's interaction with the Polk County criminal court, an accommodation was offered to him, albeit it was rejected."
2003.02-1667,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,454.645,459.02,"So they're... they're saying, look, you... you could have an Ex parte order... Young order... saying hold court on the first floor."
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,461.127,461.749,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,478.429,485.981,"But I... I take it your position would be that under Ex parte Young, a court could not say to a state official, build an elevator?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,485.981,502.949,"--Well, I think courts have wide discretion to fashion injunctive relief in Ex parte Young actions, and if, in a particular circumstance, that were the only reasonable way of delivering the service, I... I think that would be inappropriate."
2003.02-1667,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,502.949,505.467,"So you would as... as a last ditch, you would concede that?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,505.467,506.293,Yes.
2003.02-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,519.296,522.268,"But that would still be Commerce Clause-based, right?"
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,527.498,528.956,"--That would be true, Your Honor, yes."
2003.02-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,528.956,541.177,"And there is something strange about that, given that it was Congress' purpose to enable people to exercise the rights... the full rights of citizenship."
2003.02-1667,0,36328,michael_e_moore,,551.784,556.242,"I think it fits quite comfortably under... under the Commerce Clause, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,580.574,582.786,"Well, what about the... that's what I want to get to."
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,1589.598,1600.372,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.198,1630.427,"When you say, Mr. Brown, as applied to the case that's before the Court, you're suggesting that it can be kind of sliced up and just, say, address courthouses?"
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,1630.427,1638.804,"Your Honor, please, I think the history that this Court has used in the past is to focus on the case and the circumstance and the issue that's before the Court."
2003.02-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.263,1650.239,"Well, but in... in our other cases dealing with Congress' section 5 power, I don't think we've taken that position."
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,1685.7,1699.818,"Respectfully, Chief Justice, the way that I took Boerne was that this Court made a direct statement to Congress that they had overstepped their bounds in interpreting the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment and its applications."
2003.02-1667,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.824,1737.591,The legislation doesn't deal with that constitutional right.
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,1811.728,1819.984,"Justice Scalia, respectfully, Congress does not have a real good record of writing memorandum opinions."
2003.02-1667,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1844.133,1859.161,"Mr. Brown, are you saying that these... what fits within this statute would independently violate the Constitution, and all that the statute does is provide, in this case, a damage remedy?"
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,1859.161,1860.73,I think it does.
2003.02-1667,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1860.73,1868.82,"So that in... in all the cases that would fit under this legislation, someone could come in, say, and seek injunctive relief--"
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,1868.82,1871.337,"Well, absolutely."
2003.02-1667,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1871.337,1873.772,--for a violation of a constitutional right?
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,1873.772,1878.024,"Well, the beauty of Title II is that we don't have to chase all those rapids."
2003.02-1667,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1903.825,1927.231,"But let's take, say, it's a... it's a seat in... in a public stadium, which is also covered, or a theater, and it's inaccessible to certain people with disabilities, would that be a violation of the Constitution, for which this statute provides a remedy?"
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,1927.231,1934.745,"--It may not provide or deal with a constitutional violation, but it certainly deals with a prophylaxis issue."
2003.02-1667,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1996.705,1997.531,Then... then would you--
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,1997.531,1998.07,That doesn't make any sense.
2003.02-1667,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1998.07,2001.801,--Would you explain to me the difference between your position and the Government's position then?
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2016.729,2026.221,"Your Honor, I represent six people in Tennessee who are trying to get access to the courts of our state."
2003.02-1667,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2049.355,2064.033,"Is... is your argument still that what you are complaining of would independently be a constitutional violation, so that the virtue of this act, in effect, is to provide a remedy, and that's all we need to consider?"
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2064.033,2064.942,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2064.942,2065.313,Okay.
2003.02-1667,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.313,2068.741,"You... we don't have to just say this one individual, do we?"
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2112.225,2117.676,"Let me say, Your Honor, respectfully, I think we do have to establish a category."
2003.02-1667,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.835,2173.526,There has to be an affirmative offer?
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2176.21,2177.863,Your Honor--
2003.02-1667,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2177.863,2183.807,It's a constitutional violation not to offer it as opposed to refuse it when he asks for it?
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2183.807,2185.748,"--Your Honor, please."
2003.02-1667,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.748,2194.004,"I mean, he appears downstairs and... and he sees one of the constables there and says, you know, I can't make it upstairs in my wheelchair, could I have assistance get... getting upstairs?"
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2203.376,2210.518,"I think that it is, Your Honor, because the presumption is that somebody would be there to carry him."
2003.02-1667,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.518,2212.042,I... I don't understand that.
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2214.272,2222.9,"There is no constitutional right... if he doesn't have a constitutional right generally to get there, what gives him the constitutional right to have somebody carry him up there?"
2003.02-1667,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2225.872,2233.962,--He has a constitutional right for the state to provide him the means of being present at his trial.
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2257.368,2260.877,"--His safety, Your Honor, is a critical issue."
2003.02-1667,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2327.342,2346.866,"Probably this is universally accepted what you're saying, and what I wonder is, is why, if you could explain it, what your opponent is saying is that to give people a remedy for the violation of that principle, it is adequate to have the Federal Government bring a lawsuit or they bring an Ex parte Young, et cetera, action."
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2348.89,2354.379,"Your Honor, please, the Federal Government was not there the day George Lane confronted those stairs."
2003.02-1667,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.355,2363.873,Neither was a Federal judge who could hear his lawsuit.
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2363.873,2364.949,And that's why the--
2003.02-1667,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.949,2367.382,"I mean, the Federal Government brings a lawsuit or he brings a lawsuit."
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2367.382,2367.754,--That's--
2003.02-1667,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2367.754,2369.777,Neither one of them is there instanter.
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2369.777,2385.669,"--Respectfully, Your Honor, that is why Title II is there, to make the State of Tennessee anticipate that problem, solve that problem, so our citizens don't have to confront those obstacles and face pain, suffering, and public humiliation as a condition of citizenship."
2003.02-1667,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2402.676,2430.995,"There is a difference, though, if you talk about non-discrimination, say, with respect to race or religion, you... you use the word dignity to say the state has to respect the dignity of every human being, but to respect the dignity of certain people with disability, the state has to do more than not harm them, not discriminate against them."
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2435.742,2445.567,"Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, an elevator to an individual with disabilities is no different than stairs are to me as a person without disabilities."
2003.02-1667,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2472.029,2473.105,That's not the point that I'm making.
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2473.105,2473.598,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2473.598,2486.025,"The point is that sometimes to respect the equal dignity of a person, we have to treat them specially, and I think that that's what the elevator is."
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2491.97,2498.507,"Your Honor, I think the word special accommodation is something that is a problem."
2003.02-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.462,2502.122,"Thank you, Mr. Brown."
2003.02-1667,1,43960,william__j_brown,,2502.122,2502.827,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.827,2506.437,"Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you."
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2506.437,2517.666,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.359,2573.765,"That... that... that's persuasive or not, depending on what was meant by the term discrimination."
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2587.307,2593.417,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think that brings us to the second important distinction between Title I and Title II, which is because--"
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.417,2594.82,"Well, let... let's stay on your first one."
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2605.14,2606.133,"--Well, and... and--"
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.133,2608.195,--which is the premise for this legislation.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2608.195,2626.483,"--And again, Justice Scalia, I think the problem in Garrett, when this Court saw findings of discrimination in an area like employment discrimination, that's governed by rational basis review, then there's very little reason to think that the small ""d"", if you will, discrimination Congress found resulted in unconstitutional discrimination."
2003.02-1667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2651.54,2652.096,Well--
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2652.096,2653.686,"--in the Hibbs case, when--"
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.686,2660.374,"--These two sections... these... these two things were debated and... and passed simultaneously, or at very different times?"
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2660.374,2662.027,--Title I and Title II?
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.027,2662.52,Right.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2662.52,2664.377,They... they passed at the same time.
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2664.377,2670.033,And... and they're... they're using discrimination to use one thing in... in one half and another thing in the other half?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2671.852,2685.06,"I think whatever way they were using discrimination, I think that that finding of discrimination is going to be much more likely to be correlated with actual constitutional violations in an area that implicates fundamental rights."
2003.02-1667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2694.348,2694.564,Okay.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2701.778,2704.007,"--In... in some cases, Mr. Chief--"
2003.02-1667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2704.007,2712.431,How... how many cases do they... do you have where the person was not actually allowed to vote instead of not being facilitated in the ability to vote?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2712.431,2723.659,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say the... the relevant congressional committee heard testimony of individuals that were turned away from the voting place on... on election day, so there is that kind of evidence."
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.374,2728.572,What... what do you mean by turned away?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2730.512,2734.022,"Turned away because there was no elevator, turned away because--"
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2734.022,2735.675,Is... is that a constitutional violation?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2735.675,2740.959,"--If... if the voting official tells the individual, we... you can't vote here, because this--"
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.959,2742.035,He tells them--
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2742.035,2742.695,--this is not accessible--
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.695,2744.674,--we... we don't have an... we don't have an elevator.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2744.674,2745.667,--Right.
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.41,2749.382,"So if you want to get up to vote, you have to find assistance to get up there."
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2758.632,2771.468,"--With respect, I think maybe you'd need to know more, but if the individual in the polling place is turning people away because of their disability and they're not offering, don't worry, we have a school down the road that is accessible, that's not the facts."
2003.02-1667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2777.208,2782.12,How... how many of these instances did Congress find of people who were actually refused the right to vote?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2782.12,2787.406,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there was testimony of individuals, I don't have the exact number, and--"
2003.02-1667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2787.406,2788.808,What... what order of magnitude?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2788.808,2802.759,"--I... I think it was anecdotal evidence, and I would say... I mean, to give you a feel for the... the... the sort of order of magnitude, in the state task force reports that Congress authorized, there were 35 instances of inaccessible voting places."
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.988,2815.186,I don't think it does at all.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2833.102,2844.703,"And again, Justice Scalia, I think that when you couple an inaccessible voting place with local officials who are saying, you can't vote today, we don't have any facilities for you, that does violate the Constitution."
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.703,2848.54,"They're not saying you can't vote, they're saying we don't have facilities for you to get to the voting place."
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2848.54,2852.521,I... I guess I fail to understand the difference in that in a practical way.
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2852.521,2852.877,I do too.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2852.877,2864.189,"And I think this Court has said on a number of occasions, in areas of fundamental rights, it is simply not true that only intentional discrimination of the kind you have in mind would violate the Constitution."
2003.02-1667,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.539,2897.338,I'm not under... I really don't understand one... one argument that's going on.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2908.028,2922.146,"Justice Stevens, I think one example might be enough, especially when coupled by other evidence in the record that is reinforcing and suggestive of the problem, especially when coupled with judicial decisions that we provide in appendix A of our brief."
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2928.09,2938.659,"And solve that problem by requiring access to... to state-owned hockey rinks or any state-owned buildings, whether it's a courthouse or anything else."
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2956.492,2958.555,"That's true, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1667,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2972.384,2972.755,"Well, there... do--"
2003.02-1667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.755,2975.317,--Where there are no conceivable constitutional rights involved.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2975.317,2981.3,"Well, if I could respond to that, I don't think it's that there's no conceivable constitutional rights involved."
2003.02-1667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.129,3009.496,"Well, would it... would it be a violation... a constitutional violation to refuse to afford special access to a hockey rink?"
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3009.496,3018.125,"I... I don't think standing alone, Mr. Chief Justice, it would, and I think I would defend that in part as part of the permissible prophylaxis of the statute."
2003.02-1667,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3019.172,3021.28,This is what I'd like to get at.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3046.254,3047.33,"--Well, I guess--"
2003.02-1667,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3047.33,3048.073,--that you're proposing?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3048.073,3050.302,"--In fairness, Justice O'Connor, it's both."
2003.02-1667,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3068.878,3074.429,"Well, we haven't really done that in other cases of this type, of the sovereign immunity of the states, have we?"
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3074.429,3075.794,"You have not, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-1667,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3075.794,3076.148,No.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3076.148,3083.361,"And we pointed that out, and I think there is some tension between the proportionality and congruence test in this as-applied mode of analysis."
2003.02-1667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3085.369,3090.859,"It was decided maybe 50 years ago, before any of the more recent cases."
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3090.859,3092.799,"--I think that's fair, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3105.225,3114.347,"And I think there's an important relationship between this Court and Raines, because in Raines, this Court in a sense identified a fault line in a statute that was broadly applicable."
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3114.347,3117.281,It applied both to state actors and private individuals.
2003.02-1667,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3146.752,3150.839,"Suppose the state is building a new stadium, a new hockey rink."
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3158.435,3160.953,"I'm not sure that it does, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1667,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3170.984,3179.323,So... so the Government... the Government's position is citizens don't have some rights of access to public facilities as a matter of the Constitution?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3179.323,3184.442,--I think they have... they might have some access under the Constitution and some right.
2003.02-1667,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3193.32,3206.628,"You're... you're saying that if the only public facility without a ramp was a hockey rink, you'd have a tough row to hoe, but if every public facility, courthouses, schools, et cetera, have no ramps, then you've got a broader context and you've got a different argument?"
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3206.628,3207.931,"--That's exactly right, Justice Souter."
2003.02-1667,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3210.698,3212.472,And what is... what is the constitutional right?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3213.465,3217.902,--In... in... in the hockey ring context?
2003.02-1667,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3217.902,3225.127,What is the... what is the basis for the constitutional right that you accepted in your response to your question... in response to Justice Souter's question?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3225.127,3227.235,"Well, I think it would depend on the facility in particular."
2003.02-1667,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3239.745,3248.578,"There's... there's no... there's no greater right to freedom of movement or general... on the part of citizens, freedom of access to all governmental facilities?"
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3248.578,3251.634,--I... I'm not sure that... that this Court has said that yet.
2003.02-1667,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3252.953,3255.721,I'm asking your position whether or not in your view there is such a right.
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3255.721,3261.293,"--It's certainly not one that this Court has ever articulated, and... and... what I would say though is that--"
2003.02-1667,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3261.293,3263.067,So you don't have a position on the point?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3263.067,3266.716,"--I have... it's not... it's not a matter I've really given any thought, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1667,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3403.807,3407.855,Is there a reason why there's a damage remedy in Title II and not in Title III?
2003.02-1667,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3407.855,3410.865,"I think there is, Justice Ginsburg."
2003.02-1667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3425.892,3427.007,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2003.02-1667,3,36328,michael_e_moore,,3429.486,3432.624,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1667,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3533.656,3541.458,"But it begins section 5 by saying, individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion."
2003.02-1667,3,36328,michael_e_moore,,3543.398,3553.241,"Right, but out... of course, outright intentional exclusion is not necessarily unconstitutional either if it is rationally based, with respect to disabled persons."
2003.02-1667,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3556.652,3558.798,What... what's your authority for that proposition?
2003.02-1667,3,36328,michael_e_moore,,3558.798,3561.498,"--The City of Cleburne case, Your Honor."
2003.02-1667,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3589.24,3593.986,May I ask you about the hockey example?
2003.02-1667,3,36328,michael_e_moore,,3607.649,3614.875,"--I... I think so, depending upon if there were other reasons for doing it."
2003.02-1667,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3625.21,3628.454,"Well, supposing the general manager of the hockey team doesn't like handicapped people."
2003.02-1667,3,36328,michael_e_moore,,3629.736,3639.645,--Your... your hypothetical is that the architect expressly designs the building to spite disabled people?
2003.02-1667,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3639.645,3651.739,"No, the... he has two... two plans, one lets them in and one doesn't, and the manager says, oh, we don't want these people, they're too much trouble to handle for the ushers when they get them in their seats and so forth."
2003.02-1667,3,36328,michael_e_moore,,3651.739,3656.652,Your Honor's question posits a rational basis for that decision.
2003.02-1667,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3656.652,3658.51,And that would be a sufficient rational basis in your view?
2003.02-1667,3,36328,michael_e_moore,,3658.51,3661.732,"That... under this Court's minimum rational basis jurisprudence, yes, it would."
2003.02-1667,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3661.732,3665.197,Do you think the Cleburne case was a minimal rational basis case?
2003.02-1667,3,36328,michael_e_moore,,3665.197,3672.793,"I... I know, Your Honor, there... there has been a lot of scholarly debate about that, but as a lawyer for a state, we must take what the Court said at face value."
