1994.93-7407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.527,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-7407, Robert O'Neal v. Fred McAninch, Warden."
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,11.219,17.434,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-7407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.971,81.855,"Well, Chapman, Mr. Wetterer, was on direct appeal."
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,87.088,97.554,"And that was the issue that this Court resolved in the Brecht case, and didn't make a different result by reducing the burden on the State to accommodate the interest of the State in finality, comity, and federalism."
1994.93-7407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.554,108.462,"Well, why shouldn't it also accommodate those interests by saying that the burden is on the petitioner rather than on the State as to, when the thing is equally divided, I guess?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,108.462,114.046,Because the writ would no longer be able to serve the purposes that this Court has placed upon it.
1994.93-7407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.982,147.348,Do you think a lot of cases will be affected by how we decide this question?
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,147.348,163.667,"Under the current case law it indicates that not as many as would under other cases that this Court has decided in habeas corpus, because under habeas corpus law, under Fretwell, the Court is supposed to first determine whether a constitutional violation has been made."
1994.93-7407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,276.772,300.418,"So if you do not prevail in this case, and a court looks at all the evidence and concludes, we're not sure what would have happened, but this had a significant influence on the jury's determination, it was a close case, it was... we just don't know, what result under the standard that you are proposing?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,300.418,306.322,"Under this standard, the Kotteakos standard, the new trial would be granted, because every--"
1994.93-7407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,306.322,310.162,"All right, and what result under the standard that the State and the Government are proposing?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,310.162,313.645,--That that petitioner would remain with loss of life or liberty.
1994.93-7407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,313.645,325.563,"In other words, as you interpret the burden of proof that the Government and the State are arguing for, the petitioner has to show what, that there likely would have been a different result?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,325.563,331.477,"The petitioner must demonstrate that there has been a constitutional violation, and that is a huge hurdle to overcome in Federal habeas."
1994.93-7407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.477,331.967,We know that.
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,338.172,347.899,"Under the State's proposal, the petitioner has to prove that it actually had a substantial and injurious effect upon the verdict, and then besides--"
1994.93-7407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,347.899,351.041,Does that mean it's more likely that not that the verdict would have been different?
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,351.041,361.367,"--It depends upon whether the... would appear that there would be a conflict with Kotteakos, because Kotteakos says if there's grave doubt as to the outcome, then you're supposed to grant relief--"
1994.93-7407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.459,370.724,"Is there grave doubt, in your view, if the judge looks at the case and he or she says, I just can't tell?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,370.724,373.595,That's grave doubt under the Kotteakos standard.
1994.93-7407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.104,390.147,And you think that a grant of the writ would be consistent with the Government's position to the standard in the case that we've just put?
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,393.838,395.109,The Government standard does not--
1994.93-7407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,395.109,395.971,--the writ is granted?
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,395.971,397.742,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,397.742,400.964,Even under the Government's standard the writ is granted if there's grave doubt?
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,400.964,402.125,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,421.247,428.993,"When you use the term, grave doubt, though, you're not talking about the constitutional violation, but grave doubt as to whether there was any prejudice."
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,428.993,430.402,"Grave doubt as to prejudice, yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,498.078,505.062,"Mr. Wetterer, I guess habeas corpus is a civil action, is it not?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,505.062,508.624,This Court has traditionally relied on it as a quasi-civil action.
1994.93-7407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.624,520.393,"I thought we had indicated that it is civil, and certainly the longstanding rule is that the plaintiff in a civil case has the burden of proof of all elements."
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,520.393,522.113,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,537.965,550.433,But presumably the prisoner in a habeas action still has to prove that the prisoner is being held in custody in violation of the Constitution.
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,550.433,559.466,This Court has set the Kotteakos standard for the determination of whether custody is the... whether or not a violation has occurred.
1994.93-7407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,599.854,607.899,"Well, the habeas petitioner has to satisfy the court that there was a constitutional violation, doesn't he?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,607.899,608.23,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,608.23,617.096,"So that certainly accords with the normal civil presumption, that he's the plaintiff, and he's got to carry the burden of proof."
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,617.096,626.532,"But in a non... but you're never going to have, in a civil case, Your Honor, a situation where you have a plaintiff proving that the State has violated his constitutional rights."
1994.93-7407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.014,631.665,"Well, how about a 1983 action?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,639.149,645.793,"--In those civil actions, because they're going for monetary damage, they're not deprived of their life or liberty as a result of State action."
1994.93-7407,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,645.793,650.917,"Well, that may be true, but in most, in a civil case, once it's over, it's over."
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,666.807,674.962,"Because, Your Honor, Mr. O'Neal didn't... isn't... Mr. O'Neal was found to have a constitutional violation at his trial."
1994.93-7407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,703.623,722.403,"Is it your position that the substantive standard that you get out of Kotteakos makes the linkage question a matter of affirmative defense, if we take the civil case model, that your burden is to show the constitutional violation?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,726.698,727.987,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,744.56,765.781,"But if showing substantial likelihood of contributing to the conviction... my question is, if you take the civil case model, is that showing an element of your case, or is it more properly regarded as an affirmative defense on the part of the State?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,765.781,773.598,"Yes, Your Honor, it's more of an affirmative defense on the State to avoid the actions of the... for the prior conduct."
1994.93-7407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,773.598,797.693,"Do I understand you, I guess going back to your answer to the question by Justice Kennedy, that you regard the issue in this case as being both about the burden of proof and the quantum of proof, or do you, on the other hand, say the only thing that is before us is the question of who has the burden, and the quantum of what would be necessary to carry that burden is a separate issue for a separate case?"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,797.693,801.336,"This Court has already determined the quantum of proof under Kotteakos, by--"
1994.93-7407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,801.336,803.579,"In other words, the substantial contribution is in fact--"
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,803.579,803.807,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
1994.93-7407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,803.807,804.848,--a statement of quantum of proof.
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,804.848,808.772,--We are not here to attack that position.
1994.93-7407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,814.195,814.616,Okay.
1994.93-7407,0,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,814.616,828.725,"--and is inconsistent with the Kotteakos standard and the lower case standards, and that the court has already accommodated the interests of the State by reducing the standard for collateral review, and that is not being challenged by Mr. O'Neal."
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1078.96,1087.114,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-7407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.242,1170.889,"May I ask you if this was your view prior to the decision in Brecht, because it was a civil proceeding the harmless error inquiry burden was on the petitioner?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1170.889,1180.334,"Your Honor, I think that prior to Brecht the general understanding, and I guess the Court said in Brecht it had not yet confronted it specifically, was that the Chapman standard would be applied in these cases."
1994.93-7407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.334,1185.179,"But under the Chapman standard, who had the burden, in a habeas corpus civil proceeding?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1185.179,1191.754,"Well, the Chapman standard, I believe, Your Honor, was a criminal law formulation, which said that the State must show beyond a reasonable doubt."
1994.93-7407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.663,1193.364,I understand.
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1196.596,1197.157,"--Yes, sir."
1994.93-7407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.157,1201.829,But it had been applied by a number of courts in the habeas context before Brecht.
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1201.829,1203.582,I believe--
1994.93-7407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.582,1209.452,"At that time, when that standard was being applied in the civil proceeding, under your view, who had the burden?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1209.452,1215.806,"--Because this Court specifically stated under the Chapman standard that the State had the burden, the State did have the burden at that time."
1994.93-7407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.806,1217.168,Even though it was a civil proceeding.
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1217.168,1220.67,"Yes, although that's not consistent with the general tenor of civil proceedings."
1994.93-7407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1241.064,1251.541,"But yet when Chapman was carried over to a civil proceeding, a habeas proceeding, it was assumed that the distribution of the persuasion burden would be the same."
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1251.541,1273.348,"--Yes, but Your Honor, I think when this Court in Brecht specifically confronted the issue and said that the Chapman approach is not appropriate on collateral review, it was setting aside the Chapman approach, which was a criminal law formulation that the State must show beyond a reasonable doubt, and instead was returning to this Court's traditional habeas principles as stated in cases like Adams, where Justice Frankfurter for the Court said that it is not asking for too much if the--"
1994.93-7407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1273.348,1279.949,"It was also picking up a standard from the criminal context... just as Chapman came from the criminal context, so did Kotteakos."
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1279.949,1280.731,"--Yes, but--"
1994.93-7407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1280.731,1290.147,"So why wouldn't it follow that then you take the standard from the criminal context, and you also take the allocation of burdens?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1302.446,1327.831,"--Because I think that with Chapman the Court carried in a criminal law formulation, and I think that the Court's application of Kotteakos both before and since, Palmer v. Hoffman, McDonough Power, is that in a civil proceeding the party seeking to set aside the judgment must bear the burden of showing that the error actually affected the result in the case such as to influence its substantial rights, and that's the appropriate formulation, we believe, in this case."
1994.93-7407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1459.396,1460.237,"Well, why shouldn't we--"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1463.089,1464.531,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1466.292,1482.931,"So that, in the hypothetical I put to petitioner's counsel, where the judge is just in doubt, we assume a constitutional error, let's say an un-Mirandized statement is introduced, it's a very close case, I just don't know, petitioner loses, correct?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1482.931,1491.817,"--I think that that is... yes, and I think that that is the only posture that's consistent with the presumption of finality that this Court has stressed attaches in habeas cases."
1994.93-7407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1509.979,1513.663,How do you go about making that determination in a really close case?
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1522.047,1527.3,"I think that in these cases, in every case, the petitioner attempts to show constitutional error."
1994.93-7407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1531.495,1534.106,"Well, we're assuming they show a constitutional error."
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1534.106,1534.366,--I understand.
1994.93-7407,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.729,1604.942,"Mr. Cordray, let me ask you the same question that I asked petitioner's counsel."
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1637.503,1643.427,"We would agree with the Solicitor General, though we don't have any statistical analysis, this would be a narrow class of cases."
1994.93-7407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.211,1664.932,We have... let me just cut you off for just a second there.
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1677.681,1683.044,"Your Honor, I think our authority for that is the tenor of this Court's habeas jurisprudence dating back to Adams."
1994.93-7407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.044,1683.953,"Well, do you have a specific case on the point?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1683.953,1698.055,"Dating back to Adams v. United States, and also the Court's Brecht decision itself, that where you have error, you don't know what effect it has on the jury's verdict until a showing is made, and the Court said it must be a substantial injurious effect, and petitioner must make that showing to show that--"
1994.93-7407,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1698.055,1709.412,"You don't have a case that says, in effect, what you've been saying, that even though there's been constitutional error in arriving at a judgment, the presumption nevertheless remains that the judgment should stand?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1709.412,1735.959,"--We think that all of the cases this Court has decided on habeas... Granberry v. Greer, which is an exhaustion case, procedural default cases, abuse of the writ cases, and all of those cases, there are allegations and perhaps identification of error, but to the point is that the petitioner must make the showings necessary to justify relief, to show a causal link between the error and the jury's verdict, such that we now can know with some assurance that the custody here is actually in violation of the Constitution of the United States."
1994.93-7407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.959,1740.741,Does this apply even to what we have called in some of our cases structural error?
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1740.741,1741.863,"No, it does not."
1994.93-7407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1771.192,1774.434,"On direct review the standard would remain Chapman, right?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1774.434,1774.905,"Yes, it would."
1994.93-7407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1774.905,1779.507,"And there was no such application of Chapman here in the State court, right?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1779.507,1780.479,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.479,1782.259,Does that make no difference at all?
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1792.557,1800.48,"I think it raises, Your Honor, a separate question, and this question was raised in the petition for certiorari here as question 1, and it's a question that some of the courts have wrestled with."
1994.93-7407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1828.528,1833.983,--That would remain an open question however we decide this allocation of the burden of persuasion?
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1833.983,1837.215,"I think that's right, because the Court denied review on that question."
1994.93-7407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1843.417,1875.331,"If we rule your way, could a sound argument be made in direct review Chapman cases that the burden should, in fact, be in that case on the appellant, because although you... I mean, you have de novo review of the strictly legal issue, the question of prejudice is not that kind of an issue, and why shouldn't, if we go your way here, why shouldn't the appellants likewise have the burden to prove that in fact there was actual prejudice?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1875.331,1876.88,"I think here are two reasons, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1885.355,1894.902,"Well, except that it... you say it's a direct continuation, but the parties don't stand in the same relation to each other in terms of their obligations to go forward."
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1907.331,1911.262,"--I think those observations are correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1921.789,1925.343,That's kind of... isn't that sort of begging the question?
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1935.568,1943.075,"I think that, as Your Honor indicates, that is a separate question as to whether Chapman is an appropriate standard on direct review."
1994.93-7407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1980.148,1985.121,"So you really think that probably the strongest answer, then, to my question is one of statutory interpretation."
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,1985.121,1998.84,"--I think that the Court... my sense would be the Court would consider that it has directly considered the Chapman standard on direct review of criminal cases, and considers that to be the correct approach."
1994.93-7407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.84,2030.841,"I thought your answer to that was that in direct review the question is whether the conviction was proper, whereas on collateral review the question is whether the individual is being held in violation of the Federal Constitution, and if the latter is true, only where he makes a showing not only that there was a mistake in the conviction, but also when he makes a showing that that mistake led to his incarceration."
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2034.204,2036.345,"I agree, and those are the things I'm trying to say, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.345,2037.616,It's the habeas statute that makes the difference.
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2037.616,2040.527,"Yes, I agree, and I'm trying to articulate that."
1994.93-7407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2040.527,2057.719,"Well, are you then saying it's... basically it's a question of statutory construction, that so far as the so-called policy arguments might go, you could make just as strong an argument for placing the burden on the appellant under Chapman as you can for placing the burden on the petitioner here under Kotteakos?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2057.719,2067.186,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because the policy arguments, or the fundamental touchstone interest this Court has stressed applying collateral review of on habeas proceedings are distinct."
1994.93-7407,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.943,2101.026,"Mr. Cordray, you don't have much time left, and I wanted to ask a different sort of question."
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2109.171,2110.173,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2188.154,2200.43,"Mr. Cordray, if the petitioner were to prevail here, would there be a significant practical effect on the work load of the State prosecutors in defending against habeas applications?"
1994.93-7407,1,38933,richard_a_cordray,,2200.43,2212.639,"I don't think that the allocation of the burden would affect the work load one way or the other, because both parties always have every incentive to present their best arguments as to whether there is error, and as to whether that error actually had an effect on the jury's verdict."
1994.93-7407,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.539,2227.93,I assume--
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2233.252,2243.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-7407,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2301.187,2306.111,Do you agree that the practical consequences of a decision one way or another are slight?
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2316.107,2322.0,"Yes, I would agree with that, if what you're talking about is the number of cases that are likely to be affected."
1994.93-7407,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2394.219,2401.034,But isn't it odd to extract a burden of proof rule from a statute that doesn't even tell us what the substantive standard is in this?
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2401.034,2410.878,"--I wouldn't... what I would extract from that is simply that the claim that the habeas petitioner must make out is that he's in custody in violation of the Constitution, and that it is an element of that claim."
1994.93-7407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.327,2439.927,"Of course, you could really run the same argument on direct appeal, too, I suppose."
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2465.165,2466.177,I suppose you could.
1994.93-7407,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2564.572,2576.439,"Well, wouldn't it be affected to this extent, that if you take seriously the language about looking at the entire record and weighing it against the entire record, that somebody has to decide whether it's worth the judge's time to say, let's look at the whole record in this case?"
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2586.605,2592.629,"--Well, as I understand the question, if you're referring to a burden of production, it's not really the question that we've addressed."
1994.93-7407,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.67,2607.178,"Well, that's right."
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2618.477,2628.523,"--Well, I don't... I think if the Government approaches the case and finds that an error has been committed, I don't think it should ask the court to conduct a harmless error analysis unless it can conclude that that analysis--"
1994.93-7407,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.523,2633.816,But you're saying the plaintiff in every case should ask the judge to conduct a harmless error... to be sure he is... that it's not harmless.
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2633.816,2634.216,--I think--
1994.93-7407,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.216,2639.859,Your view would require the judge in every case to read the record and conduct harmless error review.
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2639.859,2646.905,"--I think if the petitioner... I think if the petitioner views... thinks that that's a sound claim that he ought to be making, that I think... yeah, I think--"
1994.93-7407,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.905,2648.915,"Well, but I mean, he's going to have to do it in every case."
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2648.915,2649.546,--I think that's right.
1994.93-7407,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2653.219,2668.269,"I understand why, but I think there is a very significant difference in work load on the court on which view one takes, because if the Government doesn't think it's... thinks it's close enough so they're probably not going to prevail on harmless error, they just don't ask the judge to read the record, but the petitioner would always have to ask him to do it."
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2668.269,2680.057,"I think ordinarily, once there's been a final conviction that's been affirmed and you're on habeas, ordinarily the Government will take the position that that conviction is valid and will litigate the harmless error issue if there's a good reason to litigate it."
1994.93-7407,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2680.057,2690.873,"Well, of course, no... I take it that the trial court also has the option to say... to address the constitutional issue first and say there's no constitutional violation, in which case he doesn't have to read the record at all."
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2690.873,2691.795,"Right, I agree."
1994.93-7407,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2700.27,2706.804,"And I should think if there is a constitutional violation, then he's going to have to read the record, and one party or the other has the burden to persuade."
1994.93-7407,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2706.804,2707.574,That's right.
1994.93-7407,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2777.071,2779.412,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,2782.223,2784.556,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-7407,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2990.27,2995.203,Why would ruling in favor of the State here complicate the task of the district courts?
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,2995.203,3005.771,"--Because every petitioner after this case would have to plead fact specifics in the record to demonstrate why this error had an impact, how it was substantially egregious, besides alleging his constitutional violation."
1994.93-7407,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3012.784,3017.378,But isn't the Government going to be doing that on the other side if the burden of proof is placed otherwise?
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3017.378,3018.329,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3037.01,3047.837,"There was some... before Brecht, there was some form of harmless error applied in habeas corpus, but you say... but that was never taken into consideration in the drafting of the petition."
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3047.837,3057.433,"--Unless it was an issue in which it was overwhelmingly a stupid issue raised by the petitioner and a claim that wouldn't affect the case, then the courts would not issue a show cause order."
1994.93-7407,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3073.124,3081.33,"Why wouldn't the court first look at the merits of the constitutional claim, particularly if it's as difficult as you say to look into the harmless error aspect?"
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3081.33,3089.585,"Your Honor, it should, and that's what this Court said under Lockhart v. Fretwell, that those are two separate issues, constitutional claim, and whether or not there's--"
1994.93-7407,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3089.585,3102.804,"Yes, but you're trying to show that the district court's task will be tremendously complicated if we don't rule in your favor, and you're saying, because they're going to have to immediately look to see whether there was any effect of the alleged constitutional error."
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3109.229,3111.469,--It would become part and parcel of the constitutional claim.
1994.93-7407,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3111.469,3116.222,"It's still... however we decide this, it's part and parcel of the constitutional question."
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3125.519,3139.318,"It's part of the determination of whether to grant relief, but if the court does not find a constitutional violation, regardless of reviewing the record, if he looks at the violation and says, this does not violate the Constitution, then he doesn't have to get to the constitutional issue."
1994.93-7407,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3139.318,3144.271,"He can do that under, however we rule in this case, it seems to me, the judge."
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3144.271,3147.313,"We would respectfully disagree on that point, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3147.313,3154.547,"Well, your point is that he has to make it as part of his petition, and they may not even call for a rule to show... they may not issue a rule to show cause."
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3154.547,3155.388,"Correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.388,3160.521,"Whereas, if you take the other view, at least he can issue the rule to show cause, and then they bring in the harmless error inquiry."
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3160.521,3168.007,"The Court can focus on just whether or not a constitutional claim has arisen at that point, and that makes it a lot simpler process."
1994.93-7407,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.007,3169.377,And therefore whether it calls for a response from the other--
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3169.377,3169.698,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7407,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3169.698,3172.91,--I suppose all you're saying is that the petitions will be bigger.
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3175.08,3182.416,"The work of the courts will be... will have to deal with harmless error at all levels, and the work of the lower courts would be--"
1994.93-7407,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3182.416,3183.427,We're back where we're started.
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3187.459,3190.26,--That's what we would like this Court to say.
1994.93-7407,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3246.39,3255.783,You mean your client affirmatively wants to be tried again as opposed to having the charges against him simply dismissed for failure to produce witnesses?
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3255.783,3256.874,That's what he's told me.
1994.93-7407,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.035,3261.258,I hope you--
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3262.899,3267.193,"We were granted... Your Honor, I was granted a writ by the district court."
1994.93-7407,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3297.14,3311.222,"Do I understand that your main complaint is that the courts will say, never mind there was a constitutional violation, we won't bother with that, we'll see if you've proved a connection, if you haven't proved a connection, we'll never get to the constitutional violation, instead of the other way around?"
1994.93-7407,3,43460,thomas_r_wetterer_jr,,3313.292,3319.326,"--Basically, Your Honor, because the petitioner always shows a nexus by his constitutional claim with the case in order to grant the show cause order."
1994.93-7407,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3364.337,3366.007,"Thank you, Mr. Wetterer."
