2011.11-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.289,"We will hear argument next today in Case 11-713, Perry v. Perez and the consolidated cases."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,11.339,14.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,47.129,54.218,"Mr. Clement, section 5 says you can't draw new maps unless they have been precleared."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,55.468,56.42,But--
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,56.42,60.289,So the only thing that exists is old maps until you get the preclearance.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,75.481,87.439,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, obviously section 5 is clear that the new map drawn by the Texas legislature, the new maps drawn by the Texas legislature, cannot take effect of their own force."
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,107.519,109.804,But you are asking for more than for guidance.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,118.827,119.827,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,119.827,125.647,"Instead of starting, as the court below did, with the old map which had been approved."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,125.647,126.397,Right.
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,133.253,135.537,Doesn't that turn section 5 on its head?
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,135.537,137.955,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor, for a number of reasons."
2011.11-713,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,200.295,201.231,It didn't ignore it.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,247.926,259.567,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, as a practical matter I suppose at that point Appellees would go to the court in Texas and say: You need to revise your interim maps once again."
2011.11-713,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.626,303.011,I don't see how it's basically Upham.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,320.52,331.892,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean it's true that the Justice Department does raise a purpose objection to the plans as a whole, but of course even that takes its force from the way particular districts are being drawn."
2011.11-713,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,359.311,361.128,Can I ask you a question about timing?
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,404.857,421.802,"Well, Justice Alito, two -- two answers: One is, as a practical matter all of the affected, you know, entities in Texas have gotten together and they have agreed on the ability to move the primary back to April, given -- on the assumption that a map could be in place by February 1st."
2011.11-713,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,448.703,460.844,"Well, if we have a binary choice, if it's either the plan enacted by the Texas legislature or the plan that's already been drawn up by the court, yes, that could be presumably resolved rather quickly."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,481.774,482.79,"Well, look."
2011.11-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.3,500.25,Just one more question.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,500.25,500.918,Sure.
2011.11-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,500.918,502.152,Background question about preclearance.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,530.721,534.473,"Well, I don't think there is a road map for the extent to which they give a road map."
2011.11-713,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,600.415,617.977,"But we've said over and over, Mr. Clement, that it's the Attorney General and the district court in D.C. that has exclusive jurisdiction over this set of questions and that we don't want courts in other parts of the country to try to mimic what those -- what that court and the Attorney General are supposed to do."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,637.772,644.192,"Well, Justice Kagan, here's why we are not asking the regional court to mimic the D.C. court's function."
2011.11-713,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,683.085,689.489,"But you are not taking into account the fact that, as Justice Sotomayor said, section 5 itself operates as an injunction."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,693.191,696.493,"Justice Kagan, I think we are taking that into account."
2011.11-713,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,739.006,740.872,That's what they said they are doing.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,813.887,818.189,"Well, I think on January 9th, Justice Breyer, you should take another look at El Paso County."
2011.11-713,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,820.624,821.324,In which -- in which--
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,821.324,824.695,--In either the congressional map or the house map.
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,829.747,830.247,What district is that?
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,830.247,830.765,--What's that?
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,830.765,831.599,What district is that?
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,831.599,832.365,"Well, it depends."
2011.11-713,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,840.102,840.702,--Okay.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,854.911,856.063,"Well, I mean, I think you are understating it."
2011.11-713,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,856.796,857.58,"No, no, right."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,857.58,858.78,--there is a whole straight line.
2011.11-713,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.134,862.434,Correct.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,862.434,863.9,And in the--
2011.11-713,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.9,864.217,All right.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,868.204,878.726,"--I want to say two reasons why it's wrong, but first I think that really does answer your premise, which is that all the court was doing was remedying one person, one vote."
2011.11-713,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,878.726,879.343,"No, no, I didn't say that."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,931.545,934.147,"No, what I'm -- I'm not saying it's my strongest case."
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,938.248,938.981,But what's was the problem?
2011.11-713,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.981,939.516,Tell me what's the problem?
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,939.516,945.12,--The problem is that the court lost sight of what it was supposed to be doing.
2011.11-713,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,946.354,946.954,What you said they were doing.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,966.801,981.627,"--And what's wrong with it is because they neither started with the old benchmark plan and said we are going to solve the one person, one vote problem, nor did they start with the new legislative plan and say is there some violation that allows us to change that plan."
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,987.697,988.247,I'm sorry.
2011.11-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.531,990.233,"You can finish, finish your answer, please, Mr. Clement."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,990.233,1004.593,"What I was hoping to say is that they -- they told you they were drawing an independent map, and what they told you is that they thought that they were under an affirmative obligation not to defer to the legislative enactment because it hadn't been precleared."
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1027.239,1029.858,"Counsel, I'm not sure how I understand that, okay?"
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1124.468,1136.961,The basic principle they violated is they drew an interim order that they thought wasn't a remedial order without it being based on any finding of substantial likelihood of a violation.
2011.11-713,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1136.961,1137.944,That's your--
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1137.944,1138.828,You may be right.
2011.11-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.213,1218.53,"I -- I had thought, Mr. Clement, that -- that one of your objections was that in deciding whether they're using the benchmark or -- or the -- the legislature's proposed new plan, whichever one they're using, they -- in drawing up their own plan, they assumed the validity of all of the challenges."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1219.863,1226.367,"--Well, that is the case, Your Honor, and that is one of the many problems with the way that the Court proceeded here."
2011.11-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1253.998,1266.575,"But you don't have any problem, if I'm a district judge and I think there is a substantial likelihood that a particular challenge would succeed, you don't have any problem with my drawing an interim plan to avoid that likelihood."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1266.575,1268.625,"--Absolutely no problem at all, Justice Kennedy."
2011.11-713,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1277.197,1285.702,But the district court in that -- in that scenario is projecting what the D.C. court that has exclusive authority is going to do.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1303.181,1313.389,"Can I respond to that, Justice Ginsburg, as follows, which is, I had assumed that Justice Kennedy's question was not specific to section 5 and could just as well be a section 2 problem--"
2011.11-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1313.389,1313.956,Section 2.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1313.956,1316.258,--or an equal protection under the Constitution problem.
2011.11-713,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1323.994,1336.652,"But haven't we also said that, with respect to section 2 and constitutional violations, that those allegations would be unripe in the -- prior to the district court or the Attorney General clearing a plan?"
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1336.652,1338.187,"Absolutely, Justice Kagan."
2011.11-713,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1382.783,1394.591,"Well, just because section 5 says that there's no presumption of regularity attached to that plan, and indeed, that it's unlawful to put that plan into effect without the proper approvals."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1394.591,1395.641,"--Two things, Justice Kagan."
2011.11-713,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1415.104,1418.956,Section 5 says somebody has to clear it before it can go into effect.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1418.956,1420.075,--Absolutely.
2011.11-713,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1428.514,1430.031,Nobody said the opposite.
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1434.199,1434.901,--Okay.
2011.11-713,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1476.912,1477.345,"No, I don't think--"
2011.11-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1477.345,1481.13,"Counsel, I think there's -- I see two different problems and I'm not quite sure how they come out."
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1511.066,1518.053,"Well, I think you try to split the difference by trying to apply the preliminary injunction standards."
2011.11-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1558.63,1579.21,"Can you -- can you tell me with reference to the two districts, other than the Senate district, congressional and State house districts, did Judge Smith defer or use these -- the Texas legislature's 2011 plan as a benchmark to some extent?"
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1579.21,1586.966,"I -- I don't think Judge Smith -- if I can answer your question, I think this does: I don't think Judge Smith did this the way that we think he should or focused on the benchmark."
2011.11-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1624.739,1630.892,So you would fault his solution for giving insufficient deference to the State of Texas 2011 plan?
2011.11-713,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1630.892,1636.713,"That's right, but it's certainly a fair improvement over what the district court majority did."
2011.11-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1638.065,1638.931,"Thank you, Mr. Clement."
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1647.837,1650.889,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1669.418,1670.134,Let me ask you this.
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1690.914,1697.335,"Well, with what Judge Smith did, I guess in that context, Justice Kennedy, there wouldn't be a section 5 issue at all."
2011.11-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1697.335,1697.918,Right.
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1698.368,1700.453,All you would be dealing with is section 2 or the Equal Protection Clause.
2011.11-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1700.453,1708.773,"--And then we could use -- then there would be no problem with using Texas as a benchmark, the Texas 2011 as benchmark, as a starting point, as a starting point?"
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1708.773,1724.484,"Well, I guess what I would say is this, that in the malapportionment context what this Court typically has said the district court should do is to start with a plan that is already in effect and then modify it according to neutral districting principles to remove the malapportionment issue."
2011.11-713,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1724.484,1726.834,What are neutral districting principles?
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1792.979,1794.996,"I guess I would disagree with you, Justice Alito."
2011.11-713,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1833.254,1851.667,"I don't want to interrupt you too much, but even if you do that, even if you start with the old plan and then you modify it to the extent necessary to comply with Constitution and statutes, there are still -- I'm sure our computer could shoot out dozens and dozens of possible maps, and somebody has to choose among them."
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1857.655,1859.821,"--There is discretion in the inquiry, Justice Alito."
2011.11-713,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1867.477,1868.511,It's not just discretion.
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1942.575,1943.927,"--Well, I guess--"
2011.11-713,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.927,1944.844,What would happen?
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1955.569,1956.952,"--No, I don't think you should do that."
2011.11-713,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.952,1963.306,"--because there may be some voters in Texas, may be, some who will be prejudiced by using the current plan?"
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1968.292,1971.494,"Well, I don't -- not in the context of section 5, Your Honor."
2011.11-713,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.721,1993.444,"You acknowledge that there are some situations in which you can use the very plan that the Texas legislature adopted, even though it's not been precleared?"
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1993.444,1996.562,Only if there is no time for the district court to adopt a different plan.
2011.11-713,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.012,1998.279,So it's no longer an absolute rule.
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2005.251,2008.803,"--There is an emergency exception, as there is with all sorts of legal rules."
2011.11-713,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2052.279,2054.398,"Well, would it be okay if we just said, well, Texas has to make the showing?"
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2054.398,2055.898,--That would certainly be better.
2011.11-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2075.812,2077.878,"Well, that's exactly right, but you see it only on one side of the problem."
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2108.283,2115.27,"I don't know about that, because I think what a district court is supposed to do when preclearance is pending is not accept all the challenges."
2011.11-713,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2120.257,2134.1,"So do you contest the view that this district court did essentially accept the challenges, did sort of say, well, look, there are these challenges, so we have to make sure that we don't do anything that cuts against them?"
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2134.1,2137.802,"--Well, there is some language in the opinions to that effect, Justice Kennedy."
2011.11-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2151.812,2156.53,"And if you look -- and if you look at Joint Appendix 146 to 147, it looks the exact opposite."
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2165.12,2172.023,"Well, that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think we point to that in our brief as an area in which the district court could give further explanation on remand."
2011.11-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2172.023,2172.356,You do.
2011.11-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2172.356,2180.212,Isn't it odd that this is a section 2 suit and yet section 5 seems to be driving that -- driving it.
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2183.914,2185.264,I think section 5 can't help but drive--
2011.11-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2185.264,2190.401,And section 5 applies only to some States and not others.
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2206.911,2212.565,"--Of course, Your Honor, Texas is in a different position precisely because it's a covered jurisdiction."
2011.11-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2224.622,2227.824,I wonder if it should take precedence in a section 2 suit.
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2235.68,2237.632,"--That -- that may be, Your Honor."
2011.11-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2249.107,2251.707,It's not giving effect to an uncleared plan.
2011.11-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2260.296,2263.348,We will let you go on for a little longer.
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2264.867,2265.483,Okay.
2011.11-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2318.498,2322.136,"Counsel, I have -- Your position -- I understand you're straddling a position."
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2345.799,2348.918,"--Well, I don't know that it is, Your Honor, and I have two responses in that respect."
2011.11-713,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.343,2366.96,Did you have -- what is that based on?
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2366.96,2368.579,--What I would say is this.
2011.11-713,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.02,2385.238,"Yes, I read, I read, I read the opinion and what you said on the phone and so forth."
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2385.238,2385.555,"--No, not that."
2011.11-713,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2385.555,2387.59,It seems to me that it's a complicated case.
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2403.984,2407.802,"Well, of course, if preclearance is granted we won't have an issue with drawing maps."
2011.11-713,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.802,2415.407,"Well, I think there's -- it seemed to me from reading it, I didn't think that the judge there is ready to grant preclearance."
2011.11-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2462.072,2464.238,"Maybe -- brief answer, please."
2011.11-713,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2464.238,2464.572,Yes.
2011.11-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2483.402,2484.519,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2490.323,2493.675,"Mr. Chief Judge, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.342,2521.694,Exclude me from the second.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2536.87,2547.476,"I think we are dealing with a matter of semantics, Your Honor, because the question is, did the Court give the State's plan deference."
2011.11-713,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2561.652,2565.723,"But you know what I don't understand about your briefs, Mr. Garza."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2592.557,2596.175,We don't say that the Court can't look at the Texas plan.
2011.11-713,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2609.669,2613.037,Then you are saying the Court should look at the merits.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2613.037,2617.155,I think that the Court did the appropriate thing by looking at the -- at this matter.
2011.11-713,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2617.155,2617.605,No.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2644.656,2652.912,"I think that the Court should look at -- first of all, should not start with the State's plan."
2011.11-713,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2672.242,2684.216,So the Texas court cannot -- should automatically accept all -- that every district that a challenge has been raised in the DC Circuit Court is okay?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2684.216,2687.601,It should not accept any of the districts that have been challenged.
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2693.321,2695.171,"I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, but I didn't follow that."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2702.26,2705.129,"--It should make a determination either way, and it didn't."
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2715.401,2720.572,"But could it look at the district and say, well, it respects county lines; it follows a river; it's got urban/rural."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2737.081,2744.337,"I think the problem with that, Your Honor, is that then it would be assuming that the State is correct, that it doesn't violate section 5."
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2749.908,2754.876,"And that's right, but it goes the other way when you say they can't approve something that's been challenged."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2757.478,2757.928,No.
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2757.928,2760.614,And that's an inquiry that belongs to the district court in D.C.--
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2760.614,2766.018,"No, because what the court did, is it didn't accept as a remedy what the plaintiffs proposed there."
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.383,2791.568,But that is not the current State policy.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2803.459,2805.995,That policy cannot be deferred to.
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.749,2816.433,There is a presumption of its invalidity.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2819.318,2820.504,--Either way.
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.289,2823.806,"Well, not either way."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2824.756,2827.158,--It -- you are not presuming it is invalid.
2011.11-713,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2844.501,2860.379,"Let's say a legislature says -- says we have a new policy, and that is that once we've satisfied our constitutional obligations and our obligations under the Voting Rights Act, the only thing we are going to do is try to draw the districts that are the most compact possible, compactness over everything else."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2883.745,2887.213,"I don't believe they can, and this Court didn't."
2011.11-713,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2888.447,2898.937,"Well, if they can't do that then you are saying that they are constrained by State policy, except to the extent the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act requires otherwise."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2898.937,2916.549,"--And in this case, part of the Voting Rights Act is section 5, and in those areas and in those districts where there have been challenges -- and by the way the district court has -- in the District of Columbia has determined that those challenges are substantial, because they have denied preclearance."
2011.11-713,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2919.601,2920.017,They denied summary judgment.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2920.984,2921.751,--I'm sorry?
2011.11-713,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2921.751,2923.719,They denied summary judgment.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2923.719,2926.505,"They denied summary judgment, but they went even further."
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2969.598,2972.736,"--The constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act is not at issue here, right?"
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,2972.736,2973.102,--That's not.
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2973.102,2973.886,Okay.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3039.627,3048.3,"I think -- I think that the statement that the Court made is a correct statement, it did create a coalition district in Dallas."
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.726,3068.528,New district 33 was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3077.133,3088.858,"Of course it can be read differently than Your Honor's interpretation of this, because the court has said over and over again we did not attempt to create coalition districts, we did not attempt to draw--"
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3088.858,3095.531,"I'm sorry, when you are saying something can be read differently than that, and say because they said something else somewhere else, that is not responsive."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3095.531,3099.999,--What I'm -- what I'm suggesting is what he is saying is that this is the result of what they have done.
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.87,3108.089,Drawn as?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3111.29,3111.706,--Yes.
2011.11-713,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3112.156,3121.329,"--two sentences forward, if I could help with the reading, the fourth new district, district 33 was drawn in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex"
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3156.902,3157.687,Precisely.
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3180.101,3185.922,"I'm sorry, why -- why do you care -- why do they care then that it was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district?"
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3190.659,3195.794,"--I believe it is describing what the results of their map drawing is, and I think that is perfectly legitimate."
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3195.794,3210.989,Can we infer from either the ambiguity or the other reading of the sentence that the Chief Justice suggested that in the court's view it was desirable to have a minority coalition district?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3213.322,3217.476,I think -- I think it is desirable to have a minority district there.
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3217.476,3218.993,A minority coalition district?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3218.993,3220.595,A minority coalition district.
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3222.845,3223.061,All right.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3227.515,3231.884,--I believe that the plan that was drawn by the court is fair.
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.688,3246.293,"One of -- one of -- one of the basic rules that was followed in drawing up the court plan was not to divide any voting districts, right?"
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3246.293,3247.745,That's one of the principles.
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.745,3248.428,Why?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3253.232,3255.032,"There is two reasons, Your Honor."
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3255.682,3257.351,So the court just made it up?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3257.351,3257.851,--No.
2011.11-713,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3336.767,3347.825,"Well, if Texas says we don't care about maintaining voting precincts; this is -- this is a matter of -- of administrative burden and expense, and we are willing to bear that, so disregard that."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3357.714,3360.216,The State didn't do that in this instance.
2011.11-713,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3360.216,3361.2,But could they do that?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3361.2,3361.633,And--
2011.11-713,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3361.633,3362.868,Could the district court do that?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3363.618,3377.777,"--It's -- yes, I think they could, because there's still the authority of this Court in Bush v. Vera that directs courts, in drawing interim plans for impending elections, to be cautious about that, number 1."
2011.11-713,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3456.027,3457.896,"Mr. Garza, what's the real drop-dead date?"
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3468.604,3469.604,"--June 26th, Your Honor."
2011.11-713,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3469.604,3469.904,All right.
2011.11-713,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3472.739,3473.889,"That's for presidential primaries, isn't it?"
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3478.977,3479.829,That's correct.
2011.11-713,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3495.088,3504.444,"--So how many days before that election do the -- does the voting mechanism or apparatus need to set up the voting booths, et cetera?"
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3504.444,3514.216,"The -- the critical date is 45 days from the election in order to ensure -- sending out a ballot to overseas voters, including the military."
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3539.383,3545.104,Go back from June 26th.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3546.587,3549.406,If go back from June 26th--
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3549.406,3550.239,"June, May, April."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3551.808,3558.262,"--You could develop a plan by the end of March, and we could conduct an election in June, in late June."
2011.11-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3558.262,3564.916,When do you expect the D.C. court to finish?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3564.916,3587.864,"I would expect it to finish by -- within 30 days of today, because we have closing arguments on the 3rd of February, and if the court will act with the sort of diligence that it did on summary judgment, which was a complicated record and a large record, 6 days later, it made its determination."
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3591.9,3597.137,When -- and when do you expect our decision on the appeal from the district court from D.C.?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3599.922,3601.088,Later this afternoon.
2011.11-713,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3604.124,3610.461,"They did write in a -- in their summary judgment opinion, they made it sound like it's very complicated."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3610.461,3611.594,Yes.
2011.11-713,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3611.594,3624.87,"And so that's why I'm -- I have some doubts about how swiftly they're going to render their decision after -- what is the date, the trial will end on February 3rd?"
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3624.87,3627.155,"That will be closing arguments, yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3627.155,3642.832,Is there anything in the opinion from the three-judge court in the District of Columbia that indicates that there are some likely potential violations that are section 2 violations as well as section 5 violations?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3642.832,3644.967,From the -- from the--
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3644.967,3649.486,And -- and I can amend that to -- and in the submission of the parties.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3649.486,3652.688,--In the District of Columbia?
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3652.688,3653.89,Yes.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3653.89,3665.864,"Well, I believe that the -- that the court has found that the -- the plaintiffs have made substantial claims with regard to retrogression and intentional discrimination."
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3667.63,3670.149,The second -- the second being section 2 violations as well.
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3670.149,3673.601,"--Intentional discrimination is a component of section 2, yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3716.047,3724.701,Do you have substantive objections to the plans suggested by Judge Smith in the house and congressional districts?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3724.701,3726.969,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3738.727,3741.079,Do you have some section 2 objections?
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3745.899,3746.299,--Right.
2011.11-713,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3790.178,3809.407,"Mr. Garza, what would you think of a system in which the Court could start with the Texas plan and say -- the new Texas plan -- and say anything that is consistent with statutes and the Constitution can go forward, but it's Texas that has to show that consistency."
2011.11-713,2,30442,jose_garza,,3820.115,3854.602,"Well, I -- I think that our position is that section 5 is clear that this Court should not start with the interim plan, but if the Court disagrees with me, I think that that's a much more reasonable approach than the one offered by the State, for the same reason argued by the United States: that is, that in the State's argument, you really turn section 5 on its head, because one of the principal benefits for the minority community in having section 5 is it alters of the burden of proof."
2011.11-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3883.305,3883.721,"I don't think we do, either."
2011.11-713,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3887.007,3889.459,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-713,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3983.385,3987.455,"Well, why -- why shouldn't it be inverted the way your friend suggests?"
2011.11-713,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3987.455,3994.526,"Well, I'll join everybody in saying that that's -- that's better than the -- than the worst alternative I face, which is to say it's better than the district court's opinion."
2011.11-713,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4063.554,4065.554,Finish your sentence.
2011.11-713,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,4065.554,4071.224,"--I was simply going to say if you go back, the default problem here is that there's an infinite number of solutions."
