1964.13,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,30.637,35.821,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,130.949,136.592,When were these admissions made before or after the arrest as you're saying?
1964.13,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,136.592,146.918,"The admission by the petitioner Barrett, Your Honor, was made after the arrest and apparently very shortly after the arrest, still at the still site."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,1875.817,1898.806,"Mr. Chief Justice associate justices, we might address ourselves at first to the fact that it might be said that this is ordinary Whiskey case or we say that in the District Court where these cases are usually tried as just another liquor case, but it is not."
1964.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1944.459,1949.347,"I suppose the Court is under the – under the duty to charge it though if it's constitutional, isn't it?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,1949.347,1967.542,"If it's constitutional they have a duty to charge them and that was what done in this instance, although I think the trial judge probably covered other areas in his charge what would have been sufficient, had the presumption been left out or put in insofar as giving the jury an adequate picture of what they must do to sustain a conviction."
1964.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.913,2059.261,"Now, we have two of them here now?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2059.261,2065.965,"We only have two of them, but I mention that for this point, sir."
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.374,2154.26,"But what if the effects were just limited to the -- the presumption was useful or made useful only in connection with one item, namely operating the still."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2154.26,2158.104,"I think that would probably help the government's position, Mr. Justice White, but --"
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.104,2160.198,Wouldn't you still make the same argument?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2160.198,2167.911,I would because mere presence can be a guilty presence if you please or an innocent presence.
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.653,2198.029,"Except if he knows, he's at a still."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2198.029,2200.299,"He is at a still, yes sir."
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.299,2203.843,The most thing right around the still and what's the different between [Inaudible]
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2203.843,2206.187,"No sir, but some are."
1964.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2206.551,2208.056,Is there anything [Inaudible]
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2208.056,2208.892,Pardon?
1964.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2208.892,2212.318,[Inaudible]
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2212.318,2220.855,"In the Bozza case, Bozza himself was present down in the basement carrying only operation, but not upstairs making the mash."
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.855,2222.882,"Yeah, but that was only on possession if they found?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2222.882,2223.749,On possession.
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.749,2226.908,"But on the operation, what Bozza doesn't help you with this –-"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2226.908,2242.467,"No Sir, not on operation, but it help us in this sense that we noted that the government in that case conceded that the facts and circumstances running Bozza's operation that were insufficient to charge him with possession and with making mash."
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.85,2248.552,What kind of operation they solved?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2248.552,2249.69,The operation itself --
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.69,2257.963,How about the [Inaudible] of presence being a [Inaudible] that the operation should be?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2257.963,2260.444,"Mr. Justice White, we had more than mere presence in Bozza."
1964.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2287.842,2311.329,[Inaudible]
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2311.329,2313.827,"By and large, that probably would be --"
1964.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2313.827,2319.708,[Inaudible]
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2319.708,2325.862,"No sir, we have to concede of course and accept certain presumptions as being constitutional."
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2373.547,2380.482,You mean that's -- on that set of facts and the language of the cases has no rational connection?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2380.482,2395.523,"I don't -- I do not think that there would be a rational connection because if Congress should do that and if it followed its reasoning in the legislative history in this instance, the purpose seems to have been to overrule Bozza, that's what they specifically say."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2484.834,2486.697,But even if he explains [Inaudible]
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2486.697,2491.453,"He could, but we take the position, may it please the Court, that he doesn't have to."
1964.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2545.145,2556.22,[Inaudible]
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2556.22,2556.906,That's true.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2680.949,2691.957,"If you're right in that argument, then could the judge review his verdict is guilty stand even without the presumption – forget, suppose Congress has passed no presumption."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2708.642,2724.225,"That is, Mr. Justice Black, not exactly, I take the position that Congress cannot say that this and this alone is sufficient without more and take it away from the trial judge."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2725.379,2730.143,If they can't do that could a jury convict on that and that alone.
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2730.143,2733.059,"Presence, mere presence."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2733.059,2734.523,Yes.
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2735.219,2735.532,I don't –-
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2735.532,2736.162,What you're saying is –-
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2736.162,2736.81,-- don't think so –-
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2736.81,2751.333,"There is not enough evidence to convict, the jury – the Congress don't have a right to say you presume he's guilty if he doesn't explain it. Could it [Inaudible] you stated for the jury convict so that the Court would be justified and let the convict stand?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2751.333,2753.375,I don't think so in this mere presence.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2753.375,2754.565,Is that what you're arguing?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2759.539,2760.99,Making mere presence a crime.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2764.335,2770.313,"Well, it does indirectly if I say it was a presumption which can be explained."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2770.313,2781.774,"I think we need a practical assumption or a practical inference to cover the usual run of circumstances rather than a statutory presumption by Congress, which under the multitude of --"
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2781.774,2804.967,"I presume that's one of the reasons that the law have evolved the system under which the legislative branch can create crime, only the trial of a Court in bringing back the conviction and here, you have a distinction, legislature and [Inaudible] say that this extent is not up to the Court."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2808.355,2814.908,We're just saying that – that Congress whatever their motives may have been in this instance just cannot do this.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2814.908,2818.859,"That's alright, but you think he has [Inaudible]"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2818.859,2819.935,Yes sir.[Attempt to Laughter]
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2843.79,2847.357,But why [Inaudible] have in effect at the difficulty in what way?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2849.406,2860.359,"Apparently, they were having practical difficulty in that this Court in Bozza had broken down the various categories."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2860.359,2862.914,What happened from that?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2862.914,2862.919,The Court's --
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2862.919,2865.208,I don't – I don't quite understand with your argument.
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2865.208,2883.788,The Fifth – the Fifth Circuit apparently and as well as other circuits since Bozza have – was -- broke the various matters down into separate distinct crimes started holding as a head in the past that mere presence in these situations was not sufficient to sustain a conviction.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2891.636,2899.745,"You mean the complaint there was that the judges in reviewing the evidence to see whether there was enough to convict, would not hold that was enough?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2899.745,2901.98,"Just the Fifth Circuit, sir."
1964.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2901.98,2910.787,"Is there any legal distinction, Mr. Davis, between this presumption and some of those in the narcotic laws?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2910.787,2914.105,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think so for this reason."
1964.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2955.938,2973.094,"Well, would you -- could this be sustained if they said if he had been proved to commit one crime that you could presume that he committed another in connection with the liquor laws?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2978.464,2979.45,I believe that is --
1964.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2979.45,2983.022,Would that be different from the one you have?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,2983.022,2986.713,"I don't think the proof of one in the crime could be paramount, Mr. Chief Justice, so have we --"
1964.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2986.713,2989.793,Well that's – that's what I'm referring to in the narcotic laws.
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3004.433,3010.067,Of course they have -- you will know the nonpayment -- the tax makes it the crime in the first instance.
1964.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3010.067,3015.15,"For another the crime though, and may sentence him consecutively for those crimes."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3021.879,3036.74,The only legal distinction I could see and would be prepared to comment on now is the nature of the possession that is a physical possession of or having control or dominion as opposed to the mere presence as encompassing possession.
1964.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3039.166,3041.607,I don't ask you to argue at all.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3041.607,3044.941,"You're really arguing on the basis of the Tot holding, aren't you?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3044.941,3047.77,"Yes, sir, no rational connection."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3047.77,3052.092,"Forget the legal language, legal language sometimes is confusing –-"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3052.092,3053.172,"It's quite true, sir."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3053.172,3068.349,"What we had there was a Congress view of presumption that [Inaudible] from the mere presence only possession of a gun, that was enough to show he has been [Inaudible], was that it?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3068.349,3069.125,Received on –-
1964.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3069.125,3070.543,At the same time for the others [Inaudible]
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3070.543,3072.761,Prior after some [Inaudible]
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3072.761,3075.219,[Inaudible] had to be convicted prior to that.
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3075.219,3077.117,"Yes, they had to be convicted prior to that."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3077.117,3083.162,And that our Court held that they couldn't convict on this evidence.
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3092.704,3094.164,That's right sir.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3124.436,3126.682,"It's certain to say, he didn't explain it?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3126.682,3127.373,"Yes, sir."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3134.459,3140.199,Did you have more than presence here?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3140.199,3141.052,Yes sir.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3162.467,3164.404,They haven't found barrel or something like that?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3164.404,3166.449,They had a butane gas cylinder on the truck.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3176.125,3180.769,You think that changed in the situation?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3180.769,3190.215,"No, sir because we are dealing with mere presence as an overall situation involving the administration of criminal justice in the Federal Court."
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3190.215,3194.928,"But if you prevail this case would have go back to new trial, would it not?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3194.928,3195.817,"That's right, sir."
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3195.817,3207.91,"And on this evidence, do you suggest, assuming you prevail on the presumption point, on this evidence do you suggest there would not still be a case for the jury?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3207.91,3214.782,"Of course, I will have to view it more closely at the time that it went to the jury, but I would take the --"
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3214.782,3215.992,"Don't bother, I won't question that."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3215.992,3217.312,"No, sir, well, as a matter of fact --"
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3217.312,3218.634,May I ask this though?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3218.634,3224.48,"As a matter of fact one respondent in this case did, the other one elected to serve his time and has already served it and there's a –-"

1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3225.87,3227.722,"-- question of about the third one, [Inaudible] about you ascertain it before him."
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3227.722,3229.63,"Yes, let me get back to you on that one."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3258.55,3259.438,The jury question?
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3259.438,3262.774,"Whereas, that is, that's the effect in the statue isn't it?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3262.774,3263.254,Yes sir.
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3263.254,3272.11,Whereas if we didn't have the statute or the judge I take it would be free to say there's no jury question and dismiss the indictment against the defendant?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3272.11,3274.564,"I think the judge could well do that, the trial judge."
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.893,3277.597,(Voice Overlap) require to do it in the Fifth Circuit?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3277.597,3278.437,I beg your pardon Sir?
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.437,3282.138,If only -- the only evidence they had was possession in the Fifth Circuit --
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3282.138,3282.536,"Presence, presence [Inaudible]"
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3282.536,3284.083,[Inaudible]
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3284.083,3287.981,"Presence, and that's all they had, the judge would have to dismiss it."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3287.981,3311.872,"The judge would have to dismiss in our opinion, but the statute makes him to put it to a jury and the government takes the position that precludes the judge from then granting of verdict of acquittal N.O.V. and that is a serious conflict between the legal aspects of a set of facts as opposed to the usual solemnity that we give defining of a jury."
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3311.872,3327.5,"Well that's – [Inaudible] against you on this on the whole line of cases, hasn't that sustained the right of Congress as long as there's so called rational connection, they deprive judges the right to withhold the cases from the jury?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3327.5,3342.81,"I don't -- it may -- it may -- I don't follow the reasoning to the extent that it deprives him of the right to writ -- to correct the apparent error, say if a jury did just go contrary to --"
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3342.81,3363.102,"Well, but when it comes down is that the Congress has made a determination based on experience, that if there is a certain thing in this instance a presence that supports an inference of ownership or whatever it may be of the particular still involved, isn't that what it is?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3363.102,3363.373,I should --
1964.13,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3363.373,3364.296,Congress has made that?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3364.296,3381.32,"I suggest, Mr. Justice Brennan, that if they did decide -- did report this statute out with that finding of legislative history that is not contained in it as I know it and as I have been able to find it, there is no mention about human experience."

1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3388.619,3396.549,"Apparently, they realized the difficulty in these situations and sought to approach it apparently in the best possible way."
1964.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3422.665,3423.667,Mr. Davis?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3423.667,3423.993,Yes.
1964.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3423.993,3449.092,"Tot and these other decisions that you just submitted, the matter of reasonable of rationality based on common factual experience and early in your argument Mr. Justice Goldberg asked you a question, which I think you didn't answer, because I think you weren't given an opportunity to answer, there's another question, but I'd like to ask you again."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3462.653,3468.442,"Well, I think --"
1964.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3468.442,3480.143,"And there are such cases and those people could obviously very easily explain their presence, but in the course of normal human experience, what other people would be at a still, the way this thing actually works in real life except people connected with this operation?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3480.143,3484.19,Human experience as I view it from a defendant standpoint of the theoretical –-

1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3486.111,3487.421,I'll say this [Inaudible]
1964.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3487.421,3489.672,-– the human experience to the facts of life?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3489.672,3513.403,"I think that there are -- that common experience would show that in a goodly number of situations involving the so called illicit operations, there are those who go and pick up things that would pick up the finished product for instance, who wouldn't have a thing in a world to do about letting one hand to work there or to set it up or to be considered as having owned it."
1964.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3516.383,3518.251,The aviators and the [Inaudible]
1964.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3518.251,3520.352,In the operation?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3520.352,3521.933,Aiders and abettors to what?
1964.13,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3522.206,3523.943,The operation --
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3523.943,3531.431,Probably carrying on the business?

1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3560.972,3572.033,"But there's another statute by holding raw material and just when he is there, are we going to say he holds raw material or that he aided in abetting and working which has a different degree of punishment."
1964.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3572.033,3583.755,"You might have all kinds of problems under this legislation with respect to the cases like Lovander and Ladner or whatever it was and Barrel against the United States, but those problems aren't before us now, that is the duplicity of punishment --"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3583.755,3584.076,No sir.
1964.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3587.553,3592.223,"There are obviously all sorts of problems like that, but those aren't before us here are they?"

1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3621.934,3626.079,Now you didn't quite answer Justice Brennan's question.
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3626.763,3628.387,About the evidence on the --
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3628.387,3631.664,"But it is there, it is there."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3676.187,3677.715,I think so because --
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3677.715,3678.499,Why?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3681.286,3698.124,"Traditionally, questions of law are for the trial judge and questions of facts are of course for the jury and if the fact as found by the jury do not constitute a crime as a matter of law, I think that the Court has the duty and the power."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3698.124,3707.391,"But you would do that, if he did so, wouldn't he be going contrary to the command of Congress if that was enough?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3707.391,3713.173,"He might be well doing it, Mr. Justice Black, but I think -- I think that judiciary could do that."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3713.173,3715.879,Because there's nothing in the world but possession?
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3715.879,3723.815,"If – if the judiciary could not do that not at the trial level but eventually at this level, then this Court would be powerless to hold any."
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3723.815,3726.271,"So, how could we do it if the Congress had said that's enough?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3726.271,3728.358,You could not touch any statute of Congress.
1964.13,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3734.033,3740.114,"Well, we would have to invalidate the act, the Congressional act, before he could do it."
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3747.632,3748.205,Yes sir.
1964.13,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3750.091,3757.156,"Isn't that what happened in Tot, the Court disagreed with Congress is the one that met rational connection, it was?"
1964.13,1,29915,joseph_h_davis,,3757.156,3759.396,That's right.
