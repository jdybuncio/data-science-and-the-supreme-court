1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,23.685,24.937,Chief Justice --
1959.43,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,24.937,27.087,Mr. Bischoff.
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,27.087,29.892,-- may it please the Court.
1959.43,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,487.775,492.056,"But right now, it's the original proceeding in the Court of Appeals you say?"
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,492.056,512.273,"Yes, we say in legal effect it was a -- an original proceeding in the Court of Appeals and I say it was a legal effect of that as such an original proceeding, because the case was not tried on this so-called alternative theory."
1959.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,552.328,563.204,May I trouble you to tell us what the Government's position was on the original appeal by you or by the present petitioner?
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,563.204,564.511,With respect to what?
1959.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,564.511,565.528,With respect to anything.
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,566.565,589.026,The sole -- the sole contention of the Government in the Court of Appeals on the original appeal was to sustain the conviction on the -- on their view that there was sufficient evidence to establish this subsidiary agreement.
1959.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,601.654,602.342,May I interrupt you?
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,602.342,602.827,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,602.827,604.89,Is that all?
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,622.948,625.505,"I'm not quite sure that I understand, Your Honor."
1959.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,627.478,633.034,Isn't there -- isn't there some question as mischarging by the trial court?
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,633.034,633.802,No.
1959.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,638.501,638.87,You did --
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,638.87,639.774,-- in the first appeal.
1959.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,639.774,640.397,You did.
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,640.397,641.937,"No, we did not."
1959.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,651.214,653.206,"The Court of Appeals found that that was wrong, doesn't it?"
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,653.206,653.908,I beg your pardon?
1959.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,653.908,656.492,"The Court Appeals disagreed with you on that, did they?"
1959.43,0,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,656.492,656.893,No.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3073.156,3076.184,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3531.562,3554.063,"Mr. Sellers, when was the latest overt act prior to -- or what was the date of the latest overt act prior to the -- these -- these discussions and -- and statements to the revenue officer, you just talked to us about?"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3556.869,3564.774,"Yes, all of these acts that I've just described 24, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33 --"
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3564.774,3565.28,Yes.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3565.28,3567.407,-- were all within six years of the indictment.
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3567.407,3573.699,"Yes, I know, but we're dealing with some taxes that go back to 1942 and 1943."
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3574.122,3574.329,19 --
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3574.329,3591.657,-- was -- was there a -- a period of six years between these transactions that you're just talking about now and the last overt act otherwise proved?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3591.657,3595.786,"I'd answer that in -- in this way, sir."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3602.181,3602.853,Yes.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3602.853,3611.609,"The return for the last year charged in the indictment, namely, 1945 --"
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3611.609,3611.859,Yes.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3611.859,3615.845,"-- would be due March 15, 1946."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3615.845,3617.454,1946 --
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3617.454,3637.17,"So all that putting that in the chronology of these overt acts, overt acts 24, 26, 29 and 30, which occurred in 1948, would be within the six years."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3652.27,3654.267,"That's all I was asking, don't take anymore time."
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3654.267,3656.396,"And for that matter, 32 and 33 --"
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3656.396,3656.574,Yes.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3656.574,3659.321,-- because they occurred in January 1952.
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3659.321,3661.507,Yes.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3661.507,3678.544,"Now, in the opening statement, I'm -- I'm proceeding still along the line to demonstrate to Your Honors, that the Government throughout, did not rely on the so-called subsidiary conspiracy theory."
1959.43,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3692.525,3706.308,"Well then, if that is true, did the United States Attorney or the Assistant, trying this case, make an egregious error and not requesting the trial judge for instructions to that effect, to the jury?"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3706.308,3726.042,"No, sir, for the reason that the court gave a sufficient instruction covering the continuous conspiracy theory and that is pointed out, sir, in the Government's brief, page 4, Footnote 3."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3735.143,3735.887,Where is that to be the --
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3735.887,3743.638,"That's at page 4 of the Government's brief in this Court, Footnote 3."
1959.43,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3786.528,3789.7,Certainly the Court of Appeals missed just the whole point of your brief.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3789.7,3797.336,"The Court of Appeals missed the whole point, sir and it recognized it in its opinion written on the Government's request for rehearing."
1959.43,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3813.055,3820.912,"The Court of Appeals in its -- in its subsequent opinions, didn't accept that qualification, had them tried on that theory, but all of a sudden (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3820.912,3827.765,"The Court of Appeals, the farther it went was to say it might have been tried."
1959.43,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3827.765,3831.519,Because it didn't agree with your present contention that it was tried after you get --
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3831.519,3832.874,They were said in so many words.
1959.43,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3844.832,3846.789,Is that a time which might have been?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3846.789,3848.201,"That's the language, sir."
1959.43,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3848.201,3855.886,"Does that -- does that mean, it could've been or it might be considered to have been filed?"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3855.886,3860.52,Well --
1959.43,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3860.52,3861.226,Did you ask for --
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3861.226,3876.428,"I would answer that, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in saying that -- that I think its fair to say that the Court of Appeals was not convinced that it had been tried on that theory, but --"
1959.43,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3876.428,3883.48,"Well, I understand that -- that's an oath of dubiety, but its effect was that --"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3883.48,3884.545,But I find conviction is --
1959.43,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3884.545,3887.739,To give power or doubt on its part.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3887.739,3890.902,"Well, there's not doubt on our part, sir, but I --"
1959.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3890.902,3901.602,"Mr. Sellers, may I ask on the petition rehearing that the Government say in effect, we did try on that theory, give as an affirmance you were wrong to have the verdict."
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3902.147,3904.138,In -- in its original --
1959.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3904.138,3904.555,Petition (Voice Overlap) --
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3904.555,3908.365,-- on it's original brief in the Court of Appeals.
1959.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3908.365,3908.764,And the original brief --
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3908.764,3914.746,It presented the correct theory along with the other theories.
1959.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3914.746,3917.381,"Well, what you do on the petition for rehearing?"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3917.381,3928.722,"On the petition for rehearing, we sought to point out to the Ninth Circuit that the case had been properly presented to the Court."
1959.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3928.722,3931.694,To the end then of having an affirmance?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3931.694,3954.475,"To the end of asking for a new trial and the attitude of the Court -- I mean, of the Government there was, that admittedly, there had been some confusion brought about by the chronology of these circumstances that I will now relate."
1959.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3954.475,3954.785,"Well, (Voice Overlap) --"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3954.785,3955.457,The second --
1959.43,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3955.457,3967.316,"-- what -- what confuses me is, in place to what you just told us and what pointed out to us in page 5 I still don't understand why the Government didn't ask on rehearing for an affirmance."
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,3969.897,3995.773,"Well, as I have stated, the Government recognized that there had been some confusion in the -- in presenting the case to the Ninth Circuit, because of the -- the Grunewald decision."
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4037.984,4039.774,To what?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4039.774,4053.05,"Well, I think that the Government owes it to any court to advise it what its -- its view of the law is in connection with the submission of instructions."
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4053.05,4065.563,"How could a defendant claim prejudice before the District Court is in fact, the same words in instruction he stressed?"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4065.563,4088.524,"Well, that's a little hard to understand, sir, but nevertheless, its fair to say that the -- the Government thought that it should share part of the blame for he confusion that resulted in the -- its failure to point out to the trial court that it was an error in giving this instruction."
1959.43,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4088.524,4089.558,Mr. Sellers --
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4089.558,4090.289,I --
1959.43,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4090.289,4104.02,-- what you are saying that the -- you couldn't tell from the jury who decided the case on what you call the Grunewald theory or what decided on the other theories?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4104.02,4105.054,"That's exactly right, sir."
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4227.516,4232.137,Which the Court has given on the motion?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4232.137,4232.561,"No, sir."
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4237.806,4239.808,In Grunewald?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4239.808,4242.361,"Oh, in Grunewald --"
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4242.361,4247.248,"It's here, but I -- I realized here is given at the request of petitioner."
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4320.607,4332.088,"If I understand your question, sir, it was why we had not pointed out that the petitioner had requested this instruction?"
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4332.088,4337.545,"Well, I understand this evidence in the record to (Inaudible) must conceive that."
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4342.776,4343.275,Well I --
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4343.275,4346.919,-- the Ninth Circuit reversed the case.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4346.919,4351.675,"Well, I think it reversed the case -- you mean on the first --"
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4351.675,4352.458,Yes.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4352.458,4353.672,-- occasion?
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4362.276,4368.304,So that because of the thrust made for the defendant for a charge to support (Inaudible)
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4368.304,4369.079,"Yes, sir."
1959.43,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4369.079,4370.892,"That's all, isn't it?"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4370.892,4373.278,Essentially all.
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4373.278,4384.973,"Mr. Sellers, you haven't quite finished your chronology and you got to -- you got to the point where the decision of this Court in Grunewald came down."
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4390.808,4398.032,"The -- this Court's decision in Grunewald was May 27th, 1957."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4413.142,4414.46,1958.
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4414.46,4445.798,"And then within the 30-day period, the -- the Government requested a rehearing and on October the 27th, at six weeks later, the Court of Appeals handed down its decision with respect to the petition for rehearing, modifying its original opinion and instead remanding it for a judgment of acquittal, remanded the case for a new trial."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4445.798,4456.273,"Now, how did you treat the Grunewald issue in your briefs in the appellate court?"
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4456.273,4475.567,"I think its fair to say, Your Honor, that in the first place, we clearly submitted the case on the basis of continuing conspiracy, that is the theory that we had tried the case on."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4518.927,4524.709,You did take -- take notice in your briefs of the decision of this Court in Grunewald?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4524.709,4524.945,"Yes, sir."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4525.993,4526.183,Are those --
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4526.183,4527.126,That's decided.
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4527.126,4529.834,Are those briefs in the record?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4529.834,4530.678,"No, sir."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4530.678,4535.422,Would -- have you a copy of them that you could submitted to us?
1959.43,1,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,4535.422,4535.951,"Yes, sir."
1959.43,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4535.951,4537.858,"Would you do that, please?"
1959.43,2,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,5462.606,5478.604,"If it please the Court, I'm -- I don't quite understand why it is set out here or that some question is in -- is suggested as to whether this alternative theory was submitted."
1959.43,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5510.031,5514.986,"Well, may I ask Mr. Sellers -- what is your response to that Mr. Sellers, if I may?"
1959.43,3,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,5515.396,5515.732,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.43,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5515.732,5519.761,-- may interrupt just a moment because that's been bothering me too.
1959.43,3,17076,abbott_m_sellers,,5519.761,5522.856,"I -- I beg your pardon, but I didn't get your statement."
1959.43,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5522.856,5525.174,Will you -- will you state it again Mr. --
1959.43,4,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,5525.174,5547.691,"I stated -- it says that in the Government's petition to the Court of Appeals, which they sought a modification for -- to remand for a new trial, told the Court and I'm reading from their petition, it must be conceded that the case was not submitted to the jury in accordance with the theory outlined above."
1959.43,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5547.691,5550.333,And that's a continuing conspiracy.
1959.43,4,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,5550.333,5551.546,"Yes, that -- they --"
1959.43,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5551.546,5551.686,Yes.
1959.43,4,40994,solomon_j_bischoff,,5551.686,5552.938,-- the kind of conspiracy that they --
1959.43,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5552.938,5555.269,"If I may just -- if we may just let, Mr. Sellers --"
