1995.95-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,20.673,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 95-6, Norfolk and Western Railway Company v. William J. Hiles."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,21.485,23.755,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,59.69,67.386,"Mr. Phillips, was the drawbar technology essentially the same at the time the statute was enacted as it is today?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,67.386,69.246,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1995.95-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,73.149,83.805,"And so at the time that the statute we're reviewing was adopted, it was necessary for the drawbar to be physically adjusted at times between the cars."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,83.805,85.656,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe that's correct."
1995.95-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.136,132.478,Could you just refresh my memory?
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,138.202,143.305,There's the Federal Employers' Liability Act that would have been available to him had he chosen to bring that action.
1995.95-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,143.765,144.754,Can he still bring that action?
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,144.754,148.688,"--I would assume at this stage it's too late, that the statute of limitations would have run."
1995.95-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,158.364,160.465,Do you have to show some negligence under FELA?
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,160.465,166.921,"--He would have to show some negligence under FELA, and respondent has steadfastly avoided any effort to attempt to do that in this case."
1995.95-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.921,171.673,"So, if there's an on-the-job injury with no negligence, is there ever a workmen's compensation scheme?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,171.673,173.645,"Not to my knowledge, no, Your Honor."
1995.95-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.756,193.517,The Jones Act picks up on the same thing.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,195.708,197.18,"The seamen have the same... that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,197.18,224.457,"You mentioned the Lewis case and as far as fines are concerned, you're certainly right, but what do you make of this statement in Lewis that the railroad's duty is, as far as the worker is concerned and the worker's injury... it's a duty not just to provide proper equipment, but to guarantee its performance."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,235.105,237.576,"I guess I would have two responses to that, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.932,302.058,Are you saying politely that Judge MacKinnon was incorrect to the extent that he said that the... that there is a guarantee of the performance?
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,302.058,314.897,"I think you can justify that statement in the very limited sense in which this Court has in the past recognized that if all the proof you have is a malfunction and nothing else comes in, there could be liability under those circumstances."
1995.95-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.111,329.256,"Well, you say that if there's just a malfunction and no evidence produced on the part of the railroad, there could be liability."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,331.878,334.82,Why would there be liability in that situation?
1995.95-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.82,335.151,Yes.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,335.151,344.687,"Well, this Court's decisions suggest that there are essentially two ways to demonstrate a violation of the Safety Appliance Act: either there has been a malfunction of the coupler or there has been a defect in the coupler."
1995.95-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.262,404.176,"So, you say your case differs from the hypothetical in that there was no malfunction here?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,404.176,405.656,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,519.299,521.962,Can I ask you a technical question?
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,526.575,527.316,In the record--
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,527.316,530.818,It would have been helpful because I'm trying to figure it out and I might have gotten this wrong.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,534.399,535.02,--Right.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,535.02,537.762,And then there's a thing that juts out from the car.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,537.762,538.173,Drawbar.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,538.173,539.334,And it has a knuckle on the end.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,539.334,539.645,Right.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.645,541.314,And the thing that juts out is a drawbar.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,541.314,541.715,Right.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,541.715,546.147,And sometimes you have to have a little give because it moves back and forth when they go around curves.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,548.841,549.159,Right.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.159,551.592,And then the person has to go between the car and move it back here.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,551.592,552.433,"Right, although--"
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,552.433,552.914,Is that right?
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,552.914,554.924,"--when he does that, obviously, he doesn't have to be right between the cars."
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,555.706,558.517,"Well, why didn't somebody think of just putting a spring on it so the spring makes it come back?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,558.517,566.424,"I assume... I mean, there have been experiments made over the past 80, 90 years trying to come up with a mechanism to make it spring back, and--"
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,566.424,571.387,Actually my law clerk found one in the Car Locomotive Cyclopedia for 1974.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,583.104,583.555,--Right.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,583.555,584.403,Is that what we're talking about?
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,585.435,586.186,I assume that would be one of the--
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,586.186,596.382,"And he also found a place where... he was quite ingenious to find all this stuff, but he found a place where they're doing research right now."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,612.743,613.215,--No.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,613.584,620.457,And if it's a design problem and not just a maintenance problem... I'm sure Congress didn't want to stop people from going in between cars to maintain oil--
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,620.457,621.288,--Right.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,621.288,624.801,"--rust-free paint, but they did have in mind designing."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,624.801,632.786,"Well, that goes to the second broad theory that the respondents put forward, which is that you really have a duty to come up with some system to realign these drawbars."
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,632.786,633.467,Why not?
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,633.467,634.687,The statute says--
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,634.687,635.228,"I mean, why not?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,643.102,643.373,"--No, no."
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.373,650.688,"I'm simply trying to figure out, is it more like maintaining, you oil the thing, or is it more like designing a better coupler?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,672.022,682.118,"Well, I don't think it's the kind of problem Congress had in mind because we know that Congress dealt specifically with drawbars in the Safety Appliance Act itself and in section 5 said, set up a drawbar at a certain height."
1995.95-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,687.583,694.345,"Well, how do we know that the drawbar is not part of the coupling device?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,694.345,704.123,"--Well, we can... we know that Congress at least viewed them differently because section 2 talks about coupling couplers and section 5 talks about drawbars."
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,711.697,717.551,"No, but they had... the old system was a system where you had a thing sticking out of the car called a drawbar."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,717.551,717.952,Right.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,717.952,719.454,And it had a link at the end.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,719.454,719.925,Right.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.925,724.576,"And the link went inside another drawbar, I take it, called a pocket, and then you dropped a pin in."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,724.576,724.907,Right.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,724.907,727.859,"So, you'd think the coupling system was that whole thing, wouldn't you?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,731.85,734.404,I'm not trying to draw too fine a distinction here.
1995.95-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.467,755.806,"--Well, excuse me."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,767.066,767.643,--Right.
1995.95-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.643,773.919,They're talking about going between the ends of cars to effect the immediate coupling or uncoupling.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,773.919,774.259,Right.
1995.95-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.14,805.768,Argument.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,807.681,818.547,"--I may have parsed their argument too finely for that purpose, but I do think the point remains the same which is there is no duty on the railroads to devise the kind of technological change that Justice Breyer--"
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,818.547,829.414,"How many injuries were there last year, if you know, approximately caused when people went between cars to realign misaligned drawbars?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,830.876,833.998,--The answer to that was... is in the footnote in our brief.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,840.213,850.037,"But is that... I know that... I do recall I had some numbers on that, but I didn't know that that was related to going between cars to cure the problem of misaligned drawbars."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,850.037,853.8,I don't think anybody collects the data on that close a point.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,862.635,863.146,Yes.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,868.76,869.231,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.231,878.097,And someone might be injured going between the ends of vehicles when it was not necessary if the vehicles closed while the person is in there.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,878.097,878.527,Right.
1995.95-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.527,885.311,"But your point is, I take it, that there's no necessity of going between the ends of vehicles within the meaning of the statute--"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,885.311,885.651,Within--
1995.95-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.651,886.893,--with this coupling system.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,886.893,889.334,"--That's correct, within the meaning of this statute."
1995.95-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.334,892.766,And this individual wasn't hurt by reason of being between the two cars at all.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,894.849,895.1,That's right.
1995.95-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,896.098,897.48,It could have happened if the car had been up on a mount.
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,897.48,897.901,--Absolutely.
1995.95-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.949,944.441,"Is this in the record, Mr. Phillips?"
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,944.441,948.565,--This is in the D.C. Circuit's opinion in the Lewis case.
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.296,975.563,"The reason that I find it quite relevant... and I'm uncertain about how to proceed... is if in fact there are a lot of people who are hurt by this and they have to go between the cars to realign the drawbars and you could cure it at very little expense with a rubber band or a spring, perhaps it does fall within the statute which was worried about going between the bars and being hurt for coupling."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,975.563,976.161,"Well, I would go back--"
1995.95-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,976.161,979.683,"If it's just like maintenance where you oil it occasionally, then it wouldn't."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,979.683,987.498,"--Well, I would go back to Justice Scalia's point because I think you cannot get to that stage unless you conclude that there is an independent prohibition against going between cars."
1995.95-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1041.373,1059.987,"Mr. Phillips, I think Judge MacKinnon was writing as of... what... 1983, and he said that after 90 years that the automatic realigning devices, as distinguished from automatic coupling devices, are still in the experimental stage and had been installed on less than 1 percent of the railroad cars."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1059.987,1060.407,--Right.
1995.95-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1060.407,1069.374,"That was as of 1983 he was writing, and what you're saying is that since that time there has not been any significant change."
1995.95-6,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1069.374,1075.168,"As I understand it, there has not been any significant technological advance that would eliminate what problems existed in the past."
1995.95-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.843,1086.994,"Very well, Mr. Phillips."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1088.875,1092.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1101.795,1107.207,Where in the record... is that a photograph of something that's in the record?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1107.207,1108.337,"That's an exhibit, Your Honor."
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1108.337,1108.797,An exhibit.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1108.797,1109.248,Yes.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1160.002,1161.821,Do we know that from the record?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1161.821,1169.789,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I was involved in the case at this--"
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1169.789,1171.348,Do we know that from the record what you just--
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1171.348,1171.909,--Not the record.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1172.49,1175.593,"--I... yes, I suspect you... I suggest you confine yourself to the record."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1175.593,1182.906,The point is that this is a performance standard statute.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1201.027,1212.566,"Mr. Mann, I assume when that coupling device is initially manufactured, somebody had to be there to put it on."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1226.437,1227.065,Correct.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.065,1237.473,"And one could say that the person who installed that coupler was going between the two cars, namely, between the car he manufactured and the car it would ultimately be coupled to."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1239.553,1240.024,"No, sir."
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.024,1241.746,"Well, he was going between the cars."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1241.746,1242.958,Only the--
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.958,1243.298,Okay.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1245.739,1248.461,--Only the process of coupling and uncoupling.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.034,1252.475,--All right.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1259.688,1260.109,It does not.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.109,1268.476,Why does it begin with the setting of the coupling mechanism so that they will engage properly?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1268.476,1271.876,Because it will not engage unless it's set properly.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.876,1274.119,It will not engage if it's not installed either.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1274.119,1277.289,"But that is not covered under the statute, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.289,1280.872,I agree but I don't see why setting the arm is covered either.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1298.654,1299.205,This--
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.205,1301.366,That isn't necessary now in order to set the arms.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1301.366,1308.17,--This Court has already ruled many years ago in a case called Wagner there as no movement of the car.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.592,1310.692,I'm talking about movement.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1323.401,1327.692,"It's not only the proximity, but in the preparation of the coupling."
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.692,1329.445,"Oh, but you say that installing the--"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1329.445,1332.437,"That's not preparation of the coupling, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.437,1332.718,--It isn't?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1332.718,1333.048,No.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.048,1335.76,You don't think putting it in in the first place is preparation?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1335.76,1335.95,No.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.474,1339.483,Well--
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1339.483,1341.653,That's certainly not in the preparation of coupling in my judgment.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.653,1341.924,--I see.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1343.726,1345.006,No.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.006,1345.577,--wouldn't have been covered.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1345.577,1345.998,No.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.998,1349.791,"But as soon as he installs it, he moves the arm to the proper central position."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1351.61,1352.261,I disagree.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1355.814,1357.825,--Within some proximity.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1357.825,1358.736,--Some proximity.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.736,1359.124,I see.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1360.726,1362.068,I don't think it matters--
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.068,1362.537,How much proximity was there here?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1362.537,1367.262,"--I think there was a car length or maybe two, but it doesn't matter."
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.979,1406.705,"The language, it seems to me, at issue here in the revised statute is couplers coupling automatically by impact without the necessity of individuals going between the ends of vehicles."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1406.705,1408.859,It could not happen in this case.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.205,1426.521,What is your distance that you... you say two car lengths is not enough.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1427.31,1428.672,It doesn't matter as long as--
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.672,1429.183,Half a mile?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1429.183,1435.905,--If it's in the same track and they're going... and the locomotive is ready to push that car and it... this was an operation.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1443.841,1447.484,And they don't have to be in the process... the immediate process of coupling.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1447.484,1448.583,"Well, they were."
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.346,1453.498,"I mean, yes, manufacturing is preparation in a sense too."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1454.698,1455.379,--I agree.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.379,1465.875,And it seems to me under this statute the reasonable line to draw it is when the cars about to be humped together in order to effect the coupling or are being pulled apart in order to disengage it.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1465.875,1472.389,"Well, I submit, Justice Scalia, the immediate preparation of that car so that that could occur would be encompassed there."
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1472.389,1483.086,"Well, Mr. Mann, I have trouble knowing why we should interpret the statute... the word coupler... as including the drawbar."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1484.768,1486.899,Justice O'Connor--
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1486.899,1489.47,They may well be different things.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1498.817,1509.425,"--But the drawbar is all part and parcel... there's the draw head, which is the actual coupling device, and then it is attached in one solid piece of equipment."
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.359,1525.013,But it appears from the language used in the different sections of the statute that Congress saw these as different things.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1525.013,1533.178,"I... they dealt with particular parts of the whole drawbar, but they're not different."
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1545.67,1555.616,It seems like what they were after was a system to replace the old method where somebody had to go between the cars to put the pin in to couple the cars.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1555.616,1555.965,--That's correct.
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1555.965,1564.312,And that it was this joinder business where they come together and the old pin used to have to go that they were talking about--
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1564.312,1565.201,Correct.
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1565.201,1569.955,--not the drawbar that swings back and forth of necessity to allow the train to turn.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1569.955,1575.289,But that pin could never have been placed in the train unless they were together.
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1575.289,1581.853,"Well, but it's sort of the... you know, the head bone is connected to the neck bone is connected to the backbone, et cetera."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1581.853,1582.424,Yes.
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.424,1584.094,And at some point they're all one.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1584.094,1584.745,I agree.
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.745,1586.345,But I'm not sure that's the case here.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1586.345,1589.487,"Well, I think it is important to go back."
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1595.331,1599.145,"Well, but the most common thing was this business of having to put in the pins."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1603.447,1603.977,--Correct.
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1604.829,1613.413,But I... it is not apparent to me that they were concerned about the necessity of occasionally moving the drawbar.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1613.413,1618.576,"Well, you did not have the same type of technology at that time as you have today."
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1632.815,1635.089,Could you have done it in 1893?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1656.152,1666.968,"But, Justice Souter, Judge MacKinnon stated, misaligned drawbar or a closed coupler is sufficient to establish liability under section 2."
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1666.968,1669.25,"Well, I'm talking about what he was saying about the technology."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1669.25,1669.941,The technology.
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1669.941,1676.245,"Did the technology exist in 1893 to... in effect, to conform to the standard of the statute as you read it?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1676.245,1678.917,"Not at that time, but I think that that--"
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1678.917,1684.72,"Well, why would Congress have passed a statute which assumed a technology that didn't exist?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1695.917,1696.188,--No.
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1696.188,1714.86,--why didn't they say that instead of writing a statute which is couched in terms of what is mechanically possible and at a time when it was not mechanically possible to guarantee the kind of degree of safety that you claim is inherent in the standard of obligation?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1714.86,1716.801,I think there are... there may be two answers to that.
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1745.158,1747.181,"Well, let me ask you another question."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1760.219,1764.453,"Well, I'm not saying the technology could not be devised."
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1764.453,1767.234,It just looks as though that's what it could do and maybe it isn't.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1767.234,1767.815,"Well, here it's attached."
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1773.378,1775.358,What does it open and shut?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1777.42,1778.201,--It opens this part here so that--
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1778.201,1779.012,"Oh, oh, I see."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1781.183,1781.653,"--No, it doesn't."
1995.95-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1782.054,1782.865,I see.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1782.865,1784.925,I'm not suggesting that they couldn't devise it.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1793.05,1795.521,It didn't take a century for somebody to get on the Pinto.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1803.809,1805.329,Starting in 1970.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.329,1806.869,"Before 1970, there was--"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1806.869,1808.621,With the Interstate Commerce Commission.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.621,1809.082,--Of happy memory.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1814.374,1814.875,"Well, I don't know that."
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.125,1817.747,You don't know the contrary either.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1817.747,1822.85,--I... that's not in the record anywhere that there was no enforcement.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1822.85,1823.23,I know.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1836.41,1838.701,The... two things.
1995.95-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1847.748,1856.723,"Mr. Mann, apart from what the courts have done, in response to Justice Scalia's question, isn't the Lewis case highly relevant because that was an agency regulation?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1856.723,1857.174,--Yes.
1995.95-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1857.174,1861.335,It was a regulation that said it's okay to use this hook procedure.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1861.335,1862.157,That's correct.
1995.95-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1862.157,1884.49,"Now, do I understand your reasoning with respect to the drawbar to be inconsistent with the result that was reached in Lewis that it was not... it was okay to have this regulation that permitted the hook procedure, even though it involved going between the cars at least with part of one's body?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1884.49,1894.497,"The only part of one's body... if you recall, Justice Ginsburg, the hook came into play after the coupler was opened part way."
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1928.029,1933.913,Could you tell me a little bit about your rule of causation and tell me what the rule of causation is?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1944.59,1945.569,No.
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1948.882,1951.513,"If he stumbles in between the cars, is there liability?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1951.513,1955.656,Until he... I think there's a super-intervening cause.
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1959.831,1960.519,"Well, there's cause in fact."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1962.011,1962.452,--Yes.
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.452,1963.791,--wouldn't have moved and wouldn't have stumbled.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1963.791,1964.973,The violation exists.
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1964.973,1975.659,"So, there must... so, you must be saying that there is some requirement of proximate causation between the defective operation of the mechanism and the injury."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1975.659,1976.45,There--
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1976.45,1977.492,You would agree with that.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,1977.492,1977.802,--Yes.
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.208,2004.848,One obvious reason--
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2022.89,2023.841,It's not irrelevant.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.574,2066.159,And what exactly is the performance requirement that you deduce from the statute?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2066.159,2087.043,"Mr. Chief Justice, I am saying that the performance requirement is that in every case, not just in... when there's moving equipment, not just when there's a defect, in every case where the couplers do not couple automatically and cannot couple automatically because of the way the equipment is designed, that there's a violation."
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.043,2088.033,Even if it's a--
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2088.033,2088.473,Yes.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.473,2091.525,--Even if it's a misalignment and not an actual failure of the coupler.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2091.525,2092.077,That's correct.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.237,2098.431,"Yes, but I don't think they've extended beyond failure of the couplers."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2098.431,2101.042,This is a failure of the coupler.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2101.042,2102.351,In what respect?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2102.351,2104.154,Because it can't couple automatically.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.154,2108.098,But it wasn't designed to couple if the thing is misaligned.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2108.098,2111.868,"But that's the whole point of our case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2118.974,2125.877,"Mr. Mann, aren't you leaving something out when you say the employee doesn't have to show any defect and you cited the Affolder case?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2132.323,2136.124,--The Court has held in several cases that's not the fact.
1995.95-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.827,2147.802,What case holds that the employer comes in... employee comes in and the employee then... railroad then says there was no defect?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2147.802,2149.983,I think O'Donnell case is clearly on point.
1995.95-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2159.249,2170.617,What is the case that says it is not a defense that the appliance was not defective?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2170.617,2173.081,I think those three cases would hold that.
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.94,2188.659,"Can I ask you what was... reference Justice Kennedy's question, in this case wasn't the injury he hurt his back?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2188.659,2191.561,"In pushing, he... what he attempted to do--"
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.561,2191.991,Yes.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2191.991,2193.661,"--Justice Breyer, is push it back in line."
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.661,2196.994,But is that the kind of injury that Congress was worried about in passing the statute?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2203.088,2204.47,That was certainly part of it.
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.47,2208.062,"Was it... I mean, you can hurt your back pushing anything in a railroad."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2208.062,2210.184,But it's not... anything is not covered.
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2215.076,2219.109,"Because of bad backs because of pushing it, or because that you might get crushed?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2219.109,2220.208,"--Well, either."
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.208,2220.969,Either?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2220.969,2221.48,You--
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.48,2223.4,But aren't there a lot of heavy things that you push in the railroad?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2223.4,2228.055,"--Yes, but not everything is of course a problem as--"
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.055,2234.888,"Is there any indication that what Congress was worried about was the fact that it was heavy and you might hurt your back pushing it, any part of this device?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2234.888,2235.369,--Well--
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.369,2236.641,Any part of the previous device?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2236.641,2239.102,--I submit it was broader than that.
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.063,2242.845,Was there anything that suggests it was at least as broad as to catch that?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2246.666,2248.038,--Not bad backs per se.
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2248.038,2248.429,"Well, pushing."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2250.429,2254.133,"No, because Congress envisioned that it wouldn't be necessary."
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.133,2266.881,What I'm actually thinking too is one reason why this might not have come up before before the railroad commissions is no one has ever been hurt by this in a way in which Congress was worried about.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2294.1,2310.159,"The Federal Railroad Administration in the accident/incident bulletins, Justice Breyer, is... has a breakdown of those that were injured in moving equipment, those that were injured in non-moving equipment, those that were killed in both--"
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.159,2318.003,And what is the answer then as to how many people were injured or killed in dealing with misaligned drawbars?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2318.003,2322.026,--I can't... I don't know.
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.467,2322.026,We couldn't find it.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2323.158,2324.127,I don't know.
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2329.412,2354.297,"So, then is the... if I thought that really what I'm trying to distinguish here is between what I'd call routine maintenance of things that occasionally cause trouble and serious design problems... and a serious design problem has to do with numbers and the kinds of injuries Congress thought about... then wouldn't I have to decide this against you because the record isn't... doesn't have that information and I can't get it enough?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2354.297,2354.717,Well--
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.717,2356.658,Or would I decide in your favor on some presumption?
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2357.089,2366.776,"--Well, I... if you determined that this is not a design issue, then of course we would lose, but in all due respect--"
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.776,2378.013,"--And how can we decide if it's a design issue if we don't have numbers that tell us how many people are hurt or killed compared with, let's say, the difficulty of doing the redesign?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2378.013,2382.476,"--Well, if a design is required, Justice Breyer, why does it matter how many?"
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2383.986,2397.324,Because in fact you wouldn't have to spend the entire gross national product to save somebody from having a bad finger because design is always a question of what kind of problem is caused to people and how difficult is it to solve the problem.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2397.324,2410.964,"--Certainly Congress in 1893 didn't know what the problem was going to be in 1996, but they did know enough about that procedure to say make it safe for the employee."
1995.95-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2410.964,2419.529,And safe is itself a word that implies that failure to do it hurts somebody and it's possible to redesign your way out of it.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2452.952,2454.854,He would not have had a violation of section 2.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.856,2474.386,"Mr. Mann, in O'Donnell the Court says on page 389, we hold that the Safety Appliance Act requires couplers which, after a secure coupling is effected, will remain coupled until set free by some purposeful act of control."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2477.919,2478.668,But in--
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2478.668,2483.562,"It then goes on to say, negligence is not required, which everybody concedes here."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2483.562,2497.361,"--And it further, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, states that the railroad cannot avoid liability depending upon how difficult it will be for them to make a coupler that works in all situations."
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.361,2497.761,Yes.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2502.994,2519.246,"But the dicta does, not the specific holding in the case, but the dicta certainly does because it states that you should not be... the railroad cannot escape liability by showing too much was demanded of it at 338 U.S. 393-394."
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.246,2521.626,But that's with respect to couplers.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2521.626,2523.938,Yes.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.938,2525.42,Not drawbars.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2525.42,2533.906,"Well, if you're drawing the distinction, I can't argue that point because I don't think there's a distinction."
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2539.058,2543.051,"But it... as I understand it, it's misalignment of the drawbars, isn't it?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2543.051,2544.512,--The entire thing is misaligned.
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2562.744,2573.35,"Well, in Affolder, there was also dicta in which the Court said, of course, the result assumes the coupler was placed in a position to operate on impact."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2576.792,2590.741,"--Very logical of the Court because they had developed this technology to allow it to open and close without the necessity of the employee going between, but they haven't addressed the other part of that statute, and that is the coupling part."
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.754,2594.754,"Mr. Mann, I want to get back to Palsgraf."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2610.065,2611.066,The Court has held--
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.066,2617.06,Just simply because the act has been violated even though the injury has nothing to do with the act's violation.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2617.06,2620.601,--The Court has held that it's absolute liability.
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2620.601,2625.485,"Suppose that it's misaligned, he has to go between the cars, and he gets bit by a snake."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2625.485,2627.026,Super-intervening cause.
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2629.787,2631.96,"Well, why isn't his bad back a supervening cause?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2631.96,2636.252,"--Well, you're talking about recovery for damages--"
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2636.252,2638.195,"I mean, you say supervening cause, but--"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2638.195,2638.503,--liability--
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2638.503,2643.648,--Supervening causes are... there is a chain of factual causality here.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2643.648,2644.296,"--Sure, but--"
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2644.296,2645.047,He pushed the bar.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2646.259,2648.62,--The violation has already occurred.
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2652.242,2653.402,"Well, that's the same case in the snake case."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2653.402,2660.498,"Well, it's similar because it is... the violation already exists."
1995.95-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2664.659,2666.632,"Well, that's part of what we're talking about I assume."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2666.632,2668.993,"But in this case, we don't have that snake bite."
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2674.907,2679.151,But he might have had the push it from inside the car even if there had been no safety violation.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2684.234,2685.145,I don't think there's a--
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2685.145,2688.106,"So, you can't say it was caused even but for by--"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2688.106,2688.725,--I don't think that's--
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2688.725,2689.586,--the safety violation.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2689.586,2692.168,--I don't think that's a violation of the statute if he's inside the car.
1995.95-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.168,2692.599,Exactly.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2695.23,2698.893,"But if he's between the car, it's certainly a violation of the statute."
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2698.893,2700.794,"So, anything that happens between the cars is a--"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2700.794,2702.576,Not anything.
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2712.631,2716.685,"--Well, the statute doesn't say in preparation for coupling."
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2721.157,2724.008,There's the Lewis case.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2724.008,2727.52,The Lewis case is a court of appeals.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2727.52,2728.001,D.C. Circuit.
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.521,2729.152,It's not binding on us.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2729.152,2740.851,"And it doesn't specifically say that, but when you look at Wagner case, for example, there was no movement involved."
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2745.332,2756.129,"Well, don't we have some concern, when we're talking about imposition of a rule of per se liability, to make sure that that's what the statute was intended to cover?"
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2756.129,2756.709,Yes.
1995.95-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2756.709,2763.846,I don't see why we should make a stretch to pick up every conceivable kind of a result here.
1995.95-6,1,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,2763.846,2773.893,"I agree, Justice O'Connor, but in the preparation for it... I think it's certainly reasonable to include preparation if there's a necessity of someone going between the cars."
1995.95-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2782.288,2784.541,"Your time has expired, Mr. Mann."
1995.95-6,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2787.982,2794.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless there are questions, I'm inclined to give you back my time."
1995.95-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.226,2795.268,Very well.
