1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.263,We'll hear arguments next in Texas Industries v. Radcliff Materials.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,44.295,45.357,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,214.305,224.036,"You don't contend, do you, that if the plaintiff had sued four and obtained a judgment against four, he could have levied on one for the entire amount?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,224.036,224.736,"Yes, sir, I do."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.314,228.845,You agree that he could have done that?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,228.845,230.064,"Yes, sir, he could have done that."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.064,233.874,And the contribution remedy would have to be worked out afterwards?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,233.874,242.433,"Well, in the absence of contribution there would be no way that that one who is levied on could force the other three to pay part of the deficit."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.433,252.179,"Well, supposing there were a contribution remedy, would you say that that prevented the plaintiff from levying on one of the four?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,252.179,253.304,"No, sir; it would not prevent him."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.178,260.334,For the full amount?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,260.334,260.817,For the full amount.
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,272.874,307.001,"Mr. Slater, one of the amicus briefs makes the point that I found quite an intriguing point, that while you present this case as whether there is or is not a right, or should be or should not be, and you say there should be, and is... a right of contribution in antitrust suits among joint tortfeasors, the point made by the amicus brief is that this question can arise in a variety of ways and maybe there's no single correct answer in every context."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,367.071,385.344,"Your Honor, I view contribution as a remedy that will further the goals sought by the antitrust laws and I think it is a remedy that should be recognized as such, and that even though it might arise in a variety of contexts, such as a settlement, for example, that can be handled."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,385.344,389.233,"And there'd be talk of it, we're here about to bargain now... then, about... and so on."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,389.233,389.436,That's right.
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.635,405.479,That's one of the purposes of a settlement.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,405.479,406.01,--Certainly.
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.398,414.756,"Well, it's always reduced by the amount of the settlement, by the amount of the money the plaintiff gets."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,414.756,414.928,Yes.
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.27,419.846,"That's done under the present law, isn't it?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,419.846,420.626,"--Yes, sir, that's correct."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,422.797,422.987,Right.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,422.987,449.476,"Some of the questions that have been raised are whether, for example, if a pro rata approach was taken to contributions, such as was done in the Professional Beauty Supply case, it may well be that the way to handle settlements is to count the number of conspirators, and if a plaintiff settles with one of the ten, let's say, then his claim is reduced by ten percent."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,450.148,455.302,Even though that conspirator had a 90 percent market share?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,455.302,457.833,"--Well, that would have to be the case in that situation."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,457.833,460.831,Or even if that conspirator had a one percent market share.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,460.831,461.628,That's right; that's right.
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,461.628,462.925,It would still be ten percent under that.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,462.925,463.222,Right.
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,466.781,469.717,And even though that conspirator had never done business with the plaintiff?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,469.717,470.623,--That's right; that's immaterial.
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.623,478.495,"Mr. Slater, do we know why the plaintiff did not sue the respondents?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,478.495,482.213,"I think it was purely fortuitous, Your Honor."
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,505.359,515.605,What I was going to suggest is that the distinction between a settlement and a prelitigation decision not to sue somebody may be a fairly fine line.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,525.54,527.336,"--Well, I would not think that would be a settlement; no, sir."
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,529.584,531.381,How do you draw the distinction between--
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,531.381,532.443,--What you raise there could happen.
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.328,557.355,"--Or he might settle with each of them for $1,000 apiece, so if I understand your view, then you'd lose your right of contribution that you claim you have."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,557.355,561.088,"But his claim would be reduced, though, under my theory."
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,561.088,565.258,But his claim wouldn't be reduced by anything here because he didn't buy anything from you.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,565.258,565.742,"No, sir."
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.677,621.472,Do the individual defendants count as coconspirators for the purpose of your rule?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,621.472,624.596,"--No, sir, we would not count them."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,634.202,651.179,"And couldn't... if three people settled for less than the claim, couldn't the plaintiff just tailor the cloth to meet the situation by increasing the ad damnum in his complaint?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,651.179,663.018,"Well, he could increase the ad damnum, Your Honor, but the question, I think, would arise as to what the judgment was when he finally got it."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,663.018,664.049,"Well, you never know that in advance--"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,664.049,671.391,"No, you don't, but you should have some idea in most of these cases of generally what damages are going in."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.199,732.708,"--You do agree that the rule against contribution among joint tortfeasors is fairly well established in tort law, do you not?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,732.708,749.014,"Your Honor, the rule in favor of contribution has been evolving consistently through the courts in the last several years in the... there's a case that we've cited in the brief, the Kohr case, which involved a mid-air collision."
1980.79-1144,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.962,767.163,"Well, what about the nonstatutory cases in tort law?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,774.208,778.066,"Your Honor, I don't have the answer to that."
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,778.066,794.575,"This trend you speak of, Mr. Slater, to whatever extent there is a trend, that cuts against the ancient equity doctrine in pari delicto the condition of the defendant is the better, is it not?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,794.575,799.447,"Well, Your Honor, it gets into the question of, I think, of fairness."
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.103,803.321,The old equity.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,819.533,827.843,"Well, I think that probably is true, although I've read Perma Life a number of times, and I must confess I really don't thoroughly understand the decision."
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,862.033,869.265,"Well, admiralty is a very, very special sort of set of rules, isn't it?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,869.265,875.044,"--Yes, sir, it is sort of different than the ordinary situation."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,893.459,897.958,"Well, in the securities area the federal statutes themselves provide for contribution, do they not?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,898.865,899.597,"Some of them do; yes, sir."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,907.83,912.968,Of course the right of action is an implied?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,912.968,917.261,"That's correct, under 10(b)(5)."
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1020.143,1037.386,"But then to pursue that in pari delicto concept, the statute treats them all in equal fault as with a felony murder case, for example, does."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1037.386,1038.089,"Yes, sir, it does."
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1038.089,1049.975,"So should any court undertake to make some different evaluations, saying one of them is more or less at fault than the other?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1049.975,1060.533,"Well, that is one of the possible ways of apportioning the liability among joint tortfeasors."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1114.607,1117.637,"But that is a recognized doctrine in some states in tort law, isn't it?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1130.552,1143.345,"That's true, and it's also true that there are some jurisdictions in which they actually apportion fault, based on whether you felt there's really a comparative fault in order to achieve contributions."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.184,1173.942,"But each is importing into the antitrust laws a doctrine that has been either been rejected or accepted in the orthodox law of torts, whether it's comparative negligence, indemnity, or contribution."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1173.942,1174.208,Yes.
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.53,1195.355,"Well, one way to guarantee that would be to make them all defendants, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1195.355,1196.433,"Yes, sir; that's correct."
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1196.433,1198.917,"It would not guarantee it, necessarily, but that would be the opening--"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1198.917,1203.135,"That is precisely why we need contribution, because in order to make certain--"
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1203.135,1208.398,"--What I meant was, suing them in the first instance."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1208.398,1209.46,"--Yes, sir, that could be done."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.752,1233.591,"Well, the 1946 amendment to Rule 14 was deliberately designed to prohibit a defendant from forcing a plaintiff to sue another defendant, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1233.591,1234.279,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1327.567,1335.595,"Mr. Slater, if we can believe the arithmetic of your opponents, your rule will leave you with a net profit, won't it?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1335.595,1340.157,"--Your Honor, I've read that formula, and--"
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.157,1341.437,What's wrong with it?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1341.437,1359.976,"--Well, what's wrong with it is that without... we cannot be liable to this plaintiff without joint activity on behalf of one or more of these respondents, so their activities caused whatever damages this plaintiff has sustained, just as much as we have."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1360.647,1366.614,"Of course, they may not be liable to this plaintiff at all, since they never sold him anything."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1366.614,1367.254,--I beg your pardon?
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1367.254,1371.299,This plaintiff might not be able to sue them at all.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1371.299,1376.578,"Oh, yes, sir, under the existing case law he could sue them and if they had not sold him a single thing--"
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.578,1377.719,They still could?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1377.719,1381.171,--he could collect 100 percent of his judgment from these people.
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1393.432,1394.166,No; all right.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1394.166,1397.384,Whether you've sold or haven't sold is really immaterial.
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1399.321,1409.364,"Their argument is that if you've got than three conspirators, the one conspirator who had all the sales will wind up with a net profit."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1409.364,1416.5,"--Well, Your Honor, in this case it's purely fortuitous and I think we've pointed out in the reply brief that this is not the only litigation arising out of this conspiracy."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1416.5,1420.905,"That would only be true, wouldn't it, when you had more than three conspirators, if you're talking about treble damages?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1420.905,1424.17,The formula?
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1424.17,1424.998,Wouldn't it?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1424.998,1434.963,"I think it would be true if you had a particular... there's a certain number that you reach that works that way, and then after you pass that, then you're outside that formula."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1434.963,1437.338,But I was just wondering--
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1437.338,1438.993,It's an interesting formula but I think it has any real--
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.993,1442.898,--How persuasive your deterrence argument is in this particular case?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1442.898,1445.429,--I'm sorry?
1980.79-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.429,1450.473,I was just considering the effect of deterrence argument in this particular case.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1455.706,1459.984,"Well, Your Honor, believe me, our client has ben deterred."
1980.79-1144,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1459.984,1465.45,"That formula doesn't count attorneys' fees, does it?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1465.45,1466.278,"No, sir, that's correct."
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1481.366,1494.315,"Tell me again, Mr. Slater, where is the source of authority for the courts to devise the remedial concept that you're urging?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1494.315,1497.814,"Your Honor, we believe that it's in the statutes, themselves."
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1499.89,1503.701,"It has to be implicit, because it's not there explicitly."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1503.701,1504.326,"--That's correct, it's not."
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1509.402,1518.571,"Well, isn't that the kind of thing that ordinarily, since it involves policy, that's usually left to Congress?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1524.708,1524.958,"Your Honor, we believe this--"
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1524.958,1527.816,"--That state courts do, do we?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1527.816,1536.33,"--First of all, we believe you certainly have the power to interpret the antitrust laws."
1980.79-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1558.085,1567.16,"Well, now, suppose we found we couldn't and decided that we couldn't fill in the gap to find any implicit right of contribution."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1569.643,1572.72,"--Yes, sir, I believe that the--"
1980.79-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1572.72,1579.906,Are there many cases where courts have fashioned one as a judicial remedy?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1579.906,1580.966,"--Yes, sir."
1980.79-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1585.06,1586.091,How many state cases?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1591.556,1596.647,"Well, there was one... yes, sir, you wrote an opinion when you were the Chief Justice in the New Jersey Supreme Court."
1980.79-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1596.647,1599.1,Where we said it had to be done by the legislature.
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1599.537,1603.302,"No, I think you did grant it, as I recall."
1980.79-1144,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1603.302,1605.317,We had a statute?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1605.317,1608.378,"Well, Louisiana has a statute, for example."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.05,1687.439,"That was based on the Dictionary Act, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1687.439,1688.454,Sir?
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.454,1693.218,"That was based on the Dictionary Act, wasn't it, that a foreign corporation was a person?"
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1693.218,1693.812,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.264,1781.261,May I ask you one question before you sit down?
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1814.404,1826.555,"Well, certainly, that particular statute sets out a private cause of action in behalf of persons who were injured in their business for profit, and provides for treble damages."
1980.79-1144,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.111,1846.499,"Well, it goes at least one step."
1980.79-1144,0,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,1846.499,1846.796,Yes.
1980.79-1144,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.796,1854.872,Mr. Cellini.
1980.79-1144,1,20645,dando_b_cellini,,1854.872,1874.379,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1144,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2065.132,2068.006,Are those part peculiar facts that you referred to?
1980.79-1144,1,20645,dando_b_cellini,,2068.006,2089.138,"--Well, Your Honor, what I am pointing out... the point I am making with respect to this is that everyone in New Orleans knew about this alleged conspiracy, and in 1973 a number of plaintiffs filed suit to recover damages against the parties that were charged with this conspiracy in the indictment."
1980.79-1144,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2190.097,2192.175,That's assuming that Mr. Slater were working for free.
1980.79-1144,1,20645,dando_b_cellini,,2192.175,2196.564,"--Certainly there are going to be other factors involved, Your Honor."
1980.79-1144,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2234.736,2244.216,"Do you think... as you know, there have been a lot of amicus briefs filed in this litigation, with many of them directed to questions that aren't really at issue here."
1980.79-1144,1,20645,dando_b_cellini,,2244.216,2244.872,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1144,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2244.872,2258.757,"Such as claim reduction and various other things, and one very appealing one, for example, by the Mead Corporation involving a question that isn't presented here."
1980.79-1144,1,20645,dando_b_cellini,,2265.145,2269.051,"My argument would reject it in all contexts, Your Honor."
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2876.542,2879.978,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1144,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2933.535,2936.44,Would it be fair to say that it kind of puts a wild card in the game?
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2936.44,2942.436,"That's a metaphor that I would adopt, particularly in the deterrence."
1980.79-1144,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.265,3063.076,How much chance do you think Congress would have of coming up with a contribution bill?
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3063.076,3077.945,"--I don't like to speculate about it, but the Congress at least thought it worthy of its attention in 1979 when it addressed the subject and invited testimony from interested sources and even came up with a bill."
1980.79-1144,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3079.961,3085.27,"Well, the Attorney General indicated general approbation of the idea in broad terms, did he not?"
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3085.27,3093.204,"--Indeed, he did, but he also stressed the complexities and suggested that it was premature to take a firm position."
1980.79-1144,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3273.616,3282.769,"That's the litigation, I think, Mr. Solicitor General, that has engendered a good many of the amicus briefs in this case."
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3282.769,3283.8,--Indeed it has.
1980.79-1144,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3283.8,3299.355,"Because I think the plaintiff in that case settled seriatim with many of the defendants and upped the ante each time, and left the Mead Corporation holding the bag, as it says."
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3299.355,3309.618,"And we would submit that there will always be appealing situations, although we think the case before the Court at this time is not such a case, and--"
1980.79-1144,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3309.618,3320.722,"No, and that involves related questions of claim limitation and carving out, and so on, which are not... and settling with defendants; none of which issues are present in this case."
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3320.722,3329.249,"--We agree completely, with the Court's observation, Mr. Justice Stewart, and we think this is another reason why we shouldn't do this."
1980.79-1144,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.249,3345.572,"Mr. Solicitor General, insofar as you stress the importance of not complicating the plaintiff's right to recover by burdening the litigation with a lot of parties and so forth, could not that problem be solved by requiring the claim for contribution to be asserted after judgment?"
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3345.572,3350.272,"That is a suggestion, Mr. Justice Stevens, that has been made."
1980.79-1144,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3362.518,3366.314,"You'd add to the burden of the courts, of course, but I'm not sure it would add to the plaintiff's burden, is what I was--"
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3366.314,3375.497,"Oh, it would ease the Court's problem but it would just make for further litigation with the liability question unaddressed."
1980.79-1144,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3375.497,3377.855,"--The plaintiff would have obtained his judgment then, presumably."
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3377.855,3381.182,But there'd just be that many more lawsuits after the fact.
1980.79-1144,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3426.117,3429.787,What would you do if you add the IBM case in New York to those figures?
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3429.787,3435.878,"--Mr. Justice Marshall, that's an entire judicial career."
1980.79-1144,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3456.776,3458.401,IBM is... about 12 up to now.
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3458.401,3469.803,I didn't intend to have a parade of horrors before the Court but I think I've identified who should be the leader of such a procession if we did.
1980.79-1144,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3498.494,3500.914,I know what it is.
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3500.914,3501.398,Very well.
1980.79-1144,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3502.211,3504.569,I've read it in the last five minutes.
1980.79-1144,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3504.569,3504.976,--Thank you.
1980.79-1144,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3511.989,3513.332,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3515.346,3559.562,"If Your Honors please, insofar as the question of the fairness argument is concerned, I think perhaps the statement of the 8th Circuit in Professional Beauty Supply puts the question a great deal more accurately than I've been able to do."
1980.79-1144,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3644.154,3662.1,"Yet, didn't the 1946 Amendment to Rule 14 permit the plaintiff in any civil case brought in the United States district courts to choose his defendant out of whim, spite, any other reason?"
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3662.1,3671.861,"Well, he could choose his defendant; certainly in an antitrust case he can choose his defendant, aside from the federal rules, because of the case law."
1980.79-1144,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3680.903,3686.761,"He presumably picks out the most convenient and the most vulnerable, wouldn't you think that would be a litigation tactic?"
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3686.761,3690.025,"Perhaps that's true, Your Honor."
1980.79-1144,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3702.552,3708.642,"Well, maybe he even thinks that if there's no right of contribution he might get a little aid and comfort from some of the others."
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3708.642,3711.079,"--Well, perhaps, but at the same time--"
1980.79-1144,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3711.079,3711.767,Anything wrong with that?
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3711.767,3720.934,"--Well, I think it's wrong because I think that the antitrust laws are designed so that those who are guilty shall pay, those that are liable shall pay."
1980.79-1144,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3724.058,3735.976,"But in a criminal case, the prosecution sometimes will let one guilty fellow off in order to get his help in the prosecution."
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3736.818,3738.943,--That's certainly true in criminal matters; certainly true.
1980.79-1144,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3783.378,3785.111,"Well, whether or not they're liable depends upon whether or not you win."
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3785.111,3786.502,--That's right.
1980.79-1144,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3950.685,3956.433,"Isn't there this factor too, Mr. Slater, that I suppose you're more apt to settle if we affirm?"
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3956.433,3957.62,--Sir?
1980.79-1144,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3957.62,3968.585,"Aren't you more apt to settle the case if we affirm than if we reverse, if you're the only one on the line and you know you can't recover from someone else after a judgment?"
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3971.803,3978.346,"I suppose there could be that, if that situation... if you got into it, you might be more inclined to."
1980.79-1144,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3978.346,3988.374,"Wouldn't that be a general characteristic of these proceedings, that if you have a possible recovery over against nonparties, you'd have an additional reason for not settling in every case?"
1980.79-1144,3,18047,benjamin_r_slater_jr,,3988.374,3995.668,"Well, I don't think so because, really, what happens in these cases, though, they're long, they're drawn out, there is long, protracted litigation."
1980.79-1144,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4020.752,4023.562,Thank you.
