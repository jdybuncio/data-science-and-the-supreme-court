1974.73-6033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.598,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-6033, Sharon Roe against Norton."
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,15.076,20.22,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-6033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,48.217,59.764,"In Connecticut, may the state bring the action on its own Mr. Cochran, independent of the wishes or the actions of the mother?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,59.764,72.585,"The state has a power under a separate section of the general statutes to initiate a paternity action in its own behalf for any child which is supported by state welfare, yes."
1974.73-6033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,84.28,94.141,"What are you suggesting that the existence of that other statute has no bearing on the problems, the issues of this case?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,94.141,97.068,"Oh, I think it has some bearing."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,161.878,168.088,"How come were all of the mothers involved here, AFDC was against?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,168.088,169.555,"Yes, they were."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,169.555,173.001,Is this a class action on behalf of AFDC or something?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,173.001,174.465,"Yes, it is."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,174.465,176.009,And it was certified as such?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,176.009,178.095,It was certified by the District Court.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,178.095,183.647,"I -- I take it then, that may make the new federal statute particularly pertinent, may it?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,183.647,187.776,"Yes, the new federal statute does have pertinency here and I was going to get to that in just a second."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,187.776,190.65,Well don't it isn't your own.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,190.65,198.809,The -- because one of the specific classes of women to whom the statute is applicable is AFDC mothers.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,203.789,223.739,"Well, do you suggest these mothers have standing since they're all AFDC recipients and only such to bring this attack on the statute on behalf of non-AFDC recipients?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,223.739,234.021,The District Court did not find that the appellants represented any other subclass subject to the statute and we have not challenged that.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,234.021,240.86,"So, then as it comes to us and confine to the framework of AFDC recipients."
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,240.86,241.449,That's correct.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,241.449,242.724,Right.
1974.73-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.724,247.187,But the statute does apply to none AFDC recipients.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,247.187,278.578,"The statute on its face imposes an obligation on all mothers of illegitimate children, however there is enforcement of the statute and a specific mechanism for enforcement setup for only three subclasses which include mothers who are an AFDC, mothers receiving town assistance and mothers who for one reason or another are not the guardians of their children or for whom guardians ad litem have been appointed."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,454.719,467.05,It's -- I take it none of these named appellants has been receiving AFDC benefits by force of this Connecticut statute?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,467.05,468.905,"No, that's not correct."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,469.841,473.423,But by force stays or what?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,473.423,477.591,"No, this statute does not terminate them from receded benefits."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,494.65,500.166,Well -- well have they in fact in subject to contempt proceedings?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,500.166,512.371,The two named appellants here have been subject to contempt proceedings which are pending in state court and have been stayed for a considerable period of time.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,512.371,515.69,But they have not actually resulted in contempt judgments.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,515.69,517.421,"No, they have not."
1974.73-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,517.421,524.681,Did they -- were those contempt proceedings initiated before or after you brought this action in the District Court?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,524.681,528.487,They were initiated before.
1974.73-6033,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.447,566.324,"Isn't that kind of getting the cart before the horse, why -- the first court to acquire jurisdiction I gather where the state courts in the contempt proceedings, right?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,566.324,566.844,That's correct.
1974.73-6033,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,566.844,572.029,"Where you interpose your constitutional and statutory defenses, right?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,572.029,573.373,That's correct and the state court --
1974.73-6033,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,573.373,580.852,And they said in the proceedings of why shouldn't that litigation have gone to its conclusion.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,580.852,582.838,"Well, the state courts indicated unwillingness --"
1974.73-6033,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,582.838,586.3,And the federal court states its hand.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,586.3,595.55,"The state court indicated its unwillingness to decide constitutional issues, it's about in the lowest federal court -- excuse me, the lowest state court."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,605.106,606.545,"Well, was this the court in --"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,606.545,609.272,In --
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,609.272,616.878,Was this the court's own decision or was this something that you asked that the state courts do?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,616.878,619.32,I honestly don't remember that.
1974.73-6033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,620.978,630.317,But there's another production about this court and federal court sustaining until states do their -- perform their function.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,630.317,632.61,"Well, I would say a couple of things about that."
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.5,646.805,It is --
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,646.805,651.404,"It -- that's true, I'm not disputing that but --"
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,651.404,654.24,"Well, this was criminal contempt, wasn't it?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,654.24,658.065,It's not clear what sort of contempt this is.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,658.724,661.349,"Is it criminal, was it civil case?"
1974.73-6033,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,661.349,662.389,Did he go to jail?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,662.389,665.86,"It was not a criminal case, you can go to jail."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,665.86,667.894,For a fixed time?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,667.894,670.819,For a fixed maximum time.
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.902,683.556,I thought you said it was sort of like the misdemeanor that the Congress turns on.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,683.556,689.469,I think the sanctions of a year in jail or a fine are similar in that respect.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,689.469,696.155,Well -- would it not be a proceeding sufficiently criminal to bring it within the Younger rationale?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,696.155,701.685,It might very well be but I don't Younger applies here for a couple of other reasons.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,718.896,725.148,"Do you have your doctrine being commonly to the states, the states may waive it if they want to."
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,725.148,726.404,That's correct.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.667,729.073,"Do you say that's what, the state did here?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,729.073,734.749,"Well, the state certainly never raised it as into this point raised it at any time."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,734.749,740.934,Did the District Court address itself to the problem formally or informally?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,740.934,747.042,"I -- It certainly didn't formally, I believe it didn't formally either I have no recollection of --"
1974.73-6033,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,747.042,751.105,Well -- you had two clients in jeopardy?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,751.105,763.399,They are in jeopardy in the sense that the petitions against them are pending at this time and will go forward at some point unless there is a definitive determination.
1974.73-6033,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,763.399,766.635,"Well, as I understand it does not stay."
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,766.635,766.863,Their stay --
1974.73-6033,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,766.863,770.476,But at least it won't go forward unless something else happen.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,770.476,779.682,"At this point Mr. Justice Marshall, they are stayed until Friday of this week whether they will be stayed beyond that, I cannot --"
1974.73-6033,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,779.682,785.17,Was that order in -- does it order that the state court has issued until Friday this week?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,785.17,796.784,The state court issued as order I believe it was in December to that effect staying those actions until the 28th of February which is Friday of this week.
1974.73-6033,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,796.784,800.452,And that's all that it says?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,800.452,806.242,"Yes, well that it wasn't all it said, no, it's a pending hearing in this Court."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,811.612,818.103,In pending in both courts are they exact same constitutional point.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,818.103,828.772,I would say that they are not really pending in the state court in the sense that the state has declined to adjudicate those issues.
1974.73-6033,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,853.186,855.455,You also asked for an injunction.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,855.455,859.977,"We did ask for an injunction before, we're not pursuing that further at this time."
1974.73-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.977,870.437,"Well, Steffel ultimately turned on the fact that there was no pending proceeding in the state court at the time the District Court action was brought, isn't it?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,879.347,891.657,I believe the determination in Steffel was that it was not a pending state proceeding because there was a stay in the state court and that is the same situation we have here.
1974.73-6033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,924.949,945.71,Doesn't -- doesn't your privacy claim has something to do with the power of the state which you conceded to bring this action independently?Would such an action not invade privacy to exactly the same extent as --
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,945.71,947.638,It would not to quite the same extent.
1974.73-6033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.511,959.902,"Why -- why it wouldn't be here to the same extent except that there wouldn't be any contempt sanction against this particular person, that's really not a privacy aspect, is it?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,959.902,961.272,"No, that's not."
1974.73-6033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,990.87,995.522,Did you say the right of the mother to safeguard secrecy?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,995.522,996.515,"That's correct, for example --"
1974.73-6033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,996.515,999.825,Where does that right originate?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,999.825,1021.239,"Well, that is the only way that the mother can exercise what we think is the basic right of determining whether it is in the child's best interest and in her best interest to bring a paternity action."
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.239,1029.314,"Could I ask you, that the District Court decided both the statutory the collision issue, the conflict issue and the constitutional question?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1029.314,1030.371,That's correct.
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.371,1031.531,Both against you?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1031.531,1033.017,"Yes, it did."
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1033.017,1046.191,"And as I read your briefs here, do you suggest that the conflict issue, the preemption issue or the statute, so-called statutory issue is different than it was because of the amended statute?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1046.191,1047.916,It is somewhat different I think it is in fact --
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.916,1050.75,"Well, do you -- well, it's quite an argument that it is different."
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1050.75,1051.618,Yes.
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.618,1059.356,"And that the Connecticut Act even if it didn't collide with the old act, it collides with the amended one."
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1059.356,1061.786,I think that's true but I think the amendments --
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.786,1063.417,Isn't that your argument?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1063.417,1070.825,My argument is that it makes it clearer that it conflicted right along and it still does.
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.825,1090.791,Why should we then ask the District Court to address itself to this question in the first instance because that might dispose the whole case for you and it might help us avoid the constitutional issue like it helped the Connecticut court?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1090.791,1094.523,"Well, my answer to that is that well of course that could be done."
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.735,1116.713,You mean it would delay things?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1116.713,1119.083,It would delay things and there is a second reason.
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.083,1124.375,That we might decide against you and the District Court might decide for you.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1124.375,1125.92,I recognize that possibility.
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.92,1129.767,This will give you two swings that I had that you see.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1129.767,1139.581,"I'm not, by any mean saying that this Court cannot or should not if it chooses to remand the case."
1974.73-6033,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.842,1195.9,But you do have a friend on the District Court that might insist on serious considerations.
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1195.9,1204.258,"I -- I don't know that I would put it that way but we do have an opinion which agreed with this contention, that's correct."
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1204.258,1221.811,"Mr. Cochran, suppose one of the appellants had abandoned any claim to AFDC benefits after this suit was instituted, could you have had the suit dismissed at that time?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1221.811,1222.69,I don't believe so.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1222.69,1237.254,"Suppose the mother simply said, well rather than provide the information which the state desires, I will just discontinue making any claim for welfare benefits, what would have happened?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1237.254,1248.75,The statute on its face appears to me will apply to that situation because the mother would have been receiving benefits at the time she was cited with the contempt citation.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1256.675,1265.621,Has there been any construction by Connecticut courts that would shed in the light as to answer to my question?
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1265.621,1271.663,There has been construction in the course of some of the hearings under the statute.
1974.73-6033,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1278.512,1298.769,"But if the statute clearly provided that if the mother abandoned any right to the welfare benefit, she would not be required to respond to these inquiries, would you have any objection constitutionally to that statute?"
1974.73-6033,0,23784,frank_cochran,,1298.769,1302.238,"Yes, I believe we would."
1974.73-6033,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.435,1396.406,Thank you Mr. Cochran.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1397.426,1401.447,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.772,1431.735,"If they -- if they can -- can get the federal court to do it, is that it or --"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1431.735,1451.344,"Well, that's the position taken in this case but in general the courts have to the amusement of Connecticut practitioners as well perhaps as this Court said that they had a restricted or almost nonexistent jurisdiction to decide the merits of constitutional questions."
1974.73-6033,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1451.344,1453.205,Does this trial court affect as you?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1453.205,1454.436,"Yes, they do Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1454.436,1459.317,(Voice Overlap) I've heard that in administrative agencies but I never heard that of a court.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1459.317,1461.653,I have never heard it of any other court but I have heard it at this Court.
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1461.653,1468.608,"Well, so that the criminal case of a statute has been construed, you can never convict the man, you just let him state it?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1468.608,1481.045,"No, the position as I understand it, the position as I take it of the Connecticut lower courts is that the statute is applied and if unconstitutional as construed as unconstitutional only by Connecticut appellate court."
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.045,1484.413,"Well, why in this case did they hold this for the --"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1484.413,1494.361,The Connecticut courts have not construed the statute to be -- have not addressed themselves of the constitutionality of the statute.
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1494.361,1497.625,The court in Connecticut that will --
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1497.625,1498.391,The Connecticut Supreme Court.
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.391,1499.92,Pass on the statute which is with Justice Marshall.
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1499.92,1505.413,"Well, how do you do it here as this particular case now stands?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1505.413,1506.732,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1506.732,1511.238,There is no way for the Supreme Court of Connecticut to decide this case.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1511.238,1512.096,Your Honor --
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1512.096,1513.628,Am I right?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1513.628,1515.032,As this case now stands because --
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1515.032,1515.989,Am I right?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1515.989,1519.933,"-- because the petitions are stayed, you are right Mr. Justice Marshall and thus the second --"
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1519.933,1531.209,So that we don't in all other states we go out through the State Supreme Court up to this Court while in Connecticut we go take a short circuit and run to the federal court --
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1531.209,1531.754,"Well, their --"
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1531.754,1536.811,With the cooperation of both the state court and the plaintiff.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1536.811,1538.137,And the state who which has --
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1538.137,1540.948,"Short circuits, the state could."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1540.948,1541.475,The --
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1541.475,1548.396,It denies us the opportunity of getting the opinion of the state court on one of its own statutes.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1548.396,1548.832,It seems to me --
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1548.832,1549.988,Do they?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1551.853,1556.995,That is the -- that would be the impact of that statute but it would not be --
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1556.995,1563.842,Is that the impact on this particular statute as applied in this particular case?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1563.842,1565.404,Mr. Justice Marshall it is --
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1565.404,1573.451,There is no way for us to get a definitive opinion from the Supreme Court in Connecticut as to its own statute.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1573.451,1581.371,"Mr. Justice Marshall, if this Court abstains at this point, you will not get that adjudication and that's the point that I wanted to make."
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.848,1593.776,So they could appeal?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1594.576,1597.35,"Well, they cannot appeal, there is a statutory proceeding for review but --"
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.35,1601.414,"Well, whatever it is that they -- and that could give that constitutional question decided."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1601.414,1602.232,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.682,1610.593,And the judgment might be stayed while they were appealing.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1610.593,1620.089,It might be stayed and the problem is that the judgment might not be stayed from the perspective of my clients who are the children of the mothers.
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1642.974,1654.422,"Would you think the District Court in Connecticut, the United States District Court might have jurisdiction in the habeas corpus case if there were confinement under contempt order of the state court --"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1654.422,1661.75,"Well, that would avoid the -- that would post the same -- that would bring this case up through the federal courts again without going up through the state court it seems to me."
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.75,1663.286,"Not necessarily, not necessarily."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1663.286,1669.996,You're -- you're referring to possibility of staying -- habeas for stay while the case is appealed through the state courts.
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1671.068,1674.314,That's been done -- that's been done many times in many states.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1674.314,1688.348,But it would involve my clients being subjected to a risk that their mothers will be unable to resist the compulsion of the state and my clients as children do not have control over their mother's ability to resist that compulsion.
1974.73-6033,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.009,1696.548,Let me ask you one more question about --
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1696.548,1696.811,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-6033,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.811,1698.217,"-- that you said you were just been on, Mr. Rosen."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1707.619,1707.859,"Yes, it is."
1974.73-6033,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.859,1714.267,Or is it -- does the Connecticut superior court have had that policy that trial court of general jurisdiction?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1714.267,1727.845,The policy is related to the step -- the fact that the Court of Common Pleas and the Connecticut Circuit Court which were the courts that we're dealing with here are courts of limited jurisdiction and that had been construed.
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1740.909,1745.155,Is this by constitution of Connecticut?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1745.155,1751.54,It is a judicial construction of the Connecticut Constitution which --
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1751.54,1755.225,"Where is it that I can read it, what you just told me you said?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1755.225,1774.356,"Well, the leading cases are two cases called State against Townsend and State against (Inaudible) and with the Court's permission a supplemental submission on the abstention question which is not been raised as we say previously would give us an opportunity to express our views on that question."
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.356,1792.051,I don't need it for myself and more speaking for myself because I just don't believe Connecticut can deprive this Court with an opportunity to have a state court decision deciding the constitutionality of every state statute.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1795.78,1800.918,"I'm -- I'm sure Your Honor that you're right as a matter of constitutional law, I'm concerned about the --"
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1800.918,1803.822,"Well, why do you argue in the other way?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1803.822,1806.553,"I'm -- no, I'm arguing only as a matter of practicality."
1974.73-6033,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1806.553,1809.485,You're just telling us what the -- what's your understanding in the Connecticut law is.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1809.485,1809.785,That's right.
1974.73-6033,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.785,1811.317,You're not arguing that as right.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1811.317,1812.255,That's right.
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1812.255,1816.875,But you did raise all the questions in the state case?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1816.875,1821.938,The state case has never proceeded to a point where those questions might be raised.
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1821.938,1834.023,"Well, then I understood then, are you -- did the gentleman Mr. Cochran say that all of the points were raised in the state case?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1834.023,1838.798,They -- I understand is they may have been raised formally or informally.
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1838.798,1841.182,"Well, this is your case."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1841.182,1844.567,"Yes, Your Honor but the state case was brought by the mothers."
1974.73-6033,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1852.139,1852.913,Alright.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,1854.953,1856.175,Thank you sir.
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2285.913,2301.407,Do you think the interest of children generally in Connecticut are implicated in the necessity for keeping this fund solvent and keeping Connecticut in a position to pay these benefits?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2301.407,2308.104,Certainly children in general have such an interest with respect to how that interest is served in this case.
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2321.648,2323.492,It says speculative interest.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2323.492,2334.699,"Well, I say it's speculative interest because the record below indicates that the Connecticut Welfare Department has made no study of the amount of money that they recoup under the statute and parallels --"
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2334.699,2343.151,"Did you make any study to know that if you pay this money out without recoupment, it's going to have an impact on the fund?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2343.151,2359.933,"Yes, but the thing that you might have to study is how much money you'll get back by pursuing the small class of women who resist disclosure of the name of the putative father even when told by the Welfare Department of the possible benefits which might come up."
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.257,2420.966,(Inaudible)
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2420.966,2422.86,I think not Your Honor. Congress --
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.86,2428.278,"Well, they went to an awful trouble to require the states to have some plans in this area."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2428.278,2429.69,"Yes, they did."
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.471,2433.386,"Not -- not for a negligible reason, I would hope."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2433.386,2434.059,No.
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2473.422,2490.704,"Well, if you should succeed in removing all the compulsion and coercion for the disclosure of the name of the father, maybe they wouldn't be 70% voluntarily or apparently voluntarily submit maybe they'd only be 10% or 2%?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2490.704,2504.364,"Well, except Mr. Chief Justice that as I read the record, that is a figure that 70% make disclosure before the fact of compulsion is brought home to the women and also I'm not opposing compulsion."
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2535.961,2555.312,"The court reads the statute in order to save it from its -- from the constitutional attack that you suggest, it reads the statute so as to require the appointment with guardian ad litem then your point is gone, isn't it, they haven't gone around to that issue yet?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2555.312,2558.278,"Well, that's true."
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2558.278,2569.361,"And you haven't -- I shouldn't say you, your colleague hasn't let the Connecticut courts get around to that issue."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2569.361,2578.18,"Well, except that there is still an important distinction even where the guardian where to be appointed in the case of all children."
1974.73-6033,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2605.246,2625.322,"Mr. Rosen, before you sit down you -- earlier in your argument volunteered to submit a brief supplementary memorandum on this whole question of the Younger question and the -- including the practice of the interior courts in Connecticut never to decide or to avoiding deciding constitutional issues and so on."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2634.654,2634.834,Thank you.
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.239,2640.923,"And so then, would five days be enough or do you want ten?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2640.923,2642.534,"I'd like ten, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.534,2653.703,"Mr. Rosen, suppose the Attorney General of Connecticut gets up and says, I've waived all my rights --"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2653.703,2656.99,"Well, in that case, I would address myself to what this Court's rule should be response of that offer."
1974.73-6033,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2656.99,2659.957,That should be a memorandum would simply recite that.
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2659.957,2662.173,"That's right, it certainly start with that."
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.173,2667.92,"Well, on the other hand (Inaudible)."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2667.92,2669.81,Then I'd rather slightly different memoranda.
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.81,2671.39,What would you say then?
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2671.39,2686.162,"What I would say then is that the -- that where my client's rights, like the children's rights are jeopardized by what I refer to as a silent extinguishment of their rights and in --"
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.162,2689.009,"So, you're going to say that the Younger does apply?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2689.009,2689.608,That's right.
1974.73-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.608,2696.437,"Well, I know -- you're not -- you wouldn't say that the he has already waived it?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2696.437,2704.561,"Well, I would also say he has already waived it because you made that suggestion to me."
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2704.561,2722.148,"Well, then there is a further factor that this might lead the court to reexamine its views about whether this is waivable, this abstention question may be waived by the state so that in any event you submit whatever memorandum you like and your friends will have an opportunity to respond."
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2722.148,2722.316,Thank you.
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.316,2724.724,"You will respond within eight days, will you?"
1974.73-6033,1,21449,david_n_rosen,,2724.724,2725.338,Thank you Your Honor.
1974.73-6033,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2728.93,2732.313,Very well.
1974.73-6033,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2734.804,2736.73,Do you waive it Mr. Arcari?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2736.73,2737.825,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2737.825,2738.903,I beg your pardon?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2738.903,2740.092,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2740.092,2741.006,Did you?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2741.006,2741.928,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1974.73-6033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2741.928,2744.688,Did you in the lower court?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2744.688,2746.308,Would Your Honor repeat the question.
1974.73-6033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2746.308,2750.054,Did you waive the Younger?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2750.054,2754.054,"If Your Honor please, I was not -- you're talking about the state courts?"
1974.73-6033,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2754.054,2754.754,Yes.
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2754.754,2756.538,I was not part of those proceedings.
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2756.538,2764.617,"No, in the federal court, Federal District Court, did you urge the Federal District Court to hold the stand while the -- or to dismiss the case?"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2764.617,2767.851,"To -- to the best of my knowledge, Your Honor, no."
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.851,2771.907,Did you ask them to affirmatively to go adjudicate it?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2771.907,2775.496,I at that time was not in charge to this case but I don't believe we did.
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.106,2789.648,But it doesn't show.
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2789.648,2792.223,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.223,2800.91,"You're talking about waiver, maybe that's the ability to --"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,2800.91,2805.805,"Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1974.73-6033,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3481.726,3493.198,"But under the other statute, if then paternity proceedings are brought, she would have to testify under -- if she is subpoenaed, wouldn't she?"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3493.198,3495.114,That's correct Your Honor and but you're also --
1974.73-6033,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3495.114,3499.898,And again under the sanction of a possible contempt if she didn't.
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3499.898,3512.085,"That's correct, she's subject to same laws as any other witness Your Honor and but she does have the right of the immunity of all the sections in the Fifth Amendment immunity and so forth."
1974.73-6033,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3512.085,3513.352,As any other witness would?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3513.352,3516.429,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-6033,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3665.707,3666.856,Mr. Attorney General.
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3666.856,3668.058,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3668.058,3684.365,"In that connection, let's assume you have a mother who is quite wealthy and has always supported her own child, as I understand your position, the state would proceed against her in the same way, is that correct?"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3684.365,3692.863,It is my opinion that the state should whether -- let me point out Your Honor that our department is concerned with welfare matters.
1974.73-6033,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3703.532,3716.88,"Well, the statute by its terms provides for three subclasses and one of the subclasses is not conditioned on receipt or welfare at all, do you agree with that?"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3716.88,3719.378,I agree with that Your Honor and I --
1974.73-6033,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3719.378,3723.604,"So the statute would apply in the situation not described, would it not?"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3723.604,3725.475,"Yes, it would Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3725.475,3726.97,It would apply.
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3756.907,3761.894,"No, it refuses to disclose the name of the putative father under those circumstances."
1974.73-6033,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3761.894,3767.587,"In other words if he refuse to disclose the name of the father, she would be prosecuted?"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3767.587,3768.46,"I believe, yes."
1974.73-6033,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3770.825,3774.047,"Alright, thank you."
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3774.047,3777.474,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3847.288,3848.007,Mr. Arcari.
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3848.007,3848.354,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3848.354,3853.136,Do you know the statute of limitations in Connecticut on a paternity suit?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3853.136,3854.392,Are there statute limitations?
1974.73-6033,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3883.52,3893.723,"If the statute had run in a particular case, would the state still insist on divulgence of identity?"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3893.723,3900.885,I don't believe so because we have -- I think that's a -- somewhat of a practical problem too.
1974.73-6033,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3923.266,3928.544,I suppose the child were 6 or five or 4.
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3928.544,3930.216,And there's welfare involved?
1974.73-6033,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3930.216,3934.253,"Yes, and you spoke of a three-year period."
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3934.253,3946.5,"If the statute of limitations has run Your Honor, we cannot -- that would be brought up as a defense and that my opinion would be what I know about paternity matters that would be a good defense."
1974.73-6033,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3946.5,3954.67,I'm just suggesting that might be a case where the -- where clearly the rights of privacy would outweigh any interest on the part of state.
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,3954.67,3959.073,That may very well be but I'm going to get into this a little further on.
1974.73-6033,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4220.836,4227.708,Have these cases always been handled in the Court of Common pleas initially or is that just been a recent status?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4227.708,4248.738,"It's my understanding that the cases of the -- well the cases involved in this particular case have been pending for about a year or so, in other words, the procedure has taken place and the Court of Common Pleas is not too old and I believe all the cases are pending, I don't think they are going forward waiting to see what happens to this case."
1974.73-6033,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4248.738,4255.058,And that's your court of general trial jurisdiction in Connecticut?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4255.058,4271.311,"No Your Honor, the -- right now, the -- our judicial system is split up between the Superior Court and Court of Common Pleas of both trial courts and it's well-defined as to which one has jurisdiction in certain cases."
1974.73-6033,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4271.311,4275.989,Is the Court of Common Pleas kind of a misdemeanor type of court?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4275.989,4277.327,I believe yes Your Honor.
1974.73-6033,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4281.648,4284.191,It's kind the -- it's inferior into the superior?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4284.191,4286.828,"I believe you could still classify it that way, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4286.828,4292.023,And then there's appeal like in the Court of Common Pleas to the Supreme Court of Connecticut or the superior court?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4292.023,4306.515,"Well, again that provision of appeal, I'm not quite sure where the appeal will lie, I believe the appeal would still lie under the present act Your Honor, on the new Act I should say to the Supreme Court."
1974.73-6033,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4312.886,4322.926,Your brother on the other side said there was some sort of a special statutory provision to review contempt he thought.
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4322.926,4329.57,"Well, if I may answer that question, my understanding, there are two types of contempt."
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4935.835,4937.05,"Attorney General, may I ask you a question?"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4937.05,4939.037,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4939.037,4951.455,"Does Connecticut have laws that apply to married women where for example the father has left the home and his location maybe unknown, what happens then?"
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4951.455,4953.376,If the mother lose the home?
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4953.376,4956.39,You have a married mother --
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4956.39,4956.632,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4956.632,4964.859,"-- father has left the home, his whereabouts may or may not be known, he is not providing support for the children."
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4964.859,4966.227,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4966.227,4967.711,What is the procedure in Connecticut?
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4967.711,4976.475,I believe the welfare department has a policy where they will attempt to locate the father in the best way possible.
1974.73-6033,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4976.475,4982.284,Is there any statute that compels the married mother to disclose the whereabouts of the father if she --
1974.73-6033,2,35382,michael_anthony_arcari,,4982.284,4983.905,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1974.73-6033,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5023.732,5024.451,Thank you gentlemen.
