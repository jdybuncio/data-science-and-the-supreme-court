1966.127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,172.576,176.306,"There's another consolidated company in here too, its overseas or somebody?"
1966.127,0,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,176.306,186.888,"Yes, it participated only one -- in only one of these five years and had a $25,000.00 loss which is negligible for these purposes."
1966.127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,186.888,189.542,It's the producing company which has got the live share of these --
1966.127,0,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,189.542,190.292,Yes.
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2126.996,2131.312,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.529,2175.609,What volume is that?
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2175.609,2184.978,"Volume 2, it's all in one on a printed record, volume 2 of the lower court record has been incorporated."
1966.127,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2184.978,2186.427,At page what?
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2186.427,2193.097,Page 24.
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.642,2237.21,There would be.
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2237.21,2241.905,-- there would then be and it will allow it in the cost of service.
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.905,2251.383,Even though and it would go on allowing it even though the company continued to have losses because somebody has made a mistake.
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2251.383,2254.709,"Well, if the Commission has correctly forecast --"
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.709,2257.063,"Yes, but I think let's assume they haven't."
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2257.063,2261.479,"If they haven't, the losses would continue and there has to be a further review of the rates."
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.479,2267.492,"And yes, and they would -- but they would continue to allow the tax?"
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2267.492,2268.088,Yes.
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.088,2268.973,Give them a tax.
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2282.103,2299.034,Only because the forecast as to the future doesn't turn out that way and if it turns out that in fact the tax liability is less than the Commission had forecast and this indicates that there ought to be a rate reduction the Commission would have the power to review it.
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.034,2306.262,And I suppose you position is in this case that the five-year-period is a forecast?
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2306.262,2306.577,It is --
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.577,2312.67,"Really, it has to forecast as to what tax liability actually will be in the future."
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2312.67,2327.115,Precisely and the Commission used this five-year span rather than the single span to try to be as certain as it could be in forecasting that this would be the actual situation.
1966.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2665.073,2672.099,I seem to remember in the briefs that your co-counsel in the other side don't agree with you about the Commission practice.
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2672.099,2673.666,"They mentioned one case, if I recall."
1966.127,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2673.666,2673.838,No.
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2680.033,2696.682,"Mr. Justice Stewart, they argued that the case as we cited at page 15 of our brief are not cases which involved non-regulated tax losses but they are in error."
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.542,2881.597,"Well, Mr. Goldberg, how does on the regulated companies actual, let's say it's a profit and loss statement at the end of the year."
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2895.55,2898.197,In a balance sheet (Voice Overlap) --
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.197,2899.316,In an operating statement.
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2899.316,2907.062,In an operating statement prepared by the certified public accountant.
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.187,2930.037,"Yes, an allocation but the -- in terms of this one company how much cash tax actually goes out?"
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2933.737,2936.433,That's what he would report went out as taxes.
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.433,2948.727,And so it's operating statement would just show that the actual tax expense or the tax charge begins income with only be the actual cash outgo for that --
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2948.727,2952.729,Actual cash transferred from the subsidiary to the parent.
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.729,2957.497,"Yes, that would only -- so, it wouldn't be 52% it would be 50%."
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2957.497,2967.615,It would be whatever the parent had dictated should be done to the subsidiary and in the days before the Natural Gas Act the parent dictated --
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2967.615,2969.651,"No, I'm talking about now."
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2969.651,2977.7,"Well, even today unless the Federal Power Commission's regulation is involved the --"
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.7,2987.152,"Well, let's just take a (Inaudible) assume that without the consolidated statement incorporate that the regulated company would have paid $50,000.00 to federal income tax?"
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2987.152,2988.245,To the treasury?
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.245,2988.846,To the treasury.
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2988.846,2989.561,Yes.
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.561,2996.783,"With the consolidated statement if share of net of income taxes is $25,000.00."
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,2996.783,3006.348,"In preparing a proper operating statement it should show federal income taxes only at this $25,000.00."
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3006.348,3030.788,"So that its own accounting would show just the actual cash outlay for taxes and it thus increases its net income, I mean this consolidated return increases its own net income available for dividend as compared with non-consolidated."
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3030.788,3039.789,I hope we're together on this and just to be sure we are may I try to state what my understanding of the situation is.
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.428,3061.692,"Well, let's assume that's $50,000.00."
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3061.692,3073.066,"That would be reflected in its account as federal income taxes and its accounts would probably also show the disbursement of the -- a reduction in cash by $50,000.00."
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3079.914,3089.459,I'm supposing the actual facts in this case then where there is a consolidated return not a separate return.
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3089.459,3107.646,"Well, in the actual facts in this case are that as between the parent and subsidiary, the transfer of cash from the subsidiary to the parent for federal income taxes was at less than the 52% rate."
1966.127,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.428,3126.422,"So, what would its accounting, its certified public accountant say its tax cost was for the year?"
1966.127,1,39378,reuben_goldberg,,3126.422,3136.418,At the 49% rate.
1966.127,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3137.663,3143.32,Very well.
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3144.718,3149.462,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3638.854,3645.292,"Mr. Fletcher, I want to make clear what you say the Commission concedes on its brief on page 15."
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3645.292,3646.949,"Yes, sir."
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3646.949,3649.151,What language you were referring to?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3649.151,3659.318,"Let me get it for you, Your Honor."
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3697.338,3699.79,"And then the petition it's note 8, did you say?"
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3699.79,3701.243,Footnote --
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3701.243,3702.418,8 on page 10?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3702.418,3703.294,Yes sir.
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3731.44,3733.932,Its parenthetical material that you --
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3733.932,3734.384,Yes sir.
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3734.384,3736.053,-- referred to on page 15 of the brief.
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3736.56,3737.899,Yes.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3916.043,3916.648,"Well, Mr. Fletcher, excuse me please."
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3916.648,3918.196,Yes.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3918.196,3926.999,Do you suggest that the Commission has incorrectly determined the actual tax cost to the regulated company?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3926.999,3928.486,I certainly do so.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3932.721,3934.295,But isn't this question --
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3934.295,3934.995,Yes.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3935.776,3943.195,"As a matter of fact, the Commission incorrectly determined what the actual out of pocket tax cost was (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3943.195,3950.391,52% of United's taxable income and this record shows that a check for that amount is written.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3950.391,3951.343,To whom?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3951.343,3953.561,To the Government.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3953.561,3954.787,By whom?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3954.787,3957.563,By United Gas Pipeline Company.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3970.586,3970.944,"Well, --"
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3970.944,3975.121,But Mr. Justice -- excuse me sir.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3975.121,3979.821,"Do you say that now, is United Gas Line is that the regulated --"
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3979.821,3984.728,"United is 44% of its regulated, yes by the FPC."
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3984.728,3988.323,And is that the one whose rate is involved here?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3988.323,3988.833,"Yes, sir."
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3988.833,3997.872,And you say that -- do you say that United actually had a cash out way of 52% for taxes?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,3997.872,3998.586,Yes sir.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4016.45,4017.265,I understand your argument.
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4017.265,4017.46,Yes.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4017.46,4033.247,"I understand your argument, I'm just wondering as a matter of fact whether the losses which -- was a matter of fact in filing on a consolidated basis saved the regulated company any taxes?"
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4033.247,4035.263,Not a single penny.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4046.958,4047.134,"Well, --"
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4047.134,4066.346,"But that was a saving to the parent that was a loss which only the parent could utilize only the parent could prepare the consolidated return, only the parent could offset the losses against the income and it was against consolidated income."
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4066.346,4079.752,"I understand, now, let's carry it on a little more -- if United, the regulated company had filed separately it would've paid 52% and you say it wrote a check for that amount."
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4079.752,4080.631,Yes.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4080.631,4081.404,To the Government or to the parent?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4081.404,4083.289,"Yes, to the Government in my recollection to that --"
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4083.289,4088.497,And doesn't the parent pay the consolidated tax itself?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4088.497,4090.206,"Of course, I think so."
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4093.022,4096.835,I thought mechanically they allocated that from consolidated return purpose --
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4096.835,4099.652,They allocate Mr. Justice as --
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4099.652,4111.326,I thought they took the total income and offset it by the losses of the group and the net result has the federal tax rate replied to it --
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4111.326,4111.846,May I --
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4111.846,4115.089,"And at that amount is then allocated back to the company, is that right?"
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4115.089,4120.684,I want to answer that but I have to do it as I understand the situation.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4198.316,4207.134,"But under the federal tax laws the regulated company in the, assume the out share of taxes."
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4207.134,4213.43,"I'm not -- don't believe that that is necessarily correct, Your Honor that could be the case, that is not necessarily so."
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4213.43,4217.305,(Inaudible)
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4217.305,4218.935,"No sir, I don't think that's right."
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4229.521,4231.523,How could?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4231.523,4249.31,They can't get to it without doing what the regulations require and that they did no more and no less and in the combination of it of course the parent did take these losses and aggregate them and then apply them to the aggregate of the income.
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4252.729,4254.458,Yes.
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4254.458,4255.908,"Well, maybe I misunderstood it."
1966.127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4255.908,4260.362,(Inaudible)
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4260.362,4291.242,"Well, what I was trying to say was that if the FPC had done what it represents to this Court it must first do all of these losses would have been credited against unregulated income and there would have been nothing left for the Commission to do in computing United's income tax component includable in its cost of service but to use from the jurisdictional business its taxable income time 52%."
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4897.888,4898.479,Excuse me.
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4898.479,4899.734,That -- pardon me sir.
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4899.734,4900.918,Excuse me.
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4900.918,4903.142,Let me finish this sentence would you please sir?
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4903.142,4903.368,Surely.
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4903.368,4910.416,Would show that this testimony was not cross-examined and it was not disputed from any source.
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4911.334,4919.512,I thought the facts in this record show that of the five-year period take there was only one year and which Union showed any profit at all.
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4919.512,4919.864,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor --"
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4919.864,4920.717,That was very small --
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4920.717,4921.867,-- 1958.
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4921.867,4924.896,"-- $24,000.00 or $25,000.00 or something or --"
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4924.896,4925.205,"No, sir."
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4925.205,4926.358,Do I have overseas in my?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4926.358,4927.133,Yes.
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4938.023,4942.419,And the losses average over the four-year period how much a year?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4942.419,4949.978,Over the five-year-period the net tax loss of Union was $3.8 million.
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4949.978,4963.323,"So that on this record, on the facts of this record it's a little hard to be sure you can't do more than speculate as to whether or not Union actually could of taking itself advantage of the carry back and carry forward provision."
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4963.323,4976.271,"Well, their witness Your Honor testified that he had had a study made and he had found that they would unquestionably be able to utilize their own tax losses."
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4985.61,4991.219,"Well, there's no question about it as a matter of law, they're being able to do it if there were profits against wish to take --"
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4991.219,4992.202,Yes sir.
1966.127,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4992.773,4994.874,That depends upon questions of fact?
1966.127,2,42664,thomas_fletcher,,4994.874,4995.946,That's correct sir.
1966.127,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5093.786,5096.264,Mr. Brackett.
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5096.264,5110.717,"If the Court please, I'd like to start by referring to a question by Justice White relative to actual taxes in what United the regulated company actually does."
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5377.091,5405.646,"Mr. Brackett, the point you -- Section 1552 says that pursuant to the regulations prescribed by the secretary the earnings and profits of each member of an affiliated group required to be included in the consolidated return shall be allocated and in accordance with one of four different methods available."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5432.572,5445.455,The choice as far as the Section number eludes me but it was done by a method which allocated 52% of the separate company taxable profit of United to United.
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5445.455,5458.827,"And so that it must -- that is not one of the way that it's expressly listed but so it must have been under four, the tax liability of the group shall be allocated in the court of any other methods selected by the group."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5464.204,5468.104,The actual check which united wrote for its --
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5468.104,5482.933,Would you concede for the moment that an allocation could have been made consistent with Section 1552 which would have reduced the actual tax cost to United below 52%?
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5482.933,5487.07,It is my understanding of that Section which I do not consider controlling that the answer of your question is yes.
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5487.07,5494.741,"I understand, so that the 1552 would've permitted."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5494.741,5496.181,It would've permitted it.
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5507.204,5511.725,"So, it wouldn't make -- you would make the same argument no matter what the method of allocation?"
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5511.725,5516.669,"Yes Your Honor, I do not rely on the earnings and profits allocation method on the Internal Revenue Code."
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5516.669,5533.148,And would you say that is it permissible for us to think about this case in terms of a single company that has both regulated and unregulated business and they were unregulated business having losses and the regulated business having profit?
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5533.148,5533.53,It's permissible --
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5533.53,5536.263,Is that a decent model with this to --
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5536.263,5538.171,It is if we refine it a bit.
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5539.954,5540.518,"Well, go ahead."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5540.518,5549.149,"Number one, is the regulated portion regulated by the FPC and I'm sure that you used the term to mean that it is."
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5549.149,5550.236,It is.
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5550.236,5568.391,"Now, in that case, then we have essentially a recreation of the El Paso case has been referred to in the Fifth Circuit and in that case, the Fifth Circuit held that the losses could be carried over because it was gas losses which were also subject to the FPC's jurisdiction."
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5568.391,5585.924,"Well, let's assume the FPC regulated portion is that you say that the unregulated portion is an exploration, the exploration operation and there are intangible drilling costs and its producing operation and there is consequently depletion."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5585.924,5599.506,"Alight, then the unregulated portion is not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction and in that case I would say that the result should be the same as we urge here."
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5599.506,5604.958,"Even though, the company predictably would pay no tax at all."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5604.958,5610.673,"You're saying now -- in other words, you're going again to your point of does the fact of the check control."
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5610.673,5634.376,"No, I'm saying that if it's all one entity and predictably there are going to be sufficient intangible drilling costs over a period of the years to reduce the tax of this single entity to zero every year predictably and everybody agreed, they'll pay no tax for the next 10 years."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5650.152,5661.108,"The answer of your question is yes, because the results of the regulate portion do in fact increase the -- either decrease the refund or increase --"
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5661.108,5663.457,(Voice Overlap) I think I'm clear enough now what the --
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5663.457,5666.421,-- or increase the liability by the amount of 52%.
1966.127,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5671.446,5704.712,"So, the tax saving which I mean you would say the rate should remain high enough to permit a return to the company after a tax cost which the company does not have because of losses in unregulated portion of the business and that the tax saving is -- which is in cash, in cash in hand is available to go on to finance unregulated activity."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5704.712,5721.573,The answer is yes because the contrary answer would violate the well-known regulatory principle which I suppose was stated most clearly in Justice Douglas Panhandle opinion that you cannot use non-jurisdictional results to reduce jurisdictional rates.
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5735.175,5743.724,(Inaudible)
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5743.724,5747.044,You mean enter into a consolidated tax return?
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5747.044,5752.342,(Inaudible)
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5752.342,5756.774,To keep them separately completely as you're stating I have take it Justice -- Mr. Justice White.
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5756.774,5765.071,(Inaudible)
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5765.071,5784.38,They are mixed only in a sense Mr. Justice White of having been joined by a cover sheet in the consolidated tax return but the components which produced that net consolidated tax are perfectly clearly computable and are separately cost by the separate operations of the various companies.
1966.127,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5854.297,5855.243,We'll recess now.
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5855.243,5858.904,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5944.651,5959.496,"So, just to make it clear, if on a consolidated return there was no consolidated that income and hence no tax to be allocated or paid by anybody and predictably that would be true for future."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,5971.688,5976.298,"I'd like to answer your question and perhaps the assumption, the answer of your question is yes."
1966.127,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5995.44,6031.246,"Well, I can understand you could make an issue on whether or not the FPC correctly concluded that the -- that there would or wouldn't be losses or would or wouldn't be income but that's the factual determination I suppose but let's just assume the you could predict that there was going to be no consolidated net income for the next 10 years and everybody admits to assume everybody agree to that, you would still say that you're entitled to tax."
1966.127,3,43922,william_w_brackett,,6031.246,6039.691,In those facts which do not pertain here the jurisdictional principle nevertheless cuts across.
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,6833.924,6842.477,"In the few minutes that I have, I think I can make two points that maybe of some assistance (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.127,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6842.477,6848.668,"Are you going to thing to think about concession, is that you made?"
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,6848.668,6885.4,I haven't felt that more was called for but it runs I may say to so far as the so-called concession in the petition for certiorari runs to the possibility which I think is faced in every case in which an allocation has to be made that the application of that allocation of that method of allocation in new cases as cases come along may present problems.
1966.127,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6885.4,6886.827,(Inaudible)
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,6886.827,6887.649,No.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6961.579,6970.199,"Well, what does this mean that if you would've prevailed on the question of power which has to provide for consideration of the matter?"
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,6970.199,6972.829,It had the consideration of the method.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6974.722,6977.207,But is it a question of (Voice Overlap) --
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,6977.207,6986.735,"We would -- I would question whether that question was preserved in -- so that it could be, so that review could be sought of it."
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7048.226,7051.162,"In any event, we don't have some of that year assuming that you (Voice Overlap)."
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7051.162,7051.717,Right.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7091.179,7096.592,"And that this, what you're talking about is the amount of tax actually paid."
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7096.592,7098.69,It's the amount that they among themselves --
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7098.69,7100.404,(Voice Overlap)
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7100.404,7107.917,"-- allocate for the tax purpose of determining whether they are operating at a profit or a loss, profits and earnings for tax purposes."
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7107.917,7113.768,"Yes, but who paid the tax?"
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7113.768,7120.598,"The tax, there is only a single tax paid and that's the problem that recalls for the allocation with --"
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7120.598,7121.943,But whose check was it?
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7121.943,7122.604,I'm sorry?
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7122.604,7127.44,Whose check did the government get?
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7127.44,7132.681,The record citation that was given for that does not disclose who wrote the check.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7141.148,7143.219,Wrote the check to whom?
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7143.219,7148.421,It says that the check was written to the government but that couldn't be a check for the payment of the total tax because of (Voice Overlap) --
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7148.421,7153.22,It's not a total tax but why wouldn't each company write a check for each year of the tax?
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7153.22,7162.488,Because there is a single tax liability for which the parent corporation is responsible for filing a return and seeing that it is paid.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7165.937,7169.254,"Well, could you explain this to me?"
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7179.19,7180.132,Yes.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7180.132,7182.045,-- and with the consent of the secretary --
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7182.045,7186.342,That's for tax purposes for determining that's what 1552 is talking about.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7186.342,7189.529,"Well, I'll just say for purpose of 1552."
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7189.529,7192.069,Yes.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7192.069,7205.951,"It allows the allocation back to the companies of tax liability and one of the ways in which it could allocated is to allocate back to this regulated company, here is 52%."
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7205.951,7208.785,But that is not the method that they did follow.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7209.854,7210.351,Just wait --
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7210.351,7211.047,Alright.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7211.413,7220.433,Let's assume for the moment that that is precisely what the company's did they allocated back to United the regulated company 52%.
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7220.433,7221.265,Yes.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7221.265,7237.016,And that the United out of pocket cost for taxes regularly and consistently is 52% of its net income although 1552 would permit a different allocates.
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7237.016,7238.771,"Yes, I understand your question and I think --"
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7238.771,7249.095,"Now, what business of the FPC got and say that what to repeal this part of 1552?"
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7249.095,7251.374,Yes.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7266.833,7272.852,"(Voice Overlap) answering -- just answer against his background, 1552 -- 1501 doesn't require consolidated parent."
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7272.852,7273.521,That's right.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7273.521,7276.592,"Now, these companies could've returned their income separately."
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7276.592,7277.369,Yes.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7277.369,7281.066,And united would've paid 52% of its net income and tax.
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7281.066,7281.467,Yes.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7281.467,7295.402,And the Federal Power Commission would have recognized and a tax allowance is 52% even though a consolidated return was permissible.
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7295.402,7296.719,Possibly but I'd like to put it --
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7296.719,7298.1,"Possibly enough, let's get to --"
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7298.1,7299.405,I'd like to give you the caveat on that.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7299.405,7301.289,Let's get back straight.
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7301.289,7338.35,"Possibly, if the Commission could find upon the facts which on review were found sufficient to support its finding that as a matter of prudent management the affiliated group should have saved the utility taxes by filing a consolidated return then the Commission might find that they had not acted prudently and in incurring the 52% tax loss."
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7343.255,7355.811,"So, you would say -- what you would say the commission in a -- would have power to require either the filing of consolidated return or a result equivalent to a consolidated?"
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7355.811,7356.845,"Yes, sir."
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7356.845,7374.813,"And that if a consolidated return is filed, the Commission has the power to select the method of allocating tax liability even though it restricts the choices open under 1552?"
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7374.813,7396.125,I would like to answer yes and qualify it immediately by saying it would not have that effect because what the Commission allows in determining cost of service is not controlling on what the companies may do for their other purposes.
1966.127,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7448.512,7449.712,"Well, that's your position."
1966.127,4,28423,howard_e_wahrenbrock,,7449.712,7452.437,Yes.
