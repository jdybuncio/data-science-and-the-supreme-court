1982.81-1214,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.715,We will hear arguments first this morning in Missouri against Hunter.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,11.871,15.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,155.372,161.198,"Mr. Koppe, has your Supreme Court ever addressed that question under the state constitution?"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,161.198,168.525,"The court did, Your Honors, and it found that the state prohibition against double jeopardy prohibited only retrial after acquittal."
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,173.989,180.91,Is that case you referred to a Supreme Court of Missouri case?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,180.91,181.643,That's correct.
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,194.669,199.245,Where is that in the opinion?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,200.618,202.229,"That is not in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, Your Honor."
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,205.524,208.07,But it's not in the opinion that's before us?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,208.07,208.85,Right.
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,210.036,211.584,Did they pass on this point?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,211.584,218.018,--The Court of Appeals in deciding this particular issue I think decided it in about a single paragraph.
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,219.036,219.878,Where is that?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,221.454,225.439,"--The opinion, the full opinion is set out in the petition."
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,225.439,225.922,I know.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,230.17,231.764,Okay.
1982.81-1214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,297.439,306.639,"Mr. Koppe, your Court of Appeals chose to vacate the longer of the two concurrent sentences, didn't they?"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,306.639,307.718,That's correct.
1982.81-1214,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,307.718,313.357,"Is there anything in state law that compels that result, rather than vacating the shorter?"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,313.357,319.9,"Well, the Court of Appeals reached that decision because in the two Sours cases and in Haggard that was the procedure."
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,370.16,385.841,"Mr. Koppe, I hate to bother you, but the third page of the opinion in the second full paragraph, talking about double jeopardy, as I read it says:"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,395.431,397.618,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,397.618,398.917,"Well, is that here?"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,401.225,402.85,"That is correct, yes."
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,402.85,404.944,That's the issue.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,404.944,406.067,That's the issue.
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,406.067,408.067,The issue is whether they can set it aside?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,408.067,415.376,"That's correct, on federal double jeopardy grounds, on the theory that that constitutes convictions for the same offense within the meaning of Blockburger."
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,415.376,418.92,"But he cites two state cases, right?"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,418.92,419.876,That's correct.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,440.352,452.331,"May I ask, you said that in one of those earlier cases, not Sours but the other one, I think it was, that the Supreme Court of Missouri said that the legislature had attempted to enact an enhancement statute."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,452.331,453.392,--That's correct.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.392,456.157,"Which is certainly the way I would have read it, very frankly."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,462.95,464.53,Correct.
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.492,534.579,"But we are bound by their interpretation of their own statute, namely that the legislature didn't pass an enhancement statute, they passed a statute which imposed a separate penalty for a separate crime."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,538.218,544.964,"--Well, when they concluded that, Your Honor, you have to look at the cases they discussed, and they discussed the two types of cases."
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.831,584.089,"But you're urging us to say that not only may the legislature pass an enhancement statute, but it may do exactly what the Supreme Court of Missouri said it did and said it couldn't, namely impose a separate penalty."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,584.089,586.011,"Well, of course, the reason--"
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.011,592.258,Aren't you saying that the double jeopardy clause does not prevent a legislature from doing that?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,592.258,593.806,"--That's correct, that's correct."
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.481,850.37,"Mr. Koppe, what if there is a conviction for first degree robbery and armed criminal robbery, which there were in this case?"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,850.37,851.899,Correct.
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.899,871.376,"And on appeal the conviction for first degree robbery is affirmed and the armed criminal conviction is reversed on evidentiary grounds or something, so there'll be a new trial."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,883.527,884.026,Correct.
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.026,885.2,Is it barred?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,885.2,892.618,"Well, I think that Brown versus Ohio indicates that there are some instances where separate trials would not be precluded."
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,915.421,915.951,Yes.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,915.951,922.558,Where it is possible at the original proceeding to charge him with both... and of course in some cases it may not be possible.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.023,931.086,"Mr. Koppe, how do you answer Justice White's question?"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,933.289,934.225,--I'll try again.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.225,938.144,Can he be tried the second time under your view of the double jeopardy clause?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,938.144,941.74,If he's tried for both at one proceeding and one is set aside.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.74,947.534,"And the Supreme Court reverses the enhanced offense, the armed conviction, then they send it back for trial."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,948.875,949.924,"In that instance I think they can, right."
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.924,953.063,So there would be two trials for the same offense.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,953.063,953.843,There would be two trials.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.843,958.496,But then so your rule isn't limited to multiple punishments for single trials.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,958.496,966.104,"Well, it isn't limited... I mean, it is except in those situations that would be exceptions to the Brown rule."
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,968.073,971.867,In those cases you would agree that for the same offense there can be successive prosecutions?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,971.867,974.928,"--Correct, that would be our position."
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.208,980.785,Why?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,980.785,981.659,I'm not aware of its happening.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.659,982.486,Why would they be rare?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,982.486,984.159,"But regardless, that's correct."
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.281,997.56,You're only asking for the immunity from that rule where one of the convictions for the same offense has been affirmed.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,997.56,998.683,Right.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.683,1001.62,May I ask... excuse me.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1021.644,1024.378,For purposes... in the State of Missouri--
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.378,1024.923,Yes.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1024.923,1027.298,--state law would make no distinction here.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.372,1036.902,And this would be two felonies for that purpose?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1036.902,1038.763,"--Well, it would not be, for this reasons."
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1297.438,1305.404,You want us to interpret the Missouri statute contrary to what the Missouri court interpreted it?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1305.404,1306.059,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1307.701,1308.98,I thought that's what you just said.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1308.98,1311.307,--interpret it precisely the way the court has interpreted it.
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1314.103,1316.774,"Well, you put ""precisely"" in and you agree?"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1316.774,1324.912,"--Right, because what I was saying is, not only does the statute on its face state that the punishment is to be in addition to, but the Supreme Court--"
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1324.912,1345.871,"And here is a state supreme court passing upon one of its statutes, without mentioning the federal Constitution or any other thing, and you want us to upset that, and take your word for what the statute says over the Supreme Court of Missouri."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1345.871,1347.135,"--Well, I was trying to make one point."
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1347.899,1349.853,Please.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1349.853,1362.94,"What I was starting to say was, not only does the statute, the armed criminal action statute, state that the punishment is to be in addition to, but it has been construed in that fashion at least on four occasions by the Missouri Supreme Court."
1982.81-1214,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1398.363,1406.143,I didn't know I was required to look anyplace else for the interpretation of a state law than to the state court.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1406.143,1409.735,"--Well, it isn't the interpretation of the state law that we're arguing about."
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.288,1432.008,May I ask you another question about that.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1459.087,1466.442,"Well, in the first instance, it is our position that in a sense it is an enhancement statute."
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1468.614,1485.385,"So in other words, the effect could be the same and for prosecutorial purposes for the State of Missouri you'd be perfectly happy not to define it as a separate offense, but make it perfectly clear that it is not only the functional equivalent of an enhancement statute, but it should be amended to be nothing more than an enhancement statute."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1485.385,1485.951,--That's correct.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.951,1488.774,And if you did that you'd avoid the problem that Justice White identified.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1488.774,1490.166,We would have avoided the problem altogether.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.741,1498.944,"All it is, just a clarifying amendment, really."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1498.944,1502.566,"Well, as simple as it sounds, I think as this Court perhaps knows--"
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1502.566,1503.647,It's easier to deal with the Missouri Supreme Court?
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1503.647,1504.692,--it's easier said than done.
1982.81-1214,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1504.692,1508.736,There are even more people to convince in the legislature than on the Supreme Court.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1508.736,1510.316,"That may be true, Your Honor."
1982.81-1214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.316,1515.439,"And it wouldn't help you out very much about past convictions, either."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1515.439,1516.578,That's the whole point.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.426,1545.832,"Of course, the funny thing about this case is that without the enhancement you had a life sentence available to the trial judge anyway."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1548.644,1550.941,--That's true.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.941,1552.797,It's sort of a tempest in a teapot.
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1552.797,1559.594,"And if in fact the court had vacated the ten-year sentence, there wouldn't have been a problem."
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.594,1564.728,"They could have done that consistently with the Missouri court's understanding of the federal Constitution, even if that may be wrong."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1564.728,1566.651,"That's correct, that's correct."
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.415,1633.766,"Put the other side of that same argument is, if one construed the Blockburger rule in the old-fashioned way... and I understand that the Albernaz case supports you very strongly... and said, well, you just make it an enhancement statute when you do, that rule of law would have provided no obstacle to the trial judge giving this man a life sentence, no obstacle to the appellate court setting aside the shorter sentence instead of the longer sentence, and no obstacle to the legislature giving you exactly what you want."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1633.766,1634.531,Right.
1982.81-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.531,1639.935,"So the constitutional rule is no problem, except when they draft a kind of a strange statute like this."
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1639.935,1640.668,Right.
1982.81-1214,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1729.849,1744.141,"When you emphasize what you call the clarity of the intent of the Missouri legislature, you are aiming, I take it, at the opening left in Whalen, where the Court said,"
1982.81-1214,0,38075,philip_m_koppe,,1758.995,1759.681,Right.
1982.81-1214,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1813.52,1814.784,Mr. Gardner.
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1814.784,1823.641,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.772,1848.675,Why isn't it... why do you think this issue was not decided in Albernaz?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1848.675,1856.751,Because in Albernaz the two statutes under which punishment was imposed were separate offenses.
1982.81-1214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.512,1874.12,"Well, that should make it even more of a violation."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1874.12,1875.949,"--More what, sir?"
1982.81-1214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.949,1880.773,Make it even more of a violation of the double jeopardy clause.
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1887.332,1896.705,"Here they are the same; in Albernaz they were separate offenses, in the sense that in this case there's no element in the underlying felony which is not in the greater felony."
1982.81-1214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1971.124,1984.199,"--And the Blockburger test is that the defendant can't receive two sentences, or is it that he can't be sentenced to more than he could have gotten on one conviction?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,1984.199,1990.665,--It is that he can't receive two sentences under two statutes which satisfy the test.
1982.81-1214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1990.665,1992.522,Here he got concurrent sentences.
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2000.364,2001.331,That's right.
1982.81-1214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2001.331,2007.768,"And instead of which, he got 10 on one, 15 on the other, but to be concurrent."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2007.768,2009.141,That's right.
1982.81-1214,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2021.448,2037.191,"Mr. Gardner, the Solicitor General has filed a brief indicating that multiple punishment only occurs if the punishment exceeds the statutory maximum for a single offense."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2042.704,2047.828,The statutory maximum in each of these offenses is life imprisonment.
1982.81-1214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2105.35,2109.663,Would you be making the same argument if he got ten years on each to run concurrently?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2109.663,2111.02,"--Yes, sir, I would."
1982.81-1214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2113.991,2116.581,"Well, where's the multiple punishment if he serves only ten years?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2119.002,2123.126,--The multiple punishment is in the imposition of the sentences.
1982.81-1214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2123.126,2130.45,"Do you suggest that it may have an effect on his parole, for example, a negative effect?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2130.45,2136.526,"Well, the armed criminal action statute prohibits parole for three calendar years."
1982.81-1214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.556,2148.864,"If he's got two of them instead of one, even though they're concurrent, would that impair his, or affect his parole in Missouri law?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2148.864,2158.27,"--Assuming there wasn't that restriction on parole eligibility, I don't think it makes any difference how the two sentences affect his parole."
1982.81-1214,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.603,2184.884,"Mr. Gardner, I understand you apparently want to come within the language in a prior case that talks about multiple punishment for the same offense."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2193.786,2203.048,"The Missouri Supreme Court I think felt that, because it vacated both the conviction and the sentence."
1982.81-1214,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2247.747,2260.132,"Under your view would you concede, then, that the legislature could enact sentence enhancement provisions for a single conviction?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2260.132,2261.427,"Yes, it could."
1982.81-1214,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2290.369,2302.941,What policies do you think are advanced by prohibiting multiple convictions or multiple punishments under your view?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2302.941,2313.892,"Well, the policy is that there shall be no multiple punishment for the same offense, and when we have two statutes that--"
1982.81-1214,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2313.892,2314.344,Why?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2317.752,2329.165,"--The Constitution assumes that out of a multiplicity of statutes, some of them may only differently describe the same offense."
1982.81-1214,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2329.165,2335.916,What was the concern of the framers of the Constitution in putting in a double jeopardy clause?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2335.916,2341.851,One of their concerns was to ensure that there was no multiple punishment for the same offense.
1982.81-1214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2341.851,2346.722,Where does it speak about punishments in the double jeopardy clause?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2346.722,2364.792,"Well, the clause itself doesn't... the clause itself says a person shall not be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense, and this Court has said that one of the three parts of that clause is that there shall be no multiple punishment for the same offense."
1982.81-1214,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2364.792,2375.617,Where do you find evidence of the concern of the framers for preventing multiple punishment for multiple convictions?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2375.617,2388.22,I think the first draft of the Fifth Amendment reflects more clearly than the final draft that that was their concern.
1982.81-1214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2398.109,2399.56,You say the convention?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2399.56,2407.245,"I meant, Your Honor, when the states gathered to ratify the Bill of Rights."
1982.81-1214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2407.245,2414.693,Weren't they ratified in separate legislatures throughout the 13 states?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2414.693,2416.351,"I think they were, Your Honor."
1982.81-1214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.021,2421.085,In the New York debate?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2421.085,2422.302,Yes.
1982.81-1214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2498.287,2514.264,"I gather your position would be, had the sentence for armed criminal action been less than that imposed for the robbery that it would still be... the sentence for the armed criminal action would still be unconstitutional?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2514.264,2515.89,"--That's my position, Your Honor."
1982.81-1214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2576.301,2596.668,"Well, carried to a logical extreme, I suppose if there had been a sentence imposed on the armed criminal action conviction, but suspended, he never had to serve a day under it, you'd still say it was unconstitutional?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2596.668,2599.339,"If a sentence was imposed, it would be."
1982.81-1214,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2599.339,2611.537,"I hate to be technical, but you keep talking about punishment and the double jeopardy clause does not say punishment."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2614.442,2624.908,"Well, Your Honor, one of the three protections of the clause is that there shall be no multiple punishment for the same offense."
1982.81-1214,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2624.908,2626.406,Where is that in the Constitution.
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2626.406,2629.326,That is what this Court has said to be--
1982.81-1214,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2629.326,2632.247,"My question was, where was it in the Constitution."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2632.247,2633.635,--It comes from the Fifth Amendment.
1982.81-1214,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2633.635,2637.621,"The Fifth Amendment says ""called to answer"", doesn't it?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2640.963,2642.398,The multiple punishment--
1982.81-1214,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2642.398,2643.26,"Well, you read your copy."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2644.664,2646.243,--It does.
1982.81-1214,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2649.632,2650.49,Right.
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2650.49,2655.082,This Court has said that the Fifth Amendment means that.
1982.81-1214,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2655.082,2656.268,Right.
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2656.268,2669.807,"The Blockburger test is a rule of constitutional magnitude which prohibits the imposition of punishment under two statutes that are the same offense, even if the legislature intended it."
1982.81-1214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2699.514,2712.305,Would you say it's a rule of statutory construction even in the case where the state supreme court is responsible as the final arbiter of what a statute means?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2712.305,2715.053,Only in a certain very limited sense.
1982.81-1214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2747.306,2752.602,"Why do you say that, if it's over and above the constitutional import of the statute?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2767.954,2779.138,The canon that I'm referring to as the presumption that it's required to use is merely the canon that the state legislature acts with the Constitution in mind.
1982.81-1214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2779.138,2800.144,"Well, I take it, though, Mr. Gardner, if your Supreme Court had taken this very statute, this very one, and said, well, we construe that statute to mean that if there's also a conviction for armed criminal action, that's merely a basis for enhancement of the sentence imposed for the underlying felony, if they had done that, you couldn't... you wouldn't be here, I gather?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2800.144,2801.162,"Yes, sir, I mean that."
1982.81-1214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2802.301,2803.393,You would not be here.
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2803.393,2806.033,"--we would not be here, neither the state nor I."
1982.81-1214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2806.033,2828.619,"What if the Supreme Court of Missouri were to write an opinion saying, we know perfectly well that our legislature doesn't give a damn about the United States Constitution and we know that it's going to try to violate it every chance it gets, and so we're going to construe all of its acts that way, realizing that it may well have intended to trench on constitutional prohibitions."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2835.817,2842.629,It is not free... I think Whalen is the answer to the question.
1982.81-1214,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2850.155,2864.463,"But Whalen was this Court sitting as interpreting the intent of Congress, and I would think the Supreme Court of Missouri would have the same relationship as to intent to the Missouri legislature as this Court has to Congress."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2864.463,2877.114,I think a state court is not free to construe that its state legislature intended for punishment to be imposed under two statutes that are the same offense in the absence of an express declaration of that intent.
1982.81-1214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.114,2886.0,"Let me read you what the Court said in Whalen, that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has just referred to: 692..."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2904.211,2919.146,"In this case we have the presence of a clear indication of a contrary legislative intent, the part in the armed criminal action statute that authorized guilt of armed criminal action and punishment in addition to the underlying felony."
1982.81-1214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2944.852,2955.895,"Well then, do you think that statement that I have just read from Whalen is an erroneous statement of the law?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,2955.895,2957.724,"It is not erroneous, Your Honor."
1982.81-1214,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2997.019,3003.905,"Having said that, don't you run into the last two sentences of Albernaz?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,3003.905,3005.047,I sure do.
1982.81-1214,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3005.047,3009.076,Are they wrong?
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,3009.076,3012.917,They're correct in the context of Albernaz only.
1982.81-1214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3012.917,3023.353,"Well, I thought Albernaz, the last page of Albernaz, just embraced what Justice Blackmun said in Whalen."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,3023.353,3024.881,It did.
1982.81-1214,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3037.847,3040.502,"One of the last two sentences of Albernaz is plainly wrong, of course."
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,3054.462,3056.182,That's correct.
1982.81-1214,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.182,3058.978,"And surely that sentence wasn't necessary to the decision in that case, was it?"
1982.81-1214,1,25366,gary_l_gardner,,3058.978,3063.755,Which makes the Albernaz opinion not controlling authority for the Missouri Supreme Court.
1982.81-1214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3349.125,3350.299,Very well.
1982.81-1214,2,38075,philip_m_koppe,,3352.046,3354.296,If I haven't exhausted my rebuttal time.
1982.81-1214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3354.296,3355.357,You have three minutes.
1982.81-1214,2,38075,philip_m_koppe,,3355.357,3356.701,Thank you.
1982.81-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3432.149,3435.37,But under the other statute you propose he could have also imposed the same sentence.
1982.81-1214,2,38075,philip_m_koppe,,3442.741,3443.755,--That's true.
1982.81-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3443.755,3449.549,"So really, he could have done... he had total freedom under either this statute or the substitute you propose."
1982.81-1214,2,38075,philip_m_koppe,,3449.549,3453.581,"Well, except that his freedom was constrained by what the jury returned."
1982.81-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3462.219,3466.31,"Well, but the jury had to find him guilty of robbery in order to find him guilty of armed criminal--"
1982.81-1214,2,38075,philip_m_koppe,,3466.31,3473.824,"--Right, and the jury assessed the punishment under both statutes, and the judge's discretion was limited to either running the sentences concurrently or consecutively."
1982.81-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3480.304,3491.395,--Do you rely at all on the clarity of the statement of the intent of the legislature to define two separate... to have an enhancement situation where he can add to the penalty?
1982.81-1214,2,38075,philip_m_koppe,,3525.129,3531.313,"I think that would be permissible and I think some states, in reliance on this Court's opinion in Albernaz, have done precisely that."
1982.81-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.656,3543.73,So there is no real requirement of any... there is no federal requirement about the way the state legislature must express its intent.
1982.81-1214,2,38075,philip_m_koppe,,3548.76,3549.868,--That would certainly be our position.
1982.81-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3563.704,3567.767,"But your position would be the same, even if the intent were not clear, is what I'm trying to suggest."
1982.81-1214,2,38075,philip_m_koppe,,3567.767,3569.748,"--Well, if the intent were... if the intent were--"
1982.81-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3569.748,3572.295,As long as the state supreme court says that's the rule in this state.
1982.81-1214,2,38075,philip_m_koppe,,3572.295,3573.184,--That's correct.
