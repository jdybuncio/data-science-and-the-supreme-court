1985.84-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.217,We will hear arguments now in Bender against Williamsport School.
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,11.497,14.433,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,78.441,84.032,"Mr. Smart, do you think there is a jurisdictional question at all in this case?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,84.032,86.297,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,87.875,89.78,"Well, Mr. Youngman and his--"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,89.78,89.983,--All right.
1985.84-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.983,92.56,--and his position in the case.
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,95.589,101.54,"In our opinion, they did, Your Honor, and the case is properly here."
1985.84-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.507,106.397,"And, why do you think they have jurisdiction?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,106.397,117.253,"--Well, it was our judgment that Mr. Youngman probably stood in the same position as Mrs. Bashdi McCollum in the McCollum case in 1948 as a parent."
1985.84-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,134.373,140.416,"While you are on that subject, Mr. Youngman is no longer a member of the School Board, is he?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,140.416,142.681,"--Mr. Youngman is no longer a member of the School Board, as I understand it."
1985.84-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,142.681,145.617,"And, he no longer has any children in the school?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,145.617,148.334,He has a child in the Williamsport Area High School.
1985.84-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,148.334,149.849,How old?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,149.849,153.363,"I believe his child is in the ninth grade, if I am not mistaken."
1985.84-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,153.363,156.113,"Now, how does that bear on the issues."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,158.191,159.924,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,159.924,164.609,Was there any framing of liability against him individually in any sense?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,164.609,166.0,"Not that I am aware of, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,166.0,169.155,How is it relevant that he has got a child in the school.
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,170.607,176.588,"Well, Your Honor, in reviewing the McCollum case, it appeared that that was the case, but we would be quite content--"
1985.84-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,176.588,182.867,"In the McCollum case, wasn't there an allegation that the child was being offended in some way by these practices?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,188.505,191.629,"--I don't know the details on that, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,203.438,206.0,Why would that be the result?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,214.87,215.604,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,218.292,219.916,He is no longer.
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,219.916,222.086,He is no longer a member of the School Board.
1985.84-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,222.086,235.098,"Well, I know, but suppose the Court of Appeals said a piece of controversy has just washed out, wouldn't it have directed the district court to dismiss the case?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,235.098,237.032,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1985.84-773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.265,256.182,"Well, it might have been a valid decision at the time the district court rendered it, but I think our practice, since the time of the Munsingwear case, you know, some years ago, has been to say if it becomes moot on appeal, the whole thing washes out."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,262.679,267.035,"Well, if that were the case, then the Court of Appeals would have two options if that were the law, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,277.954,279.814,"Why not, Mr. Smart?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,283.203,285.249,"I believe that is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,286.374,288.279,"So, he had no support for his position at all."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,288.279,290.324,"--No, Your Honor, he did not."
1985.84-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,290.324,298.448,"Of course, the School Board doesn't decide the constitutional questions with finality, do they?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,298.448,319.176,"No, Your Honor, however, they do decide what course the School District takes and the Respondent is here in the capacity as an original member of this lawsuit against whom we sought individual liability, including attorney's fees, and he has represented that he is in this lawsuit at this point as a parent."
1985.84-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,319.176,323.422,"So, he could have been a plaintiff in the case originally?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,323.422,324.469,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,327.031,331.388,"So, you think he is still in the case?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,331.388,334.809,We believe he is still in the case and we believe it is still a valid case or controversy.
1985.84-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,359.487,363.749,Is that the same as the Widmar factual setting?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,363.749,368.499,"We think that constitutionally it is indistinguishable, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,368.499,369.638,I am speaking narrowly.
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,374.371,375.699,"That is exactly correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,375.699,378.698,"If they wanted to advance socialism, they could do it?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,378.698,379.745,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,379.745,382.525,"They were free entirely, weren't they?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,382.525,387.101,They were free entirely to conduct their meetings as they saw fit.
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,396.675,397.471,Did they have to do something?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,400.142,401.157,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,418.026,425.57,You mentioned that some of these youngsters were in the ninth grade.
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,440.094,447.029,"Your Honor, our case concerns only age 14, grade nine through twelve."
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,448.638,459.665,"Suppose, as in another school district, your high school consisted of grades ten, eleven and twelve and the junior high had nine as is the case in many communities."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,466.615,477.86,"No, it... Well, it would depend on whether the school had created a free-speech opportunity for the students through some kind of self-initiated activity forum."
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,477.86,481.171,Then you would go down to the first and second grades on that basis?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,481.171,481.593,No.
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,491.028,495.463,Suppose they wanted to play chess.
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,503.132,527.075,"I think that there is going to be... Of course, the Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals was concerned about the impressionability and age of students and I would have to frankly admit that I think there is some age at which any sort of religious activities going on may reasonably be interpreted by a student as having been sponsored by the school."
1985.84-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.019,559.593,"Mr. Smart, in this case, a faculty member was present at the Petros meetings."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,559.593,560.779,That is correct.
1985.84-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,560.779,563.482,"But, not participating, is that the record evidence?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,563.482,565.357,"That is exactly the record evidence, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,565.357,572.821,Does the record disclose whether the teachers had been instructed not to actively participate?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,572.821,579.007,"The record does not disclose that, although I think it is clear that that is what did happen."
1985.84-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,579.007,585.755,Would your conclusion be the same if the teacher had actively participated in the meeting?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,585.755,586.63,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,612.244,612.775,Mr. Smart--
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,612.775,613.103,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.103,626.847,"--if that is your position, supposing the time that is devoted to this activity is needed to qualify the school for its academic diplomas and all the rest, and as I understand, you can't tell from the record whether it is counted or not."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,640.249,647.231,"I don't see that that is a significant constitutional connection, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,665.537,674.533,"Well, if that is your position, why would it matter if the monitor was an employee of the school and who directed the activity?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,678.719,683.608,--I am not sure I understand the question.
1985.84-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,683.608,685.668,The issue as you put it is whether it is state action or not.
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,685.668,685.856,That is right.
1985.84-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,685.856,693.291,"And, if it is action that is necessary in order to have these students be qualified for a state diploma, why is it not state action?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,693.291,700.772,"Well, Your Honor, the state action consists of having them on the premises in the question that you put forth."
1985.84-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,815.82,822.364,"Mr. Smart, to get back to the teacher, is there anything in the record to show what the teacher is there for?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,822.364,823.114,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.813,839.874,Couldn't that have been accomplished in the hallways?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,839.874,841.935,Couldn't it be accomplished in the hallways?
1985.84-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,843.342,852.212,"I mean, if you stationed yourself in the hallways, you would find out whether or not they have left unless they jumped out a window."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,852.212,856.444,"--That is right, Your Honor, and that is an excellent point, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,864.145,867.799,"Was the teacher monitoring or anything, that is what I want to know?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,867.799,873.906,"Your Honor, the teacher was grading tests during this time and I think that is pretty--"
1985.84-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,873.906,878.921,"Just needed, you say, in case something comes up."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,878.921,880.748,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1985.84-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,880.748,881.342,Like what?
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,881.342,886.229,"--Well, it is the duty of the School District to keep the students on the premises."
1985.84-773,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,902.957,916.217,"Mr. Smart, I thought the record indicated that the teacher was there to take the roll to make sure the students were present and then to remain because of disciplinary problems."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,916.217,925.558,"--There is a reference in the record to the teacher taking the roll, although I think that what actually happened was that the students signed a roster in actuality."
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,957.609,967.275,"Mr. Smart, in the Appendix, pages 95 and 96, which is a deposition apparently, there is a question:"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,992.032,993.967,"That is my understanding, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,993.967,995.545,"Nothing else, just be there."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,995.545,997.388,I think that fits the record in this case.
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,997.388,1001.606,"Hardly the normal definition of supervision, is it?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,1001.606,1011.351,"Well, Your Honor, I think that if you look at the purpose of the activity period, it is not a curricular activity period, it is an extra-curricular period, and--"
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1011.351,1012.508,"But, what is the situation."
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,1022.317,1024.05,--It is my understanding that it does.
1985.84-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1034.328,1041.918,"Well, if it is required, what importance is the nomenclature the School Board puts on it as required or not?"
1985.84-773,0,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,1041.918,1048.243,"--Well, I think the curricular/non-curricular distinction is a distinction this Court has used in the past."
1985.84-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1117.591,1127.321,Very well.
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1127.759,1131.101,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1163.995,1174.458,"Mr. Fried, may I ask if the federal interest would be adequately satisfied by a decision that the Appellant here didn't have standing to appeal and the judgment of the Court of Appeals was vacated?"
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1174.458,1184.502,The doubt which the Court of Appeals has raised about the act would still be there.
1985.84-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.982,1195.7,"But, you wouldn't have any doubt about how it would come out in the Third Circuit, would you?"
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1195.7,1196.809,"I would not, sir."
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.714,1202.572,I am not sure of what your answer is.
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1207.118,1209.162,"The cloud would still be there, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.162,1210.632,"So, you would rather have an advisory--"
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1210.632,1217.518,"On the jurisdictional point, Justice Stevens, we do discuss that on page five of our brief."
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1473.759,1474.446,"--I do, Mr. Fried, if you have a moment."
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1490.19,1493.642,The Petitioners in this case made--
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.642,1495.828,"Petitioners... I am sorry, go ahead."
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1495.828,1504.185,--Petitioners made that allegation and it was not controverted and it was the basis for the District Court's judgment and for the judgement of the Court of Appeals.
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.185,1511.104,Was any pleading filed other than the one answer by the School Board as an entity?
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1514.478,1511.104,Not that I am aware of.
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.491,1520.46,He surfaced at the time of the notice of appeal.
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1520.46,1523.504,"I am not sure of the answer to that, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1523.504,1534.814,"Mr. Fried, I know that you passed over the standing of jurisdiction question and referred to the passage in the Solicitor General's brief on the subject."
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1554.649,1571.314,"A student may allege an injury of a constitutional dimension if that student alleges that the going on of such activities in his school is, as it were, constitutionally offensive to that student."
1985.84-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.605,1585.526,"But, we don't know that any of them are before us, do we?"
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1585.526,1586.901,Of the Petros students?
1985.84-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1586.901,1587.51,Right.
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1587.51,1593.836,"I believe that the Petros students are included among the class of Petitioners, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1593.836,1594.288,All right.
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1600.396,1610.939,I think the way to put that concern to rest would be to realize that the School Board is still preventing Petros from meeting.
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1627.337,1630.82,"Mr. Fried, were they doing that at the time the appeal was taken?"
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1633.741,1636.443,"--But, after the appeal and at this moment--"
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.443,1640.083,"But, at the time the appeal was taken, what was the controversy?"
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1646.94,1658.2,"--Mr. Youngman, I believe, at that time was claiming on his behalf as a parent--"
1985.84-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.2,1659.808,Where in the record do you find that?
1985.84-773,1,18942,charles_fried,,1659.808,1667.008,--I cannot point you to the section of the record.
1985.84-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1681.925,1690.968,Mr. Youngman?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1690.968,1693.046,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1732.28,1737.137,"And, did the judgment of the District Court grant any relief against you in your individual capacity?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1737.137,1743.087,"That is still to be decided, Justice Stevens."
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1743.087,1746.399,"Well, if one reads the judgment, one cannot find any relief against you as an individual."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1751.414,1752.086,That is correct.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.086,1754.866,And a judgment you didn't agree with.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1754.866,1755.489,That is right.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.489,1759.239,"So, if you were going to obey the law, you were stuck with it."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1759.239,1762.346,Unless I appealed.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.346,1762.674,Yes.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1779.198,1780.948,That is still to be decided.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1794.443,1798.707,You must be relying on Kentucky against Graham.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1798.707,1799.223,What?
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.223,1804.345,You must be relying on Kentucky against Graham which clearly makes you not liable for fees.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1804.345,1804.752,That is right.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.515,1851.153,"Well, how did he ever become one?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1851.153,1858.011,--Through Supreme Court Rule 28 as a successor in interest who agrees with my position.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.011,1864.18,"So, you think that here he is now a Respondent?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1864.18,1864.804,That is right.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1864.804,1870.896,"And, that is in his capacity as a member of... in his official capacity of--"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1870.896,1871.193,That is right.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1872.286,1873.832,"--And, he can speak for the entire Board?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1873.832,1876.284,"No, that isn't the point."
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.202,1891.168,"And to impose a liability for fees and costs on the Board itself, one person can do that?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1891.168,1895.573,"Well, I think I have the right to oppose that myself and I think--"
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1895.573,1897.76,I say impose it.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1905.726,1912.52,"--No, I don't presume to litigate on behalf of the entire Board."
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.777,1935.402,May I just ask one more question and then I won't take any more of your time?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1935.402,1935.683,--Yes.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.683,1946.085,"Prior to your filing the Notice of Appeal in this case, had you independently taken any action or had anybody on the School Board taken any action to resist the claim other than to file an answer?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1946.085,1947.413,Yes.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.893,1956.081,"By fighting, did they take any depositions?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1956.081,1957.065,Yes.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.065,1958.268,Whose deposition did they--
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1958.268,1960.642,They took the deposition of the principal and--
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1960.642,1963.546,--The Plaintiffs' lawyer took the deposition of the principal.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1963.546,1963.812,--Yes.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.812,1966.343,Did the Defendants' lawyer take any depositions?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,1966.343,1983.366,"No, but the Defendants' lawyer procured affidavits of both the principal and the superintendent, submitted papers and briefs, and argued the motion, the cross-motion for summary judgment."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2047.544,2051.745,Record of Appendix?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2051.745,2097.367,"Joint Appendix, excuse me."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2216.71,2218.116,Mr. Youngman--
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2218.116,2218.413,Yes.
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2218.413,2221.457,--You gave Joint Appendix 33 as a source.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2223.753,2224.737,"Eighty-three, excuse me."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2224.737,2225.253,--Eighty-three.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2225.253,2227.361,"Eighty-three, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-773,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.501,2272.702,"Mr. Youngman, why are you reading us these excerpts?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2276.747,2277.56,That is right.
1985.84-773,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.56,2282.542,Did the Court of Appeals disagree with any of the District Court's factual--
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2282.542,2295.304,"The Court of Appeals did not disagree, however, we believe that the Court of Appeals misread the nature of the forum."
1985.84-773,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2295.304,2302.831,"--Well, then, you are asking us to upset a finding made by the District Court and not upset by the Court of Appeals?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2302.831,2303.815,That is correct.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.815,2308.11,"And, if we don't do that, do you lose or do you have other grounds?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2308.11,2311.125,"We certainly have other grounds, Justice White."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2491.397,2510.625,"Now, do you mean by that, if you will clear it up for me, that if the faculty member was there they can participate in the debate of the students on a political issue?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2510.625,2512.203,--And do.
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.778,2526.976,"So, if the faculty advisor had republican leanings, he could... or she... could influence the line of discussion, is that what you are suggesting?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2526.976,2530.834,"Well, there was no Republican Club."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2530.834,2533.052,I am giving you a hypothetical.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2533.052,2533.646,If--
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2533.646,2538.723,"They could have one, could they not, a Republican or a Democratic Club?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2538.723,2547.75,"--They could have had one, but that was not the nature of the forum as it existed at Williamsport High School."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2547.75,2554.497,"But, we are concerned here with the scope of the authority as well as what really took place."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2569.929,2577.067,I am not sure.
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.236,2584.016,"Well, can you suggest anything in the program that prohibits that?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2584.016,2610.756,There is nothing except that the clubs that were in this forum were uncontroversial and I believe that the School Board would not have opened this forum generally to First Amendment speech on the ground that they would not have wanted to promote controversy and divisiveness.
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2621.532,2639.619,"Do you suggest the school performs its function of getting young people ready for citizenship if it would forbid a group to get together, one asserting a democratic position and one asserting a republican position and perhaps someone asserting a socialist position?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2641.978,2647.115,"If there were a non-public forum, I believe, yes."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2741.078,2746.014,Let me come back to this other question because I am perplexed by your responses.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2770.254,2775.626,My reaction is that that would be permitted.
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.626,2779.048,How could you discuss that--
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2779.048,2789.404,"But, it would be... The point is it would have an advisor there and would be subject to structure and direction from the School District."
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.951,2841.852,--What if the student group wasn't going to have a debate about the budget but it was students against taxation and they wanted to have their meeting like all the other groups around and that is how they can oppose taxation?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2862.451,2864.076,I don't think so.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.076,2873.807,"What makes you think that the ordinary member of the public would think that the views expressed at this... what is the name of the group, Petros?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2873.807,2874.244,Petros.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.244,2879.68,Why would the public think that the views expressed there were the school's?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2879.68,2882.819,"The problem isn't the public, Justice White."
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2882.819,2883.491,What is it?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2883.491,2886.614,It is the students themselves.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.614,2888.363,"Well, all right, the students."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2898.61,2904.295,If this was the Anti-Taxation Club and it had an advisor--
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2904.295,2904.654,Yes.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2904.654,2911.87,--that activity would be viewed by the students at the high school as being approved by the--
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.87,2914.525,You say that too.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2921.334,2921.6,--Yes.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.6,2924.286,--taxation and even though the school's life depends on it.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2928.488,2933.704,"Well, it is silly until you consider the nature of public high schools."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2966.269,2974.344,"Do you think the standards should be set to gauge to the lowest common denominator, the retarded?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,2976.937,2996.071,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice, but some accommodation has to be given to that situation, just as I don't think you should gear the standard to the highest level, because you span the gambit."
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3016.174,3029.232,"Well, what if in the next room beside... along side the group of Against All Taxation is a group that is... It is called the Committee for Fair Taxation and they... supporting taxation."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3037.243,3040.493,There--
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3040.493,3043.913,You mean some might think one and some might think the other.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3043.913,3050.817,"--You have opposites in the forum and there it is more difficult, I grant."
1985.84-773,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3065.266,3080.384,"Well, in judging the effect of a particular course of conduct for Establishment Clause purposes, wouldn't we apply an objective test that would ask what a reasonable student would think?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3080.384,3086.163,"Well, you would apply an objective test, that is true."
1985.84-773,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3106.78,3116.009,"A reasonable person's standard, not one that is geared either to the high or the low end of the spectrum or to individual problems."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3116.009,3126.849,"--But, I don't think you can entirely discount the fact that you do have the low end of the spectrum in this particular situation."
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3133.877,3142.765,"Mr. Youngman, in defending this case, was any effort made to bring out evidence that would support the suggestion you are making that some of the high school students would perceive endorsement?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3145.015,3146.185,No.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.185,3149.903,The Court of Appeals certainly made a lot of it.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3149.903,3150.34,That is right.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.196,3161.899,Even though nobody in the trial of the case thought it important enough--
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3161.899,3170.035,Even though the record doesn't have expert testimony in this regard.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.79,3210.331,"--But, Mr. Youngman, isn't it true that this program was permitted to operate for about a year after the District Court decision and there is nothing in the record to suggest anybody was even remotely unhappy about it in any way, got any misperceptions or anything."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3213.971,3214.532,That is true.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3242.366,3247.362,"Does the record tell us anything about the attendance during that year, how popular the group was?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3247.362,3255.577,--The record says that the club did not exceed 45 members.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.577,3256.874,That was at the very first meeting.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3256.874,3257.343,That is right.
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.343,3260.436,There were about 20 at the second meeting and they met for a year.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3261.997,3263.451,"No, the record doesn't show how many met."
1985.84-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3263.451,3266.074,--We don't know if it is two or three or twenty or thirty.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3266.074,3268.776,You don't know that from the record.
1985.84-773,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3297.733,3300.779,May I ask this question?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3307.996,3309.057,No.
1985.84-773,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3322.037,3324.879,Without regard to the age of the children?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3324.879,3326.441,"Without regard to the age, that is right."
1985.84-773,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3328.222,3329.345,In what respect?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3329.345,3336.108,In intellect from educably mentally retarded to gifted.
1985.84-773,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3336.108,3339.388,"That has to do with age though, maturity."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3339.388,3349.135,"Well, it has to do with age, but it also has to do with maturity regardless of age too, and that is the point."
1985.84-773,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3349.135,3356.537,The test turns in this case solely on the question of the age of the pupils?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3356.537,3358.35,"No, it also turns--"
1985.84-773,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3358.35,3362.895,The Court of Appeals said that explicitly.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3362.895,3367.908,"--Yes, but I don't believe that that should be the test."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3375.951,3384.667,"Who finances the University of Missouri, taxpayers, the same as the grade school and high school?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3384.667,3388.446,"As I understand it, the taxpayers did finance the university."
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3388.446,3390.274,It is a public school?
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3390.274,3410.876,"That is correct, that is correct, but the university situation is different from the secondary and elementary education provided in the compulsory attendance setting and there is just no way to avoid that."
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3410.876,3434.319,"Mr. Youngman, suppose we reverse the Court of Appeals and the School Board says, well, even if this is not an establishment, we nevertheless don't want the group to meet and we are perfectly free to do that just as our own decision."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3438.535,3455.732,District and Circuit Court's decision with respect to the open forum question would mean that any First Amendment club has a right to be in that forum.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.732,3462.166,"--So, the free-speech interest would get them into the school regardless of the wishes of the school?"
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3462.166,3463.416,That is correct.
1985.84-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3463.416,3465.696,At least that is what the two courts below said.
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3465.696,3466.212,That is right.
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3476.91,3479.441,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Youngman."
1985.84-773,2,33710,john_c_youngman_jr,,3479.441,3479.691,Thank you.
1985.84-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3479.691,3481.815,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Smart?"
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3481.815,3482.362,"A few comments, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.805,3512.413,Would you say that under the... Would you say that if we reverse the Court of Appeals the School Board could nevertheless keep your group out?
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3512.413,3515.551,--I think it would be an entirely different case.
1985.84-773,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.551,3517.098,"Well, that isn't what I asked you."
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3517.098,3517.332,Yes.
1985.84-773,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.284,3521.783,Do you mean despite their free-speech interest?
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3521.783,3522.033,--No.
1985.84-773,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3526.142,3529.547,"Well, yes, there is a structured activity period, isn't there?"
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3529.547,3531.201,--Yes.
1985.84-773,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3535.933,3541.915,"Well, if there is a forum in the school, you would think your group should be able to get in."
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3545.351,3546.539,"Yes, Your Honor, we would argue that."
1985.84-773,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3546.539,3557.035,"Well, what if the school policy were that we will have an activities period and it is open only to secular groups to meet."
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3570.748,3580.946,"Your Honor, I do not believe that they could articulate a valid reason for having only secular activities once they have opened the forum."
1985.84-773,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3591.973,3597.144,I gather they would simply have to abandon the whole program to keep your group out.
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3597.144,3600.814,"Your Honor, I think they would not have to abandon the whole program."
1985.84-773,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3622.414,3627.382,"Mr. Smart, do you take the position your clients have the right to use the bulletin boards as the other activity groups do?"
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3627.382,3630.208,"No, Your Honor, that is not in this case."
1985.84-773,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3631.927,3635.331,"I know they haven't sought it, but assume they did seek it."
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3637.72,3653.245,"If our students had sought that right, then I think this Court would want to know more about the details of how that is administered, who puts the notices up there, who determines what is up there, and that sort of thing."
1985.84-773,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3676.19,3691.261,"Well, Mr. Smart, under your view, would the Board have to permit some group such as Sons of Satan or whatever it might be that would be entirely anti-religious to come and meet?"
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3691.261,3696.026,"Yes, Your Honor, the School Board would have to permit that."
1985.84-773,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3696.026,3697.743,Or a neo-Nazi party?
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3697.743,3703.365,Or a neo-Nazi party unless the School Board can articulate a compelling interest.
1985.84-773,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3735.806,3742.022,Did both parties here agree that in this instance an open forum had been created?
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3742.022,3744.194,--Did both parties agree?
1985.84-773,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3744.194,3745.833,Both sides.
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3745.833,3751.111,"Both sides in the District Court I think, in effect, agreed that at least that was not contested."
1985.84-773,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3751.111,3756.328,"So, perhaps it isn't necessary in this case to wrestle with all those problems."
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3756.328,3757.109,That is exactly right.
1985.84-773,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3757.109,3759.905,The only barrier is the Establishment Clause now?
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3759.905,3766.872,The only thing we are asking this Court is to decide that our group does not face any additional barrier because of the Establishment Clause.
1985.84-773,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3766.872,3778.32,"But, wasn't an issue in the Court of Appeals whether any kind of an open forum had been created at all, because the Court of Appeals certainly spent a lot of time discussing it and saying, yes, there is one."
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3778.32,3783.692,That was certainly argued by Mr. Youngman in the Court of Appeals that there was no public forum created.
1985.84-773,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3783.692,3784.395,Exactly.
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3789.518,3792.595,"Yes, Your Honor, he could argue that."
1985.84-773,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3805.169,3809.074,"Mr. Smart, does the record contain the legal opinion on which the School Board relied?"
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3809.074,3810.166,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3810.166,3813.321,Does the record contain the legal opinion on which the School Board relied?
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3813.321,3821.723,"It does not contain the letter from the attorney, however, we do have a recitation in the record from the Superintendent of what the attorney said."
1985.84-773,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3821.723,3822.004,I understand.
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3823.614,3838.467,"The opinion itself is not in the record, but it is clear from the record that the opinion of the attorney concerning the Establishment Clause was the only reason and I think that it would be a different case if the school had said it is inappropriate for this reason or that reason or some other reason."
1985.84-773,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3840.154,3841.092,Your time has expired.
1985.84-773,3,33054,james_madison_smart_jr,,3841.092,3841.514,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1985.84-773,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3841.514,3843.045,"Thank you, gentlemen."
