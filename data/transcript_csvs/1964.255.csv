1964.255,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.242,"The American Ship Building Company, Petitioner, versus National Labor Relations Board."
1964.255,0,46395,william_s_tyson,,20.991,25.046,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1556.14,1560.769,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1681.742,1690.792,"Well, is it your â€“ Mr. Come, is it your interpretation that just took place during the course of bargaining or after an impasse had been reached?"
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1690.792,1701.366,"I believe that the examiner found that an impasse had been reached and that finding was not disturbed by the Board, so that we do have an impasse in this case."
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1717.159,1721.968,"Yes, but what you said was with that bargaining position as though this was during the bargaining before an impasse is reached --"
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1721.968,1722.573,Well --
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1722.573,1725.076,I didn't -- I just wondered about the legitimate --
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1725.076,1734.671,"Well, to -- to get his contract terms rather than the terms that the union was demanding."
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1870.166,1883.297,"Now, Mr. Come is this right or tell me if I'm wrong, that before any -- before any National Labor legislation, there's no question at all under the law of the employer's right to lockout."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1883.297,1884.122,For any reason.
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1884.122,1892.244,For any reason and there was considerable question about the employees' right to strike for various legal reason.
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1911.09,1923.322,"But on the other hand, Your Honor, taking the promise that the employer could lockout for any reason, he could also lockout for the purpose of beating a union."
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2022.902,2037.252,Was there any discussion of this at all in the -- to be found with the legislative history either Wagner Act or the Taft-Hartley Act or the legislation in 1959 the Labor Management Disclosure Act.
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2037.252,2053.147,The only that indicated discussion that I can find is a bit of the Wagner Act history which is referred to by the Court in our footnote in Buffalo Linen.
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2088.853,2093.771,"We don't have here, however, any anti-union purpose in the lockout."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2093.771,2095.077,"No Your Honor, you do not."
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2121.55,2137.654,"Was the Erie Resistor you add, the employer resort to a device, the super-seniority for replacements for people who didn't have to come and strike which really in the experience of industrial experience makes the final settlement very difficult."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2139.05,2142.285,"Well, that is true."
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2208.326,2209.752,Assuming that Mr. Come --
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2209.752,2209.879,Yes.
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2209.879,2213.131,-- there is something about the spirit of statute that's involved.
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2215.273,2215.901,"Well, I would like --"
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2215.901,2232.172,"And I -- I would like you for a moment that anytime in your argument, address yourself to the basic concept that whether you believe when the Congress adapted this statute which was designed primarily to prevent anti-union device, the Wagner operation."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2253.373,2313.286,"Well, I think one of the basic purposes of the Act is this evident from the Section 1 was to equalize the bargaining power of employees and employers and the way that -- one of the basic ways in which the Congress thought to do that was to protect the right of the employees to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing and to engage in a concerted activities from mutual aid and protection and as part of that panoply as this Court has recognized to safeguard the right to strike and now what I'd like to show is the very serious consequences that a bargaining lockout has on the right of employees to strike which this Court --"
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2313.286,2329.605,"Well, it doesn't Mr. Come that -- you -- you correctly said that the basic underlying spirit of this legislation was to equalize -- was to equalize and come you say into a balance."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2343.164,2347.299,I don't think that there is any affirmative indication that that is (Voice Overlap)
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2347.299,2352.242,But you agree with me don't you that the employer prior to any national legislation did have the right to lockout.
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2352.242,2352.912,That is correct.
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2353.703,2359.834,And you agreed further that the right to strike was in a serious question in the said area.
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2359.834,2373.465,I would like to demonstrate though that to give the employer the right to lockout far from equalizing the situation would give him an unduly advantage that would keep the scales in his favor.
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2373.465,2380.426,"So the Congress gave it to him, I said the Congress proceeded on the assumption that he had it."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2380.426,2384.858,"Well, but Congress took it away."
1964.255,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2529.409,2542.565,"Mr. Come, does this argument finally get you to the point that there never can be circumstances in which outside of the multiemployer set up that single employer may resort to lockout."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2542.565,2544.726,"No, it does not."
1964.255,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2545.347,2553.946,What circumstances would the employer resort to lockout that would not have the effect to describe the force on the right to strike?
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2553.946,2562.123,Where it is used for a currently defensive purpose and does not preempt the use of the strike weapon.
1964.255,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2580.585,2591.558,If we're looking for general principle where the Board suggests them that the resort to the lockout weapon is never permissible except as a defensive move.
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2591.558,2601.965,I think that that is basically the line that the Board has drawn because in -- it used that as an offensive weapon.
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2639.172,2641.428,I don't quite understand the use of the word defensive.
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2694.778,2720.355,"I think in that case, you might well say that the union has already indicated that it is going to use the strike weapon and it has made it difficult for the employer to operate and that gets you pretty close to a Betts Cadillac line --"
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2720.355,2728.47,"The union disclaimed the right to hold full scale strike in its literature, in its resolution then in its statement."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2728.47,2741.987,"Well, the Board's position is not so wooden that it's going to force an employer to operate under circumstances where the union is playing games and I think that's the kind of --"
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2741.987,2745.815,"Where do you find then the Board's decision, the position that one knows that --"
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2745.815,2765.319,"Well, I think that you find in all of the lockout cases since Duluth Bottling in over the years, an indication that the Board looks pretty carefully to the facts of the particular cases."
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2766.711,2778.8,"And the difficulty here is this, you, I think, correctly stated strike is a serious business, the union does not ordinarily engage in a strike and this was the last resort, all of which I think industrial history teach it."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2802.368,2823.958,But on the findings of the Board which have been sustained by the Court of Appeals he had no reasonable basis for anticipating that there was going to be either a full-pledged strike or one of these quickie deals at any point in the picture.
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2823.958,2844.461,"Accepting that why wouldn't employer justified in saying to get the type of the agreement that we need in order to carry on our business without saying that there's a lot of business, I think we'll have to just -- this ought to be done to bring a sense of realism into the collective bargaining process."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2844.461,2866.926,"Well, for the simple reason that giving the employer that power does in this particular case under these facts throws employees out of work who might never have gone out on work and they are out of work."
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3092.967,3093.963,Probably there's a big difference.
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3102.161,3106.944,Aren't there straight focus as to follow the -- that has covered both.
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3123.963,3124.818,That is correct.
1964.255,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3153.21,3161.57,"Well now, Mr. Come we talked about, we -- we've talked about the basic purpose of this legislation as to give the equality of bargaining power."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3190.409,3227.697,"I submit that that view, I respectfully submit, overlooks the fact or at least does not fully take into account the fact that the employer has these other alternatives at his disposal, the utterances that were made at the -- at the time that the lockout is the corollary of the right to strike were made at a very early stage of the development of this law."
1964.255,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3296.464,3305.851,"Well, what do you say from this fact, that of 85% of all labor agreement usually contain a clause."
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3324.511,3331.104,"Well, I think that the -- to be frank with you that that's one interpretation."
1964.255,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3428.761,3434.342,How widespread is the use of lockout?
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3434.342,3437.844,"To my knowledge Your Honor, it's not very widespread at all."
1964.255,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3437.844,3440.725,It follows the limits of the (Inaudible).
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3440.725,3444.958,I think it is because it's been pretty well settled.
1964.255,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3475.039,3480.567,But it has a factor against the union and the employer.
1964.255,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3491.388,3500.044,"Well, if he feels that he can get a contract on his own terms though, however, it may be worth it."
1964.255,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3515.075,3517.256,Mr. Tyson.
1964.255,2,46395,william_s_tyson,,3517.256,3519.469,May it please the Court.
1964.255,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3591.377,3597.457,"Mr. Tyson, how would you answer this, which I think is underlies and splashed out of the last moment."
1964.255,2,46395,william_s_tyson,,3641.697,3666.087,I am very pleased that you asked that question if Your Honor please because I had failed to make clear that I am in thorough agreement with what this Court said in the Truck Drivers case that the rights protected under Section 7 for the employees that an invasion of those rights in an attempt to right the union or frustrate organizational levels --
1964.255,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3666.087,3690.368,"What does the employer says, I don't want to break the union, all I want is to preserve my existing wage scale which I think is the only way economically I can operate, and then therefore in order to make clear that I'm serious about this and that I better shut so the people will be able to influence their union to make this highly reasonable deal."
1964.255,2,46395,william_s_tyson,,3690.368,3721.029,"Of course, as you know Justice Goldberg, neither side is forced under this Act to make a concession and we get to that question that you asked a moment ago about an impasse and in further response to that, in considering the questions that were asked by you and by Justice Brennan, I think my thinking on that probably was heavily weighted because of the situation here where there was an impasse."
1964.255,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3729.815,3740.914,You might -- you might be guilty of a refusal to bargain if you -- if there is strike or a lockout before an impasse or refusal to bargain and in good faith which is also a violation of the Act.
1964.255,2,46395,william_s_tyson,,3740.914,3743.503,You could be -- you could be that that --
1964.255,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3743.503,3747.839,Because you have the duty to bargain to an impasse generally speaking.
1964.255,2,46395,william_s_tyson,,3747.839,3749.615,That's possible.
