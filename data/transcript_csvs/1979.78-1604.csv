1979.78-1604,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.813,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Central Machinery Company against Arizona State Tax Commission.
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,16.882,19.967,Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.
1979.78-1604,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.395,177.239,"Mr. Lewis, would you agree that if, instead of the transaction taking place on the Gila River Reservation, it had taken place in New Mexico and Arizona had sought to levy its privilege tax, it would be taxable?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,177.239,184.084,"I am not sure whether or not there would be a sufficient connection to the State of Arizona, allowing Arizona to impose that tax."
1979.78-1604,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,190.266,204.063,But if there had been a -- do you -- do you think the same standard would govern or do you think that it's the licensing by the Secretary of Interior and the other peculiarly Indian aspects of this case that govern?
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,204.063,215.219,I don't think the licensing by the Interior is dispositive in this case nor do I think it would be handled the same way regarding a transaction in New Mexico.
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,281.759,285.472,"Mr. Lewis, could I ask you a question."
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,288.32,290.862,The transaction was approved by the Federal Government.
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,292.376,292.773,And --
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,292.773,293.026,-- representatives and the Superintendent.
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,293.026,299.577,"-- when -- when it was approved, did the person who granted the approval know the terms of the transaction?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,299.577,301.564,He knew the terms of the transaction.
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,309.937,315.71,Can it be inferred that the approval carried with it approval of the transaction tax?
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,315.71,317.665,"No, it cannot."
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,336.514,341.561,Was -- was there any objection made on behalf of the Federal Government to the payment of the tax?
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,341.561,347.818,"There is no objection, at that time, made under -- made by the Federal Government to the imposition of the tax."
1979.78-1604,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.421,421.632,"Well, does that -- do you mean to argue that if the -- if the Indian purchasers had left the reservation and gone into the city or gone into a town or some neighborhood -- neighboring community and negotiated the purchase of a tractor, paid for it there and took -- and delivery taken there that -- that the seller would have had to qualify as an Indian trader?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,421.632,428.646,"If we went off the reservation to buy these tractors, we would be subject to the Arizona transaction privilege tax."
1979.78-1604,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,428.646,434.801,And the -- and whoever -- and the seller wouldn't have to -- wouldn't have to be recognized as an Indian trader.
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,434.801,438.626,The seller would not have to be recognized as an Indian trader.
1979.78-1604,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,439.314,451.803,"Well, what if you -- what if he went off to the reservation and took -- and bought -- bought and paid for the tractor in the adjoining community and asked that it be delivered on the reservation?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,451.803,453.834,That's -- that would not be our case.
1979.78-1604,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,453.834,454.086,"I know it isn't your case, but --"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,454.086,456.486,That -- that's a different situation.
1979.78-1604,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.476,471.778,Yes.
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,471.778,477.99,The Federal Government has traditionally and historically regulated trading involving Indians.
1979.78-1604,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.522,785.562,"Well, shouldn't -- should -- should Central had a license."
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,785.562,788.927,Central did not need a license in this case.
1979.78-1604,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,798.78,803.945,"You're saying that the trading statute did apply, the only -- except for the licensing provision, is that it?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,803.945,805.183,The trader statutes apply.
1979.78-1604,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,822.459,829.009,You're suggesting that the licensing would be a -- is merely a matter of form of formality?
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,829.009,831.923,"In this case, it was a mere formality."
1979.78-1604,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.731,848.175,Was the extent of the economic burden any factor in your argument or is it just a straight preemption argument?
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,848.175,850.869,"Well, that's basically our argument."
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.726,930.841,"Mr. Lewis, let me just be sure I understood you correctly."
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,939.598,939.83,No.
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.097,964.747,"This cannot be applied if they go off the reservation, negotiate the whole transaction and go back on the reservation and sign the papers."
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,964.747,966.765,"Well, I think if delivery was made on the reservation --"
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.765,970.259,"Well, it's always going to be made on the -- the delivery was made on the reservation --"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,970.259,970.587,"Yes, it was."
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.587,973.269,"-- here and in -- I think, in Mr. Justice White's example too."
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,973.269,980.044,"I think it's the mere fact that some negotiations took place off the reservation, I still think, would prevent imposition of this tax, but --"
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,980.044,983.847,The key is where they sign the contract.
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,983.847,984.153,No.
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,990.382,990.552,"Yes, but in one case, he --"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,990.552,991.288,-- statutes regulate --
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.288,991.629,-- signs it in --
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,991.629,992.928,-- this trade.
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.928,998.444,"I mean, if the only difference is where you sign the contract, is that the difference between taxation and no taxation?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,998.444,1004.35,"No, that's not the difference between taxation and -- and no taxation."
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.593,1006.146,What is it then?
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1006.146,1015.875,"Well, the taxable event in this case was the -- this -- the transaction or the sale of the -- the sale of the tractors to the Gila River Indian Community."
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.748,1052.985,"Well, then, is it delivery any time merchandise is delivered on the reservation?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1060.405,1063.229,"The -- in this case, these events -- these events took --"
1979.78-1604,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.229,1063.777,"Well, I understand."
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1073.746,1079.529,The -- the line -- the line is -- is drawn when you're dealing with an Indian tribe with an Indian country.
1979.78-1604,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1112.4,1125.563,"But then, are you saying that it's the status of the Indian tribe that is the dispositive factor and that all these other factors are unimportant and irrelevant?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1125.563,1140.973,"Well, the -- the status of the Indian tribe, the fact that it occurred within Indian country, it was a commercial transaction, yes, those are the factors which preempt the Arizona State sales tax."
1979.78-1604,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1140.973,1156.635,"Well, certainly, Mescalero, the decision in our Court in -- several years ago, rejected the idea that the mere fact that it was -- it was an Indian tribe automatically meant federal preemption, did it not?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1156.635,1157.276,Did it not?
1979.78-1604,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.033,1175.591,"But, I mean, so far as the -- but if the status of the Indian tribe wasn't endowed so the status, by itself, wouldn't be given exemption here, would it, under -- under Mescalero."
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1175.591,1178.319,"Under Mescalero, that, of course, involved a different situation."
1979.78-1604,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1205.911,1227.741,"If the Tribe had sent a representative into Phoenix to buy a truck and it bought the truck off of an automobile dealer's light, taking the truck back to the reservation, would that be covered by the -- by your -- your submission here today?"
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1227.741,1230.688,"By the submission today, it would not be covered."
1979.78-1604,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1230.688,1234.324,That would -- you wouldn't be making the claim that you are making here today.
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1234.324,1236.006,We would not be making the claim.
1979.78-1604,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1236.006,1248.647,"Suppose that the agreement to purchase the truck, having been made in Phoenix, also provided that the truck would be delivered to the reservation."
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1248.647,1256.372,I think simple delivery of that -- of the truck on the reservation probably would not bring this -- this --
1979.78-1604,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1256.372,1257.847,Would not be quite enough.
1979.78-1604,0,39770,rodney_b_lewis,,1257.847,1264.687,Would not be quite enough.
1979.78-1604,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1264.687,1267.021,Very well.
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1277.368,1278.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it --"
1979.78-1604,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1278.15,1279.238,Mr. Claiborne.
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1279.238,1282.696,-- may it please the Court.
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1350.582,1350.777,"Well, was it (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1350.777,1351.452,-- Indian tribe --
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.452,1358.813,-- nothing an approach from the outside if a farm machinery dealer simply advertises on local television?
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1358.813,1358.964,Perhaps --
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.964,1366.493,Or on local radio and advertises John Deere tractors at a very low price?
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1366.493,1367.299,"Perhaps not, Mr. Justice."
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.299,1372.292,And off the -- off -- off the Indian goes to buy a tractor.
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1372.292,1373.062,Perhaps not.
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.902,1374.571,"Well, perhaps."
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1378.42,1379.863,I would have thought not.
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.3,1394.651,"Well, what about a --"
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1394.651,1394.886,-- goods or --
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.886,1399.132,-- flyer in the mail to all residents of the reservation?
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1399.132,1405.554,"That, I think, would be an invitation from outside and that would and should be --"
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.554,1406.641,And even if the even --
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1406.641,1406.666,-- subject to federal supervision.
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.666,1411.405,"-- if the Indian then leaves the reservation, signs the contract, takes delivery off the reservation?"
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1411.405,1417.915,"Well, Mr. Justice White, of course, there are gradations and I'm -- I'm not clear as to each of the --"
1979.78-1604,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.915,1419.612,But you're clear about this one.
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1419.612,1431.968,"This one, because we've got an approach from the outside, we've got the transaction conducted wholly within the reservation, we've got the contract signed there, and we've got delivery effected there."
1979.78-1604,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1431.968,1443.144,"Do I understand correctly, Mr. Claiborne, that your -- your alliance is primarily, if not exclusively, on the doctrine of Warren Trading Post?"
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1443.144,1447.699,Insofar as we rely on statutory preemption.
1979.78-1604,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1447.699,1450.632,And don't you do primarily rely on statutory preemption?
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1450.632,1459.1,"We do primarily rely but we have, as Your Honor may know from our brief, also suggested that there is a constitutional dimension to the case."
1979.78-1604,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1467.808,1468.822,Right.
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1468.822,1474.335,-- what we think is a constitutional preemption argument which is --
1979.78-1604,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1474.335,1475.794,As an Indian Commerce Clause?
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1475.794,1478.461,An Indian Commerce Clause argument.
1979.78-1604,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1500.383,1522.446,"Do you not or do you -- I'll put it this way, do you agree with Judge O'Connor's statement in her opinion that it is the existence, the existence of the federal laws accompanying regulations and not their enforcement which preempts the State's ability to tax the transaction?"
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1522.446,1526.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, we endorse that statement entirely."
1979.78-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.479,1587.926,"Well, how do you distinguish your answer to the Chief Justice's question on the statement in Mescalero, on page 147 of the U.S. reports, “At the outset, we reject as to the state court the broad assertion that the Federal Government has exclusive jurisdiction over the Tribe for all purposes and that the State is therefore prohibited from enforcing its revenue -- revenue laws against any tribal enterprises”?"
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1587.926,1600.623,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I take that statement to address the broad proposition they put forward that the relation with Indians and with Indian tribes, even off reservation, was exclusively a matter of federal concern."
1979.78-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1600.623,1608.377,"But if it's Indian commerce, certainly, Indian commerce can take place off reservation as well as on reservation."
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1608.377,1624.185,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we assume, and I think with some justification in history, that the Indian Commerce Clause was written against the background of two kinds of Indians for the most part then, on their own territory within Indian country."
1979.78-1604,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1658.877,1672.298,"Well, in the original, they were not reservations, they were just tribes that were considered in the era of the Worcester case, a little short of sovereign nations like England or France or Germany."
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1677.691,1689.404,"Mr. Justice Stewart, because they were more independent then than now, but the Cherokees in the Worcester case were on their reserved lands, those which they had not seated and the reservations --"
1979.78-1604,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1689.404,1700.264,"But unlike today where Indian reservations are federal lands, federal -- in those days, they were Indian lands."
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1700.264,1704.904,"Well, how -- in some cases, of course, they're simply federal lands set aside for Indians."
1979.78-1604,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1704.904,1708.076,And Indian sovereign nations or quasi-sovereign nations.
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1708.076,1721.586,"But they're all, and most reservations today are simply the residual of aboriginal Indian lands which are now more restricted in area and more subject to both federal and to some degree, state regulation."
1979.78-1604,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.586,1728.919,"But those boundaries were fixed up by the Indians put by treaties and by Acts of Congress, as Justice Stewart suggested."
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1740.366,1742.017,"To some degree, Mr. Chief Justice."

1979.78-1604,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1774.647,1775.996,That's the point.
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1775.996,1778.632,"Well, that is not quite true, Mr. Justice Stevens."

1979.78-1604,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1803.152,1803.381,I mean you --
1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1803.381,1803.819,-- States before the Constitution and continental Congress.

1979.78-1604,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1809.502,1825.575,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the period between the declaration of independence and the Constitution and the period of the continental Congress was a period of the United States, although not governed by the confederation rather than the Constitution."
1979.78-1604,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1906.762,1910.843,Mr. Macpherson.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,1910.843,1913.535,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-1604,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.86,2094.197,Is there no superintendent of the Gila River Indian Tribe?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2094.197,2097.277,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I -- that -- that's my understanding."
1979.78-1604,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.184,2301.817,"Mr. Macpherson, isn't there a body of law to the effect that the representatives of the United States Government cannot estop it, that is, that just because a representative of the -- of the Government makes a statement or a decision that a federal statute is to be applied in a perfect way -- particular way some time ago does not necessarily conclude the Government on that point?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2301.817,2302.635,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1604,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.339,2338.852,Would there be tax exemption if it was a COD transaction?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2338.852,2339.264,Mr. Justice Burger --
1979.78-1604,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2339.264,2339.759,After it delivered --

1979.78-1604,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2340.216,2344.109,-- on the reservation on a cash-on-delivery at that time.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2344.109,2373.319,"Mr. Chief Justice, in -- in that regard, and I will apologize to the Court, I do not have a transcript of the oral argument which was held in the Arizona Supreme Court with respect to this, but with due respect to Mr. Lewis' recollection of that argument, it is my recollection that the position was taken at that time that where a COD delivery was made on the reservation that that indeed, would also be exempt."
1979.78-1604,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2438.835,2443.96,"But Arizona doesn't prevent the vendor from passing along a tax to the vendee, does it?"

1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2459.336,2464.27,"But the general practice is to -- the general practice is to pass it along, isn't it?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2464.27,2464.719,Mr. Justice --
1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2464.719,2466.983,And you've already told us that was done in this case.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2466.983,2468.165,That's correct.
1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2473.669,2474.151,"Oh, I understand."
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2474.819,2475.2,But --
1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2475.2,2481.709,"-- but the general practice and I suppose therefore, the expectation is that it will be passed along to the retail customer."
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2481.709,2489.111,"Your Honor, if -- if the term “expectation” is used in the context of a requirement of state law, I would respectfully --"
1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2489.111,2489.472,"Oh, no."
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2492.376,2492.473,As a --
1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2492.473,2493.644,-- about the general practice.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2493.644,2493.957,Yes.
1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2493.957,2495.614,"And it is to pass it along, isn't it?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2495.614,2496.894,Your Honor is quite correct.
1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2504.697,2505.107,Is there --
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2505.107,2507.219,-- has including his other --

1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2507.263,2512.98,"-- economic burdens of taxes, his costs of acquisition, his labor expenses, his fuel and electricity expenses."
1979.78-1604,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2619.601,2625.106,Does state law require that the amount of the tax be disclosed at the time of the transaction?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2625.106,2627.392,"Mr. Justice Powell, it does not."
1979.78-1604,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2627.392,2631.231,And is it uniformly disclosed as a matter of practice?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2631.231,2640.893,"Your Honor, I -- I can't speak for the some-100,000 vendors in the State of Arizona, but the -- in -- as a general practice, yes, it is separately stated."
1979.78-1604,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2640.893,2645.271,"If you bought an item out of a department store, would the sales ticket reflect the tax?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2645.271,2648.216,"It does, indeed."
1979.78-1604,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2648.216,2663.491,"What if -- what if the Tribe had contracted for these tractors in Oklahoma and delivered them themselves on over-the-road trucks to their reservation, can Arizona tax something?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2663.491,2673.972,"Mr. Chief Justice, in the hypo is the -- are all of the negotiations done through the -- the out-of-state vendor?"
1979.78-1604,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2673.972,2677.066,Suppose the Indians go over to Oklahoma or any other nearby States --
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2677.066,2678.174,Yes.
1979.78-1604,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2678.174,2680.939,"-- and say, “We want to buy these tractors."
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2683.119,2683.227,Yes.
1979.78-1604,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2683.227,2684.504,-- railroad trucks or whatever.”
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2684.504,2685.689,Delivery on the reservation?
1979.78-1604,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2685.689,2686.164,No.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2686.164,2689.676,Non-taxable.
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.676,2692.274,Is there a different tax imposed on that transaction?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2692.274,2692.541,Yes.
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.862,2706.212,That would be on the vendee.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2706.212,2706.905,That's correct.
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2706.905,2710.942,"And in that case, would you say you could or could not collect the tax?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2710.942,2714.439,"From the vendee, Gila River Tribe -- the -- the Gila River Farms?"
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.439,2714.71,Yes.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2714.71,2715.438,We could not collect it.
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.799,2719.643,And why not?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2720.551,2724.196,Because they are an Indian tribe located on an Indian reservation.
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2728.849,2737.492,"Apart from our Court's decision, just to get the theoretical basis for it, what is the reason that there cannot be a tax in that, other than that the Court has said so?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2741.07,2743.05,Apart from the Court's decisions?
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.05,2743.253,Yes.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2747.908,2761.683,"As I understand the rationale of both Bryan and McClanahan, the state taxes, in both of those cases, which were being attempted to be imposed, were sought to be imposed directly upon an Indian on an Indian reservation."
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.683,2763.791,"Let me ask you, what's wrong with that?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2763.791,2764.419,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2764.419,2766.506,"And I'm asking you, why cannot that be done?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2772.655,2790.353,"Mr. Justice Stevens, it's my -- it's my understanding that under the Commerce Clause as well as, perhaps, the Supremacy Clause, the States are without power to impose the direct legal obligation for state taxes upon Indians on Indian reservations."
1979.78-1604,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2794.398,2800.465,"It's a sovereign, an Indian sovereign, it's got some relationship to Indian's tribal sovereignty, I take it, doesn't it?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2800.465,2802.117,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.719,2805.452,Why doesn't that rationale apply here?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2813.816,2816.747,"Well, if I may, Your Honor."
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2874.215,2874.523,Do you think it makes any --
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2874.523,2876.227,-- of the Indian's immunity from taxation.
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.227,2883.064,Do you think it makes any difference whether it's a tribe or -- or individual Indians that's involved?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2883.064,2887.357,"Your Honor, it may but it escapes me why."
1979.78-1604,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.093,2913.306,I just find this a very confusing area and I'm asking questions because I'm trying to understand it.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,2914.641,2941.636,"Well, if I may, by way of further explanation, the fact of the matter is that Arizona believes, after an examination not only of the Warren Trading Post decision but the Warren Trading Post briefs and indeed, the tape of the oral argument in the Warren Trading Post decision, maintains that these taxes are not preempted."
1979.78-1604,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2995.29,3010.441,"Well, suppose -- suppose we agreed with you in this case and then Central decided that “Well, we -- we've read that opinion and we've -- so, we're going to open a branch on the reservation.”"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3030.111,3031.967,Of the office on the reservation?
1979.78-1604,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.245,3044.958,"Well, it may -- it may but, I take it on your rationale, I would take you would want to cut into Warren Trading Post."
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3044.958,3048.508,"We've done something like that, Your Honor [Laughs] in the briefs."
1979.78-1604,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3053.904,3055.36,"Exactly, yes."
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3065.261,3065.4,Well --
1979.78-1604,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.4,3066.472,-- the sale over there.
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3066.472,3067.504,-- Your Honor is correct.
1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3076.237,3086.333,"And you certainly ask us to, in both this case and the next one, as I understand it, to re-examine what it said in that footnote in Warren Trading Post about the Buck Act."
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3086.333,3088.692,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1604,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3089.198,3097.114,"But you -- but you submit that in at least -- in this case at least, that even if we don't do that, you, nonetheless, must prevail."
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3097.114,3098.724,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1604,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3420.145,3436.368,"Is there any contention, as you understand it, Mr. Macpherson, made by the Government or by the Tribe that the Central Machinery Company was in violation of federal law or regulations because it had not obtained a license and nonetheless, done business with the Indians?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3436.368,3439.47,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, quite the contrary."
1979.78-1604,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3484.203,3496.382,"Because -- because an Indian tribe might be subject to some indirect taxes doesn't mean that they're automatically subject to all other more visible taxes, does it?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3496.382,3499.217,"Well, that's -- that's -- Mr. Chief Justice, that -- that's correct."
1979.78-1604,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3524.388,3532.777,Didn't they also -- weren't they also told that it was paid under protest?Isn't that what they approved?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3532.777,3547.024,"Mr. Justice Marshall, the purchase order, which is located in the record at, as I recall, item 15, pages 15A."
1979.78-1604,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3555.927,3556.336,Well --
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3556.336,3556.866,The check that subsequently --
1979.78-1604,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3556.866,3566.63,-- doesn't the record show that the government agent was told by Central that this had been paid under protest?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3566.63,3570.56,"Your Honor, I find nothing in the record that specifically states that."
1979.78-1604,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3570.56,3572.821,"Well, then, they're misleading us."
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3572.821,3573.896,Excuse me.
1979.78-1604,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3619.206,3621.684,Where did it say sales tax?
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3621.684,3626.544,Sales tax was located on the purchase order.
1979.78-1604,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3626.544,3628.428,"Well, was there a sales tax?"
1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3628.428,3631.207,"If it please the Court, I think I see where the Court is going.[Laughter]"

1979.78-1604,2,28632,ian_a_macpherson,,3659.618,3660.969,In my office in Phoenix.
