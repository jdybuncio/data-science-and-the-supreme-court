1984.84-351,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.947,We will hear arguments next this morning in Atascadero State Hospital and California Department of Mental Health against Scanlon.
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,105.88,117.508,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case comes here on a petition by state defendants for writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals."
1984.84-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.244,363.648,"Mr. Ryan, I suppose you would concede, however, that a plaintiff in the circumstances of this case could nevertheless seek an injunction against the state asking for an order that the physician be given--"
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,363.648,365.0,"In federal court, Your Honor?"
1984.84-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.592,370.072,--You think not under Ex Parte Young?
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,370.072,375.836,"--If the plaintiff in this case had sued an official, that issue would have been raised."
1984.84-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.836,378.048,But no officials were named here.
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,378.048,382.982,"No officials were named in this case, but as to naming a state agency itself--"
1984.84-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.982,394.018,"If officials had been named, and injunctive relief sought, you would agree the suit could have proceeded in federal court?"
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,394.018,399.532,--Under the common understanding of the rules pertaining to Ex Parte Young at that time.
1984.84-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.303,403.355,And maybe attorneys' fees obtained if successful?
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,403.355,404.674,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-351,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,650.887,654.858,"Counsel, you mentioned the position of the Solicitor General."
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,657.89,658.652,"No, it has not."
1984.84-351,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,658.652,659.473,In this case.
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,659.473,660.614,It has not.
1984.84-351,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,660.614,662.636,So he was against you earlier.
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,662.636,663.924,He certainly was.
1984.84-351,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,663.924,666.675,You didn't mention that.
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,679.595,680.777,Very definitely.
1984.84-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.777,689.901,Is that because the state has generally waived its sovereign immunity to actions like this in the state court?
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,689.901,702.581,"The state has generally waived its immunity for suit in states under this type statute, but not... that is not to say, of course, that the state has waived its immunity under the Eleventh Amendment for suits in federal court."
1984.84-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,702.581,710.256,So your position is the Eleventh Amendment protection is really broader than the protection under the sovereign immunity doctrine.
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,710.256,726.506,"Our position is that under established law as handed down by this Court, that waivers under state law pertaining to suits brought in state courts do not constitute waiver of the Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court."
1984.84-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.506,728.079,Have we ever so held?
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,728.079,731.879,"Yes, you have... yes, this Court has, Your Honor, in several cases."
1984.84-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.879,734.66,Where that particular point was at issue?
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,734.66,738.844,Where similar statutes--
1984.84-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,738.844,747.99,"I mean where you had an acknowledgement by the state that there had been a waiver of any sovereign immunity defense, nevertheless assertion of the Eleventh Amendment."
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,747.99,765.291,"--Well, the position of the defendants in this case is not that there has been a broad waiver of sovereign immunity, only that there has been a waiver in state courts, and this Court has seen this very same argument made in a number of cases right through Pennhurst II."
1984.84-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.075,785.956,"Your provision says,"
1984.84-351,0,32697,james_e_ryan,,793.929,794.861,That's correct.
1984.84-351,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1223.211,1238.321,Ms. Holle.
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1238.321,1251.201,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before I respond to the points raised by Mr. Ryan, I would like to summarize our position in this case."
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.4,1399.037,"Ms. Holle, have you said all you are going to say about your argument that the state statute waives immunity both in federal courts as well as state courts?"
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1399.037,1400.158,"No, I have not."
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1401.458,1402.56,You are going to get to that later?
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1402.56,1404.02,"--Yes, I am, Your Honor."
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.792,1490.136,Have you read our Great Northern Insurance Company versus Read case?
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1490.136,1508.188,"Yes, I have, and indeed in that case this Court recognized that somehow California was different when it analyzed the outcome and the reasons for the outcome in Smith v. Reeves, and it really contrasted California with other states."
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.094,1550.506,"What do you think it depends on, Ms. Holle, the intent of the legislature passing the--"
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1550.506,1552.937,I think if you look at Muskopf--
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.937,1555.569,"--I mean, I was asking what you think it depends on."
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1555.569,1570.79,--I think it depends on whether or not the legislature has affirmatively imposed a limitation so as to bar discriminatees from suit in federal court under 504 or any other civil rights statute.
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.79,1575.422,So it is not a question of whether they intended the waiver to extend to federal court as well as to state court?
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1575.422,1585.989,I think a fair reading of Muskopf would indicate that in California sovereign immunity concepts have been swept away.
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1585.989,1591.733,But what is the test for purposes of applying the Eleventh Amendment?
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1591.733,1603.221,The test would be whether or not with respect to a federally created right there is any bar that you can find that the legislature has affirmatively imposed.
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1603.221,1615.82,"So if a legislature simply passes a statute, perhaps like the statute in Great Northern, saying the state waives its immunity to sue, period, that would be enough in your--"
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1615.82,1617.03,"Well, in California the structure is a little different."
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.03,1617.611,--But I--
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1617.611,1618.582,Yes.
1984.84-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.582,1621.133,--Would you answer my question?
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1621.133,1622.803,Yes.
1984.84-351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1622.803,1628.255,"Now, did the court below deal with that question?"
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1628.255,1641.385,"No, the court below dealt with federal law questions, and indeed we don't think you reach state law questions unless you rule against us on the federal law, and therefore have to look at that as an alternative reason."
1984.84-351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1641.385,1644.127,"Well, suppose we disagree with you on the federal law issue."
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1646.378,1650.752,I think maybe you follow what you did in Rogers v. Mills.
1984.84-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.08,1666.771,Was waiver argued at all in the lower courts?
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1666.771,1675.469,"--Waiver was argued under the Parden standard, and if you look at Parden, this Court relied on the reasoning of a California state court."
1984.84-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1675.469,1676.337,That wasn't a state law question.
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,1676.337,1682.612,"No, but this Court relied on the reasoning in Parden versus California for its outcome."
1984.84-351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.76,2621.837,You asked us to look particularly at the Maurice case in California.
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,2621.837,2622.216,Yes.
1984.84-351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.216,2624.519,Is that not an appellate court decision?
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,2624.519,2638.498,"But that case was approved specifically in the first... the state court in Nevada v. Hall decision, and it is for that reason that I call it to your attention."
1984.84-351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.498,2641.129,It was approved by the California Supreme Court in Nevada against Hall?
1984.84-351,1,36021,marilyn_holle,,2641.129,2646.413,By the California Supreme Court in the first Nevada v. Hall decision.
1984.84-351,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2696.596,2699.588,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Ryan?"
1984.84-351,2,32697,james_e_ryan,,2699.588,2701.11,"A few points, if I may."
1984.84-351,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2844.112,2845.234,"Thank you, counsel."
