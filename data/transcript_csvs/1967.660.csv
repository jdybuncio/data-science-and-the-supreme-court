1967.660,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.521,"Number 660, Board of Education of Central School District number 1, et al. appellants, versus James E. Allen, Jr. as Commissioner of Education of New York, et al."
1967.660,0,36449,marvin_e_pollock,,46.514,50.443,May it please the Court.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,2887.7,2892.367,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.660,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2941.838,2949.926,"I thought I did see your motion of James E. Allen, Jr. to dismiss one of jurisdiction."
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,2949.926,2961.532,It's for one of jurisdiction based upon what we felt were prior decisions of this Court which involved not a question -- it was not a question of standing the sue it involved the merits of the sue itself.
1967.660,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2961.532,2963.044,One that involved the merits?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,2963.044,2965.003,Yes sir.
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2965.003,2967.379,How do you reconcile the agreements?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,2967.379,2967.917,Pardon me.
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2967.917,2975.228,How do you reconcile the proposition with the state of the agreements of standing as foreclosing this Court by reason --
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,2975.228,2985.328,The standing to sue which was raised was standing to sue under state law and now a question of the general right of a taxpayer as may have it raised in this Court.
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2985.328,2992.402,"No, but it wasn't the (Inaudible) that questions standing the sue in New Jersey which New Jersey sustained what this Court said."
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,2997.458,3001.811,Yes but I think that it has been considered I think by all the parties in this case if this was --
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3001.811,3011.317,"Well, I don't suppose -- I don't suppose what the parties considered if the standing question is considered -- that the parties don't want us to consider which --"
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3011.317,3020.542,"Certainly, if this Court were, itself, to consider that standing to sue is a problem of this Court, you certainly decide it on that basis."
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3022.64,3024.265,That's what happened in -- wasn't it?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3024.265,3026.867,"Yes, I believe it was."
1967.660,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3026.867,3028.201,I'm just wondering.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3072.104,3085.143,"Well, I would assume that the initial problem which raised their -- which started the sanction was that the members of the Board themselves, felt that the law was unconstitutional both under the state and Federal Constitutions."
1967.660,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3118.238,3149.73,But the fact is that they state in their statement of jurisdiction that they are in a legal dilemma that they cannot act without subjecting themselves to some kind of sanctions and the New York Court of Appeals has held that they are -- they can be subject to no sanction for the simple reason that the law in which they are obliged to act under the Court of Appeals order is constitutional.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3154.896,3158.263,But certainly wipe out the premise if they were contending to accept the decision.
1967.660,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3158.263,3158.818,I beg your pardon.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3158.818,3168.974,They would wipe out that premise if they are willing to accept the decision of the New York Court of Appeals on the issue of constitutionality which apparently they are not since they are here.
1967.660,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3168.974,3178.597,"But certainly, they don't expect us to say that the New York statute is unconstitutional according to New York Constitution do they?"
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3178.597,3189.531,No sir but they were hoping that you will say it's unconstitutional in the Federal Constitution and since they as public officials in New York not only to uphold the statement but also the Federal Constitution.
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3216.876,3222.817,But you don't suggest that the books that are maybe designated are books that are actually used in the public school.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3222.817,3224.234,No sir.
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3224.234,3228.843,They maybe any kind of a book as long as the public authority will approve them.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3228.843,3229.531,That is true.
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3229.531,3233.676,And except that they must be secular?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3233.676,3235.826,"No, a secular text."
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3235.826,3237.941,You mean that's what the court says?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3237.941,3241.552,That's what the court said and I think this is what the statute had in mind because when the -- when the statute said --
1967.660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3241.552,3243.625,This is what the Attorney General said?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3243.625,3244.879,Yes sir.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3244.879,3249.368,The Attorney General said nonsectarian that's different isn't.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3249.368,3252.331,I suppose it is but I think we were -- this is not what we were --
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3252.331,3253.772,"Well, it's an important --"
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3253.772,3259.206,"Yes, I think that the Attorney General has said not sectarian in this --"
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3259.206,3273.531,"And he's made it clear by that parenthetical remark in 6(a) of his ruling that he's talking about in anyway, when he says nonsectarian, he means nonsectarian and not secular."
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3273.531,3274.096,Oh sir.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3280.613,3282.416,"Well, what is a rule?"
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3284.381,3291.405,"Well, the status of this is, is that as an opinion actually from our office, it's an advisory opinion only."
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3291.405,3298.196,Well your adversary said that he didn't spend that this was binding but correct me if I'm mistaken.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3298.196,3298.287,I think that the counsel –-
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3298.287,3299.639,You think it's not?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3299.639,3308.614,"-- no, the counsel of the education department like the New York Attorney General would like very much to have his opinions binding but they are entered in an advisory capacity only."
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3325.017,3331.573,Where are the regulations of the board of region stand that are referred to in the statute?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3350.651,3358.818,"As far as I know, the opinion of the counsel -- it's the only thing approaching a rule of regulations --"
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3358.818,3369.033,"No ma'am, but I want to know what the opinion of the counsel is why it's here."
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3380.602,3384.318,This is not as far as I know that adopted as the rule and regulation of the board.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3388.439,3394.45,And you say there are no regulations prescribed by the Board of Regents despite the language of the statute.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3394.45,3395.139,No.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3407.136,3410.299,The statute used the word end here.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3430.628,3430.996,No sir.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3465.453,3467.576,"Well, let me get clear about this."
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3535.265,3536.442,Yes sir.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3536.442,3540.947,And that -- does that ever go to the Central Board of Regents?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3540.947,3564.062,"It would only go to the Board of Regents or particularly to the Commissioner of Education if a local taxpayer in one of the school districts disputed a termination of the local school board, possibly someone who objected to a book which they felt was sectarian or religious and nonsectarian sense."
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3564.062,3564.393,Right.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3564.489,3565.97,They can appeal to the commissioner --
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3565.97,3579.721,"Now, you're also telling us though that there no directions to the boards of education that within a broad word of the statute which regarding with textbooks."
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3595.434,3598.142,No sir except from the framework of this opinion which has been given.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3598.142,3602.795,"Well, this opinion was handed down that the statute has been an operation whatever that opinion means."
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3602.795,3603.22,No sir.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3609.924,3610.261,I see.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3610.261,3624.558,"This was an advice to the school districts on how they were to go about purchasing the textbooks, what book are to be involved and how also you will see in there the process for processing the reimbursement provisions."
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3624.558,3631.838,"And you're also telling us in any child -- any school of the child if he decides that he wants such and such a book, is that right?"
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3631.838,3632.281,Yes sir.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3632.281,3635.007,It can apply to the Board of Education?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3635.007,3640.795,He may if it is a textbook which he is required to use in a school.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3646.509,3647.475,I see.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3647.475,3658.492,But I think that it should be made clear that the distinction here is between these textbooks are by law required to be provided to the students and not to the schools they attend.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3662.308,3695.507,"Can you say that there's no way at all for us to have access to a list that shows whether in fact the word textbook in the statute has been construed in its broad sense in which without qualification, it's used in the statute in the sense of nonsectarian as used in the opinion of counsel to the Department of Education or in the still narrow sense of secular as used in the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals."
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3695.507,3702.518,I could inquire of the education any problem where there has been any further implementation since the decision of the Court of Appeals which refers to secular.
1967.660,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3716.488,3731.565,"Is there any implementation of 704, I think it is that says it can have subversive textbooks? Is there any regulation or anything of the sort of the Board of Regents?"
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3731.565,3736.845,I don't know whether there has been any list promulgated of any textbooks which they consider subversive or not.
1967.660,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3762.917,3775.164,What agency in New York has supreme authority in finding the cause to determine what textbooks will be used by the student?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3775.164,3776.875,The Commissioner of Education.
1967.660,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3776.875,3778.401,What about the regents?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3778.401,3781.477,"Well, the regents of course, the Commissioner of Education."
1967.660,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3792.102,3792.269,But what about the Board of Regents?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3792.269,3797.715,As supervised by the Board of Regents -- the Board of Regents is a general policy making organization.
1967.660,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3801.307,3805.332,Do they not have authority over the books even in going to libraries as well as the schools?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3805.332,3807.081,"Oh yes sir, they would have that."
1967.660,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3807.081,3808.15,What?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3808.15,3809.408,They would have authority.
1967.660,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3809.408,3810.313,That's the Board of Regents?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3810.313,3811.136,"Board of Regents, yes sir."
1967.660,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3811.136,3813.149,And that's what they have about the school books in there.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3813.149,3821.307,Yes sir.
1967.660,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3821.307,3835.89,"I asked Mr. Pollock if this act should be able to interpret to say that the school board in Buffalo, New York could furnish school children in the City of New York."
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3847.466,3872.857,I would say as far as students who are enrolled in the private schools in New York City as distinguished in public schools that they could request a textbook which might be used in the public schools or approved by the public school board of the City of Buffalo but has not been approved or designated for use in the public schools in New York City and be entitled to receive it under this law.
1967.660,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3872.857,3875.325,Who would have to give -- who would have to loan them the books?
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3875.325,3877.358,The New York City School Board under those circumstances.
1967.660,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3877.358,3880.643,And they have to buy them or get them from Buffalo.
1967.660,1,29612,jean_m_coon,,3880.643,3884.798,"Well, from the same publisher, the Buffalo buys it from."
1967.660,2,34748,louis_j_lefkowitz,,3904.045,3907.82,In last year was about $19 million figures in our brief.
1967.660,3,29612,jean_m_coon,,3909.186,3909.393,No.
1967.660,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3915.329,3920.239,The statutory of limitation is so much dollar in how many dollars for pupil I think then?
1967.660,3,29612,jean_m_coon,,3920.239,3921.968,It works this way.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,4716.09,4717.495,May it please the Court.
1967.660,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4717.495,4718.838,Mr. Chandler.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,4718.838,4727.341,"Picking up for a moment what Mrs. Coon has just said, the question that Mr. Justice Fortas has been concerned about."
1967.660,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4811.464,4816.725,That long experience has been with respect to public education and not parochial.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,4816.725,4833.661,That's right but the theme of this law is that the book that are to be provided are books uphold by public school authorities on the same standard that the public schools have been using for a long time.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4939.508,4947.234,But even if it weren't I suppose that even if the statute were sustained that specific practice could be attack in the constitution.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,4947.234,4950.872,Yes.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4950.872,4962.0,Is it clear in this record that parochial schools involved here were not previously furnishing the textbook?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,4962.0,4964.574,"Yeah, I'm glad Your Honor asked that question."
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4981.551,4988.064,But the law covers -- the law would permit this furnishing of textbooks --
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,4988.064,4988.549,Yes.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4988.549,4996.79,And even toward those parochial schools which were themselves buy the textbooks and --
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,4996.79,5001.27,There's no evidence or claim that that happens anywhere in the state.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5001.27,5001.928,What if it did?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5002.632,5023.111,"I don't think it would -- I think it would be a matter of -- well, first of speculations of facts not shown on this record and I suppose that if a public school -- I would say that if a public school, a parochial school had been furnishing textbooks to children that the children in that school would still be covered by this law and would be entitled to get it."
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5023.865,5025.841,You would say that it was wholly valid.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5025.841,5039.946,I would say it was valid but I add that in this particular case and as far as we know towards the general practice throughout the state has been that the parent individually pays the bill for the textbooks.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5149.62,5155.463,Is the entire area of New York covered by at least one school district?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5155.463,5155.933,Yes it is.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5156.636,5157.974,Is there a school district covering it --
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5157.974,5163.532,"There's a school district with widely varying terminology covering the entire state, yes."
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5229.662,5234.525,Do you know what percent of the books on that list are actually used in the public schools?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5234.525,5235.96,"No sir, I don't."
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5235.96,5237.424,The small percent of schools.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5237.424,5240.32,"Your Honor, this is the public school list -- what percentage."
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5249.229,5256.409,So this doesn't include the least that they approve for parochial schools with the public school list.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5256.409,5263.644,The parochial schools I think in almost every instance withdraw from that list unless there were some very special reason.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5266.666,5273.802,"Well, these are books that are approved for use in public schools, but maybe not that any of them were used."
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5273.802,5293.326,"This is the list from which any local school board of New York can order and from which by the same token, any local parochial schools stood in order and it will be approved automatically without checking to see whether the book is on the list and a mention is made at page --"
1967.660,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5293.326,5298.669,To what extent can they add books in that list for parochial schools?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5298.669,5300.099,If the list.
1967.660,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5471.884,5482.194,"Suppose that the religious school said, you don't teach German in the schools in this district, we want to teach German."
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5482.194,5482.946,Yes sir.
1967.660,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5482.946,5489.228,But we don't want any of the books that any of the public schools use for German.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5499.848,5509.298,I think they could provide it and certified as passing the test of not being a religious book and not having religious connotations in it.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5523.636,5527.575,Do you think they could get approve toward this history approved.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5527.575,5528.67,Get what sir?
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5528.67,5534.546,Get Twine B's history approved as a textbook in a parochial school.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5534.546,5537.33,I can only say that I don't know.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5546.461,5552.621,Do you have in this record the number of parochial schools there are in the state of New York?
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5552.621,5553.112,"Yes sir, I do."
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5553.112,5556.219,Probably up among the state?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5556.219,5562.109,I don't have it in the record but I can answer the question.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5612.919,5615.407,I suppose the Darwinian Theory that --
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5615.407,5616.271,What's that?
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5616.271,5622.234,I suppose the Darwinian Theory would shock some religious groups isn't it?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5622.234,5626.03,Your Honors have that case on the docket for later on in this term I believe.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5626.03,5634.338,"I don't ask you to decide it but I'm saying, what is the policy of the Board of Regents on that kind of issue?"
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5634.338,5637.558,I'm teaching the Darwinian Theory?
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5637.558,5640.361,Or some competing theory.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5640.361,5642.744,I think the Board of Regents would probably provide it.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5652.04,5656.227,Is there anybody here speaking for the Board of Regents by the way?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5656.227,5657.083,Mrs. Coon.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5657.083,5657.759,You do.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5657.759,5658.067,Mrs.--
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5658.067,5661.442,I thought you were trying to distinguish yourself from the board.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5661.442,5662.219,No sir.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5662.219,5663.657,"I'm sorry, I misunderstood."
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5663.657,5668.525,Mrs. Coon represents the Commissioner of Education who is the record defendant in this case.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5668.525,5669.005,I understand.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5669.005,5673.135,The Commissioner of Education is the administrative arm of the Board of Regents.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5680.566,5683.998,But they're not a part here are they?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5683.998,5691.401,No because the relief could be obtain fully against their executive official by the Commissioner.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5691.401,5693.439,Unless they discharge the commissioner.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5693.439,5694.255,What's that?
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5694.255,5696.006,Unless they discharge the commissioner.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5696.006,5701.204,I see.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5713.566,5715.312,You know how they divide it out?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5715.312,5717.173,Among religions?
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5719.577,5721.925,Are any Presbyterian colleges?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5721.925,5723.4,I call it Presbyterian and I am not--
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5723.4,5724.547,Schools I mean.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5724.547,5736.349,There are several religious -- find that somewhere in this book.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5736.349,5738.858,Can I ask you one other question in that connection?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5738.858,5740.476,Yes sir.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5740.476,5743.191,Is there in the record that can be obtained?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5743.191,5744.338,In the record of sir?
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5744.338,5764.952,"Is that in the record partly obtained, specifically at there, but you might call the charter of these parochial schools which states what their purposes is and limits their duties and their activities?"
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5764.952,5767.027,"Yes, I would like to elaborate on that."
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5780.658,5781.489,What is that one?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5781.489,5825.147,"Jewish 135, Lutheran 57, Episcopalian 48, Seventh-day Adventist 45, other religion and that includes Quakers, Mennonites, Eastern Orthodox and Methodist, other religions, 11 and non-religiously affiliated 246 of which 204 have children who are getting textbooks under this program that is of the non-religiously affiliated private schools."
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5825.147,5826.643,206?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5828.109,5837.062,204 out of 246 non-religiously affiliated schools are having their children get books.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5837.062,5840.537,"Now, the Catholics have 1435."
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5840.537,5841.842,1445 Your Honor.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5841.842,5850.786,"45, is there anyway we can get or is there a charter gotten out by the church itself."
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5859.272,5871.466,I have gone at some length into my brief on the extent of state control over these schools and I think that might answer Your Honor's question.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5871.466,5876.969,I don't think it would but I would be interested to know what it is.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5876.969,5883.177,When I get through perhaps because I haven't done something further.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5981.337,5983.298,Is this true of theological school?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5983.298,5985.087,Except theological schools.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5986.521,5987.128,Yes.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5987.128,5989.416,I was talking about high school diplomas.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5989.416,5989.554,Were you also –
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,5989.554,5998.26,A catholic high school board if it passes an examination set by the regents and he gets a regents diploma and the sample of it is in the Appendix to our brief.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5998.26,6012.83,I think this is one of the theories expressed by the centers of the Court of Appeals of this old system perhaps in the long run to secularize the education in the parochial schools.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6012.83,6013.869,Well --
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6013.869,6015.548,Did I misread that opinion?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6015.548,6036.418,The minority in the Court of Appeals indicated that it might in the long run secularize education in the parochial schools by getting parochial school parents accustomed to using secular books instead of the religiously oriented books they would have been suppose to be using otherwise.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6044.237,6047.627,"Well, he was talking about the future and not the --"
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6047.627,6055.508,My brother Pollock talks about the parochial school being practically a seminary of religion and nothing else.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6067.203,6076.44,"Well, there is that danger and maybe the danger that Mr. Pollock spoke of would be more realized."
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6076.44,6078.363,Either danger is suspected in the First Amendment.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6078.363,6080.549,Either the danger is highly speculating.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6080.549,6082.19,I mean to suspend.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6082.19,6082.85,What?
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6082.85,6085.735,"Under the First Amendment, either danger might have validated --"
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6085.735,6099.665,Yes and the business which my friend is also raised in his brief about being no way of distinguishing between the secular and the religious in the text would cast out on the whole theory of education even in the public school.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6099.665,6109.777,How does the Board of Regent -- thus the Board of Regents differentiate the curriculum it prescribes for say a Methodist parochial school and a catholic school?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6109.777,6111.556,No.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6120.279,6123.181,Are they anti-religious the Board of Regents?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6123.181,6124.083,What did you say sir?
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6124.083,6125.712,Is the board anti-religious?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6125.712,6127.289,I would not think they were anti-religious.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6142.468,6147.974,"When it comes to a book say on teaching the reformation, what kind of a decision would the Board of Regents make?"
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6147.974,6153.049,I think they would probably say that the book must be highly neutral or else not on the list at all.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6156.793,6159.377,Then it would be anti-religious.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6159.377,6163.075,"You got -- well, may I ask Your Honor this question back."
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6178.887,6184.356,The public school by definition is not serving any religious cause.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6184.356,6185.542,No.
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6185.542,6188.651,Any particular sectarian cause.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6188.651,6190.343,If I haven't answered Mr. Justice Black's question.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6190.343,6195.742,How do you understand is the basic purpose of a religious school?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6195.742,6203.385,The basic purpose of religious school is to give an adequate secular education plus religious instruction and the fact that it was given --
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6203.385,6212.426,I was wondering why is there been any charter that we can get hold of why these parochial schools doesn't show us?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6217.232,6220.719,Get out from what sir?
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6220.719,6227.153,The lines of the charter of parochial schools.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6240.203,6240.953,Yes.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6240.953,6243.696,Not according to secular education.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6243.696,6248.491,But they have to meet the secular requirements laid down to the state or they can't exist.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6248.491,6250.238,But what about the other?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6262.011,6265.945,It doesn't immediately come to my mind just what there is but I will look and see.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6267.284,6268.67,If you get it would you send it to us?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6268.67,6270.59,I will sir.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6300.366,6303.405,I didn't understand that he said that.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6303.405,6304.947,"Well, I beg your pardon."
1967.660,4,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6312.139,6315.905,But there's nothing ideological about a bus I suppose.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6315.905,6331.784,And I don't think there's anything ideological about a book called Hallet's Machine Shop Practice which is one of the books that is approved for use in the public schools of New York and which probably becomes bad the minute it is used by a parochial school student.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6405.634,6411.85,You're really arguing then that before this law was passed in New York providing any constitution?
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6411.85,6412.984,No sir.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6415.286,6423.433,Why wouldn't your argument be the same if New York is going to give free school books to public children -- public school children have to give it to --
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6423.433,6424.12,No sir.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6436.04,6438.73,"Well, how can they enter the Free Exercise?"
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6438.73,6464.085,"The court said in Everson that that could be done but then I say that if the court goes outside there as it did here and extends the benefit to all children then there's always carrying it to all children that cannot exclude one particular task, the religious ones and while still going on to give the same books to show the attending non-religious private schools."
1967.660,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6486.481,6488.489,Do you rely it all in Sherbet and Verner for your --
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6488.489,6493.983,I rely very much so on Sherbet v. Verner and I cited in that section of our brief.
1967.660,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6493.983,6505.433,Yes but Sherbet would more support the idea that New York was violating the constitution before this law passed.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6505.433,6509.126,I wouldn't -- by providing it only for public schools.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6584.344,6599.759,"May I ask you, suppose this law provided that states paid the wages or the salaries of all the teachers who teach at schools that taught mathematics?"
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6599.759,6609.467,"Your Honor, I don't think I can generalize on hypothetical statute that against the background of necessities or judgments that I cannot --"
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6609.467,6612.839,There's either argument about mathematics.
1967.660,4,37810,porter_r_chandler,,6612.839,6615.327,It's been -- argument about mathematics.
1967.660,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6649.865,6663.852,"Well, all the facts that I've suggested is that the State of New York supposed to be all the wages or salaries of all the teachers of mathematics and all the church schools in New York."
