2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.96,"This morning we will hear argument in Case 19-177, United States Agency for International Development versus the Alliance for Open Society International."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,19.4,29.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Twenty years ago, the HIV/AIDS pandemic was devastating the world."
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,149.64,161.4,"Counsel, one thing that I think is not clear from the record is the precise relationship between the domestic entity and its foreign affiliates."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,180.08,188.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, you're correct that the record is not particularly thorough on that issue, despite 15 years of litigation on -- on this matter."
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,222.2,222.6,Is it --
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,222.6,224.32,-- certain perks.
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,224.32,255.72,"-- is it reasonable to insist on formal corporate ties in this -- in this context? I gather that it's undisputed that to be effective in many of the foreign countries involved here, you have to operate through a foreign entity, that the -- the effort would not be as effective if the American entity were the one actually on the ground in the foreign country."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,255.72,257.4,"Well, two points on that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,310.2,312.96,"But, presumably -- presumably, it does reflect their own views."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,324.84,329.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, with respect, I don't -- I don't think it does."
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,355.72,356.92,Thank you --
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,356.92,358.0,-- wanted to note --
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,358.0,362.36,"-- thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-177,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,362.36,369.4,"Mr. Michel, the Respondent seems to argue that your guidelines on -- your affiliate guidelines actually support their argument."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,372.56,412.24,"Justice Thomas, I -- I don't think that they do as -- as an initial matter and, even if they did, I think that would, at most, be a basis for challenging the guidelines, not -- not the constitutionality of the statute. And to start with the first point, the guidelines, which are reproduced at -- at pages 1A through 3A of our reply brief, simply provide that an entity can affiliate with a separate entity that has a different policy on prostitution and sex trafficking if it meets certain requirements, and -- and there are five non-exhaustive requirements spelled out there. Four of those would generally be satisfied by an entity that has legal separation."
2019.19-177,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,444.16,452.04,"When this case was here last, I seem to remember it was about the domestic organization."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,474.32,476.36,"Well, Justice Thomas, you're exactly right."
2019.19-177,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,535.08,538.0,Thank you.
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,538.0,538.64,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-177,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.64,544.36,"Mr. Michel, I have two questions."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,579.92,582.76,"Justice Ginsburg, I think there are a few reasons for that."
2019.19-177,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,626.28,656.16,"It -- it seems to me that these organizations are doing the same thing. But let me ask you my second question, and it is: May a pledge taker -- say you're right and these foreign entities have to take the pledge -- may they nonetheless work with prostitutes to encourage the prostitutes to take preventative measures that will advance control of AIDS?"
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,656.16,661.84,The answer to that question --
2019.19-177,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,661.84,674.0,"Can they do that? Can they take -- they say, all right, we'll take the pledge, but we're going to work with prostitutes, make sure that they use preventative devices?"
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,674.0,677.24,"Absolutely they can, Justice Ginsburg, and we encourage that."
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,761.36,762.64,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,762.64,763.48,But in any event --
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,763.48,766.08,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Breyer?"
2019.19-177,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,766.08,773.12,"Just following up on that question, some would."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,875.2,883.16,"Well, a couple of quick responses, Justice Breyer. I -- I don't think that the Court did base its prior decision on that particular concern."
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,971.16,973.96,"Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito?"
2019.19-177,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,973.96,995.28,"Counsel, as I understand the government's position, it depends on whether the foreign entity that ultimately gets the legal -- the Leadership Act funds is a separate legal entity or legally distinct from the U.S. entity."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,998.32,1008.88,"Yeah, it depends -- what we look at is whether the recipient of the funds, the entity subject to the condition, has First Amendment rights or not, and we think that turns on whether they're a U.S. entity or a foreign entity."
2019.19-177,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1008.88,1010.96,All right.
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1037.88,1067.2,"So the sort of difficult questions about how -- how to parse incorporation have really not arisen in this case because I think Respondents and the foreign entities at issue are clearly legally separate in the way that matters for the funding program, which is to say they've applied separately for different grants. And so the easiest way to answer the question, I think, is that when a U.S. entity applies for a grant as its own entity, it's not subject to the policy requirement."
2019.19-177,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1076.68,1092.4,"So the U.S. entity gets the money and the U.S. entity wants to make a sub-grant to a foreign entity, and as I understood your -- your position, whether or not the foreign entity can be required to endorse the policy depends on whether it's legally distinct from the U.S. entity."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1093.32,1102.48,"That -- that is correct. So, in that sub-grant relationship, the condition would then attach to the foreign entity as the sub-grantee of the U.S. entity."
2019.19-177,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1102.48,1103.12,All right.
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1114.84,1126.04,"I have to confess, Justice Alito, we haven't confronted the trust question, so -- so I don't have a ready answer for that."
2019.19-177,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1142.56,1159.28,"Well, is that because, until recently, the government's test was not legal separation -- was not whether it was a legally separate entity but a multifactor test under the regulation to which Justice Thomas referred?"
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1159.28,1163.64,"No, with respect, Justice Alito, that -- that's not and -- and hasn't been our position."
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1181.56,1191.2,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor? Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.19-177,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1191.2,1224.44,"I'm sorry, Chief. Did it again. Mr. Michel, the long and the short of this is that a domestic agency that does not want to adopt a policy of being opposed to abortion but who is willing to not support it in a program, they can't receive funds unless they affiliate with someone who will make the statement for them, correct?"
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1224.44,1227.64,"I -- I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.19-177,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1242.92,1259.16,"But the domestic corporation who doesn't want to speak the government's message but does want to do the program can't, unless it finds a affiliate who will speak the government's message?"
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1259.16,1263.36,"Well, with respect, Justice Sotomayor, that -- I think that was the issue in the case last time."
2019.19-177,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1263.6,1264.08,Exactly.
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1264.08,1266.12,-- that's no longer true. Yeah.
2019.19-177,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1266.12,1267.32,Exactly.
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1284.48,1294.76,"I think if you read it as truly facially invalidating the statute, then, no, we couldn't win."
2019.19-177,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1296.12,1296.44,All right.
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1300.24,1300.96,Of course.
2019.19-177,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1300.96,1313.84,"In Hobby Lobby, we recognized that a closely held corporation at least could be viewed as expressing the religious beliefs of its owner, a person independent legally."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1399.52,1401.6,"Justice Sotomayor, a couple of points."
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1443.96,1448.4,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.19-177,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1448.4,1455.32,"Counsel, I'd like to just follow up on that for a moment."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1477.04,1477.32,Sure.
2019.19-177,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1509.68,1525.2,I think the argument is a little -- goes a little bit beyond the forced nature of -- of the association to the concern about chilling of speech. Can you speak to that? The First Amendment doesn't care just about protecting speech.
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1529.92,1606.36,"I think that -- I think you're -- you're, of course, right about that, but I simply don't see any chilling of speech here, given that, as a result of this Court's prior decision, the domestic entities are free to take the money and -- and use it themselves in charge of their own message. And they're also free to make a different choice, which is to work through a foreign affiliate that, as a result of Respondents' own choice, will have to make the policy statement opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. But, even in that instance, Respondents are still free to use their own speech rights to explain that -- that they don't share the views of the foreign affiliate on prostitution and sex trafficking. I -- I think, ultimately, what Respondents are asking for is a sort of right to optimal message management, which is simply not what the First Amendment protects. If you look at cases like Rumsfeld versus FAIR, the Court explained that the law schools in that case might well be concerned about misattribution of their position on -- on letting military recruiters onto campus, and yet that concern alone was not a reason to find an unconstitutional conditions violation. And -- and likewise, in the Court's other funding cases, like Rust, for example, and Regan, the entities were ultimately not allowed to operate in their preferred manner."
2019.19-177,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1634.08,1635.28,Thank you.
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.28,1638.16,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh?"
2019.19-177,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1638.16,1641.88,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Michel."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1660.12,1663.84,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, I think that there would be real concerns about that."
2019.19-177,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1766.12,1767.12,One other question.
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1779.76,1780.36,Not at all.
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1828.0,1831.12,"Mr. Michel, take a minute to wrap up, please."
2019.19-177,0,62926,christopher_g_michel,,1831.12,1863.88,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I -- I do think this case ultimately in -- in its current iteration can be resolved on -- on a straightforward basis that Respondents themselves long accepted, and that's that the policy condition is a permissible exercise of Congress's core spending power as applied to foreign recipients that lack First Amendment rights but not as to domestic recipients that have First Amendment rights. And although Respondents have -- have broadened their position, they had it right the first time, and nothing supports the bootstrapping that they have requested."
2019.19-177,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1863.88,1870.44,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bowker."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,1870.44,1889.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The undisputed record shows that the U.S. Respondents themselves suffer First Amendment harms when the policy requirement is imposed on their foreign affiliate. Respondents and their affiliates share a name, brand, logo, mission, and voice."
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2004.08,2013.4,"Counsel, can your client compel what the foreign affiliates say on this question?"
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2013.4,2031.12,"We represent several different organizations here, as Your Honor knows, and I think it is correct as a factual matter that in every case, the U.S. organization effectively can veto the speech of a foreign organization on these issues."
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.28,2060.28,"Can you give me a citation to the record where I can look to find that? Because I -- I thought that by saying that there wasn't a formal affiliation, but the organizations share the logo and the name and so forth, that there was some absence of control."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2066.72,2077.16,"I think -- I think Your Honor is correct that there is -- as a legal matter, there may be the absence of control in some cases, but, in every case, there is practical control."
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2111.48,2124.48,"Thank -- thank you for that, counsel. You -- you used the phrase ""practical control,"" and I just wonder precisely what your test for that would be."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2124.48,2130.4,I think the -- the right test here is the risk of attribution.
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2156.24,2160.92,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-177,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2160.92,2186.32,"Yes, thank you, Chief Justice. The -- did you have an opportunity in the lower courts to discuss or debate what criteria would be used to determine whether or not the two organizations merge or are close -- affiliated closely enough so that the First Amendment rights apply domestically?"
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2186.32,2209.84,"We did, Your Honor. Judge Marrero gave the parties an opportunity to both submit voluminous materials into the record and to explain to him the relationship between these entities. I think, here, what's important is there is no dispute about the relationship here. These entities are clearly identified with one another."
2019.19-177,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2249.36,2262.32,"Well, if you went that far, could you give us just -- give us a recap of what the criteria would be for that affiliation that would be close enough?"
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2262.32,2263.44,"Yeah, absolutely."
2019.19-177,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2310.48,2312.44,The -- I understand that.
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2324.0,2331.12,"Well, I think the -- the types of injuries are twofold."
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2413.52,2416.24,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg?"
2019.19-177,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2416.24,2440.28,"Counsel, I don't follow your last response, because the domestic organization is able to speak for itself, and as far as any attribution of the foreign entity to the domestic organization, AOSI can disclaim the foreign entity's pledge."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2469.48,2470.56,Justice --
2019.19-177,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2470.56,2483.56,"-- organizations continue to work with prostitutes; they have just made a statement that, on the ground, means nothing."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2483.56,2514.36,"Justice Ginsburg, I think this Court had it exactly right in 2013 when it recognized that an organization cannot both avow the government's viewpoint and then turn around and assert a contrary belief or even claim neutrality without appearing hypocritical and without appearing to engage in doublespeak. And the problem here, of course, is that the entities are indistinguishable and they speak as one."
2019.19-177,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2564.72,2568.88,"Let me ask you a question, an -- an argument that you didn't make."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2600.56,2604.52,Justice Ginsburg --
2019.19-177,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2604.52,2604.96,-- is there a --
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2604.96,2606.6,-- I think it's an important -- sorry.
2019.19-177,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2609.84,2619.24,And I'm asking whether U.S. actors have an obligation to conform their conduct to constitutional norms?
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2619.24,2627.6,The first response is I don't want the Court to think that we're trying to export the First Amendment.
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2688.44,2690.96,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2690.96,2691.36,Yes.
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2691.36,2691.68,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-177,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.68,2703.56,"It seems to me the government is prepared to concede that you, the CARE U.S.A., doesn't have to -- doesn't have to oppose prostitution."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2719.88,2755.28,"Well, the -- the problem with that, Your Honor, is that, according to the government, the policy requirement still binds the U.S. organization in the following way: If CARE U.S. gets the money and sub-grants to CARE India, it must carry the burden of the government in the sense of imposing the policy requirement on its own affiliates and police compliance with the policy requirement, not just with respect to the speech and activities of its foreign affiliate but also with respect to itself, lest it violate the regulations which it --"
2019.19-177,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2755.28,2786.8,"Where do I find in the briefs or in the record just what you said? Because it seems to me just what you said shows that this case is 100 percent about the rights of an American company, the parent, and the question is, can they forbid -- can the government require them to forbid one channel of communicating the message, can it control what they say in that channel? The channel happens to be a channel that goes abroad."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2796.32,2796.6,Yes.
2019.19-177,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.2,2866.52,Thank you.
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2867.56,2869.72,Justice Alito?
2019.19-177,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2869.72,2878.12,I agreed with your client's position when this case was before us previously.
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2937.36,2954.16,"No, it wouldn't be, Your Honor, because that requirement doesn't require the affirmation of a belief and then conformity with that belief and espousing it as one's own. And that -- this requirement --"
2019.19-177,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2954.16,2962.12,"Well, it does exactly. The school that gets the money must have a policy denouncing terrorist attacks against American civilians."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,2978.32,2982.64,I -- I think that there's a problem with germaneness in that case.
2019.19-177,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3007.72,3008.28,"Yeah, exactly."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3050.28,3109.52,"Well, in that case, the entity being made to take the pledge is not clearly identified with the U.S. entity and, therefore, the pledge of the foreign entity doesn't get attributed back to the U.S. entity. And I think that's a very important difference. Here, when the U.S. entity imposes the requirement on its sub-grantee, on its clearly identified foreign affiliate, it's as if it's imposing the pledge requirement on itself, because, after all, these -- these organizations are indistinguishable and speak with one voice. I -- I do think it's important to make the point that the government still has very broad authority to control what happens with its funds, to put in place policies for its programs, and to require that grantees fulfill the requirements of the program in every respect. This particular requirement is unique. There's no other requirement like it in U.S. law."
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3122.08,3126.92,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.19-177,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3126.92,3131.68,"Counsel, there has been a long history to this case."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3161.56,3228.28,"So these organizations are the same organizations that were before the Court in 2013 but a smaller group because the rest of the clients are too small to have global networks. We now are talking about the entities that were before the Court in 2013 that are the -- the large international entities like CARE and Save the Children and World Vision and Pathfinder that are the ones with their own clearly identified affiliates overseas. And these organizations receive money here in the United States and receive money through their locally incorporated affiliates. CARE, which is the example we've been using, the U.S. entity receives all U.S. grant money under this program and then sub-grants to its local affiliates. And so, in the case of CARE, it has done that under objection."
2019.19-177,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3244.6,3248.32,I don't -- I'm not sure you've answered my question.
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3274.28,3276.48,"Well, it's a little bit of both, Your Honor."
2019.19-177,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3336.6,3341.88,And so are they threatening to take away the funding? Why?
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3341.88,3361.28,"They are now saying that the policy requirement will be enforced as against the clearly identified foreign affiliates of the U.S. Respondents because, they say, those organizations have no First Amendment rights. We argue that this isn't about any rights of the foreign organizations."
2019.19-177,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3363.24,3363.8,"No, no, no. Counsel --"
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3363.8,3363.88,Yes.
2019.19-177,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3363.88,3377.28,"-- I'm sorry for interrupting, but if the foreign affiliates have made the policy statement, what -- so they've done what the government wants."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3383.08,3387.84,We -- we object to that policy requirement.
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3407.6,3411.36,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.19-177,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3411.36,3452.6,"Counsel, in -- in response to Justice Ginsburg and Justice Thomas, you indicated that the primary harm your client had suffered is the risk of attribution, mistaken attribution, of the foreign affiliate's speech to the domestic entity. That sounds a bit like an alter ego argument, that the ordinary listener will be confused and attribute the speech of a foreign affiliate to the domestic entity. Yet, at the same time, I -- I assume you -- you'd resist any effort to pierce the corporate veil from those foreign entities and impose liability on the domestic entity."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3468.92,3476.24,"Your Honor, we don't ask the Court to pierce the veil or to treat these entities as alter egos."
2019.19-177,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3542.72,3558.08,"On -- on that score, what evidence is there that there is this risk of confusion or attribution, given that the domestic entity is free to disavow the statements of any foreign affiliates? What -- it seems to me an empirical question."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3559.44,3590.32,"Yeah, I think the best evidence is -- is in the record in the unrebutted sworn declarations of these organizations, which talk about how they are perceived in the public health community, the price they are paying in the form of hypocrisy and the way that they lose their integrity and their reputation and their brand when they're forced to speak out of two sides of their mouth. The -- the declarations that were --"
2019.19-177,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3590.32,3592.52,"I -- I understand -- I understand that harm, counsel."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3631.76,3639.64,"Well, I think, when these public health organizations take a pledge saying that they believe something, I think people take it very seriously."
2019.19-177,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3658.44,3660.8,"I'm sorry, counsel. Counsel, I accept that, again."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3676.84,3684.76,"Well, Your Honor, I think that falls apart when the organization speaks with one voice, as these organizations do."
2019.19-177,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3705.96,3706.44,"Well, are --"
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3706.44,3708.2,I think Your Honor had it exactly right.
2019.19-177,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3708.2,3730.08,"-- are we back then, counsel, to -- to the -- the belief that people will always confuse this as one entity and it's not possible for a local chapter of an organization to have a different view than the national organization or the international organization? That people cannot hold that -- that concept in their heads?"
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3730.08,3731.92,"Briefly, counsel."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3731.92,3732.96,"Yes, briefly."
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3754.24,3755.4,Thank you. Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.19-177,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3755.4,3758.68,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, counsel."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3775.84,3777.44,"We do, Your Honor."
2019.19-177,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3777.44,3778.0,Okay.
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3813.76,3842.04,"I think that's a -- a harder case, because I don't -- I don't hear that as requiring affirmation of a belief. Rather, it's in recognizing a fact that the U.S. has established a certain diplomatic relationship with -- with Israel, and the U.S. government gets to say what that relationship is for the United States. I don't think that's making the entities espouse that view as their own."
2019.19-177,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3845.6,3848.96,That would be acceptable in your view?
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3848.96,3850.6,I -- I think it would be.
2019.19-177,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3850.6,3851.08,Okay.
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3867.88,3871.48,"Yeah, I -- I disagree with that."
2019.19-177,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3900.6,3903.4,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3903.4,3905.28,"One minute to wrap up, Mr. Bowker."
2019.19-177,1,20625,david_w_bowker,,3905.28,3931.04,"Thank you, Your Honor. Applying the policy requirement to foreign members of these tight-knit international entities fighting HIV/AIDS overseas puts words in the mouths of the U.S. members of those entities, and the program regulations effectively prevent the U.S. members from even disavowing what the foreign members are compelled to say. The injunction should be upheld."
2019.19-177,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3931.04,3936.16,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michel, three minutes for rebuttal."
