1972.71-1647,0,22315,edward_g_gruis,,6.521,11.688,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-1647,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,319.775,329.021,"Mr. Guris, in this connection, perhaps you can explain, did the Maritime Commission exercised jurisdiction over any merger prior to 1940?"
1972.71-1647,0,22315,edward_g_gruis,,329.021,331.178,"Not that I know off, no sir."
1972.71-1647,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,341.475,349.524,Is what you just said or was what you have just said equally applicable to those earlier years as to the later ones?
1972.71-1647,0,22315,edward_g_gruis,,349.524,352.961,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1972.71-1647,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.398,1384.687,You don’t claim that those 50 amendments were an affirmative grant of authority to the commission.
1972.71-1647,0,22315,edward_g_gruis,,1386.43,1392.177,"It’s a recognition of the existence of that, but I will come to that point in a second."
1972.71-1647,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1583.545,1584.934,Mr. Seibel?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1584.934,1589.994,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1647,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.979,1985.007,Why do you say that Mr. Seibel if the last is obviously a generalized?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,1988.773,1993.322,"I mean, obviously in sense of generalized rather than specific Your Honor."
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2198.952,2200.674,This was back in 19 --?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2200.674,2204.256,"1910, 1911, 1912, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2943.172,2964.315,"Would you suppose that if you’re correct on this issue, which is the only issue before us whether or not Section 15 is (Inaudible) whether -- this is something that is filable under 15 and if the committee -- if the commission approves is immune from the Antitrust Act, that’s the question?"
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2964.315,2966.735,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2966.735,2981.365,"Would you suppose that if you’re right there that the full force of the antitrust funds would -- it would follow, they would apply to this acquisition?"
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2981.365,2984.603,I am not suggesting the particular transaction involved in this case is a violation (Voice Overlap)
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2984.603,2985.871,It can't be violation.
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2985.871,2986.559,"No, no."
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2986.559,2988.2,And that of course is not before us?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,2988.2,2991.321,"No, Judge Wilkie expressed no opinion."
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2993.327,3006.389,"Because it's certainly -- the legislative history does show the realization by Congress of the fact that this industry is sui generis, if you will --"
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3006.389,3007.673,Yes sir.
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3007.673,3017.256,"-- and therefore is, I believe, not to be the target of the full force of the antitrust laws as such."
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3018.144,3018.456,Oh!
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3049.835,3055.522,At that time the sale of assets was not covered by the anti trust law?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3055.522,3061.371,"It was, well, I think it was [Attempt to Laughter] later found out in this Court."
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3061.371,3061.848,That it was.
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3061.848,3062.71,It probably was --
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3062.71,3064.012,But nobody knew it was at that time?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3064.012,3073.582,"Now, stock acquisitions I think were the predominant mode of mergers and acquisitions, but that's right Your Honor."
1972.71-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.67,3160.815,Why -- now can you tell me why the act – why is the United States Department of Justice --
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3160.815,3162.881,Where a statutory --
1972.71-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.881,3163.56,"What, what --"
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3163.56,3171.852,The statute on partitions for review of the agency’s decision requires that the United States be a party.
1972.71-1647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3171.852,3173.513,Is that true of other agencies too?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3173.513,3175.398,Some other agencies.
1972.71-1647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3177.016,3180.909,The Comptroller of the Currency was -- at the ?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3180.909,3183.656,I don’t think so in other cases.
1972.71-1647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3183.656,3185.769,The Department is natural party?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3185.769,3187.028,Yes sir.
1972.71-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.447,3201.31,Didn't command you to (Inaudible)
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3201.31,3203.181,"No, no."
1972.71-1647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3203.181,3206.719,"I’m just curious, are there other instances where -- ?"
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3206.719,3216.358,The Interstate Commerce Act -- the United States wasa statutory defendant and we normally do not join together like with sisters --
1972.71-1647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3216.358,3222.932,"If Justice Frankfurter were here, he'd be going through the roof? [Laughter]"
1972.71-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.932,3228.872,And is it necessary for the department to consent under the statute also for the maritime commission to file at least (Inaudible)?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3228.872,3231.04,"Oh no, under the statute of the maritime --"
1972.71-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.04,3236.03,I know but (Voice Overlap) some other statute?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3236.03,3242.026,"Yes, there maybe, that’s right I think perhaps under the Federal Aeronautics Act, that’s true."
1972.71-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3242.026,3244.797,Actually both of you --
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3244.797,3248.25,"I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you Your Honor."
1972.71-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3248.25,3250.253,Both of you be here?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3250.253,3251.828,"We are, yes."
1972.71-1647,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3251.828,3255.113,Who speaks for United States?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3255.113,3257.42,I do Your Honor.
1972.71-1647,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3260.63,3263.822,Is it still true that you have to pay for their brief?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3263.822,3264.902,For this?
1972.71-1647,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3264.902,3268.338,"The briefs, is still true?"
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3268.338,3268.751,We did.
1972.71-1647,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3273.041,3275.939,"Well, this is suit United States versus United States."
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3275.939,3277.341,"No sir, Federal Maritime Commission."
1972.71-1647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3279.614,3280.445,The only two --
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3280.445,3284.414,"They have ceded their time, they have ceded their time."
1972.71-1647,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3284.414,3286.592,"They could have argued, could they not?"
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3286.592,3287.446,Yes sir.
1972.71-1647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3287.446,3292.274,"Well, as a matter of fact the maritime couldn’t be here without the consent of Solicitor General?"
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3292.274,3293.594,I think he could.
1972.71-1647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3294.047,3296.577,"Well, I notice that Solicitor General consented to it at the filing."
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3296.577,3302.549,As a matter of form in this case I think under the statute they -- perhaps I am misspeaking but I do think under the statute they have the right.
1972.71-1647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3302.549,3305.658,They may be --
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3305.658,3312.183,You may well (Inaudible) exactly what the statue contemplates.
1972.71-1647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3312.183,3313.519,That they will have the right.
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3313.519,3314.664,That's right.
1972.71-1647,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3314.664,3322.177,"The only uniqueness is that Seatrain has yielded all its time to you, if there is any uniqueness, is that it?"
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3322.177,3323.02,I don't -- Well.
1972.71-1647,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3323.02,3324.323,They could have been here --
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3324.323,3326.955,They could have been here and they are here through --
1972.71-1647,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3326.955,3328.724,I mean physically.
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3328.724,3329.785,"Yes, they could have been here."
1972.71-1647,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3335.112,3336.603,Because that's what we are hearing?
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3336.603,3338.989,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1647,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3341.757,3350.477,"I will ask this question. You are here as I understand it, asking this court to have affirmed the judgment below?"
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3350.477,3351.526,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1647,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3351.526,3371.268,"But in addition, you say at the end of your brief that you think the opinion of the court below erred in the distinction it may between what was called the simple merger or sale of assets and one that had some ongoing characteristic such as a covenant not to compete."
1972.71-1647,1,28683,irwin_a_seibel,,3379.462,3386.896,"Yes, Your Honor, because the great uncertainty, I think, that would result as to the scope of the commission's jurisdiction."
1972.71-1647,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3413.115,3414.947,Do you have anything further?
1972.71-1647,2,22315,edward_g_gruis,,3414.947,3420.711,I would like to add only one point Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-1647,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3493.919,3495.734,"Thank you Mr. Gruis, thank you Mr. Seibel."
