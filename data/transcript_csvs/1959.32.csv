1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2116.877,2122.255,There was nothing in his union contract that said anything about one way or the other.

1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2346.2,2348.805,Where did he have to do this work?
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2348.805,2354.137,He would have to go from the Winisook down to the raft in order to do it.

1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2356.558,2357.439,Yes Your Honor.
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2357.439,2358.972,Did he reach the raft?
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2358.972,2363.298,"He reached the raft in the accident, not prior to the accident."
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2363.298,2364.474,He did fell on to the raft?
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2364.474,2365.676,That's correct.
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2365.676,2371.537,He had not yet gotten to the place where he was to do the work by putting the deck planks on dock?
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2371.537,2372.504,But Your Honor he was --
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2372.504,2374.816,I'm just asking you that as to the fact.
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2374.816,2377.609,"He had not as yet gotten down onto to the raft, that's right sir, but he --"
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2377.609,2380.08,And that was the place he was to do the work?
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2380.08,2383.039,That was the place where he is putting the planks on but the doing of the work --
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2383.039,2385.517,Was he ordered to do in anything besides put the planks on?
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2385.517,2390.82,"Well, sure because he had to get the raft in position, firstly he get on with the raft."
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2390.82,2390.959,And --
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2390.959,2395.083,"In order to get to the raft, he had to put the raft in position where he could get to it, to get -- get on with it."
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2395.083,2400.148,"The place of getting to -- in order to get away he was do the work, he had to get away he could do the work?"
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2400.148,2400.616,That's right.
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2400.616,2401.654,Which was on the raft?
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2401.654,2411.21,"That's right sir and while he was doing that â€“ unlossing this line to pull the raft up, to get down onto it that he fell."
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2480.648,2482.706,"He'd be pretty close to both places, wouldn't, he?"
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2482.706,2491.537,"He'd be pretty close to the locale, but I don't think it he'd be closer from legal contemplation to a Jones Act remedy."
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2491.537,2510.795,"What you're saying is that they had been a ladder took from the wings of wines -- Winisook, whatever it is, down to the raft and he'd been ordered to go to the raft to do the work, you're saying that he was in the same situation as he had been, if he reached that ladder, the ladder will rotten and broken."
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2517.0,2518.156,"Well, I gave --"

1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2523.732,2524.656,I'm talking about this one.
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2537.334,2538.311,That's right.
1959.32,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2555.002,2567.626,"According to your argument as I understand, you're walking from the job as a mate towards his job as whatever that was that was not a mate -- not a member of a crew and on his way he fell onto the place where he was to work?"
1959.32,1,22644,edmund_f_lamb,,2567.626,2567.809,No.
