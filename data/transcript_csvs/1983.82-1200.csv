1983.82-1200,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.267,We'll hear arguments next in Daily Income Fund against Fox.
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,68.939,78.123,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,307.646,312.458,"Mr. Pollack, where in your brief will we find the full text of 23.1?"
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,312.458,318.044,"Your Honor, the full text is not in our brief."
1983.82-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.044,320.536,It is not in your brief even though that is the controlling--
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,320.536,323.968,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,333.461,334.834,--How about your petition?
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,334.834,338.446,I don't believe it is printed in the petition either.
1983.82-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,338.446,342.387,"Yes, page 19a of the petition, Footnote Six."
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,354.105,356.399,"I believe there is, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,356.399,358.62,The rule merely requires
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,366.885,367.566,Correct.
1983.82-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.912,379.643,"But, is that a matter of federal law or state law?"
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,379.643,381.604,I believe that is a matter of federal law.
1983.82-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,381.604,386.519,"Well, at least literally Rule 23 does not require a demand."
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,389.188,393.192,"Your Honor, that position was taken in the SEC brief."
1983.82-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,393.192,395.363,"Well, I am just saying that is a fact."
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,395.363,408.713,"Well, we state in response to that, Your Honor, that the courts have repeatedly held that it is more than a mere pleading requirement, that there is a substantive requirement of demand intended by that rule."
1983.82-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,408.713,418.318,"Do you suggest as a matter of state law... Say the State of New York might provide that there is no such requirement, it is an in New York corporation to be a valid state law?"
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,418.318,421.799,I think that would be--
1983.82-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,421.799,423.902,Could the State of New York do that if it wanted to?
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,423.902,431.476,--I think an action in the federal court that would conflict with the policy of Rule 23.1.
1983.82-1200,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.476,437.901,You think the State of New York would not have the power to do that in view of the way Rule 23 has been construed?
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,437.901,439.872,"That is my belief, Your Honor."
1983.82-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.56,490.526,"Mr. Pollack, we are not talking about the meaning of the word 23.1, right?"
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,490.526,491.758,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.106,598.246,"Well, Mr. Pollack, is it an essential ingredient of being a derivative action that the corporation could have brought suit on its own behalf?"
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,598.246,601.248,The Court of Appeals held that it was an essential ingredient.
1983.82-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.514,642.756,"So you adhere to the view that you took in your brief, I take it, that in order for an action to be a 23.1 one need not show that the corporation could have sued on its own behalf?"
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,642.756,645.427,We take that a back-up position.
1983.82-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.973,681.942,"You have been doing a lot of cross referencing between legislative history, opinions of this Court, language of the rule."
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,685.552,699.912,--I believe that Justice Brennan's definition in the Burks case is a satisfactory definition; that is to say an action brought on behalf of a corporation by a shareholder.
1983.82-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.912,703.664,You were in that case I take it?
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,703.664,707.297,"Yes, Your Honor, I did argue before this Court in that case."
1983.82-1200,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.297,709.879,Did you win?
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,709.879,711.15,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1200,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,716.882,719.065,"That messes with your averages, you know."
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,720.105,726.84,"I pondered that long and hard when the writ of certiorari was granted in this case, Your Honor."
1983.82-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,767.287,771.789,Doesn't 36(b) provide in so many words who may bring an action under it?
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,771.789,772.771,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.771,775.492,Why do you ever get to an implied question then?
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,797.435,816.539,"We believe that the recent cases of this Court, and I think it is Cannon... I may have juggled them in my mind... While I am standing here, I will look before I rebut... stands for the proposition that the fundamental purpose of the section must be considered."
1983.82-1200,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.604,1055.086,"You didn't refer to Justice Brennan's earlier statement in his opinion, the opinion for the Court, as dicta."
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1060.961,1061.402,--No.
1983.82-1200,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1108.873,1112.936,"Well, couldn't the director start to rethink as soon as the complaint is served?"
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1112.936,1127.757,"Yes, but there is the Damoclesian sword of the complaint hanging over their head and we believe the purpose of the demand rule is to provide for pre-litigation considerations, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1200,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1127.757,1131.378,Just as the statute of limitations is always looming in the background.
1983.82-1200,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1135.199,1142.245,"Yes, Your Honor, and that is, in our judgment, the second error of the Court of Appeals in this supplementary holding."
1983.82-1200,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1194.709,1195.19,Very well.
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1212.151,1215.733,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1200,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1284.739,1286.161,May I just stop you there?
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1290.753,1305.903,"--The words, on behalf of such company, do not, I suggest, imply that that means that the company itself may bring the statute nor does it make it derivative."
1983.82-1200,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.235,1311.977,"Well, that may be, but those words are in the statute."
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1311.977,1313.187,"--The words,"
1983.82-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.88,1322.102,Wouldn't the suit be pressing a company right?
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1322.102,1325.525,"No, Your Honor, I submit not."
1983.82-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.525,1327.976,Who would the recovery--
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1327.976,1332.23,"The recovery would go to the company, but that does not make it a right--"
1983.82-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.23,1337.443,--You mean it is getting something for nothing that it doesn't have a right to?
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1337.443,1339.396,--It--
1983.82-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.396,1342.137,It certainly has a right to the recovery if there is one.
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1342.137,1345.46,"--It has a right to recovery, that is correct, but--"
1983.82-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1345.46,1348.63,So the suit is pressing something on behalf of the company.
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1348.63,1353.285,--The suit seeks recovery on behalf of the company.
1983.82-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.824,1389.699,"Maybe not, but if the company has a right, they may not be able to sue for it, but if it has a right against the advisor and the shareholder may assert that right on behalf of the company, certainly it is fairly reasonable to say that a suit by the stockholder is one on behalf of the company."
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1389.699,1394.511,The statute indeed says that the suit is on behalf of the company.
1983.82-1200,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.511,1395.052,Yes.
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1401.936,1410.57,"Well, the statute also says that the suit that may be brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission is on behalf of the company."
1983.82-1200,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.851,1442.944,"Mr. Meyer, may I interrupt again?"
1983.82-1200,1,39933,richard_m_meyer,,1458.472,1492.004,"--Well, the fact of the matter is that there has been, to my knowledge, one action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the statute in which the Commission did recover and the recovery went to the investment company."
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,2786.34,2788.341,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.677,2950.935,"Could I ask you, before Rule 23.1 comes into play, it assumes that the corporation or association has failed to enforce a right?"
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,2950.935,2952.327,Correct.
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.327,2959.81,You say in this case the fund has failed to exercise a right.
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,2959.81,2961.072,I don't suggest that at all.
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.185,2966.345,"Yes, it says had it failed."
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,2966.345,2977.713,"--There is a dispute, of course, between the parties as to whether they have failed and that is the very function of the demand rule, to enable a dialogue to go forward and for the directors to say--"
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.713,2998.657,"Assuming we disagreed with you and assuming we thought that there was no right in the firm to sue under Section 36, to sue the advisor under 36, that it just couldn't exercise any right under the statute to sue."
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3001.739,3014.756,"--We have argued as a back-up position in our brief that we are still within the language of Rule 23.1, because we have a right not to be charged excessive fees."
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.239,3038.724,"It may be you have a right, but you say... but the rule says you have to fail to enforce it and so... But, if you have no right to enforce the right, if you have no cause of action to enforce the right under the statute, what then, do you turn to state law?"
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3038.724,3038.842,Yes.
1983.82-1200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.842,3041.966,Okay.
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3052.843,3053.514,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.514,3071.654,"Isn't it also possible your response to the latter is they don't have to be shareholders and, of course, that is true, but would it not also be conceivable, if they thought they had a good case and they were willing to finance it with corporate funds, that they could find a shareholder and assure him that the corporation would pay the expenses of litigation even though the corporation couldn't litigate directly?"
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3071.654,3078.519,"I suppose that is a theoretical possibility, but if those directors were lawyers that would get them into quite a bit of hot water ethically."
1983.82-1200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.519,3086.584,Do you think that would be an ethical problem if they thought there was a clear violation and that the corporation would benefit from the action?
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3086.584,3093.278,I would not want to be a director-lawyer and be someone seeking a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit.
1983.82-1200,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3093.278,3094.771,Say you had non-lawyer directors.
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3096.251,3098.734,"A harder case, I agree."
1983.82-1200,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3122.098,3130.414,"Suppose the directors, Mr. Pollack, concluded shortly after the suit was brought that maybe there was quite a bit to it."
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3153.849,3163.625,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that that gets into the issue raised by Justice Brennan's statement about cutting off."
1983.82-1200,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3174.432,3186.919,"They aren't intervening to cut it off, they are intervening to assert the corporation's right along with the plaintiff, whether he is derivative or whatever."
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3186.919,3195.177,--I suppose in theory that is possible that the directors could seek to intervene.
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3213.099,3220.131,"What would you have done if... You represent the Fund, don't you?"
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3220.131,3221.343,"Correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3221.343,3226.846,"If the Fund hadn't been named at all as a defendant, would you have been in this case?"
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3226.846,3227.878,Yes.
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.878,3229.007,What?
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3229.007,3231.068,"Yes, because the--"
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.068,3232.38,"What would you have done, intervened or--"
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3232.38,3233.031,--No.
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3238.254,3239.025,--Yes.
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3239.025,3241.116,I suppose I would not be here today.
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.116,3256.446,"Well, you are here just representing what is called the nominal defendant and you are asserting that you really don't... the Fund really doesn't care to have any recovery from the--"
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3256.446,3269.483,We are asserting that the company has a right to determine whether the litigation shall proceed in the first instance and--
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.483,3273.196,"--Well, do you think you are any more than a nominal defendant whatever that means?"
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3273.196,3284.914,--I think that the Fund has an important function in this circumstance and is represented by the independent directors.
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3293.492,3306.167,"That may be true, but the company's position in this case... The only possible reason for it being a defendant or being a party at all is so it is in the case to receive the money if there is some money."
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3306.167,3317.585,"--As a defendant, it in theory cannot receive that money and that, I suppose, goes to the question you asked Mr. Meyer about whether they are improperly aligned."
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.585,3318.116,They can receive it though--
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3318.116,3320.096,If there is a recovery.
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.096,3326.491,--I take it you participated all the way through the courts?
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3326.491,3327.533,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1200,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3327.533,3329.143,Thank you.
1983.82-1200,2,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,3329.143,3344.873,"The final point about Mr. Meyer's argument, the use of Section 16(b) as an analogy, we think is inapt, because Section 16(b) has its own demand rule."
1983.82-1200,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3390.685,3392.808,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
