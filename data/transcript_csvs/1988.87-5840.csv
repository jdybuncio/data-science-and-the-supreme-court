1988.87-5840,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.689,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-5840, Edward McNamara v. the County of San Diego Department of Adoptions."
1988.87-5840,0,32986,james_e_sutherland,,10.772,14.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-5840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,57.384,60.253,What were your claims below?
1988.87-5840,0,32986,james_e_sutherland,,60.253,63.472,The claim--
1988.87-5840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,63.472,65.823,Was it a due process claim?
1988.87-5840,0,32986,james_e_sutherland,,65.823,84.57,"--The claim in the trial court was that he was entitled to the parental preference under the California statutes, relying on Stanley v. Illinois, both establishing the fundamental right, and both due process and equal protection claims."
1988.87-5840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,84.57,87.32,So you did press equal protection claims below?
1988.87-5840,0,32986,james_e_sutherland,,87.32,98.478,They were pressed there by raising that particular argument in the trial court and on appeal.
1988.87-5840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,111.635,112.202,Including equal protection?
1988.87-5840,0,32986,james_e_sutherland,,112.202,114.487,Equal protection and due process.
1988.87-5840,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,118.273,118.773,"Right, all right, thank you."
1988.87-5840,0,32986,james_e_sutherland,,126.544,138.852,"Well, we submit that we raised the issue but not as directly or precisely as it might well have been."
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1552.39,1558.528,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-5840,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1602.573,1607.794,"Well, Mr. Harmon, the substantive due process issue is not what the petitioner raises here."
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1607.794,1625.839,"--Yes, that also baffles us a little bit because if you look at his opening brief, the argument is, of course, that Edward has a protected liberty interest."
1988.87-5840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1678.64,1698.369,"And the purpose of the quotation is to set the stage for the last paragraph of the footnote, which simply concludes: Because we have ruled that the New York statute is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause, we similarly express no view as to whether a state is constitutionally barred... it's not a substantive discussion of equal protection at all."
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1719.015,1723.936,"Well, it certainly does not have any discussion of the equal protection issue."
1988.87-5840,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.308,1790.664,"Well, that's almost the converse of finality, to say that you must come immediately to this Court if you possibly could."
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1792.564,1834.259,"--No, not exactly in those words, Mr. Chief Justice, but the point of the finality rule, which is to protect federalism and also to have efficiency within the court system, would be served in this type of case where the federal constitutional issues have been decided by the highest court of the State of California so that on any remand of state issues only, the lower courts are going to be judged by what the California Supreme Court has said is the appropriate federal constitutional application."
1988.87-5840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.259,1836.025,"But there was a remand, wasn't there?"
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1836.025,1837.042,There was a remand--
1988.87-5840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.042,1841.846,"Well, there was a remand, so it really isn't... the case wasn't over yet."
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1852.221,1853.737,"--Well, right, but--"
1988.87-5840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1853.737,1856.006,And there would have been no judgment at all to review.
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1856.006,1858.172,--That's--
1988.87-5840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.172,1858.739,Isn't that right?
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1858.739,1859.708,--That's possibly true.
1988.87-5840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.558,1863.093,"Well, they remanded to determine a--"
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1863.093,1865.028,State law issue.
1988.87-5840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.028,1865.562,--Yes.
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1870.932,1871.882,But the--
1988.87-5840,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.882,1874.051,And the federal issue would have no longer been in the case.
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1874.051,1914.343,"--But the federal issue was certainly a basic underpinning of what the trial court was going to have to do in that case with respect to the construction of the statute, and I think another aspect of this case that may differ from other types of cases where folks are asking a construction of the finality rule, this Court has recognized that in child custody cases time is of the essence, that it impacts a child's development to delay, and I think one could say this case is a classic example."
1988.87-5840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.23,1947.146,Excuse me.
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1947.146,1947.646,--Yes.
1988.87-5840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.646,1958.538,"Your argument still does, even if you limit it to that narrow category of cases, it does hinge upon what the Chief Justice suggested, that is, that if we might have taken it, you must apply to us."
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1970.261,1970.595,That's correct.
1988.87-5840,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.595,1976.832,"So in all custody cases, even though you might win on remand, you have to go through the expense of filing cert petitions here."
1988.87-5840,1,34547,lloyd_harmon_jr,,1976.832,1983.153,Only if the highest court in the state has ruled on a federal constitutional issue properly raised.
1988.87-5840,2,32986,james_e_sutherland,,3369.02,3370.053,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.87-5840,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3582.425,3585.594,You mean the trial itself lasted three--
1988.87-5840,2,32986,james_e_sutherland,,3585.594,3587.213,"--No, no, was within three or four months."
