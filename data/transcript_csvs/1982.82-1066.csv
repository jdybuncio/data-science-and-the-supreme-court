1982.82-1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.525,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Ptasynski.
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,68.924,72.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-1066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,572.378,573.879,What color is it?
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,573.879,576.847,"That's a green brief, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-1066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.457,665.089,"Well, Mr. Wallace, is it your submission that the uniformity clause would have no application if one could show that somehow there was no discrimination against a minority of states?"
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,665.089,669.231,"--That is not our submission, but I think--"
1982.82-1066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.231,670.573,Then why do you make the point?
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,670.573,692.905,"--Because it... it... it puts in perspective what it is that we're dealing with here and why we believe that Congress acted consistently with respect to this oil production in keeping with the theme of the act as a whole, rather than in a way that should raise concerns under the uniformity clause."
1982.82-1066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,913.734,918.106,"Well, what's that got to do with the uniformity clause?"
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,921.12,948.826,"Well, it does bear on the severability clause, but it also bears on the contention being made by the appellees that this act favors Alaska as a price for getting political support from Alaskan representatives in Congress, and represents a coalition of Alaska with others who favored the act as against the states that would be more heavily taxed."
1982.82-1066,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,980.236,988.437,"Of course, the fact is that Congress used geographical terms, didn't they, when they might have used other terms that were not geographical."
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,988.437,989.935,--That is correct.
1982.82-1066,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,989.935,991.513,And that's your problem.
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,991.513,1018.408,"And that... that... we think that... that what is reflected here is a finding of a unique combination of risks and costs in this area due to the climate, the geological factors, the... the special problems of the fragile environment caused by permafrost."
1982.82-1066,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1067.998,1083.149,"The argument is made in response that there are other areas... for instance, in some offshore drilling programs in cold areas... that present equally expensive problems, Mr. Wallace."
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1083.149,1091.13,"Well, no showing has been made either before Congress or in the district court that that is true."
1982.82-1066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1104.716,1109.497,You said that they have very long winters in Alaska and very short days.
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1113.276,1115.588,"--Well, of course it's a difference."
1982.82-1066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.271,1274.537,"Well, the tax is actually on oil production, isn't it?"
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1274.537,1281.189,"That is... well, it is designed to tax the windfall profit."
1982.82-1066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.426,1283.221,But is... what is the task on?
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1284.391,1291.125,It is on oil produced and sold or for which sale is imputed.
1982.82-1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1300.776,1301.619,"We'll resume at 1:00, Mr. Wallace."
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1324.314,1327.125,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-1066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1384.21,1390.005,"Well, they were co-extensive in the sense that only the State of Alaska was embraced within the exemption."
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1390.005,1394.817,"--And offshore oil adjacent thereto, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-1066,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1394.817,1396.642,But outside the State of Alaska?
1982.82-1066,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1396.642,1397.503,Yes.
1982.82-1066,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1760.041,1762.213,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1982.82-1066,1,42268,stephen_f_williams,,1765.477,1769.29,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-1066,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.622,1919.101,"Mr. Williams, would you concede that the Congress could exempt from taxation oil produced in certain described geographical... described climatic conditions, for example?"
1982.82-1066,1,42268,stephen_f_williams,,1919.101,1920.022,Yes.
1982.82-1066,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1937.219,1944.137,"Well, is it prohibited from giving a shortcut description by reference to a geographical area then?"
1982.82-1066,1,42268,stephen_f_williams,,1944.137,1945.529,Yes.
1982.82-1066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.756,2085.973,"Well, what do you suppose... what do you suppose this exemption... why did it even come into being, or do you know, or do you care?"
1982.82-1066,1,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2092.875,2096.42,"I can't rule that out, Your Honor."
1982.82-1066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.078,2103.088,"Well, there are some powerful Senators from that state, that's true, but they only have two votes."
1982.82-1066,1,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2103.088,2104.387,"They only have two votes, but--"
1982.82-1066,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2104.387,2105.76,And they voted against it.
1982.82-1066,1,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2105.76,2117.083,"--They voted against it, but they also withdrew the or ceased the delaying tactics in which they had been engaged up until December 14."
1982.82-1066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.083,2120.362,"Well, what... so I'll ask my question again."
1982.82-1066,1,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2122.332,2136.328,"Your Honor, it's hard to... they certainly thought, or at least many of them must have thought that this was a sensible dealing with the problem of special high production costs."
1982.82-1066,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.328,2136.905,Yes.
1982.82-1066,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2139.264,2142.341,"Well, we say that if you look at high production costs--"
1982.82-1066,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.341,2144.057,"Well, let's assume they were right, absolutely right."
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2146.697,2169.7,"Yes, we would, Your Honor, but I think the point is that in view of the facts that I have mentioned, even if the rational basis test suggested by the Government were applicable, what you're looking at is a... is a trial which would be very difficult and which it would be very difficult to justify the line actually drawn by Congress."
1982.82-1066,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.7,2181.321,"Well, would you say the exemption would be invalid if they exempted all oil produced above the Arctic Circle, and it turned out that the only oil produced was offshore on the Continental Shelf?"
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2181.321,2196.958,"Well, the two... insofar as they drew the geographic line and insofar as any part of any state was covered by that line, it seems to me it clearly violates the requirement of the uniformity clause."
1982.82-1066,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2229.098,2250.201,Is there any place below... and you call them the lower 48 states... where for long periods of time annually large numbers of workers are unable to work and yet have to be paid?
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2250.201,2251.012,"No, Your Honor."
1982.82-1066,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2251.636,2252.997,"Well, that is a difference, isn't it?"
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2252.997,2262.633,"--We acknowledge that the operating conditions are extremely hostile in Alaska, so that the costs are high, but the costs per barrel are low."
1982.82-1066,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2429.72,2433.689,"Before you do that, Mr. Williams, may I ask one question about your theory?"
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2450.852,2452.353,Essentially so.
1982.82-1066,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.256,2465.973,"Well, but... but you would say, for example, all coal mined above 5,000 or something would be equally subject to--"
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2465.973,2468.66,That wouldn't seem to me a meets and bounds description.
1982.82-1066,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.66,2470.563,"--Well, I understand that--"
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2470.563,2472.298,A meets and bounds description in this act draws a geographic line--
1982.82-1066,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.298,2472.876,"--Well, I understand."
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2479.497,2482.807,"--I don't think there would be any problem with that, Your Honor."
1982.82-1066,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.807,2483.794,That would be permissible.
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2483.794,2485.073,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1982.82-1066,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.073,2486.119,But meets and bounds would not.
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2486.119,2487.261,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-1066,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.261,2489.995,Or by depth of oil... oil well.
1982.82-1066,3,42268,stephen_f_williams,,2489.995,2491.805,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-1066,4,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3634.245,3635.742,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-1066,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3832.959,3835.927,"Thank you, gentlemen."
