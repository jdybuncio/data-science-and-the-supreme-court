2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.402,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-1332, the City of Ontario v. Quon."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,6.138,20.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the less restrictive constitutional standards applied when government acts as employer, as opposed to sovereign, there was no Fourth Amendment violation here."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,43.885,44.919,The written policy?
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,59.036,61.145,"That is the argument, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,122.386,126.617,"Well, we are dealing with Mr. Quon's reasonable expectations, right?"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,126.617,127.698,"Yes, yes."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,127.698,133.991,"And even with the written policy, he has the instructions -- everybody agrees -- you can use this pager for private communications."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,133.991,134.895,That's correct.
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,134.895,140.203,We're not going to audit them.
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,160.605,183.266,"Not when he was told at the same time that these text messages were considered e-mail and could be audited, and that they were considered public records and could be audited at any time; that is, it has to do with a different aspect of what the policy -- the oral policy--"
2009.08-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,183.266,194.402,"In addition to -- that was said at the meeting -- and Lieutenant Duke, who was the same one who later says: I'm not going to monitor as long as you pay the difference."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,204.193,207.364,"--Yes, there was, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,218.845,219.547,Let me ask you--
2009.08-1332,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,219.547,219.941,Counsel--
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,219.941,222.596,--Let me ask you to put the written policy aside.
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,233.043,233.917,Not--
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,233.917,236.821,"In other words, all we know is the list that I went through earlier."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,236.821,237.589,--Yes.
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,241.414,241.867,Yes.
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,241.867,250.146,"--That is, he is using his department-issued pager; he is a police officer and indeed a member of the high-profile SWAT team of the police department."
2009.08-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.944,291.114,"Mr. Richland, a little earlier you referred us to page 152 and 156 of--"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,291.114,293.395,Of the appendix to the petition.
2009.08-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.395,296.281,"--Oh, the appendix to the petition."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,296.281,297.533,"Yes, and that's the policy."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,301.608,302.793,"Well, that's the written policy."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,302.793,304.576,"That is the written policy, and the--"
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,304.576,309.809,"But the policy itself, from the point of view of Officer Quon, is a little bit more complicated than that."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,309.809,324.521,"--Well, of course, what the -- what Officer Quon's point of view is must also be tempered by what we are reasonably going to accept as a society of his understanding of the circumstances."
2009.08-1332,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,324.521,324.833,--Counsel--
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,324.833,330.752,"You would agree, I think, that if the SCA, the Stored Communications Act--"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,330.752,331.111,Yes.
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,331.111,340.373,"--If that made it illegal to disclose these e-mails, then he would certainly be correct that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy; isn't that right?"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,340.373,341.87,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,343.278,345.431,It's not reasonable to assume that people are going to follow the law?
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,345.431,347.29,"Well, for several reasons."
2009.08-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,380.199,392.1,"Well, on that point, do we take it as the law of the case or as a given that it was illegal for I think Arch to turn over the transcripts to the police department?"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,394.193,399.785,"Justice Kennedy, I don't believe it is law of the case that is binding on this Court, since this Court is a higher court."
2009.08-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,411.686,417.685,"On remand -- has there been a final judgment issued as to Arch, or is that just being held--"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,417.685,418.823,"I don't believe so, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1332,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,423.9,443.83,"--Counsel, let's assume that in this police department, everyone knew, the supervisors and everyone else, that the police department people spoke to their girlfriends at night."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,443.83,445.89,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1332,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,445.89,461.195,"And one of the chiefs, out of salacious interest, decides: I'm going to just go in and get those texts, those messages, because I just have a prurient interest."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,473.38,481.846,"Justice Sotomayor, as to the first aspect, the question of reasonable expectation of privacy, the motive should have no impact."
2009.08-1332,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,494.512,509.895,"But if in fact -- and whether we agree with this conclusion or not, we accept the lower court's views that there was an expectation that the chiefs were not going to read these things, some expectation of privacy--"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,509.895,510.363,Yes.
2009.08-1332,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,510.363,529.588,"--the limits of it have to be limited for all of the reasons you've said, doesn't this case begin and end on whether or not what the jury found is reasonable grounds for what the city did?"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,529.588,541.474,"I think that what this case begins and ends with, if we assume that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy, is under the plurality opinion in O'Connor: Whether the search itself was reasonable."
2009.08-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.803,566.512,I guess we don't decide our -- our Fourth Amendment privacy cases on the basis of whether there -- there was an absolute guarantee of privacy from everybody.
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,590.86,593.812,"I think that's correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.812,594.311,I think it is.
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,594.311,616.57,"And I think the reason why you must have the two-step analysis in a case of this sort -- that is, first look at the question as to whether there's a reasonable expectation of privacy, and then determine, if there was, whether the search was reasonable -- is precisely for the reason that, without that, what we will have in every case is the claim that there was a salacious reason, that that was the reason."
2009.08-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,618.571,623.848,"Then, according to what you just said, the jury determination was superfluous."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,641.293,643.013,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.087,656.209,"--So you have two arguments: One, that it's -- there's no reasonable expectation of privacy; even if there were, that this was a reasonable search."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,656.209,656.817,That's correct.
2009.08-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.817,661.068,Is reasonable expectation of privacy a judge question or a jury question?
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,661.068,667.05,"Well, if there is a conflict in the facts, I presume the jury must resolve those -- that factual conflict."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,672.688,678.561,Did your client treat on-duty text messages different from off-duty text messages?
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,678.561,684.18,"It did, once there was an initial determination made as to the--"
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,684.18,685.104,Why did it do that?
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,685.104,686.274,--Excuse me.
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,686.711,692.615,Why did it treat them differently?
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,696.597,701.049,It treated them differently out of -- because there were two aspects to the case.
2009.08-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,729.707,731.379,Is that something like the plain view argument?
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,734.955,736.047,--I suppose.
2009.08-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,736.047,736.956,"--Well, I'm serious."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,739.83,740.204,Yes.
2009.08-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,740.204,744.981,"--legitimate grounds to look at the messages, and then once they see it, they don't have to ignore it."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,744.981,747.371,"I think that's correct, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,747.371,748.214,"Well, why did -- I'm sorry."
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,751.198,756.134,Redacted because the inquiry -- the second stage of the inquiry in Internal Affairs--
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,756.134,756.54,Yes.
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,756.54,761.585,--was simply to determine how much time was being spent on duty sending personal messages.
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,761.585,761.991,Right.
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,761.991,767.083,So the Internal Affairs Department said: We don't need to look at the off-duty messages.
2009.08-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.748,785.154,Excuse me.
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,790.073,791.462,"--No, it was the other way around."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,809.486,815.234,"Well, you don't have to look at the messages to determine that with respect to the off-duty messages, right?"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,815.234,825.572,"--Well -- well, you did, because of the fact, Mr. Chief Justice, that there were job-related communications even while there was off-duty."
2009.08-1332,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,835.756,840.175,"If someone wanted to send a message to one of these pagers, what sort of a device would you need?"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,846.971,851.047,"No, there were messages that were sent from various other devices."
2009.08-1332,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,858.484,858.889,Yes.
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,862.09,863.104,--It -- oh.
2009.08-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.923,886.497,"You know, if they were on duty 24/7, there weren't any off-duty messages, were there?"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,887.106,888.357,"Well, I may have misspoke."
2009.08-1332,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,894.292,919.764,"If we take it that the Stored Communications Act does say that the provider may not give out the transcripts, if we take that as given, then how can the department lawfully use the transcripts?"
2009.08-1332,0,33948,kent_l_richland,,919.764,931.385,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, first of all, there was no -- there is no current claim that anything that the department did with respect to the Stored Communications Act was unlawful."
2009.08-1332,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,991.75,992.623,"Certainly, counsel."
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1003.775,1013.005,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Millions of employees today use technologies of their -- of their employers under policies established by those employers."
2009.08-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1069.923,1086.133,"Let me ask you this: Suppose the department asks for opinion of legal counsel whether or not transmittal of the transcripts by Arch to the department was a violation of the Act, and the counsel said: This was a violation of the Act; they had no right to send them to you."
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1090.477,1096.848,So the question is if the Stored Communications Act is violated?
2009.08-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1096.848,1097.207,Yes.
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1097.207,1100.113,We don't think the Stored Communications Act was--
2009.08-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1100.113,1109.827,"No, but -- no, my hypothetical is that the -- that there is a legal counsel's opinion that this was in violation of the Act, and let's say the district court said it is in violation of the Act."
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1114.603,1115.649,"--Oh, absolutely not."
2009.08-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1136.877,1147.933,"Well, California v. Greenwood was a question of -- of a Fourth Amendment standard that had to be nationwide."
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1149.649,1160.365,"--I -- I do think it's the same, and for this simple reason, that when you have a nationwide standard or a State standard, it's to fill the gap, whatever isn't necessarily protected by the Fourth Amendment."
2009.08-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1161.035,1168.752,"Well, but Greenwood was in the -- in the context of the exclusionary rule in criminal proceedings."
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1178.248,1180.011,"--Absolutely, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1332,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1216.202,1230.022,"Well, that's -- that's a little bit puzzling because there are -- electronic communications are stored all over the place in -- and there isn't a history -- these are -- these are relatively new."
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1260.699,1266.131,"--Well, Justice Alito, I do think that the underlying premise of your question is one with which we entirely agree."
2009.08-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1328.454,1338.619,"Your point that you made just a moment ago, that we don't want to freeze into place the constitutional requirements with respect to new technology, I wonder if it cuts the other way."
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1354.049,1364.688,"Well, I think that the -- the best way -- I think the most -- the easiest way for the Court to resolve this is to simply say that when we are dealing with what is reasonable, we look to the policy."
2009.08-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1375.933,1379.524,"Well, but that puts a lot of weight -- I mean, there are some things where we don't bind them."
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1405.032,1411.466,"Well, I think the clearest way, Mr. Chief Justice, to decide what is reasonable and what isn't is actually the terms of the policy."
2009.08-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1420.337,1421.959,Suppose we find a right of privacy.
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1432.41,1434.033,Absolutely.
2009.08-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.688,1441.73,--What's the government's position on the unreasonableness of the search?
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1441.73,1453.651,"--The government's position is that the Ninth Circuit just from the get-go got the standard wrong by citing -- by using a Schowengerdt test which was, was this -- was this search the least restrictive alternative?"
2009.08-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.486,1470.172,"Maybe an easier way, huh?"
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1470.172,1478.779,"--Well, I don't know that it's easier, in the following sense: I think that thousands of employers across the country rely on these policies and millions of employees."
2009.08-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1496.174,1507.187,"So, your -- your position would require people basically to have two of these things with them, two whatever they are, text messager or the BlackBerries or whatever, right?"
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1512.373,1515.107,"--To the -- under this policy, yes."
2009.08-1332,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1571.989,1588.546,"You want to -- you want to -- you want to undo O'Connor's operational realities of the workplace and say the minute you issued a written policy that renders all searches okay, even if the operational realities are different?"

2009.08-1332,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1602.447,1623.407,"You may have an argument that the nature of the policy here and all of the activities related to it don't prove an operational reality of privacy, but I don't know why -- you want a flat rule that says once you have a written policy, there' no expectation of privacy."
2009.08-1332,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1623.407,1630.263,"--And I think that is -- that is what O'Connor says with respect to the -- as long as the policy is in place, that -- that's what O'Connor permits."
2009.08-1332,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.263,1631.261,"--Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1637.851,1655.157,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think an underlying fact that we might be skipping over is -- is -- and both the lower courts recognize this -- that the computer policy that the department had didn't apply to the pagers on its own."
2009.08-1332,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1669.465,1670.822,Why is -- why is that so?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1689.58,1694.094,"--Well, the policy itself has two components to it."
2009.08-1332,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1736.809,1744.495,"But my question is, an employee reads this policy and says, oh, my e-mails are going to be subject to being monitored--"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1744.495,1745.041,--Sure.
2009.08-1332,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1745.041,1750.01,--Wouldn't that employee expect that the policy would carry over to pagers?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1757.239,1764.067,"Well, I'm sure the same reasons could apply, but the -- the city is the one that writes the rules here."
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1771.672,1775.543,"Maybe -- maybe everybody else knows this, but what is the difference between a pager and e-mail?"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1775.543,1776.062,Sure.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1798.645,1800.411,You can do that with e-mails.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1800.411,1802.408,"--Certainly, certainly."
2009.08-1332,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1842.517,1854.652,"I thought that he said -- he was saying: But as far as billing is concerned, I'm not going to look at these; if you use more than 25,000 characters, you pay the extra, and that will be the end of it."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1880.53,1890.981,"This -- this is what Sergeant Quon testified to, that he attributed to Lieutenant Duke: If you don't want us to read it, pay the overage fee."
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1890.981,1894.697,But what's wrong with his deciding: I don't like to do this anymore?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1906.052,1906.895,He can certainly--
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1906.895,1909.535,"So I would like to know, so therefore I'm going to look and see."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1912.783,1916.815,"--Well, he certainly could say I don't want to do this anymore, and he could--"
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.815,1917.408,"Oh, no."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1917.408,1918.375,--And he could tell everybody.
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.375,1920.559,I'm saying what's -- the city owns the pager.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1942.801,1946.236,"I don't think that request is unreasonable, Your Honor."
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1946.236,1946.564,Fine.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1951.138,1957.338,"Well, here the jury -- the only fact that was determined by the jury was the reason for the search."
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1976.095,1977.577,How does that differ from what I just said?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,1977.577,1983.652,"Well, it -- it comes into play on -- on the scope of the search."
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1984.436,1985.075,"No, I understand."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2036.596,2039.376,--The scope of the search was unreasonable.
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2039.376,2040.998,That's the conclusion.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2041.954,2050.747,"Under -- under -- looking at O'Connor, you have to -- you have to look to make sure that the search is not excessively intrusive."
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2062.757,2064.364,"Well, explain that one to me."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2064.364,2064.816,They--
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.816,2079.639,"Being naive about this, if I had a -- like, 20, 30,000 characters in 1,800 messages and I wanted to know which are personal and which are work-related, a good way to get at least a good first cut would be to read them."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2084.685,2086.452,"--Well, that's certainly one--"
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.452,2086.92,So all right.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2088.682,2091.025,--That's one of the ways they could have done it.
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.253,2101.49,All right.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2111.329,2111.969,Right.
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2111.969,2115.311,"So I guess if you had asked for consent, the officer would have said no."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2122.868,2128.96,"Well, they could have -- they could have had the officers themselves count the messages."
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.96,2133.02,"Well, the officer is going to say, hey, these are all big -- work-related."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2135.426,2136.691,Well--
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2137.066,2137.409,Okay.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2138.236,2140.389,Okay.
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2150.887,2152.088,That would have been rough on them.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2158.163,2159.507,--The--
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.507,2163.209,"--Look, so far I listened to four things, and I'm just being naive about it."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2169.658,2178.654,--They also -- they could have had the officers redact the private messages and then given it -- given it to the department.
2009.08-1332,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2178.654,2193.383,"But suppose that their application of what -- how much was being spent on business-related, all of your suggestions about having the officer do things does nothing about their application."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2193.383,2194.635,Well--
2009.08-1332,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2194.635,2200.367,You're -- you're relying on the very person you're auditing to do the audit for you.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2206.536,2216.78,"--Well, other than my one sample of -- example of saying, hey, let's -- let's stop the personal use and we're going to have a test month to determine exactly how many messages we need for our business-related purposes."
2009.08-1332,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2216.78,2220.652,That goes back to -- I don't understand that.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2231.103,2240.302,"Well, but the -- the sole purpose of the search was only to find out if officers were paying for business-related messages that they didn't need to pay for."
2009.08-1332,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.302,2242.941,"But the question, in the Constitution, the word is ""unreasonable""."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2274.227,2278.397,I think it comes down from that perspective on the excessiveness of the search.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2278.397,2287.673,"The only reason -- the only reason the officer would not be accurate -- I mean, I don't understand why the redaction is such a bad idea."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2307.807,2310.057,That -- that's exactly what we're saying.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2320.129,2336.982,"I mean, it's no different than the police coming in and saying, well, we're going to look at, you know, what's in every drawer and then -- you know, then if it turns out to be personal and private, we won't -- you know, we won't -- it just happens that we came upon, I guess, is Justice Kennedy's point."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2342.34,2343.245,That's true.
2009.08-1332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.025,2349.695,Can I ask you this question about the basic background of a reasonable expectation of privacy?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2368.888,2374.526,"Well, certainly -- certainly that could happen in any number of--"
2009.08-1332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2374.526,2388.304,"I mean, wouldn't you just assume that that whole universe of conversations by SWAT officers who are on duty 24/7 might well have to be reviewed by some member of the public or some of their superiors?"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2388.304,2395.378,"--But that -- that could be a possibility on any -- on anything that they do in their lives, whether it be their personal life or--"
2009.08-1332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2395.378,2401.613,"Well, but it's over official -- it's over the official communications equipment that they use for purposes of law enforcement."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2401.613,2402.346,--Correct.
2009.08-1332,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2403.017,2409.902,I certainly -- criminal defense attorneys challenging probable cause would want to look at these.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2424.101,2428.243,"Well, it's just like my mail that I might send out to somebody."
2009.08-1332,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2430.976,2435.145,But you're not -- you're not a police officer who is making arrests.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2441.189,2451.668,"--No, it -- obviously, there are different reasons that could come into play that would legally produce these messages, certainly."
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.668,2455.371,"Mr. Dammeier, you could say the same thing about private phones."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2476.94,2477.268,No.
2009.08-1332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2493.215,2505.382,"Yes, but there's no normal reason for going through somebody's desk; whereas, there would be a very ordinary -- ordinary reason for reviewing calls made to the SWAT -- members of the SWAT team, it seems to me."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2505.382,2515.47,"Well, there are -- as talked about in O'Connor, there are certainly a lot of valid reasons to go through a public employee's desk, if you're looking for a file or if you're looking for--"
2009.08-1332,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.47,2515.782,Yes.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2515.782,2517.782,--Or for -- or for an investigation.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2532.558,2543.223,"Well, to say that there's an expectation of privacy in the desk doesn't say that every intrusion into that expectation of privacy is an unreasonable one."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2562.733,2563.263,--Correct.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.526,2573.917,"Well, why isn't this a proper circumstance?"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2573.917,2580.178,"The initial circumstance might be proper, but how they effectuated it was not."
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.029,2601.7,"They didn't know which ones were private messages, did they?"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2601.7,2603.716,Not until they read them.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.716,2604.73,Not until they read them.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2604.73,2613.15,But there certainly -- they certainly knew what might be coming because of the arrangement that Lieutenant Duke had in place.
2009.08-1332,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2616.303,2618.99,What was the arrangement that Lieutenant Duke had in place?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2628.361,2628.907,--His--
2009.08-1332,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2628.907,2635.326,Did he ever say that -- that I'm not -- that you have a privacy right in these things?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2635.326,2645.543,"--No, but according -- according to Sergeant Quon's testimony, he told him: As long as you pay the overages, we're not going to read them."
2009.08-1332,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2647.247,2647.98,"Did he say ""we""?"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2663.487,2665.218,--True.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2693.942,2703.562,"What happens, just out of curiosity, if you're -- he is on the pager and sending a message and they're trying to reach him for, you know, a SWAT team crisis?"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2708.686,2711.061,I don't think that's in the record.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2718.993,2720.588,And would you know where the message was coming from?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2720.588,2723.087,I believe so.
2009.08-1332,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2728.57,2734.439,"And he's talking with a girlfriend, and he has a voice mail saying that your call is very important to us; we'll get back to you?"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2736.174,2766.223,"Well, I think with the text messages -- and that's what we are talking about the transcripts of, were the text messages that were data transferred from device to device, and here, you know, we come back to -- I did want to touch a little bit on the Stored Communications Act having play on somebody's expectation of privacy -- you know, it's -- lawfully, those messages were protected."
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.547,2781.907,Did -- did he know about that statute?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2783.202,2785.187,That's not in -- that's not in the record.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2787.043,2788.576,Can we assume he didn't?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2788.576,2789.184,--Right.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.074,2793.353,And what difference would that make?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2793.353,2796.679,"--I still don't think anything, given the operational realities--"
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.679,2800.009,"I don't see how it can affect his expectation of privacy, if he didn't even know about it."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2800.009,2804.786,"--Well, it's -- it's just like the California Public Records Act."
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.156,2825.89,"Ignorance of the law is no excuse, is what you're saying?"
2009.08-1332,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2825.89,2838.259,"Do you have any theory, or do you make any argument that Florio, Trujillo, and Quon's wife can succeed in their Fourth Amendment claims, if Quon can't?"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2838.259,2839.788,--I do.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2876.509,2877.118,Well--
2009.08-1332,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2877.118,2896.638,"Well, suppose it was perfectly clear that -- I mean, suppose that the department gave Mr. Quon a policy -- a statement that says: Sign this, you acknowledge that your pager is to be used only for work and that you have no privacy interest in it whatsoever; we're going to monitor this every day."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2905.385,2910.151,Until the point that it's on Quon's pager.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.7,2960.194,"Well, what -- when you send a text message to somebody else, aren't you quite aware that that text message will remain confidential only to the extent that either the recipient keeps it confidential -- and he can disclose it -- or somebody else who has power over the recipient or over the recipient's phone chooses to look at it?"
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2964.252,2965.738,"I -- I agree with that, and--"
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2965.738,2975.794,"Well, so she should have understood that, you know, whoever could get ahold of his phone lawfully can read the message."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2980.95,2984.542,--I think it's just a slightly different one.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2990.274,2990.96,"Well, that's a different issue."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,2990.96,3001.017,"But here, again, had they gotten consent from -- from Quon and got it from him directly, that's a -- that's a different story."
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3001.017,3003.86,"--Well, again, it depends upon their reasonable expectation."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3012.341,3015.215,That's -- that is true.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3016.104,3022.464,"Well, then they can't have a reasonable expectation of privacy based on the fact that their communication is routed through a communications company."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3022.464,3030.256,"--Well, they -- they expect that some company, I'm sure, is going to have to be processing the delivery of this message."
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3031.429,3032.365,"Well, I didn't -- I wouldn't think that."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3035.941,3036.83,--Well--
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.83,3039.189,You mean it doesn't go right to the other thing?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3040.565,3043.705,"--It's -- I mean, it's like with e-mails."
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.162,3067.257,Can you print these things out?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3072.975,3075.159,"--Well, he could have ultimately, sure."
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.159,3076.456,Well--
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3076.456,3085.563,"And -- and like, when I get a piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well, but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the Post Office and get my mail before I get it."
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3092.948,3103.273,But just -- just to be clear: You think if these messages went straight to Quon that there'd be no problem from the point of view of the senders?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3107.489,3110.551,--I think it's certainly a harder argument for me to make--
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3110.551,3110.972,Yes.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3110.972,3114.127,--that they have an expectation after -- after Quon has it.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3114.127,3120.998,So we have to assume for your argument to succeed that they know that this goes somewhere else and then it's processed and then it goes to Quon.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3120.998,3127.417,"Yes, but I think in today's -- I think in today's society that's -- that's a reasonable assumption to make."
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.399,3129.304,"--Yes, I didn't know."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3129.304,3143.721,"--I think it might have been Florio testified that she actually called her carrier to find out, you know, if -- if the messages that she would transmit would be maintained and that was -- that they didn't maintain a copy."
2009.08-1332,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3147.327,3152.31,Can an officer who has one of these pagers delete messages from the pager--
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3152.31,3153.746,Yes.
2009.08-1332,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3153.746,3158.34,--so that they can't be recovered by the department if the pager is turned into the department?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3158.34,3158.777,Sure.
2009.08-1332,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3159.12,3159.978,They can delete them?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3159.978,3160.664,They can delete them.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.883,3181.187,"Suppose I sent somebody a letter and -- and I have privacy in that letter, and let's assume it's intercepted at the Post Office, but I have also published the letter in a letter to the editor of the newspaper."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3189.934,3196.134,"Well, I think then certainly your expectation may be diminished."
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.134,3197.963,"Well, but that's the situation here."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3217.438,3222.124,But that would create a free-for-all in service providers.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3226.702,3227.217,Right.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3227.217,3228.589,--It's a free-for-all.
2009.08-1332,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.451,3229.763,Exactly.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3255.844,3261.875,"--Well, certainly, obviously the statute could come into play in addition to the Fourth Amendment."
2009.08-1332,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3298.702,3303.979,Are you sure that -- are you sure about your answer to the question of deletion?
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3309.743,3320.022,"Honestly, I'm not -- that's not in the record, and the -- how that pager works as far as deleting, I couldn't be certain that it would be deleted forever."
2009.08-1332,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3341.075,3354.962,"I thought the factual record was the opposite, that in fact most of the calls were -- not most, but a huge number of calls were happening on duty."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3354.962,3357.695,--There were -- there were a large number on-duty.
2009.08-1332,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3437.051,3439.988,I thought the policy was limited personal use.
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3439.988,3445.485,--The computer policy was limited personal use.
2009.08-1332,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3449.591,3458.432,"But the -- the notice was we're going to treat these just like e-mails, and e-mails were limited personal use."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3458.432,3461.711,--Correct.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3468.489,3469.024,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1332,2,20795,dieter_dammeier,,3469.024,3469.46,Thank you.
2009.08-1332,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3469.46,3471.769,"Mr. Richland, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3471.769,3475.146,Thank you.
2009.08-1332,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3557.628,3572.808,"Mr. Richland, do you take any position on whether Jerilyn Quon, April Florio, and Steve Trujillo stand in the same position as Sergeant Quon insofar as this lawsuit is concerned?"
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3572.808,3581.664,"We do, with respect -- in at least one respect, and that is: If Sergeant Quon loses, then we think the other plaintiffs must also lose."
2009.08-1332,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3581.664,3582.007,Why?
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3582.007,3582.553,Yes.
2009.08-1332,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3593.675,3603.686,"That means the government can set up an interception mechanism on telephone transmissions, on e-mail, computer transmissions--"
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3603.686,3605.046,"--It -- it does not mean that, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-1332,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3605.046,3615.508,"--If it doesn't mean that, answer his argument that, yes, you could take anything from Quon, but the storage -- you went to the storage facility, which is a Post Office."
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3615.508,3625.803,"And he says it's a Post Office, but the truth is that all of these plaintiffs admitted that they knew that this was a department-issued pager, and this wasn't a Post Office."
2009.08-1332,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3637.954,3639.483,So you have to get into who owned--
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3639.483,3640.36,--Excuse me.
2009.08-1332,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3640.36,3647.886,--Whether this was a -- we have to get into the Storage Act and figure out whether this was an RCN or ACS?
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3647.886,3665.286,"Well, I think that -- I don't know that it's necessary to do that, because I think that all that must be determined is -- and I don't think whether it's an ECS or RCS is -- you would require that to determine who owned it, because it was clear that Arch acted solely as the city's agent."
2009.08-1332,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3665.286,3665.894,"Whoa, whoa."
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3669.598,3670.3,I understand--
2009.08-1332,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3670.3,3675.452,--as opposed to an independent contractor who is doing business with the city.
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3675.452,3676.079,--The point is--
2009.08-1332,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3676.079,3677.296,You sure you want to live with that?
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3677.296,3681.137,"--I don't mean ""agent"" in -- in the most literal sense, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1332,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3681.137,3681.516,"Oh, okay."
2009.08-1332,3,33948,kent_l_richland,,3681.516,3687.98,"What I mean is that they were -- in effect, when there was a delivery to Arch Wireless, it was a delivery to the city."
2009.08-1332,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.711,3695.709,"Thank you, counsel."
