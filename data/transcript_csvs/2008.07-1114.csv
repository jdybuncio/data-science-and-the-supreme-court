2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.837,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-1114, Cone v. Bell."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,8.856,15.426,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this case comes to the Court, two things I think are uncontested."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,37.473,42.66,"There's also a third thing that's uncontested, which is there's no Brady claim on the merits."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,55.485,58.503,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are a couple issues that you've raised."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,124.814,125.531,"Well, but don't stop there."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,140.924,141.776,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,165.908,171.895,"Well, but don't -- you've resolved your dilemma by not raising anything at all about the merits in the question presented."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,171.895,174.664,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I disagree, and let me explain why."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,180.568,186.654,"Well, let's start on page Romanette i, where is -- where the questions presented are."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,192.125,199.362,"--Mr. Chief Justice, and I -- the document, of course -- let's -- let's talk about the text of the question presented, and then I'll give my explanation."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,209.168,217.257,And I -- I guess what I would say is you've got Federal habeas review of that claim because the district court decided it on the merits and the court of appeals decided it on the merits.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,217.257,222.978,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I have explained why it is, and if I can then take you to the rest of the body of the cert petition."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,253.949,254.532,Okay.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,256.566,257.318,--Yes.
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,257.318,261.37,"If you did not, then we don't address the procedural issues that you raised."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,275.529,282.183,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, can I -- can I answer the -- finish answering my question about the body of the cert petition and then come to this?"
2008.07-1114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.337,315.487,Where am I going to find footnote 6?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,315.487,318.206,"--Footnote 6 at page 30 of the cert petition, sir."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,334.234,339.972,"Our -- our cases clearly hold that when you have alternate holdings, neither one is -- is dicta."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,339.972,344.007,"Sir, the -- but it was disavowing it, I think, as an alternate holding."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,378.347,386.517,"Well, that's fair for the Respondents to say, look, there's no reason to take this procedural -- complicated procedural issue, because we win on the merits."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,390.737,392.287,"Well, I agree it was perfectly fair for them."
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.449,409.632,How -- how long has this case been going on?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,412.584,414.453,"--In 1980, August of 1980."
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.453,418.405,"The crime was committed in 1980, 28 years ago."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,418.405,418.922,Yes.
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.922,424.376,And when was the -- when was the -- the conviction and the sentence of death pronounced?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,424.376,427.328,"Very soon thereafter, within a couple of years."
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.564,432.814,"And you want to go back down again, for another--"
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,432.814,433.331,I'm sorry?
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.331,436.016,--How old is this -- is this defendant now?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,436.016,437.218,He's around 50 years old now.
2008.07-1114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,437.218,444.289,And when -- when did the court indicate in -- in Tennessee that you had access to the file?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,444.289,445.005,Yes.
2008.07-1114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,451.443,453.728,"Was that -- oh, I thought that was 2000 -- when was that?"
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,453.728,454.763,--In 1992.
2008.07-1114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.763,455.597,1992.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,455.597,459.065,In 1992 he was granted access to the files.
2008.07-1114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,465.036,470.956,And the Brady claim has been pending in the Federal courts but just not decided since about 2001?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,470.956,471.739,"--Yes, sir."
2008.07-1114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.562,481.997,But it was -- it was decided.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,503.328,509.998,"--Well, I took Justice Kennedy's question to be that this has been in the case all along and hasn't been finally resolved."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,549.391,554.093,I guess it's -- my questionings and -- questions and the point--
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,554.093,554.46,Yes.
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,554.46,572.322,"--that was raised about the time aren't related, because one reason these things drag on interminably is that you are -- exactly why you're raising this issue here: It's a procedural nicety or a procedural difficulty that arose some time ago in the State courts."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,599.991,600.391,Right.
2008.07-1114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,617.117,623.438,I thought what you asked us to do was to reverse on the procedural default issue and remand the case.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,623.438,625.123,--We -- we do do that.
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,641.699,654.024,"Well, that would -- that would then depend upon us agreeing to review a very fact-bound, necessarily fact-bound, Brady question when the questions presented focused on a procedural issue."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,654.024,660.796,"--Well, first of all, Mr. Chief Justice, there -- we have two different sets of errors that we think exist with respect to the Brady claim."
2008.07-1114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,729.29,733.076,That -- that seems to me to be directly contrary to what you say in your brief.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,744.284,748.169,"Yes, sir, that -- that is something that the Court can do."
2008.07-1114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,764.28,766.899,Can I ask you a question about -- on the procedural default issue?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,766.899,767.482,--Yes.
2008.07-1114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,767.482,771.684,Could you put yourself in the position of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,797.252,805.44,"I would have, although I would have -- I understand your concern about whether it was fully elaborated and sufficiently so."
2008.07-1114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,810.326,817.332,"Was that mentioned in -- in either the principal brief or the -- or the reply brief, the reason why it wasn't raised earlier?"
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,817.332,828.89,"Insofar as the defendant, Mr. Cone, told the court of appeals as to paragraph 35 and paragraph 41, the court of appeals should look at the affidavit."
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,876.037,880.173,"How many claims were -- was this a case where there, what, 81 separate claims?"
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,880.173,883.29,--The -- it -- I don't think there were--
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.29,889.694,"I mean, I can understand giving a lick and a promise to -- to each one if you come up with 81."
2008.07-1114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,889.694,890.546,52.
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,890.546,892.063,52.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,894.165,900.086,"--The -- but when we got to my point in the Tennessee Supreme Court, there was much less action in the case."
2008.07-1114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,945.765,946.531,If it is--
2008.07-1114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,946.531,965.41,Can you tell me what -- can you tell me what is this -- let's suppose that you had an initial Brady claim that there was one part of the file that you were entitled to see that said that there is some evidence that he's a drug user.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,989.192,1007.654,"Well, this is, I think, similar to the Bell v. Kelly question, the case that the Court DIG'ed on when you present a Brady claim and the State courts evaluate the merits of that Brady claim, and then you find out other material later, and the question becomes, how much deference you owe to the State courts the -- the first go-around."
2008.07-1114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1049.082,1075.214,"--But your -- but your proposal would be that they would never do it because you want to send it back to the Federal district court, and -- and if the State was laboring under misapprehension, it thought that, because he brought up the issue twice, he had somehow been defaulted, everyone can agree that that didn't make sense."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1109.704,1111.989,I don't know that he made a concrete proposal.
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1150.864,1162.922,"I didn't look, counsel, at your -- I don't know if it's yours or your predecessor counsel's brief in the -- appealing from the district court here to the court of appeals."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1167.493,1169.043,"--Yes, it did."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1181.483,1185.287,That was -- that was not a friendly question.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1193.041,1194.56,--It wasn't a friendly question--
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1194.56,1197.012,So this wasn't sort of sua sponte addressing--
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1197.012,1197.429,--Right.
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1197.429,1200.381,--the Brady claim as kind of a safety net on the procedural--
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1200.381,1202.314,"It wasn't a friendly question, but it was an honest answer."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1251.58,1252.063,--Yes.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1269.708,1274.012,"It's -- I don't think, pejorative or not, that it's fair to accuse us of -- of smuggling it."
2008.07-1114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1358.683,1360.201,Where was that colloquy?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1371.843,1376.394,"--Justice Ginsburg, this is in the yellow brief, our merits reply brief."
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.993,1429.095,"Well, I -- you know, I'll give you the first, that he appeared drunk or high."
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1452.895,1453.278,Well--
2008.07-1114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1453.278,1454.913,--of being under the influence of drugs.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1454.913,1459.65,--I don't doubt for a second that that's exactly the argument that the prosecution would have made.
2008.07-1114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1491.17,1493.888,This is a very complicated factual question.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1498.941,1502.227,"--There are three witness statements, and there are a series of police reports and--"
2008.07-1114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1503.21,1511.183,--And so you'd have to evaluate all of those and evaluate the prejudice against what was in the record.
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1514.785,1516.153,"--Two points, Justice Alito."
2008.07-1114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1549.641,1556.462,Let me ask this one quick question: Is it your view that the evidence was deliberately suppressed or negligently suppressed?
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1556.462,1558.83,"Deliberately suppressed, although it doesn't matter under Brady."
2008.07-1114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1572.107,1587.599,"--You recognize that a -- a defense like this, that the defendant was high on drugs, that's -- isn't it ambivalent?"
2008.07-1114,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1622.172,1633.378,"--It -- it could, and that's why I think it's very important that our defense was amphetamine psychosis brought on by post-traumatic stress disorder from honorable service in Vietnam, not just that he was a drug addict."
2008.07-1114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.48,1635.997,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1645.869,1670.401,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the Court has alluded in a number of questions, both the district court and the Sixth Circuit now twice have resolved -- have rejected Cone's Brady claim on the merits, and we believe correctly so in light of Cone's actions in the day surrounding the murder, his statements about what he did and why he did it, and more importantly the lower court's recognition that additional evidence--"
2008.07-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1670.401,1672.42,May I ask this get it out on the table?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1677.388,1683.192,"--Your Honor, I don't think there's been any -- any finding about the--"
2008.07-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.192,1684.394,But is there any explanation for it?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1684.394,1684.861,--The State denied that.
2008.07-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.861,1688.363,Was there any explanation for it other than a tactical explanation?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1688.363,1690.798,There's no explanation in the record.
2008.07-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.237,1708.426,"But it seems to me it's relevant because if it was suppressed for a tactical reason, it seems to me hard to say that the prosecution thought it didn't make any difference."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1708.426,1721.751,"--Well, again, there has -- there's been no finding on that, because each court -- and I think more than just in a passing statement, each court that has looked at it, both the district court and the Sixth Circuit, have looked point by point, especially in the district court--"
2008.07-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1721.751,1736.51,"What they have seen, but one of the first questions that always troubles me in a Brady case is the conduct of the prosecutor and the ethics of the profession and the whole -- whole importance of the rule is to be sure prosecutors perform their public function."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1751.27,1766.013,"--Your Honor, I certainly understand the Court's concern, and I'll just -- and again reiterate, there has not been any finding on that, but there is at least a suggestion in the record that some of the evidence on which the Petitioner is relying at this point actually wasn't suppressed."
2008.07-1114,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1779.939,1781.472,But Blankman -- that isn't the concern.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1893.981,1903.336,"--Well, Your Honor, I can't speak for the prosecutor's state of mind at the time, but I will -- will state that the central question in the case was not whether the Petitioner used drugs."
2008.07-1114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.388,1909.49,"Well, it was conceded that he was a drug user."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1909.49,1910.84,--That's exactly right.
2008.07-1114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.859,1914.159,And that he was dangerous because he admitted the murders.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1914.159,1916.661,--It came -- some of that came through the State's own witnesses.
2008.07-1114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1938.359,1945.663,Do -- do you think that the material described by Justice Breyer would have been excluded by the trial court as irrelevant if it had been introduced?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1949.549,1951.151,--I don't think it would have been excluded.
2008.07-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.99,1989.376,So do you think the prosecutor had an ethical duty to turn over this material?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1989.376,1993.494,--I think that the material -- if the material -- if the subject was immaterial--
2008.07-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.494,1994.43,"It's a simple question, yes or no?"
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,1994.43,2001.267,"--I think that as a legal matter, he -- there was no -- no need to turn it over because it was immaterial."
2008.07-1114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2001.267,2002.034,That's not my question.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2008.321,2022.847,"I'm unaware of any ethical requirement that he turn it over, and I don't think that -- and certainly under Brady if it's not material -- we don't think it was material -- then it's certainly not required as a constitutional matter."
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2023.949,2031.269,Do you believe that the materiality judgment is yours to make -- the State's to make as sort of a gate-keeping measure?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2035.071,2038.257,"--Well, I think that -- as--"
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2038.257,2048.398,"You -- you exclude -- do you believe that you can, in effect, suppress any piece of evidence on -- on the State's judgment that it will not prove to be material in the context of the whole case?"
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2048.398,2051.683,--I think prosecutors make those kinds of judgment calls all the time.
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2051.683,2053.885,Do you think that's a proper judgment for the prosecution to make?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2053.885,2060.455,"Well, I think that probably a prudent prosecutor would err on the side of turning over matters that--"
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2060.455,2060.988,Right.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2061.772,2062.49,--that have some relevance.
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2062.49,2071.096,"--Wouldn't he err on the side of turning over the matters because Brady leaves the materiality judgment, like all materiality judgments, ultimately, to the factfinder?"
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2071.096,2074.298,"Certainly ultimately it's left to the factfinder, but the prosecutor is--"
2008.07-1114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2074.298,2080.452,"--Well, initially Brady leaves the judgment -- the judgment, further on Justice Souter's point, to the attorney for the defense."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2099.114,2106.167,"--Well, I think -- yes, I think the defense ultimately would make the decision how to use the evidence that comes into his possession."
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2115.292,2126.148,Isn't the prosecutor's obligation to make an -- an initial assessment as to whether the evidence tends to be mitigating evidence or favorable to the defendant?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2127.933,2130.385,I think that -- that falls within that -- the prosecutor's judgment.
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2132.452,2136.789,Isn't this evidence clearly of a mitigating character?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2136.789,2138.139,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2138.139,2138.689,You don't think--
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2138.689,2139.255,I don't--
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2139.255,2143.609,--You don't think it would be favorable to the defendant to get any evidence that Justice Breyer summarized a moment ago?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2143.609,2144.526,"--No, sir, I do not."
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2153.549,2180.132,"Maybe I'm beating a dead horse, but Justice Breyer made the point, and he made it I think very clearly, that although that evidence was in, the argument here -- the argument that was made before the jury in this case is that the witnesses upon whom the defense was specifically relying were witnesses whose account of the defendant's drug use came solely from the defendant himself."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2201.595,2205.766,I don't think that it would have been material to--
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2205.766,2208.885,We are not asking about materiality at this point.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2217.407,2220.776,--I think it added no more than -- than what was already before the jury.
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2220.776,2221.393,That was not my question.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2226.18,2231.251,"No, not under his theory, and the reason is--"
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2231.251,2239.487,Then I will be candid with you that I simply cannot follow your argument because I believe you have just made a statement to me that is utterly irrational.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2239.487,2253.33,"--Well, let me explain, if I -- if I may, and the reason I say that it is not mitigating is because the -- the entire question in the defense and for mitigation purposes is the defendant's state of mind at the time of the murder."
2008.07-1114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2271.209,2274.078,"But what about the prosecutor who said ""baloney""?"
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2322.324,2327.545,"I think that the prosecutor overstated in that portion of his argument, Your Honor."
2008.07-1114,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2327.545,2339.353,"He also had cross-examined the two expert witnesses in order to show that they didn't really know that this man was a drug user, because their only basis for that was he told them."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2447.907,2453.328,"Well, I -- I want to answer your question -- I will answer your question, Your Honor, if I could just say one thing about the Brady."
2008.07-1114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2526.241,2527.293,If we read the -- can I ask you this?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2573.572,2592.136,"--In answer to your first question, yes, we don't disagree with the proposition that if a trial -- that if a State court refuses to consider a claim on the basis that that claim has been determined previously, that that would not be an adequate basis for a procedural default in Federal court."
2008.07-1114,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2624.94,2625.84,"Well, ""waiver"" -- my goodness."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2656.661,2658.061,The trial court--
2008.07-1114,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2658.061,2658.628,Yes.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2658.628,2659.28,--held that.
2008.07-1114,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2659.28,2659.93,Okay.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2693.084,2698.671,I think that rule holds if the petitioner has made the argument to the appellate court.
2008.07-1114,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2701.823,2707.761,Don't you think at this point the Petitioner is saying in his briefs: I've been getting the runaround.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2720.735,2721.771,"--Well, I--"
2008.07-1114,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2721.771,2725.723,"So you choose the procedures, but be sure that that's the outcome."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2725.723,2728.857,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, I don't think the Petitioner has been getting the runaround."
2008.07-1114,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2780.809,2794.783,Could the explanation of this language in the opinion be due to the fact that the State first argued that it had already been decided; then in later courts the State changed its theory and announced that it had been waived?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2794.783,2796.319,--The State--
2008.07-1114,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2796.319,2797.819,Is that why they're writing about waiver?
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2797.819,2799.387,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.07-1114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2818.148,2823.302,Spell out the waiver in light of what he said.
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,2872.069,2882.425,"--Well, I think to understand how this -- how this can happen, the bottom line is that he failed to demonstrate to the State courts why he should -- he was properly before the court to begin with."
2008.07-1114,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3086.441,3106.021,"What -- what do you say to the argument on the other side, that these various items of -- of Brady material were adverted to and were discussed on a purely isolated basis; they were not discussed in terms of their cumulative effect, which Kyles v. Whitley says is the standard."
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,3107.004,3116.21,"Well, I think if you look at the -- at the district court's opinion, I think that argument could be made based upon the way the district court treated the items."
2008.07-1114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.979,3155.287,"Do -- do you agree that the prosecutor was arguing, when he said that -- that he's a drug dealer, that he was not a drug user?"
2008.07-1114,1,33022,jennifer_l_smith,,3178.819,3184.806,"--Your Honor, I -- I think I've noted earlier, I think that the prosecutor overstated his case on that point."
2008.07-1114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3307.585,3312.422,It's outside the record and not really relevant to the case.
