2011.10-7387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.987,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-7387, Setser v. United States."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,8.737,11.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,50.447,59.42,"Counsel, in the third sentence of this provision, on its face, does Mr. Setser fit into it?"
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,59.42,60.987,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,61.889,68.275,"""Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively. """
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,71.227,74.179,"Your Honor, that term can only--"
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,74.179,75.262,The words are not unclear.
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,78.648,84.802,"--Your -- Your Honor, the words can only be read in the context of the first -- of the first sentence."
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,93.141,110.102,"Some fairly respected jurists below, Judge Easterbrook and Judge Fletcher, two different circuits, have read it as taking care of all those situations that the other two sentences don't cover."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,112.887,129.433,"Your Honor, I -- I think it has to be read -- the third sentence has to be read in its place within the statute, and I think that the third sentence refers exclusively to circumstances where the defendant was already serving another term of imprisonment at the time of the Federal sentencing."
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,134.468,137.353,"But that assumes the answer, is what I'm saying to you."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,152.012,159.785,"--Yes, but those terms of imprisonment weren't -- there was no term of imprisonment imposed at the time of his Federal sentencing."
2011.10-7387,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,173.426,177.711,"You would say that at the time of sentencing, there were no multiple terms of imprisonment."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,179.161,181.213,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.15,189.436,What difference does it make for him?
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,211.801,216.586,"Your Honor, we -- we believe that the order, what the order did was bind the court."
2011.10-7387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.868,239.551,And this is--
2011.10-7387,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.551,242.57,Entitled to credit or you could seek it?
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,253.259,265.817,"Because -- because, Your Honor, the court ordered that the -- the Federal sentence to run concurrently to that 10-year sentence that he received in State court."
2011.10-7387,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,270.221,283.028,"In situations like this, somebody is going to have to make the decision whether the Federal sentence and the subsequently imposed State sentence run concurrently or consecutively."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,295.336,300.054,"Your Honor, in our estimation the question is not the who, but the when."
2011.10-7387,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,331.092,340.198,Why would the -- why would the exact length of the sentence imposed by the State court be relevant to the determination made by the sentencing judge?
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,382.442,389.547,"--Well, Your Honor, at the time that the Federal judge passed this sentence, he had no idea what was going to happen in either case."
2011.10-7387,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,429.355,429.872,"Well, that's interesting."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,429.872,430.122,--imprisonment actually is.
2011.10-7387,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,430.122,435.49,Do you think that the Bureau of Prisons is bound by those factors when they make the decision later?
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,435.49,446.565,"Your Honor, the -- the Bureau of -- of Prisons is bound by the factors of 3621(b), and several of those factors match up with the factors in 3553(a)."
2011.10-7387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.594,464.094,--Where is--
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,464.094,464.477,And to the extent--
2011.10-7387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,464.477,468.247,"Where is all that that you just read, that they're bound by all these things?"
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,481.888,490.244,"--Your Honor, I believe it is in -- in the Solicitor General's -- in the appendix to the Solicitor General's brief, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,490.244,493.946,"--Well, I'm looking at -- I guess I got this off -- somebody got this off-line for me."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,512.942,528.636,"Well, Your Honor, I think that what the -- the law requires is that the Bureau of Prisons has to look at these factors under 3621(b), and those program statements are trying to define what those exact factors are."
2011.10-7387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,528.636,545.498,"I mean, doesn't it seem strange to you that a Federal bureaucrat sitting, a regional director -- I guess there are about a half dozen of them -- sits somewhere and decides whether a defendant -- say there's a 10-year Federal sentence, 10-year State sentence, and that person says, well, I think he ought to serve another 10 years or I think he's done."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,545.498,556.103,"Well, Your Honor, to -- to be clear, I mean, Mr. Setser is going to have to serve a 151-month term of imprisonment no matter what."
2011.10-7387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,564.757,570.327,"Well, I know, but -- but it's a big deal to be sentenced to, in my hypothetical, another 10 years in prison."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,573.196,585.187,"--Well, Your Honor, but still, that -- that person has the -- has the information before it, and it's also subject to judicial review under 2241."
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,591.526,592.992,But judicial review of what?
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,606.786,608.336,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,616.49,627.298,So you are going to make a bureaucrat equal to a judge in making the most important decision that a defendant faces: How much time he should spend in jail.
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,642.223,647.877,"Your Honor, again, it -- it's not the who for us, but the when."
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,647.877,656.817,"It's not -- it's not a who or when, because the State court judge's recommendation is not binding on BOP."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,658.602,660.435,"Your Honor, I'm aware of no--"
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,660.435,661.402,Just answer that question.
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,667.875,669.641,"--That -- that is correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,678.23,681.515,So it can't be just who -- it can't be just when.
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,683.05,685.669,"--Well, yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.821,693.74,"--Well, isn't it true that the bureaucrat used to make that decision not too long ago?"
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,693.74,694.692,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.692,695.958,When we had the parole system.
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,701.846,702.964,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.964,705.281,"Some bureaucrat in the Bureau of Prisons, I guess."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,705.281,707.916,"Yes, Your Honor, along with good time credits--"
2011.10-7387,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.916,708.702,It's not unthinkable.
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,708.702,711.385,"--No, Your Honor, prior to the passage of the SRA, the--"
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,711.385,719.64,But wasn't the SRA passed and this provision passed in part to take that decision away from the bureaucrat?
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,719.64,732.483,"--Well, it was a -- it was passed to take the decision away from the bureaucrat, that the courts could not order a Federal sentence to run concurrently with an undischarged State term of imprisonment."
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,734.083,736.269,"Well, let's answer Justice Scalia's point."
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,749.243,751.945,"That's part of the reason, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,764.669,769.423,I don't know why it takes away from them on that score.
2011.10-7387,0,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,776.846,790.654,"--Well, I mean -- I guess, yes, Your Honor, that is part of it, but that only comes into play when the first sentence does not apply and when the court does not have the requisite information."
2011.10-7387,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.102,814.971,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,835.717,837.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.994,863.368,"I'm not clear on what the -- what the government's view of whatever you want to call it, inherent judicial sentencing power is."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,878.044,879.511,"Not with a State sentence, Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.435,891.804,How do you know?
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,891.804,893.054,"Well, that's--"
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.054,898.291,"I mean, it did not -- what authority it did have did not come from a statute, right?"
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,898.291,903.427,"--Well, if it had had such authority, Justice Scalia, it would have overridden the Attorney General's authority."
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.495,909.064,Where is the Attorney General's authority prescribed?
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,909.064,910.016,--The Attorney General's authority--
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.016,912.385,His authority to say where the sentence will be served?
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,912.385,913.585,"--Precisely, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.585,916.086,"Oh, that -- that seems to be quite--"
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,916.086,916.686,If you look up--
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.686,917.019,--quite fanciful.
2011.10-7387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,917.019,933.631,"--really interesting, because I did go back and look at the '79 Senate report on the S. 1, which was the whole reform, from beginning to end, and my reading of that section suggests to me that they thought past practice was exactly what they wrote in this statute."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,968.185,971.054,--Let me see if I can answer both Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer.
2011.10-7387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1017.968,1018.468,He could recommend it.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1021.07,1022.439,"--Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.10-7387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1024.724,1026.524,You said Federal or State.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1028.693,1031.128,"Section 3621(b), Your Honor."
2011.10-7387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1032.712,1033.112,Yes.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1033.112,1034.58,"--the second sentence,"
2011.10-7387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1041.567,1050.423,"In other words, what the statute does is it's phrased in terms of place, but it really has consequences as to time."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1082.644,1083.762,--That is how it works.
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.762,1085.662,"Nunc pro tunc, right?"
2011.10-7387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1085.662,1087.048,That -- that's an amazing interpretation.
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1087.048,1088.664,You get that out of this -- this lean language here?
2011.10-7387,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.664,1092.535,"I understand that's your interpretation of the statute, but I -- I understand that -- that's the way it's being done."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1092.535,1094.118,"That is the way it's being done, Justice Kennedy."
2011.10-7387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1104.593,1114.782,"Or -- or what if it's a situation where he goes into one of these prisons that are run by a private entity, right, whether the Federal Government or otherwise, right?"
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1120.519,1122.602,"Privately run, State facilities, Federal facilities."
2011.10-7387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1122.602,1122.835,Okay.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1130.125,1137.279,"Mr. Chief Justice, Federal inmates since the passage of the first Federal crime in 1790 have served their time in State prisons."
2011.10-7387,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1147.502,1166.048,"It seems to me that the question of how long someone should spend in prison, which is what's involved in determining whether -- deciding whether a sentence is going to be served consecutively or concurrently, is very different from determining where the sentence is going to be -- where a sentence is going to be served."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1176.07,1177.606,"I don't think so at all, Justice Alito."
2011.10-7387,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1222.468,1222.801,Mr. Jay?
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1222.801,1223.235,Yes.
2011.10-7387,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1223.235,1225.419,Can I -- can I take you back to 3584?
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1273.483,1281.589,"Well, I will -- I will assume with you, Justice Kagan, although you know that I disagree, that the -- that this is conscious."
2011.10-7387,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1296.349,1297.466,"Well, let's just say Congress just didn't know."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1302.836,1313.977,"You would do it this way because -- because the limitations are so clear and because, as Mr. Hawkins said, there is a universe with sort of three possible relationships."
2011.10-7387,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1335.224,1336.007,"Well, now you are back with my assumption."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1344.797,1352.867,"--Well, its peculiarity, Justice Hagan, doesn't take away from the fact that if you let this situation in then the limitations have no meaning."
2011.10-7387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1352.867,1359.038,You are talking linguistically that I thought one Congress probably did have it in mind.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1458.282,1462.169,"It's not a practical problem, Justice Breyer, for a couple of reasons."
2011.10-7387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1462.169,1462.719,All right.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1464.704,1472.275,"Number one -- number one, the judge doesn't know -- you asked us to assume there has been a conviction in the State, maybe just not--"
2011.10-7387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1472.275,1472.592,No--
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1472.592,1473.394,--Maybe just not--
2011.10-7387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.394,1475.127,--There has not been a conviction.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1475.127,1476.362,--That just highlights my point.
2011.10-7387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.32,1503.762,How does the judge stop the State court judge later from making his conviction for a separate form of behavior run concurrently with the Federal sentence?
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1506.947,1518.522,--I don't think I or either of my friends who are going to argue today are suggesting that the Federal judge has power to order the State court not to do something.
2011.10-7387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1518.522,1518.855,Correct.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1519.672,1526.343,"Well, the way that sovereigns work out who gets to punish, if they both want to punish--"
2011.10-7387,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1526.343,1527.795,You may have missed my point.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1533.931,1537.133,"--I am delighted to hear that you think we are right, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-7387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1559.166,1572.223,"So that -- so that 20 years later after the defendant has served his mandatory minimum sentence, your friend in the Bureau of Prisons regional office is supposed to go look back and see what the judge said 20 years ago?"
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1572.223,1576.175,"Judges make recommendations all the time, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-7387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1576.475,1580.995,"I don't think that is responsive to the point I just made, that they make recommendations all the time."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1584.947,1593.053,"--As the Court is aware, the Administrative Office's standard form for the judgment in a criminal case allows the judge to make recommendations to the Bureau of Prisons."
2011.10-7387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1599.557,1600.909,"Mr. Jay, what does the ""or"" mean."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1614.4,1617.954,--Your Honor is reading from the Bureau of Prisons policy statement.
2011.10-7387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1617.954,1618.42,Uh-huh.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1618.42,1625.941,"If you go on in that policy statement, it alludes to other considerations that the Bureau looks at."
2011.10-7387,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1649.307,1649.924,Mr. Jay--
2011.10-7387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1649.924,1660.364,Do they take -- do they take account of the -- the defendant's behavior in the State facility?
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1661.364,1666.268,"In Federal or State custody, Justice Ginsburg, it may be a factor, yes."
2011.10-7387,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1666.268,1668.051,Which is something that the judge couldn't know.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1668.051,1669.937,That's certainly correct.
2011.10-7387,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.195,1684.48,I thought we tried to get rid of all of that when we abolished the parole system.
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1695.537,1698.989,--Mr. Setser has been sentenced to 151 months for his Federal crime.
2011.10-7387,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1708.345,1724.974,"--Mr. Jay, there is some force to your, to Petitioner's argument that federalism should be respected, that Federal courts -- the State judges and their individual wishes should be respected and followed by BOP actually."
2011.10-7387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1762.397,1763.949,You may answer briefly.
2011.10-7387,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1763.949,1764.532,The bottom line--
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1764.532,1765.801,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-7387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.682,1792.118,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-7387,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1792.118,1793.234,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.10-7387,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1793.234,1797.686,Mr. Young.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,1797.686,1801.138,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-7387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.727,1844.0,"The government says that the Federal courts never had that power anyway, so that nothing is being restricted."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,1866.163,1879.173,"Against -- that is wrong, because against a number of cases that we cite -- and I would commend them to the Court -- in which Federal judges previous to the Sentencing Reform Act anticipatorily sentenced."
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.458,1888.112,"But nobody found that out in 1980, in 1980 or '79."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,1970.914,1982.906,"I think the answer is that it turns much more on the order of imprisonment than the order of sentencing, because the Federal court in Mr. Setser's case, for instance, is imposing no obligation whatsoever on the State."
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.739,1991.578,"I don't deny that there are many instances where you could get it to work, particularly where you are going concurrent."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2023.514,2026.585,"--Well, let's take this very case, for instance."
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.824,2043.374,He can do that.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2043.374,2044.776,And that's all he did do.
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2044.776,2045.376,"Oh, I know."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2069.142,2081.532,"What the State judge could not do is to say: I want this State sentence, which is going to be served first, to run concurrent to the later-served Federal sentence because that would require the Federal sovereign to let someone go."
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2081.532,2083.799,"Oh, well, now we are getting awfully complicated."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2083.799,2084.084,Actually--
2011.10-7387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2084.084,2087.019,Mr. Young -- it becomes easier than that.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2093.09,2095.457,--Can't force the Federal Bureau of Prisons to do anything.
2011.10-7387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2095.457,2096.125,Exactly.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2108.45,2109.133,Precisely.
2011.10-7387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2109.133,2111.469,Runs it consecutively or concurrently.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2115.421,2119.056,The Bureau of Prisons can effectuate that order very easily once that's happened.
2011.10-7387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2119.056,2126.478,"Mr. Young, the government says that there are three situations in which this consecutive-concurrent problem comes up."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2140.821,2146.725,I think the best argument is that the statute plainly does not withdraw any authority.
2011.10-7387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2151.51,2153.546,I think that that's not right.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2179.029,2189.969,"--Well, my best argument, assuming the premise that it's a grant, which I think is not the best way to read it, but if it's a grant of authority, still the correct answer is it says nothing at all about the anticipatory context."
2011.10-7387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2194.706,2196.408,"Well, it does to this extent."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2222.808,2224.742,I think it would not be possible.
2011.10-7387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2224.742,2235.783,"So why should -- if the order is one way for successive Federal prosecutions, why should it be different when the second prosecution, instead of being Federal, is State?"
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2235.783,2240.354,"For several reasons, one of which is -- I think it ties into Justice Breyer's question."
2011.10-7387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.052,2293.988,But it would be the second judge.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2293.988,2300.225,"The second Federal judge can do it but a second State judge cannot, because this statute can neither empower the State judge--"
2011.10-7387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2300.225,2303.594,The State judge can decide what's going to happen with the second sentence.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2303.594,2306.094,--If the second sentence is served second.
2011.10-7387,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2325.007,2335.363,But what do you do with the -- the argument about the judge who anticipates a second sentence may be wrong.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2352.991,2353.943,--It's true.
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2496.968,2513.93,"Well, I'd be a little worried in this case at deciding whether section, what is that section, the place of imprisonment, section 3621(b) whether that does or does not give the power to the Bureau of Prisons, the power that they've assumed for many, many years."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2538.879,2539.962,--That is all you have to decide.
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2549.603,2550.82,I don't think you have to.
2011.10-7387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.722,2555.591,"Well, somebody has to make that call."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2555.591,2557.524,Should it be the judge or the jailer?
2011.10-7387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.524,2559.209,If you say -- it's either the judge or the jailer.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2560.743,2561.995,That's precisely the point.
2011.10-7387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.278,2565.363,"So if you say the judge can't, it's going to be the Bureau of Prisons."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2565.363,2566.647,--Precisely.
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2571.433,2608.726,"Well, let me ask you this then: Is it -- is it -- if we want the judge to be able to say this particular prisoner will serve his Federal sentence after the State gun sentence is served or alternatively with the State gun sentence, the 3621 says that -- that the judge can, if that sentence, State sentence has not yet been imposed, we don't know what it is, we don't know if it will be imposed, we don't know what they are going to say, we don't know whether they are going to sentence him to be -- count his time, time served in the Federal judge."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2644.697,2659.956,"It doesn't, Your Honor, because what that factor allows the Bureau of Prisons to do is to decide, based upon the judgment here, is this someone who needs to be in the super-max or is it someone that can be in a much more minimum security type prison?"
2011.10-7387,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.001,2703.783,"Am -- am I correct, Mr. Young, that if -- if the Federal sentencing judge is erroneous in his prediction of what the State court later sentencing will do, that his order, based upon that erroneous prediction, can be altered upon appeal by the Bureau of Prisons?"
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2703.783,2704.333,That's correct.
2011.10-7387,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2729.115,2732.401,I am interested in pursuing the point Justice Breyer raised.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2748.993,2750.778,--In -- in--
2011.10-7387,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2750.778,2759.051,Why isn't -- doesn't it make sense to say that the Federal court doesn't -- whoever is second can always tailor their sentence to what they want.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2764.622,2770.692,--Because in the dual sovereignty context that second sentencing judge cannot compel the Federal sovereign to either reduce--
2011.10-7387,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2770.692,2772.942,"Doesn't compel -- no, doesn't compel the Federal sovereign."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2775.494,2775.811,--Right.
2011.10-7387,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2775.811,2787.118,"I see you have already got, you know, a -- a 15-year sentence under the Federal, but I don't want it to be 25 years; so I'm going to, in fact, just give you a 5-year sentence."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2788.987,2789.37,Yes.
2011.10-7387,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.37,2795.974,"Whoever the second judge is can figure out exactly how long he thinks the sentence should run, and give the sentence accordingly."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2795.974,2805.08,"That cannot be the case if it's a State court and the State court does not know, with respect to a later-served Federal sentence, whether or not the time will be credited."
2011.10-7387,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2807.115,2818.923,"Well, but I suppose in the Chief's example a super cautious State court judge would say: I see you've got a 15-year sentence here, I don't know if it's going to be concurrent or consecutive; so I will sentence you to nothing at all."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2832.349,2842.205,"--In the case in which the -- the State judge says, I want it to be zero, then we know that the State relinquishes its custody."
2011.10-7387,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2882.913,2889.417,"Well, you're saying that your position is really more consistent with the Federal balance because it allows the State to know what it's deal with?"
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2889.417,2889.5,Precisely.
2011.10-7387,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2971.117,2979.123,"This is perhaps something that I should have asked the Solicitor General, but do you have any idea how often this situation comes up?"
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,2979.123,2981.325,I don't have specific numbers.
2011.10-7387,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3019.948,3027.185,"So is there evidence one way or the other on that question, whether this situation was in any meaningful sense before the Congress?"
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3027.185,3029.404,Everything is silent.
2011.10-7387,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3100.233,3109.505,"In order for you to prevail, I think we -- is it correct, we would have to determine that there was this authority inherent in the judiciary prior to the enactment of this statute?"
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3109.505,3112.806,I don't think that that is necessarily true.
2011.10-7387,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3122.812,3125.264,"Yes, with respect to Federal sentences, certainly that is true."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3148.13,3149.747,That's true with greater frequency.
2011.10-7387,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3155.383,3168.127,"But -- but if one had -- you know, what I take as the view of Justice Alito's question is that there was no -- no practice supporting courts sentencing in this way."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3183.637,3187.755,"In that case, if the choice is between the judge and the jailer, I think the choice is clear."
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3213.085,3214.668,"No, it isn't a tie."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3287.716,3294.037,"--Well, let me address what the anticipatory sentencing, the Federal judge, how he could possibly interfere with the State."
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3297.489,3298.205,"No, no."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3305.195,3305.578,Right.
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3305.578,3312.082,--but he wants -- he decides he wants it to run consecutive -- concurrently with the Federal -- ongoing Federal sentence.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3313.451,3315.283,"Well, the question is -- that's the key point."
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3318.485,3319.018,Well--
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3319.018,3320.02,--his Federal sentence hasn't begun.
2011.10-7387,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3321.454,3321.854,--All right.
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3346.922,3355.36,"--If the State court sentence has not been imposed and will run second, a Federal court can say consecutive or concurrent, but it wouldn't have any meaning."
2011.10-7387,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3394.569,3397.104,"He can't -- he can't -- if, for example, they are dealing with a mandatory minimum."
2011.10-7387,2,23461,evan_young,,3404.691,3412.114,If State law has a particular requirement as Federal law in some cases -- 924(c) does -- then that's the way dual sovereignty works as well.
2011.10-7387,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3603.405,3604.422,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-7387,3,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,3607.107,3609.143,Thank you.
2011.10-7387,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3642.864,3654.522,"That's preferable, to clog the judicial system with untold number of Federal convictions that have not been reduced to judgment?"
2011.10-7387,3,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,3664.194,3671.55,"--Your Honor, the judge can state the views -- her views up front in a recommendation."
2011.10-7387,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3674.936,3678.954,Could you tell me what facts would affect the sentence here?
2011.10-7387,3,30801,jason_d_hawkins,,3702.319,3718.615,"--Your Honor, I think in looking at 3584, it may well seem reasonable for the Federal court to have done this, but the -- the fact is, is that Congress drew a bright line, and it has to be subject to this undischarged term of imprisonment."
2011.10-7387,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3718.615,3719.581,"Thank you, counsel."
