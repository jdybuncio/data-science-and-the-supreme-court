1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.137,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-197, Eloise Anderson v. DeShawn Green, et al.--"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,12.429,13.561,"Garelis, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,13.561,13.871,Garelis.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,15.02,15.811,Thank you.
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,39.917,41.818,Would that make any difference?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,41.818,44.081,"Yes, it would."
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,44.081,46.332,What would you do if the injunction were dissolved?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,50.533,53.455,"At the moment, Your Honor, we could not do so."
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,66.684,68.595,"Why is that, Mr. Garelis?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,68.595,77.601,"Because State law, the statute here in question, absolutely requires, by its own terms, that California have that waiver."
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,77.601,81.455,"Well, I realize it says it has to have the waiver."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,83.646,84.517,Yes.
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.517,92.511,"--which sets forth... it says, this section shall not become operative until the date of approval by the United States Secretary of HHS."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,96.245,98.145,"Yes, Your Honor, the Secretary--"
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,98.145,100.756,--and so the thing became operative then.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,100.756,101.397,"--Yes, it did."
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,101.397,107.902,"Well, the statute doesn't say anything about becoming nonoperative if the approval is revoked, does it?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,107.902,113.475,"Well, the... no, it does not, that is true, but we hav always--"
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.475,116.176,Has it been construed by the California courts on that point?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,116.176,119.189,"--No, I do not believe it has, but we've always taken that position."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.189,121.339,"Isn't Federal law relevant, too?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,128.005,130.786,"As a matter of Federal law, yes, we could."
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.786,132.489,You'd just lose a lot of Federal money.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,132.489,144.905,"If the operative actions were taken by the Secretary of Health & Human Services to restrict our funding on California's Medi-Cal program, yes, that's--"
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.905,149.929,"Would California put a law, this law into effect without the matching Federal dollars?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,149.929,150.868,"--Yes, it could."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,150.868,152.15,"It could, theoretically?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,152.15,157.704,"It could theoretically, but it would run the risk of losing a good deal of Federal matching funds."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,157.704,161.927,But your submission to us is that you would not implement it without the waiver?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,161.927,172.704,"No, we would not... we have always interpreted this section as a mandate by the California legislature that we would not implement this particular statute without the waiver."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,172.704,176.107,"Have you applied for the, or reapplied for the waiver?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,176.107,176.898,"Yes, we have."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,183.99,193.027,Is there some indication that the Department has denied waivers submitted from other States that contain this provision?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,193.027,196.429,"I believe the Secretary has done that recently, yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,196.429,222.597,"If the cases had come up in a different order... suppose you had been... the Beno case had come up first, so you... the Federal permission was not there, and then these plaintiffs, the Green plaintiffs, had begun this lawsuit, wouldn't you be taking the position that their lawsuit was premature because you in effect had no law in effect?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,222.597,224.646,"Yes, we would."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.646,232.302,"So isn't that really where we are now, that this suit has in effect not become moot, but become not ripe?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,232.302,240.879,"No, I don't believe so, Your Honor, because the case... the questions here are persistent."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,246.161,264.735,"But if you say that you don't have any law in force at the moment other than the old law under which the newcomer gets the full benefits, then you're asking us to decide a hypothetical case about a law that is not yet in being."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,264.735,271.389,"--Well, the law was... the approval of the waiver was obtained."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.356,332.609,And in effect you have no law of the kind that the plaintiff is challenging.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,340.032,348.598,"Well, we did have the approval, and as soon as we get the waiver back we would be able to implement it, but it is true at the moment we would--"
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.598,358.855,And is there any reasonable basis to predict that you'll get it back when the Federal Government has turned down such applications by other States with the identical law?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,358.855,373.646,"--Well, perhaps one of the reasons why the Secretary has turned down such waivers is because of lack of guidance from this Court that our statute should, indeed, survive a constitutional challenge."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,373.646,378.448,But we don't sit to give advice to the Secretary or anyone else.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,382.321,383.253,Well--
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,383.253,388.314,--and now the law that you're trying to defend is not yet law in being.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,388.314,394.759,"--Well, the Ninth Circuit invalidation was on procedural grounds."
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.065,408.378,"The invalidation of the waiver, you're talking about."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,408.378,408.828,"Yes, that is true."
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,408.828,416.572,"If you get your approval back, there's no risk of there being an evasion of review on the analogy with the mootness flaw, is there?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,416.572,422.038,"No, but this is... what we're arguing is that this is a continuing question."
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,422.038,427.571,"Well, it may be a continuing question, but right... but it is not a continuous question right at the moment."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,439.108,445.563,"Well, no, but I believe it would be wise policy to have this question settled."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.235,478.418,"Well, if I could ask one more question about the administrative process--"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,478.418,478.828,Yes.
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.828,503.803,"--Is there an indication in the administrative record that the reason the agency has denied the waiver is because of its interpretation of the constitutional minimum standards that it has required, or is it also plausible to surmise, or to interpret the agency's action as being simply the agency's determination that this is somehow inequitable as a matter of welfare policy?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,503.803,505.733,I really cannot answer that question.
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,507.916,508.765,Not clear from the record.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,508.765,514.321,"--The waiver we have was approved, and it was invalidated by the Ninth Circuit, so--"
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.321,518.842,"Mr. Garelis, are you still litigating the invalidation of the earlier waiver?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,520.393,525.248,--The invalidation of the previous waiver was accomplished by the Ninth Circuit.
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.464,538.945,So that is done.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,541.158,542.007,"--Well, we have--"
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.007,543.219,The elimination of the prior waiver.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,543.219,549.344,--It is currently invalidated by means of the preliminary injunction.
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.775,549.344,"Not currently, it is finally invalidated."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,554.256,556.058,That was only under a preliminary injunc--
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.058,557.12,I don't care what it was under.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,558.4,559.401,"--I would say no, it is not."
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.401,560.17,Why is it--
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,560.17,561.132,Because--
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.132,562.303,"--You haven't appealed it, but it's not final?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,562.303,566.246,"--It was invalidated by a preliminary injunction, and--"
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,566.246,566.645,What was the--
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,566.645,567.556,--we can still address the merits.
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.556,570.548,--What was the basis on which it was invalidated?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,570.548,586.209,"It was invalidated on the basis that the Secretary of Health & Human Services had not adequately considered the opposition of... of those who were opposed to the statute at that time, that the administrative record did not reflect an adequate review of the opposition."
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,586.209,590.75,And what was the dis... that it was to be sent back to the Secretary?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,590.75,601.018,"The instructions were that... I can't quote them exactly, but it was that the matter was to be remanded to the district court with instructions that it be remanded to the Secretary for additional consideration."
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.51,613.485,"I really don't understand why the State has enough interest to bring this case here but did not have enough interest to continue to litigate that issue, to just roll over and say, the waiver's dead, and we'll let it die."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,613.485,622.791,--I believe California thought that the best we would be able to do is simply to... is get a remand.
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,630.257,637.631,"Well, wouldn't the Secretary have had to have chosen, because the injunction... it was the Secretary's action that was invalidated in that Beno case, wasn't it?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,637.631,637.971,"Yes, it was."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,637.971,643.916,"And so the Secretary didn't have adequate notice and comment, and so... and the Secretary chose not to appeal."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,643.916,645.578,"Yes, that's true."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.578,647.028,So--
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,647.028,655.033,"But we also would have had... we also had the ability to petition for writ of certiorari, I believe, because we were a party to that action also, and it was our waiver."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,655.033,662.729,"--But if the Secretary says, they said I didn't have adequate notice and comment, maybe I didn't, you would be in a pretty... you'd--"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,662.729,665.5,It was hard to argue it when the Secretary was not going to join with us.
1994.94-197,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.5,668.833,--But is that issue still under litigation... that issue?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,676.88,681.322,"Yes, I believe that's still under litigation, because the decision--"
1994.94-197,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,681.322,683.635,It is?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,683.635,684.505,--was only made on a--
1994.94-197,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.505,686.327,I realize it was made on a pre... this is a preliminary injunction.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,686.327,686.936,--Yes.
1994.94-197,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,686.936,689.059,Many decisions are made on preliminary injunction.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,701.995,709.952,"Well, we're going to have to wait and see what the Secretary's resolution is, and we have no other plans of litigating except for that."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.954,796.748,"If your theory is right, how long could California maintain this differential?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,804.244,805.404,"Yes, that is true, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,805.404,807.106,Could they do it for 2 years?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,807.106,810.669,We would maintain that we could do it for a year.
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.689,845.631,"On your reasoning, could California also adopt a law that would say, if you move into California from a State that has a higher income tax... that might be hard to imagine, but maybe there is one--"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,852.765,861.41,"We believe California could do so with a rational basis, and we believe that that statute would be adjudicated under the rational basis standard."
1994.94-197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,861.41,865.263,Why isn't the right to travel implicated here?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,865.263,884.364,"The right to travel is not implicated to the extent necessary to become a penalty, because the statute is very carefully drafted to maintain the recipient's level of receipt of benefits."
1994.94-197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,884.364,890.889,"Is it possible that the cost of living is higher in California than, let's say, Louisiana?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,890.889,892.662,"That may be, but--"
1994.94-197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,892.662,897.564,Does California's scheme make any adjustment for the higher cost of living?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,897.564,898.946,"--No, it does not."
1994.94-197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,898.946,911.552,"Well, so in a very real sense the new residents are worse off in real terms than they would have been due to the cost of living increase, aren't they?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,911.552,912.433,Well--
1994.94-197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,912.433,918.778,"It's not as though they are just as well off, in real terms, as if they stayed in Louisiana."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,918.778,926.823,"--We would submit, Your Honor, that an examination of real terms goes against the AFDC program as it is set up."
1994.94-197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,946.374,962.546,"Well, but for purposes of knowing whether there's a violation of any constitutional protection given to the right to travel and establish a new residence in a new State, perhaps it does permit that kind of an inquiry."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,962.546,983.68,"--Well, when a person comes from a State with a higher benefit level to California, that person is restricted to the California benefit level even in the absence of our statute, and that is constitutional, so there's no reason why a person coming from a State with a lower--"
1994.94-197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,983.68,1004.564,"But there, of course, California's extending the same level of benefits both to long-term residents and to new residents, and in these circumstances California has a two-level benefit scheme, a lower level for new residents and a higher level for residents of some duration."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1004.564,1005.306,"--That is true, but--"
1994.94-197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1005.306,1006.464,That's the difference.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1006.464,1014.209,"--Yes, but when you're talking about analyzing whether or not there's a penalty, you're looking at a strict scrutiny analysis."
1994.94-197,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1025.499,1029.809,"Well, I was just suggesting in real terms there may well be a penalty."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1029.809,1041.087,"Okay, but you see there's nothing to guarantee that that person had a benefit level in the prior State that met the necessities of life in that State, either."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1048.433,1063.533,"Could you tell me the... you answered Justice Ginsburg that perhaps 2 years would be an impermissible waiting period, if I interpret your answer correctly."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1074.649,1080.924,"Well, if I did suggest that a certain amount... I did so in error, and I apologize."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1092.471,1103.418,"--Well, perhaps I was reading too much into your answer, and you didn't make that concession, but let me ask you, would a 3-year waiting period raise problems that this statute doesn't?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1103.418,1107.06,I believe amounts over a year would raise more problems.
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1108.71,1111.153,"Why is that, if it's not a penalty, it's not a penalty?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1112.714,1113.145,Pardon?
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1113.145,1114.637,Under what constitutional standard?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1116.607,1119.068,"Well, it would be a penalty at that point."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1122.06,1127.113,"So the longer the disability, the more it impinges on the right to travel?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1127.113,1128.725,"I think we would have to admit that, yes."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1128.725,1135.829,And... but then you are conceding that an infringement or a burden on the right of travel is impermissible?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1135.829,1136.95,No.
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1154.091,1160.005,So you posit... you take as your opening premise that there is a right to travel--
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1160.005,1160.536,"Yes, we do."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1160.536,1162.025,--and there cannot be a penalty imposed upon that.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1162.025,1163.147,"Yes, we do."
1994.94-197,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1163.147,1165.838,So we're just arguing here about whether or not that's a penalty?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1165.838,1174.614,"What we're arguing is, is our... is the effect of our statute on the right to travel of a magnitude to constitute an impermissible penalty?"
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.614,1183.3,"It's a penalty, you're saying, but not enough of a... you're acknowledging it's a little bit of a penalty, because otherwise multiplying it by three, three times zero is zero."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1189.794,1196.229,"What... the way I would interpret it, Your Honor, is that we possibly have some deterrence effect on travel."
1994.94-197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.26,1214.421,But is the length of the period the measure of the deterrence on travel?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1228.271,1231.842,"--I would... I believe I would agree with the thrust of your question, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1265.016,1273.009,"Well, you're suggesting that the magnitude of the differential and real impact on the person's livelihood is what we should look at, rather than just the length of time."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1273.009,1273.79,"Yes, I am."
1994.94-197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1273.79,1282.405,"But then, if it were true that... in one State there was a very dramatic difference of... I can't remember the figures, but there was, from one of these States there was a rather dramatic difference in the amount of money."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1289.602,1291.462,"No, I don't believe it would, because--"
1994.94-197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.462,1293.563,No matter how dramatic the difference?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1293.563,1300.468,"--Because the amount, Your Honor, that was received by that recipient in the prior State is a constitutionally permissible amount."
1994.94-197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1300.468,1301.619,In that State.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1301.619,1305.21,"In that State, and that should carry over to California--"
1994.94-197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.21,1306.352,But--
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1306.352,1316.239,"--because, as I stated before, any concepts of standard of need are not necessarily related to the setting of benefit levels."
1994.94-197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1317.308,1330.978,"--No, but your test before, you were suggesting that at a certain point the burden becomes a penalty and interferes with the right to travel, and I'm a little puzzled as to why the magnitude of the differential is irrelevant to that analysis, but the period of time is critical."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1330.978,1338.723,"--Well, let me try to restate it for a second, because I don't believe I stated it clearly enough."
1994.94-197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.983,1358.975,Would you statute be constitutional if it did not have those offsetting benefits in it?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1368.222,1391.828,"--We would submit that because California is offering a constitutionally permissible amount to all recipients, because eligibility is not in question, as it is in a lot of other cases that have come before this Court, for those reasons, our statute is constitutionally permissible and does not constitute a penalty on the right to travel."
1994.94-197,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.828,1394.509,I'm not quite sure whether you're saying yes or no to my question.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1412.281,1426.65,"I would answer yes with one proviso, that I understand that your question includes something that is in our statute, which is that the recipients are receiving a constitutionally permissible amount in their State of prior residence--"
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.65,1427.671,--What does that mean?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1427.671,1427.982,--yes.
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.982,1429.913,Does the Constitution require welfare benefits?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1431.826,1432.136,"No, it does not, but certainly--"
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1432.136,1437.659,"--Well, what is this phrase you're coming up with, they are receiving a constitutionally permissible amount?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1443.323,1450.107,--Because those are the amounts that are being paid in the prior State of residence that have not been challenged.
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.107,1452.518,"Zero is a constitutionally permissible amount, isn't it?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1452.518,1455.28,"In effect, Your Honor, you are correct, because--"
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.28,1457.672,So then why drag in this constitutionally permissible amount?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1458.353,1459.732,--Because what is being challenged here--
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.732,1460.343,--it doesn't exist.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1460.343,1462.173,--is whether or not California's amount is constitutionally permissible--
1994.94-197,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1462.173,1462.443,Right.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1462.443,1470.929,--And I want to encourage this Court to look at the fact that the amount that we are offering people is constitutionally permissible.
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.929,1502.28,"But again, where do you get the term, consti... the reason that... the constitutional challenge here isn't to the amount in the abstract but to the fact that you pay California residents a different amount than you pay arrivals who have been there less than a year, and that constitutional challenge is based on the right to travel, but certainly you're not suggesting that someone back in Nevada, or wherever they may have come from, could challenge their welfare payment on the grounds that it wasn't enough to live on?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1502.28,1517.812,"No, but what we are offering people is an amount that is... is offered by another State but is not challengeable and, therefore, California ought to be able to offer a like amount to that person temporarily."
1994.94-197,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1517.812,1533.43,"Is there any scheme like this where... I know some differences between residents and nonresidents, but here the variation is... depends on the State you come from, so if you come from New York to California, you're better off than if you come from Louisiana to California."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1552.564,1568.035,"I don't believe so, unless you look at the circumstance of someone coming from a State with a higher benefit level coming to California and getting a decrease in their benefit level, which is not challengeable."
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1568.035,1592.449,"Isn't the reason for your concession to Justice Kennedy on the 3 years that when you take the 3-year hypothesis there would be no basis upon which you could reasonably argue that the individual was not a resident and I presume, indeed, a citizen of the State of California, so that it would follow that the correct comparison was between that particular citizen or resident and all other California residents, and once that comparison is made, there is a penalty?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1594.071,1594.91,No.
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1605.278,1611.772,"Well, it might not be a penalty, but I... didn't you concede that under the 3-year hypothesis you would have some constitutional problem?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1611.772,1623.48,"I believe what I said, we would have... under a factual record it would be more of a problem, yes, but California has--"
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1623.48,1624.469,Why would it be more of a problem?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1624.469,1626.162,--Because--
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1626.162,1634.436,"If the distinction does not turn on obviousness of residence, or some such thing as that, why is it more of a problem?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1634.436,1641.662,--It would be more of a problem because that person would be getting a rate that was not the California full-level rate--
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1641.662,1643.173,So what?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1643.173,1643.904,--for a longer period of time.
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1643.904,1644.915,"So what, on your theory?"
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1658.112,1661.814,"Because, as with any factual distinction, it might be more problematic."
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1662.955,1664.016,But I don't understand why.
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1669.459,1681.026,"--Because I believe in order to establish whether there's a penalty, one ought to compare what one received in one State compared to what one is getting in the other State, what one is getting in the old State--"
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1681.026,1683.769,"Well, let me ask you the question directly which keeps coming up."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1702.061,1705.964,--I don't believe that's an inappropriate comparison.
1994.94-197,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1715.02,1716.77,And your rational basis is saving money?
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1716.77,1718.843,"Yes, the rational basis is saving money."
1994.94-197,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1718.843,1725.827,"If the rational basis is saving money, they say you'd save twenty two and a half million dollars, about $1 per recipient, if you cut it across the board."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1733.78,1738.315,Because California did many things at that time.
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.575,1756.867,"Thank you, Mr. Garelis."
1994.94-197,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1756.867,1757.266,Thank you.
1994.94-197,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.266,1758.438,"Ms. Sullivan, we'll hear from you."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1758.438,1765.223,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.94-197,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1773.727,1776.379,"Well, do you think the issue is ripe?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1776.379,1778.032,"No, we do not, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.638,1796.833,"And I take it you're willing to follow the consequence of that, which they suggested that you wouldn't, that then you'd go back to square one."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1803.758,1804.908,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.005,1840.111,"Well, we do have a statute before us, and it seems to me it's not at all clear, simply reading the statute, that the State is... State's argument is correct."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1859.033,1860.964,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-197,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1868.039,1869.011,"Because it wants Federal money, isn't that right?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1869.011,1870.611,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1870.611,1876.064,"And it could put in its own welfare program without Federal dollars, but the likelihood of that is not great?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1876.064,1877.616,"Very unlikely, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.046,1907.717,I don't read any--
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1907.717,1908.986,--as Justice O'Connor suggested before.
1994.94-197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.986,1912.329,"--Why do you have to put that limitation in, and becomes a bona fide resident?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1920.025,1922.536,"That is correct, Justice Scalia--"
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1922.536,1923.235,But that--
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1923.235,1944.169,"--you're free to travel, but you're not... nonresidents are not required to be treated equally in all respects by a State which they are merely visiting, but in a State where one is a citizen, and the Fourteenth Amendment's citizen clause makes us all citizens of the State in which we reside, one is entitled to be equally treated with all other citizens of the State in which we reside."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1962.941,1972.458,"--Well, we've upheld durational residency requirements for State... in-State tuition, not just for testing, but simply categorically."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1972.458,1979.103,"Your Honor, you've summarily affirmed decisions upholding durational residency requirements for in-State decision--"
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.103,1979.582,Which are decisions on the merits.
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1979.582,1998.175,"--Correct, Your Honor, but they are entirely different from this case, because as this Court noted in Zobel, as in Vlandis, the reason for making a student wait a year to get the benefits of in-State tuition is that a student is likely to be characteristically transient in a way that no welfare recipient is."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.684,2022.291,"Well, could a State set up any sort of a time limit and say that you don't become a bona fide... you cannot become a bona fide resident until you've at least been here 30 days."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2022.291,2024.441,"Yes, it could, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.775,2031.207,"A year is too long, in your view?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2031.207,2041.993,"--A year is generally too long, unless there is special reason to fear that a certain population is going to come into the State on a transient basis to procure a benefit from that State and then leave."
1994.94-197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2050.418,2056.472,Am I supposed to take judicial notice that students are more apt to move than welfare recipients?
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2057.484,2062.897,"Your Honor, welfare recipients are unlike students or divorce-seekers for several reasons."
1994.94-197,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2091.424,2097.629,So I take it at no point in the litigation has the State raised this... a challenge to the bona fides of the residents?
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2097.629,2098.81,"That is correct, Justice Souter."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.7,2112.048,Is there--
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2112.048,2113.821,--because the money is spent as soon as it's received.
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.821,2120.816,"--In your view, Ms. Sullivan, is there some Federal rule that determines how we find out whether someone is a bona fide resident?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2120.816,2123.057,"No, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.857,2169.476,"What about the State using... I understand that we have a general rule about freedom of travel, and a State cannot penalize people for moving into the State, but it seems to me entirely reasonable for a State to object, if it wants... especially a State that wants to have a generous welfare program, to want to preserve the funds that it's expending in that program by not becoming an attraction to people who move to that State for no reason except to get the increased welfare."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2196.535,2204.569,"Justice Scalia, if that is the State's justification, the statute is still unconstitutional and unreasonable."
1994.94-197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.21,2206.162,I knew you were going to say that.
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2207.841,2208.702,--Let me explain why.
1994.94-197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.334,2273.996,But they can say you pay a different tax rate.
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2277.557,2280.389,"In Nordlinger v. Hahn, Your Honor?"
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.788,2342.08,"Well, what if California in this case, Ms. Sullivan, said nobody shall get the California benefits but they'll get lower for 60 days, and it's not to allow us to investigate, but we simply don't recognize anybody as a resident or citizen of California who has not been physically present here for 60 days?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2342.08,2343.921,"We would have no objection to that, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2351.185,2354.968,"Well, it's... no, it's not testing bona fide residence at all under my hypothesis."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2376.542,2379.744,"--Your Honor, we would concede that that is constitutional."
1994.94-197,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2393.082,2397.987,What is the voting... the time that one must live in California to register to vote?
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2397.987,2401.598,"--I'm not certain of that, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2406.382,2411.574,"Is it your point that in the Chief Justice's example it would be all right provided they gave the person nothing, not just a lesser benefit?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2411.574,2412.616,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.947,2453.542,"Well, why isn't it reasonable to think, if California pays a good deal more in welfare benefits that other States do, that people who are receiving those benefits in other States will be attracted to California?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2453.542,2484.823,"Your Honor, there is absolutely no evidence in the record that California's relatively higher grant levels attract poor people at higher rates than they would be attracted otherwise by the prosperity or other features of the State, but even if that were so, you have in the past consistently said that a State may not make itself attractive to insiders but discriminate against newcomers in order to keep an influx of newcomers from coming into the State."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2566.187,2570.819,"Well, if it's a rational basis test, it doesn't really need tailoring, does it?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2570.819,2580.075,"Your Honor, if it's a rational basis test, it must still not serve a forbidden purpose, or it still must be logically related to its distinctions."
1994.94-197,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2611.585,2647.048,"Well, that's true if you look at it on a purely individualized basis, but there is a rational argument, I suppose, to the effect that California or any State simply cannot afford to provide a generous welfare scheme if the magnet is going to be so great that there are going to be a lot of short-term ""transients"" taking advantage of it... I use transient in quotes... so that in fact the only hope for raising the level for everybody is to do it under circumstances in which the short-term attraction is going to be mitigated, otherwise, nobody can afford it."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2666.071,2677.508,"Justice Souter, you have long said that the purpose you have just described is a forbidden purpose, or an impermissible one."
1994.94-197,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2677.508,2679.86,"Well, I'm not questioning you about precedent."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2679.86,2680.141,Yes.
1994.94-197,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2680.141,2687.706,"I'm simply questioning you about, if we were starting at square one, that would qualify as a rational argument, wouldn't it?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2687.706,2701.284,"Justice Souter, if you were starting at square one and ignoring the admonition in Shapiro that the goal to fence out needy people is an impermissible one, the statute would still not be logically tailored to that goal."
1994.94-197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2752.597,2754.63,"You don't concede that that would be constitutional, do you?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2754.63,2755.669,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2766.297,2778.595,"But then we're slipping away from the argument about whether or not this isn't, leaving precedent aside, a rational policy for the State of California, who wants to have an intact, sound welfare program."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2780.465,2781.306,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2781.306,2785.658,"Then you ended up by saying you could screen, and I just don't... I don't see the relation between the two arguments."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2785.658,2798.457,"Justice Kennedy, we argue that it is impermissible to treat new State citizens unequally merely because they have come to get higher welfare benefits."
1994.94-197,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2801.56,2805.681,"With respect, I probably wasn't clear on that, but that wasn't the hypothesis that I was making."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2828.647,2839.815,"--Your Honor, as Justice Breyer pointed out before, that argument is scarcely credible in a case where the State could save the same amount of money by reducing benefits 76 cents across the board."
1994.94-197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.277,2887.346,"Surely there's a difference in treating somebody differently by... I mean, let's say we're not going to give you library privileges in the State, or you can't use the State tennis courts, or you can't use the State schools for a certain period."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2917.386,2919.757,Justice Scalia--
1994.94-197,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.757,2920.828,And it's only the case with welfare.
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2931.916,2938.778,"--Justice Scalia, with respect, the statute is not limited to those who will be on welfare from the time they arrive."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2994.594,3011.056,"Well, but I think you're putting too much of an absolute construction on some of our other... the in-State tuition cases, I mean, it isn't just a total refusal to allow the States to make any distinction between old and new residents."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3014.128,3032.19,"Your Honor, as you've suggested, both the opinion for the Court and the concurring opinion in Zobel suggested the reason for that in the tuition cases, as in the divorce cases, is a fear that there will be a characteristically transient population that will misrepresent its intent to stay in the State a long time."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3032.19,3034.732,"Yes, but all I'm saying is that there have... the cases have gone the other way."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3038.405,3039.644,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.245,3040.786,I thought--
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3040.786,3041.547,--hardly ever permissible.
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3041.547,3041.957,--Well--
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3041.957,3043.047,We're not saying it's never permissible.
1994.94-197,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3057.046,3062.04,--Anything other than the genuineness of the residency that would be a legitimate basis for distinction?
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3062.04,3062.398,Perhaps--
1994.94-197,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3062.398,3070.985,"In both Sosner and Vlandis, those situations, it's that you distrust the claim that I really am a Californian."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3070.985,3074.319,"--That's one situation, Justice Ginsburg, and there may be others."
1994.94-197,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3163.746,3175.874,"Ms. Sullivan, was there any showing in this record, or is there any discussion in the literature with a statistical survey to show that people do or do not move for higher welfare benefits?"
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3175.874,3179.136,"There is no such showing in this record, Justice Kennedy."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3286.858,3292.06,"Well, presumably they can get into the political process, at least under your hypothesis, in very short order."
1994.94-197,1,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3292.06,3304.56,"--That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but... they can get into the process to vote, but they're still likely to be a small minority, and that's not the true point."
1994.94-197,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3378.63,3380.74,"Thank you, Ms. Sullivan."
