1990.89-1322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.706,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1322, Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma."
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,48.664,51.183,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1322,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.725,124.481,"Well, now, you don't assert any right to collect taxes for sale to tribal members, I trust?"
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,124.481,125.847,"Yes, we do."
1990.89-1322,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.847,128.348,You assert that you can do that as well?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,129.884,134.853,And what authority do you cite for that proposition?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,134.853,155.766,"--Well, I think this case is on point with the Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones decision of 1973, and there we had an off-reservation business operated by the tribe that was found to be reliable for $26,000 in gross receipts taxes on its sales and that it... and that that tribe--"
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,162.07,184.269,"Well, I think the McClanahan case and the Colville case find that the tribal members in those cases were not taxable because they... the sales occurred on the reservation or, in the McClanahan case, the individual earned her income on the reservation."
1990.89-1322,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.868,241.372,"But the land on which this store is located is held in trust by the United States for the tribe, is that correct?"
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,241.372,242.255,That is correct.
1990.89-1322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,320.474,330.33,"Well, doesn't our McGowan case say that lands held in trust by the United States for the Indians have much the same status as reservation lands?"
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,330.33,358.515,"Well, I think the... there are cases that hold that trust land in the... for instance in the John decision, the trust land is a... has reservation status, but I believe in those cases there was a resident tribal population in those cases where the Government was supervising that land."
1990.89-1322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.515,360.967,Here there's no resident tribal population?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,360.967,369.907,Not... these are lands that are for the tribal headquarters and a golf course and public buildings here.
1990.89-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.891,513.698,I'm not sure what your... I'm not sure what your... are you arguing there has to be a declaration of reservation status before the Indian tribe would have sovereign powers in the area?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,513.698,514.798,Well--
1990.89-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.798,516.714,Because I don't think our cases support that.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,527.439,529.808,--Correct and--
1990.89-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.808,536.127,"And we've held in other cases, haven't we, that it doesn't have to be a formal declaration of reservation status."
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,536.127,536.627,--Correct.
1990.89-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.985,576.503,Not applicable when Indians have left?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,583.108,585.192,"--Well, yes."
1990.89-1322,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.57,603.356,Why?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,612.962,625.035,"Well, it would apply to a certain extent, but it's not... the land was transferred in trust in 1975 in order for the tribe to qualify for loans."
1990.89-1322,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,662.727,667.529,"Well, the Solicitor General doesn't agree with you on this point I take it?"
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,667.529,670.981,I don't believe the Solicitor General does.
1990.89-1322,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,670.981,671.666,No.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,671.666,672.05,No.
1990.89-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,715.027,717.029,On sales to nonmembers.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,717.029,719.147,--On sales to nonmembers which--
1990.89-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.147,722.266,"Now, would you claim they should collect it on sales to members, too?"
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,722.266,723.699,"--Well, yes, I do."
1990.89-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.699,724.133,xxx.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,724.133,737.026,"But if they collected sales against nonmembers in this situation, they would be collecting taxes on 99 percent of their sales."
1990.89-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.559,745.881,But the SG says the court of appeals was wrong in enjoining you from collecting the tax.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,745.881,746.848,--Collecting the tax.
1990.89-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.848,747.764,To nonmembers.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,747.764,751.952,"Well, the Tenth Circuit--"
1990.89-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.952,760.141,"No, the SG, the Solicitor General, says that the court of appeals was in error in enjoining you from collecting the tax."
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,760.141,761.724,--Correct.
1990.89-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.724,762.441,All right.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,773.766,779.353,"Well, in this case we have issued an assessment--"
1990.89-1322,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.353,783.57,You can't... you can't... under the SG's view the tribe is immune from suit.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,785.672,790.057,"--Well, that is the problem we are faced."
1990.89-1322,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,794.694,796.961,Could you sue the store manager?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,796.961,798.863,"Well, we have--"
1990.89-1322,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.863,803.467,To require the manager to set aside the money and do what's necessary?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,803.467,811.637,"--Well, under Oklahoma law the owner of the store is responsible rather than employees."
1990.89-1322,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,819.357,839.937,You don't think you would have jurisdiction to go after the employee not to hold him liable but to require by way of an injunction or other court order that the employee set aside this money for the taxes?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,839.937,859.7,"--Well, we have had in another case in the Chickasaw Nation case that was up here a few years ago, we did try to sue the manager of the store but the Tenth Circuit opinion, which was vacated in that case, is now before the Oklahoma Supreme Court."
1990.89-1322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.992,876.36,"Well, but this Court isn't bound by any ruling of the Tenth Circuit--"
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,876.36,876.894,Correct.
1990.89-1322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.894,878.896,--as witness to the fact we've got this case here on certiorari.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,878.896,879.596,Correct.
1990.89-1322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,887.133,897.023,Could you require the wholesaler to affix the stamps on 100 percent of the cigarettes and then just rebate the tribe for those that were sold to Indians?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,897.023,925.008,"Well, that's what... we do require the wholesaler to do that, however, when the tribes in Oklahoma purchased their cigarettes from as far away as Tennessee or Nebraska from wholesalers who have no nexus with the State of Oklahoma, they will then ship those in on common carrier or otherwise, basically bootleg them into the State and--"
1990.89-1322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,925.008,929.329,They're not doing business in the State of Oklahoma by the end sale?
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,929.329,931.529,"--No, no."
1990.89-1322,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1005.21,1007.429,We can pursue it some other time.
1990.89-1322,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1012.566,1025.14,"--Well, we do not have the authority for... to require a wholesaler in another State to comply with our laws."
1990.89-1322,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.449,1298.216,"Very well, Mr. Miley."
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1299.916,1314.326,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1390.726,1391.61,Mr. Kneedler--
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1399.916,1400.916,"Well, there are--"
1990.89-1322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1400.916,1402.182,--really as a practical matter?
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1402.182,1402.868,"--Well, there are a number of--"
1990.89-1322,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1402.868,1412.64,Can they sue and get some kind of affirmative injunction against the manager of the store to require the taxes to be--
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1412.64,1414.59,--There are several possible remedies.
1990.89-1322,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1478.33,1483.734,"--Mr. Kneedler, it might... in your view should this Court be deciding that anyway?"
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1483.734,1484.684,"No, it should not."
1990.89-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.675,1555.947,So the administrative court of appeals erred in entering the injunction against collecting the sales... sales tax on sales to nonmembers?
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1555.947,1556.347,Right.
1990.89-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.85,1566.469,I guess we left the States in that same position before.
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1566.469,1567.019,--That's correct.
1990.89-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.156,1614.133,"Mr. Kneedler, even before the passage of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act my recollection is that at least some courts had adopted what most... what has been adopted internationally in exception to sovereign immunity in the case where the supposed sovereign is not acting in a governmental capacity but in a commercial capacity."
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1619.521,1628.06,"The result might be different, but we think that would not be within the Court's authority and even prior to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the Court did not take it upon itself to modify that rule."
1990.89-1322,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.412,1633.297,"With respect to foreign countries, hadn't some of the courts of appeals done so in--"
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1633.297,1635.816,--I believe not until the Tate letter of 1953.
1990.89-1322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.483,1668.704,"--But it was this Court that first created tribal sovereign immunity, wasn't it?"
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1669.737,1674.274,"It was not an act of Congress, but I don't think it's entirely fair to say that the Court created."
1990.89-1322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.485,1695.787,"Mr. Kneedler, what is your understanding of the source of the Indian tribal immunity?"
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1698.556,1707.495,It derives from the status of Indian nations as sovereign entities that predate the Constitution in fact and that are recognized in the Constitution.
1990.89-1322,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.316,1714.466,"Well, that's statutory."
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1714.466,1722.088,"--Well, but it predated the Constitution and, you know, neither the Court recognized it as a common law rule in additional to a statutory rule."
1990.89-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.15,1749.156,"Mr. Kneedler, your brief says the question of what remedies the State might have should be left in the first instance to the court of appeals."
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1749.156,1750.774,If necessary.
1990.89-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.207,1756.242,"Well, how would that ever be... how would the question of remedy ever be up in the courtroom?"
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1756.242,1757.444,"--Well, it depends--"
1990.89-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1757.444,1764.431,"They would be passing on... the tribe brought the suit, wanted the injunction, and you say, well, they shouldn't have gotten an injunction."
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1764.431,1765.431,"--Well, they shouldn't have gotten--"
1990.89-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1765.431,1765.967,Is that the end of the case?
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1765.967,1768.283,"--Well, they shouldn't have gotten as broad an injunction as they did."
1990.89-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.553,1775.822,xxx set aside that injunction.
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1775.822,1776.038,Right.
1990.89-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.137,1805.922,"Well, but the court of appeals wouldn't necessarily get into anything about remedy."
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1805.922,1806.858,"No, what we--"
1990.89-1322,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1806.858,1812.845,"They would leave the State exactly where we put them before, wouldn't they?"
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1812.845,1815.964,"--Well, more completely I think the court of appeals could address that if necessary."
1990.89-1322,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1819.915,1826.585,"Mr. Kneedler, why is there difficulty in suing the tribal store manager in an Oklahoma State court?"
1990.89-1322,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1829.521,1842.531,"No, because Oklahoma has not accepted jurisdiction under Public Law 280, civil adjudicatory jurisdiction at least with respect to an Indian on... in Indian country in Oklahoma would not reside in the State courts."
1990.89-1322,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1898.867,1900.569,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,1902.919,1907.739,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.124,1966.012,"I know, but the assessment was for sales tax that should have been withheld and wasn't."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,1966.012,1969.38,"Your Honor, I don't think that makes any different."
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1972.082,1972.649,No.
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,1983.724,1995.781,"--Yes, sir, you have held in certain cases that in certain States that the State may require Indian tribes to cooperate, and if they don't cooperate they're not entitled to injunctive relief."
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.493,2018.111,What does the... what do you mean an assessment?
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2020.213,2023.932,"Your Honor, the writing of that letter is a very critical--"
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.932,2024.782,"Well, I know, but I hear you say an assessment--"
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2024.782,2026.4,--I proposed assessment.
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.4,2028.002,"--they just said, please pay us this tax."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2028.002,2034.239,"And in 30 days if we had not filed a protest with the State, the tax would have been filed."
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.239,2036.256,"Well, and then what would have happened?"
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2036.256,2039.441,Then they would have done whatever else it was that they could have done.
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2039.441,2046.397,"Well, I know, but they... what would they have... what would... wouldn't have... if your tribe is immune, I don't know how they could have sued them or do anything else."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2050.581,2058.105,"Well, it's a little bit hypothetical to talk about what we might have done had they directly proposed assessment against the tribe."
1990.89-1322,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2091.909,2100.949,"Well, I'm not sure it's an assessment against the tribe, that the State's taking a position that they're taxing a transaction and the transaction is taxable."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2100.949,2108.353,"Yes, Your Honor, that's what they're contending, but what I'm saying is that's not related to the action that they took."
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.58,2133.134,You know... the tribe knows what the law is about what the sales tax law is and you've never been withholding and returning the tax.
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2133.134,2135.253,"Well, I'm not sure--"
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.253,2135.686,Isn't that right?
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2135.686,2138.288,--I'm not sure it would be fair to say the tribe knows what the law is.
1990.89-1322,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2150.863,2181.317,"Well, Mr. Minnis, let's say that we follow the Colville case and the Solicitor General's position and that we agree that Oklahoma is entitled to tax the transaction of sale of cigarettes to nonmembers of the tribe... that that's a taxable event and the tribe... the State can require the tribe collect the tax and pay it over."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2185.536,2202.314,"I can't speak for the tribe in the sense that I'm not their business committee, but I would suggest that they have acted with... I think that they have acted consistent with what they perceive the law to be, even... Justice White asked me about whether or not... surely they knew what the law was."
1990.89-1322,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2228.215,2241.372,"Well, I asked though suppose we take the view that the Solicitor General has urged here that these transactions, at least as to sales to nonmembers, are taxable."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2241.372,2241.805,Yes.
1990.89-1322,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2241.805,2244.724,Where does that leave us?
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2244.724,2245.759,Well--
1990.89-1322,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2245.759,2254.949,"There have been sales to nonmembers, apparently substantial sales to nonmembers and that continues to this day I understand."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2254.949,2255.782,--That's correct.
1990.89-1322,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2255.782,2258.984,Now let's say that we think those are perfectly taxable.
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2258.984,2262.619,"Well, then I would--"
1990.89-1322,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.619,2264.721,What's to be done?
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2264.721,2266.021,--and I'm just assuming because it's a hypothetical--
1990.89-1322,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2266.021,2268.64,"Well, it's not very hypothetical."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2268.64,2271.059,--that they would either quit selling cigarettes or they would collect the tax.
1990.89-1322,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2271.059,2289.02,But your contention is that neither this Court nor the courts that have heard the case previously has the authority to make that decision in this case because it's not an issue of this property before us?
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2289.02,2289.77,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2289.77,2293.488,"As we view the case, the case is simply an assessment case."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2305.696,2308.982,In response to the counterclaim by the State.
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.982,2312.517,"Well, I know, but the court of appeals reversed them."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2312.517,2320.289,"They reversed them on the basis that the tribe had sovereign immunity and that the court, the district court, should never have heard the case."
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.289,2332.68,"Well... it couldn't even tax sales to nonmembers and if we say they were wrong in that, I suppose we would reverse them."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2332.68,2347.023,"The relief that the Tenth Circuit granted was simply a reverse remanded for entry of order as prayed for, and the order that was prayed for by the tribe was simply an injunction against the proposed assessment."
1990.89-1322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2347.023,2350.059,But the court of appeals in its opinion certainly went further--
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2350.059,2350.742,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.742,2361.966,--and said the injunction should cover not merely the sale of cigarettes to tribal members but to nonmembers because of its analysis of Public Law 280.
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2361.966,2368.103,I don't think that they said that the injunction that would be entered after remand was supposed to be broad enough to cover that.
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.85,2396.504,"I take, then, it wouldn't bother you if we said there is no existing injunction against the State from collecting sales tax?"
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2404.942,2406.409,That's correct.
1990.89-1322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.452,2428.142,From assessing the tax on sales to nonmembers or to members or to both?
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2428.142,2431.927,"In this case assessing the tribe, the proposed assessment against the tribe."
1990.89-1322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2441.699,2443.234,"Well, we're playing with words to a certain extent."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2457.375,2471.885,"--Yes, Your Honor, we're arguing that as an alternative in response to their counterclaim, that their counterclaim was not valid because in Oklahoma there's a situation that's different from Montana, Washington, and California, which were Public Law 286."
1990.89-1322,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2471.885,2498.536,"Well, when you invoke the jurisdiction of the Court to ask for its equitable powers to be exercised on your behalf in a situation as complex as this, why isn't appropriate for the Court to make an announcement that perhaps the tribe cannot be assessed directly but that the tribe has the duty and the responsibility to remit the taxes to the State?"
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2498.536,2513.462,"Well, for one thing I think that there's no factual foundation for that in the sense that the factual dispute that caused the filing of the lawsuit in the first place."
1990.89-1322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.183,2664.943,"May I ask you on that, supposing the State had seized a shipment of cigarettes destined for the tribe and presumably owned by the tribe, because they would shipped by a common carrier and... the property would presumably pass at the time of shipment."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2674.818,2676.018,In favor of the tribe.
1990.89-1322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.018,2680.055,"Well, then what remedy does the State have?"
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2684.257,2692.279,"Well, I... no, I'm suggesting that if they wanted to raise the issue of the propriety of seizing the cigarettes that that's the way they should have proceeded."
1990.89-1322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.279,2693.529,But they'll still lose is that what's you're saying.
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2693.529,2695.147,"Well, we'd still defend that lawsuit."
1990.89-1322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2696.764,2697.331,Yes.
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2697.331,2713.026,That's the argument we're making here is that we're being asked to defend the lawsuit that they didn't bring that they could have brought and the one that they have brought is whether or not... the one that they solely define by the actions they took was the tax assessment.
1990.89-1322,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.513,2723.549,But they could have done with the same result is the problem I suppose.
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2723.549,2726.417,But we would argue... we would argue this... the same result.
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.074,2757.888,"Well, let's assume that we hold that the State is entitled to collect sales taxes on the sales by nonmembers and that the tribe should have been withholding those taxes and, of course, if they... and if they... of course, if they should from now on withhold, they should have withheld it in past."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2772.897,2782.42,"Well, I would think... well, if you... it is insulting if you contend that you are a sovereign and that you are immune from suit and you're immune from tax."
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2785.205,2792.978,"No, but the State says, your immunity doesn't cover sales to nonmembers and cites these cases."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2804.286,2811.522,"Well, yes, Your Honor, but I mean, it's not as if they said, start collecting taxes--"
1990.89-1322,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.522,2812.456,"Well, the tribe owns the store."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2816.26,2825.282,"--Yes, Your Honor, but you still end up with who pays the money and the money would be paid by the tribe under a direct tax assessment."
1990.89-1322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.282,2829.318,"Well, but perhaps the tribe is liable."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2835.388,2847.863,"Your Honor, that would presuppose that the Oklahoma State tax laws are applicable to the tribe, and if they are applicable to the tribe, are just those laws or are all State laws?"
1990.89-1322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.863,2856.818,"Well, certainly Moe and Colville said that Montana and Washington State tax laws were applicable to the tribes who were involved in those lawsuits."
1990.89-1322,2,36278,michael_minnis,,2856.818,2886.773,"In those cases the Court was clear to point out that the incidence of the tax was not on a tribe as it is in this case and that the collection of the tax was something that the tribe... those cases arose when the tribe sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and what this Court did was say, you're not entitled to the injunctive relief because you should have been collecting the tax and since you didn't collect the tax we're not going to give you the injunctive relief you've asked for to stop the trucks from coming into your reservation."
1990.89-1322,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2904.032,2905.234,"Thank you, Mr. Minnis."
1990.89-1322,3,21180,david_allen_miley,,2907.686,2909.503,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.478,2990.59,Has the State of Oklahoma or any other State as far as you know requested Congress to waive tribal sovereign immunity where the tribe has refused to pay... to collect sales taxes and to turn them over--
1990.89-1322,3,21180,david_allen_miley,,2990.59,2993.959,"No, we have not requested Congress to do that."
1990.89-1322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.863,3000.93,--What do you mean it isn't in a position to do that?
1990.89-1322,3,21180,david_allen_miley,,3000.93,3005.184,"--Well, I believe Congress could do that if it wanted to."
1990.89-1322,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.591,3019.859,But they're concerned with the status of Indian tribes.
1990.89-1322,3,21180,david_allen_miley,,3019.859,3053.664,"--That's correct, and they would be concerned and they have passed several laws like the bingo laws to encoarage economic development, but I think what we have here is an area where we do not need to go to Congress to ask Congress if the State of Oklahoma can collect its taxes."
