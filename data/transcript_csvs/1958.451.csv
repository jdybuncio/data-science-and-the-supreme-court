1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,14.655,15.36,Mr. Chief Justice --
1958.451,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,15.36,17.324,Mr. Dangel.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,17.324,20.512,-- may it please the Court.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,718.352,719.175,You saw it?
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,719.175,722.299,"I saw -- I saw that one because that was an exhibit, Your Honor."
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,783.694,784.321,Mr. Dangel.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,784.321,784.993,"Yes, sir?"
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,784.993,792.831,Let's see if I understand you.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,799.368,801.509,"Yes, it was given to the defendant."
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,801.509,810.759,"And, the Court had it before it, the Court of Appeals, in the record --"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,810.759,811.102,It had it.
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,811.102,814.573,As well as the one that was submitted --
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,814.573,814.74,In camera.
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,814.74,818.247,In the envelope and examined in camera.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,818.247,819.342,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,819.342,824.922,"So, do you argue that the Court couldn't be trusted to determine that they were alike?"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,824.922,827.749,I'm not -- I don't say the language isn't alike.
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,830.595,832.778,Was that material if you had the --
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,832.778,847.11,"Well, I should imagine that, in cross-examination, it might be immaterial as to whether or not Mr. Meierdiercks originated this statement which was written down, Exhibit C2, or whether somebody else originated that statement."
1958.451,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,873.134,877.984,Was the written -- handwritten statement in the writing of the witness?
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,877.984,878.788,"No, it was not."
1958.451,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,882.56,882.685,Yes.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,882.685,885.174,Either one or two.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,898.65,905.348,"Were the original and the transcript invoked by the same -- attributable to the same author, the same person?"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,905.348,906.51,We can't tell you really.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,909.84,910.248,Yes.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,910.248,911.921,And the other is handwritten.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,911.921,915.709,And nothing to indicate whether the typewritten --
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,915.709,916.455,Preceded the handwriting?
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,916.455,918.19,I don't care whether it's preceded or followed.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,918.19,918.841,"No, that's correct."
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,918.841,924.365,Was it by the same -- was the same person responsible --
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,924.365,924.422,I --
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,924.422,925.488,For the contents of both?
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,925.488,927.811,"I have never seen it, nor has the petitioner ever seen it."
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,927.811,929.427,"No, but the judge passed on that."
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,929.427,933.161,"The Court of Appeals passed on it, first, the judge, and then the Court of Appeals."
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,933.161,938.43,"So, the question on that point is not interpretation of meaning --"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,938.43,939.212,No --
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,939.212,942.343,But merely identity of the symbols.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,942.343,942.578,Yes.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,944.147,944.572,What?
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,944.572,951.332,The origination of the paper is important.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,951.332,954.232,"Well, I don't know if the -- why do you say the origination is important?"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,954.232,954.654,Well --
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,954.654,962.569,"If one is an identical copy of the other, but you're concerned with, was there a -- was this in contest that there wasn't somebody who wrote something?"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,962.569,965.155,This is a contest as to whether somebody said something.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,965.155,965.269,Yes.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,965.269,965.965,It's a contest whether Meierdiercks --
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,965.965,969.275,But it's not invoked -- they both say the same thing.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,973.08,976.116,"Well, you can get some change in it."
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,976.116,976.971,What kind of change?
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,976.971,991.083,"Well, you get the change as to whether or not this was presented to him for his signature, or whether or not it was written at the time he said it was written because of questioning of the FBI agents."
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,991.083,1001.787,"Well, in any event, it was the statement which was in possession and was demanded and was delivered."
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1001.787,1002.645,It was not delivered.
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1005.101,1005.459,Well --
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1005.459,1006.102,The --
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1006.102,1007.724,The handwritten copy was.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1007.724,1008.534,"Yes, that's right, the handwritten copy."
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1008.534,1017.386,"And, my difficulty is in seeing that if those were alike, whether you get one copy or a carbon copy --"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1017.386,1017.498,It is --
1958.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1017.498,1018.244,Or --
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1018.244,1022.919,That isn't the my -- I guess I have not made my point clear.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1029.584,1030.843,"No, but, I mean, if it is."
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1030.843,1042.465,Without any -- without the defendant being able to combat that or in anyway explain it or to know about it seems to me to be depriving of him of something that's of value to him.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1083.163,1083.768,"Well, is this of any --"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1083.768,1085.191,It's true to --
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1085.191,1086.295,Can I ask this.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1089.112,1090.339,It's not in -- it's not in con --
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1090.339,1093.82,"Upon signing something, he made that something here, is that right?"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1093.82,1094.861,That's correct.
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1094.861,1106.154,"Now, what difference does it make whether he made that something here, that that something which he made was a copy of something that had been typewritten or longhanded?"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1106.154,1115.105,"Well, it would make some difference in cross-examination and in value to his testimony as to whether or not he had originated the thought that were in that paper."
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1115.105,1116.042,It doesn't make any difference if he had copied it.
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1116.042,1120.67,"Well, I s -- well, Your Honor says --"
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1120.67,1125.387,"Unless you say that he was hurshed in signing it, was that in the case?"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1125.387,1132.371,"No, it was this in -- this was in the case, that he intended a benefit from signing."
1958.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1149.231,1153.412,"In other words, he was going to repudiate that when he signed to that extent, is that right?"
1958.451,0,22147,edward_m_dangel,,1153.412,1154.488,"Well, that might be so."
1958.451,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1784.736,1787.533,May it please the Court.
1958.451,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1939.108,1945.52,"When you say corroborate, do you mean not to tell what were the durations that she had to find?"
1958.451,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,1945.52,1948.99,"That's right, but they were corroborative of his version of what he did."
1958.451,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2880.762,2903.686,"Ms. Rosenberg, assuming that this letter was a statement, as defined in Subparagraph (e) of the statue, in passing that question, assuming it was such a statement, aren't we dealing here with a statute enacted by Congress which imposes an absolute duty upon a district judge?"
1958.451,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,2932.386,2965.03,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that even a violation of constitutional rights or a statutory right that it's less open in Kotteakos but, nevertheless, for example, let's take a motion to suppress which should have been granted as to, let's say, two grains of narcotics, a theoretical case."
1958.451,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3170.37,3171.861,Jencks wasn't (Inaudible)
1958.451,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3171.861,3175.112,"Well, it wasn't raised in petition for certiorari."
