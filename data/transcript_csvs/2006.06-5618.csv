2006.06-5618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.735,"We'll hear argument next in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,7.726,11.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-5618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,81.294,86.136,What would be your test of reasonableness for appellate review?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,86.136,101.847,I think a sentence would be reasonable if a reasonable judge on the facts and circumstances of that case would find that the sentence imposed was sufficient but not greater than necessary to satisfy 3553(a) standards.
2006.06-5618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,101.847,117.167,"It seems to me that gives very little weight to the goal, which I think is a congressional goal, of nationwide consistency in eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system which cause great disrespect to the justice system."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,117.167,126.203,I think that the statute speaks of unwarranted disparity and does not speak in terms of uniformity.
2006.06-5618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.049,172.994,"Can I substitute ""substantial"" for ""gravitational"" without offending your position or affecting your position?"
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,172.994,180.26,I don't... my position would be that 3553(a)(4) is the correct place for consideration of the guidelines.
2006.06-5618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,184.992,186.772,Kind of a weak law of gravity like the Moon.
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,188.404,191.847,--As a legal matter weak.
2006.06-5618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,198.901,204.203,"Well, I guess the question is how strong should we say or can we say, or can Congress say it is?"
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,204.203,228.001,"--I think that the strength should be no more than one of the 3553(a) factors, because I think the danger, particularly after 20 years of guideline sentencing, is that courts will routinely and mechanistically apply the guidelines instead of exercising their discretion, which now runs to the full limit of 3553(a)."
2006.06-5618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,228.001,236.336,"Then it seems to me that to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from the process."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,236.336,242.708,I think the appellate courts are... I think Booker considered a very deferential standard of review.
2006.06-5618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,268.026,281.595,"Well, suppose the court of appeals had done exactly what it did in this case, but it said, we're not giving any special weight whatsoever to the guidelines, we're basing this just on our own evaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in the Sentencing Reform Act."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,282.826,296.093,"--I think there would, Justice Alito, because I don't think that the role of the appellate court is to substitute its judgment for the application and weight applied to the 3553(a) factors for the district court."
2006.06-5618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,296.093,298.297,That's a principle that you derive from what?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,302.087,308.952,"Well, I think it derives in part from the Sentencing Reform Act, which contemplated individualized sentencing."
2006.06-5618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,308.952,318.489,"The Sentencing Reform Act required, as enacted by Congress, required trial judges to apply the guidelines, to follow the guidelines."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,332.588,335.54,Certainly extremely broad discretion.
2006.06-5618,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,335.54,340.502,How do you get that out of the statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,340.502,353.312,"Even under a mandatory guidelines system that this Court considered in Koon, it recognized that the Sentencing Reform Act also had an important goal of individualized sentencing."
2006.06-5618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,372.095,378.707,So one of the guides for reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a particular type of case?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,378.707,393.677,"--I think that what guides the court of appeals on reasonableness review is to look to the particular case and determine if the reasons on the record in that case, the district court's--"
2006.06-5618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,393.677,394.999,It's impossible to do in the abstract.
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,417.223,438.567,"--I think the court of appeals' job is to ensure that the district judge provides reasoned elaboration of its judgment on the facts of that case that establish that the district court had complied with 3553(a), and on the facts of that case, selected a sentence which is sufficient but not greater than necessary."
2006.06-5618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,449.764,452.196,"Even if you're looking at not just the number, but the reasons."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,472.748,495.245,"I think it is not lawless in the sense that courts of appeals need to determine whether in a particular case, the differences it finds are warranted on the facts and circumstances of that case, whether the district judge has consulted the guidelines, has looked at the history and characteristics of that defendant, has looked at the nature and circumstances of the crime."
2006.06-5618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,501.539,505.84,"On my particular case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals?"
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,521.761,525.605,--I think the same process of review applies to each.
2006.06-5618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,541.004,542.726,Where does that come from as a matter of law?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,642.44,647.022,I think there is a constitutional problem with that.
2006.06-5618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,668.636,669.136,It's not mandatory.
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,712.066,719.051,"Of course, the court of appeals did not adhere to your hypothetical in this case."
2006.06-5618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.472,719.992,Yeah--
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,719.992,725.716,"--The Eighth Circuit in this case simply said it is not a guidelines sentence, it is an extraordinary variance and we are reversing."
2006.06-5618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,785.259,803.167,"Aren't you really saying that the most weight that the guidelines can be given, or guidelines can be... is that... I apologize for my voice... the most weight the guidelines can be given is, is the weight of necessary advertence?"
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,846.517,847.466,Yeah.
2006.06-5618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,862.577,862.898,Yes.
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,865.249,869.932,--But I agree with you that it is a consideration... and I'm not talking about a check list.
2006.06-5618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,890.015,901.212,"Well, as one of the themes that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over time."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,927.128,934.925,"I don't believe that, that the results are going to be considerable disparity."
2006.06-5618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,956.958,962.073,Do you think it is idle to talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,966.475,967.897,--I do remember those days.
2006.06-5618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1014.409,1014.867,"--Yeah, yeah."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1095.08,1108.9,"I don't believe that sentencing under an effectively advisory system under the standards of appellate review that I've described, which I think is the standard Booker described, is in a sense an empty exercise on appeal, and leading simply--"
2006.06-5618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1108.9,1109.799,Could you describe it again?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1124.829,1126.522,--Yes.
2006.06-5618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1126.522,1131.264,And no particular deference to the guidelines?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1131.264,1133.077,"That would... yes, I would agree with that."
2006.06-5618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1133.077,1136.938,So what is it other than... is this arbitrary and capricious?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1136.938,1159.482,"I think that the court of appeals will first look to ensure that there was reasoned elaboration of a judgment complying with 3553(a), that the district court considered all of the factors and arrived at a judgment that this sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary."
2006.06-5618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1173.172,1183.246,"But the... one problem is that two judges, both reasonable, might approach the facts in this very case differently."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1238.655,1240.365,Yes.
2006.06-5618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.03,1259.677,"In any case, you... you, you are not driven to the alternative that Justice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve absolute uniformity."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1293.36,1295.353,"--I agree, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-5618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1295.353,1295.774,Do you agree?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1318.457,1323.259,"Well, I... I also appreciate the dialogue."
2006.06-5618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.63,1327.093,You don't... you don't have to engage in our dispute here.
2006.06-5618,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.413,1332.977,We're pointing out there are problems to every solution.
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1335.328,1369.762,"--And... and one of the serious problems in the solution that Booker chose is that while judicial discretion, which I think 3553(a) requires and mandates, and an advisory system requires, that, too, doesn't deal with the necessary exercise of prosecutorial discretion which has an enormous thumb on the scale, and which the district court, in the day to day work of the criminal system in the courts, in the district courts, has a far greater appreciation for, than a court of appeals would."
2006.06-5618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1369.762,1390.857,"Mr. Dwyer, before we get to the prosecutor, you were candid in saying a district court... different district judges could act reasonably, one of them giving whatever it was, 33 months, and the other giving 15 months, both of those would be reasonable and could be affirmed on appeal."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1464.064,1479.795,I think that the judge in the obligation of imposing an individual sentence must consider the advice of the guidelines but must also be free to shape and tailor that advice as the circumstances of that case require.
2006.06-5618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1479.795,1489.121,"Well, specifically, can you take into account, can he say I'm going to treat him as though he possessed powdered cocaine?"
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1490.503,1491.022,Yes.
2006.06-5618,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1491.022,1494.434,Even though we know that Congress didn't want that to happen?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1494.434,1501.811,"Yes, because I think if the judge can elaborate reasons to justify that judgment in that case--"
2006.06-5618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1501.811,1504.532,That's got nothing to do with that case.
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1515.292,1526.137,"--Well, I beg to differ, Chief Justice Roberts, because the differences were predicated on assumptions about the type of individuals who would engage in that."
2006.06-5618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1548.123,1552.855,"Well, I think you ran away from Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical just a little bit."
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1568.737,1575.011,I don't think that the district judge's role is to make categorical pronouncements.
2006.06-5618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1575.011,1575.829,Is the judge permitted--
2006.06-5618,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1575.829,1583.766,To what extent is the Congress's purpose later than the Congress that enacted the statute we're construing?
2006.06-5618,0,35671,michael_dwyer,,1588.629,1596.265,"Well, I would resolve the problem by saying that the district judge must consider the guidelines."
2006.06-5618,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1629.755,1630.896,"Thank you, Mr. Dwyer."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1633.428,1636.941,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-5618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.622,1706.485,"As closely as it can, and the ""as it can"" depends upon violation of the Sixth Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1797.326,1825.143,"Justice Scalia, as I think we talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be if this Court concludes that judicial determinations on appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals does is essentially function as a sentencing commission, literally prescribing particular levels of punishment for recurring sets of facts."
2006.06-5618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.74,1873.205,"But if you have two cases that are in other respects similar, and the court of appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower sentence."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1873.205,1883.963,"--Well, he doesn't, Justice Scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same level of leniency or any leniency at all."
2006.06-5618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.301,2063.489,"May I ask this question: It seems to me that in sentencing there are two different broad categories of decision that the judge has to make, one involving the severity of the crime, and the other the characteristics of the particular offender."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2082.431,2084.833,"I think at a high level of generality, that is true."
2006.06-5618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2191.272,2200.608,What do you think about taking some of the Rivera ideas... I'm slightly hypothesizing this... and following up with what Justice Stevens said.
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2217.919,2218.92,I agree.
2006.06-5618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2218.92,2227.078,"So one big power a judge has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to say the guideline itself is unreasonable."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2290.959,2301.806,"Well, Justice Breyer, if the system that you're describing is a replica of the system that existed under Koon versus United States--"
2006.06-5618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2301.806,2302.527,Not quite--
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2302.527,2307.459,--then it runs into the same problem that led to the constitutional problem in Booker.
2006.06-5618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.341,2353.751,"Why, why do we assume that the district judge cannot depart from the guideline recommendation unless he thinks the guideline recommendation is unreasonable?"
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2368.561,2369.89,That's correct.
2006.06-5618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.89,2373.162,So he doesn't have to determine that it's unreasonable.
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2379.216,2410.315,"I do think, though, that the Court should be concerned about each district judge formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing guidelines and then applying them in the court to the cases that appear on that judge's docket without any check on appellate review to ensure that, although the sentence might be in some possible world reasonable, it's out of whack with what the Sentencing Commission has prescribed and what other district judges are doing."
2006.06-5618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.493,2455.576,"--That's the other thing I'm not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2517.556,2545.846,"I think what is proportional is a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that have been using this rule have not had a great deal of difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to which the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you look at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and have a sense of is this a significant deviation away from what the guidelines would actually describe."
2006.06-5618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2545.846,2560.086,"Well, why use the word ""proportional"", because the other thing is what the Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason justify a little departure rather than a lot?"
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2566.381,2594.089,"If the sentencing court articulates a bad reason, namely a reason that's irrational or one that does not respond to facts of the case, then that really shouldn't justify the sentence at all and what the court of appeals should do is vacate it, send it back for resentencing, and allow the district court to articulate the reasons why the sentence that the court now chooses to impose is an appropriate sentence under 3553(a)."
2006.06-5618,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2594.089,2604.855,"Mr. Dreeben, if we could focus on the facts of this case and what the district court appeared to do, she made a kind of proportionality judgment, too."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2662.644,2664.114,That's right.
2006.06-5618,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2754.405,2763.281,"But you did leave out what... she didn't elaborate on it, but she said, I would be throwing him away."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2773.696,2782.302,"Well, this brings me to my last point about this particular sentencing, which is that in this very case Judge Jackson looked at the defendant."
2006.06-5618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.919,2862.344,"--Yes, but didn't the court of appeals draw the inference that he had been distributing drugs during that 6-month period and that was not supported by the record?"
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2863.316,2866.487,"--Well, Justice Stevens, we're not relying on the inference of the--"
2006.06-5618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2866.487,2874.252,Would it have been error for the court of appeals to find a fact like that that was not supported by the record and didn't it do it in this case.
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2874.252,2876.593,"--Well, supported by the record is something of a judgment call."
2006.06-5618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.739,2904.072,And the court of appeals is willing to draw a factual conclusion that he had in fact distributed during that 6-month period?
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2904.072,2905.183,That's right.
2006.06-5618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2910.008,2913.649,But should the court of appeals act as a fact-finder in that posture of the case?
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2913.649,2914.67,Not in my view.
2006.06-5618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2920.554,2925.146,Is it not possibly a fact that would justify the conclusion that they committed error?
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2925.146,2934.172,"--This aspect of the court of appeals opinion in my view is not essential to the judgment that it reached, which is correct."
2006.06-5618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.172,2936.713,"It may not have been essential, but it may have contributed to their judgment."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2936.713,2948.471,"It may have, but what they did not mention is an equally valid reason for concluding that this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist even though he had no criminal history."
2006.06-5618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.411,3039.991,May I ask just one other question?
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3048.837,3049.888,That's correct.
2006.06-5618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3072.492,3073.854,"That's the part, they said that."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3116.292,3122.697,--I think you want a better reason for a sentence that is farther away from some mean.
2006.06-5618,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3122.697,3123.506,--Better than what?
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3124.928,3129.19,Perhaps the best way to do this is to give a example.
2006.06-5618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3196.845,3201.069,But what happens when that case... it goes back down to the district court.
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3216.43,3227.206,"Justice Scalia, I don't think that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a sentence."
2006.06-5618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3329.912,3331.975,"Well, it wouldn't be, just be procedural only."
2006.06-5618,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3356.331,3357.04,That... that is true.
2006.06-5618,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3387.781,3389.351,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2006.06-5618,2,35671,michael_dwyer,,3391.953,3400.24,I believe that Justice Breyer put his finger on one of the central problems with the Government's proposed rule.
2006.06-5618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3447.04,3452.824,What about Mr. Dreeben's parting challenge?
2006.06-5618,2,35671,michael_dwyer,,3457.847,3467.022,"I'm certainly going to argue that under the facts and the record before the Court, that was not a sentence that was sufficient but not greater than necessary."
2006.06-5618,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3531.898,3532.448,"Thank you, Counsel."
