2008.06-1595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.272,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1595, Crawford v. The Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee."
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,11.056,26.65,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Vicky Crawford reported to city officials that she had been repeatedly harassed by the board's director of employee relations, her conduct was protected by section 704(a) of Title VII."
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,82.868,105.984,"So a co-worker of your client says: You know, the boss really was guilty of sexual harassment and the co-worker says: Gee, that's terrible."
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,105.984,107.768,"Yes, yes."
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.768,108.201,That's enough?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,108.852,109.919,Yes.
2008.06-1595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,114.12,118.655,"What if it's just, sexual harassment is terrible?"
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,118.655,121.541,--That would be covered.
2008.06-1595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,122.976,131.047,"Even if there's no link, there's no link to the person that the original -- the complainant says was engaged in that activity?"
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,131.047,133.998,--The opposition doesn't have to be directed at a particular event.
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.998,138.633,"What about, violating the law is terrible?"
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,138.633,144.687,I think if there's no reference to Title VII that wouldn't suffice.
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,144.687,145.104,Okay.
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,155.662,159.797,I think a trier of fact could conclude she was referring to what the co-worker had just said.
2008.06-1595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,159.797,165.951,"So if Mr. Jones, the person, did that, that's terrible."
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,165.951,168.386,Yes.
2008.06-1595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,168.386,171.838,That's actionable as opposition to the practices?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,171.838,173.121,It is protected.
2008.06-1595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,177.407,178.207,Mr. Schnapper--
2008.06-1595,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.207,189.299,"I was going to say in part it seems to me that in isolation it seems harmless, almost trivial, but the whole point is that the employer doesn't think it is trivial."
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,196.036,196.469,--Right.
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.357,207.944,But that doesn't solve the problem of having too broad an entry into this thing.
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,228.59,233.126,"--With all deference, Your Honor, the plaintiff must have sufficient evidence to get to the jury on all three elements."
2008.06-1595,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,244.45,263.597,"Do you believe, as I understood you to suggest a moment ago, that you could prove causation if the statement ""It is terrible"" or ""Sexual harassment is terrible"" had been uttered in effect in the abstract without reference to particular behavior or a charge of particular behavior on the part of a co-worker or an employer?"
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,298.353,300.753,--Up--
2008.06-1595,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,300.753,313.696,"What I'm getting at, doesn't the statement ""It's terrible"" or whatever the opposition may be have to be made in relation to some specific activity?"
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,313.696,314.596,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,315.213,316.732,Then what is the limit?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,339.93,341.213,That's at least two questions.
2008.06-1595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.979,372.819,--But why are we -- why are we spending so much time on hypotheticals that are so far from this case?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,406.123,408.075,"You do not, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,408.075,416.931,"Well, but, you know, that's why we ask hypotheticals that aren't related to the specific facts, because we're interested in how broadly the proposition you're asking for goes."
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,429.488,430.905,Yes.
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.498,448.985,And there does not have to have been sexual harassment in the employment unit.
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,448.985,451.102,That's right.
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.102,456.906,So this is a law directed against expressive activity.
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,456.906,458.425,Yes.
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.425,459.741,Are those laws good?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,462.126,462.642,"No, no."
2008.06-1595,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,469.196,478.921,What if the employee just made -- reports factual information: Supervisor did such and such; doesn't express opposition to it.
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,490.61,492.479,Not necessarily.
2008.06-1595,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,512.058,512.992,Let me ask this.
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,536.674,539.46,It's our view that that is not protected by the opposition clause.
2008.06-1595,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,545.029,557.587,"Isn't it strange when there are many situations in which testimony or the reporting of information is protected, but when it's done, isn't it usually done both ways, as it is under the participation clause?"
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,572.014,581.786,"--That's why we're advancing the view that the participation clause here provides as well, so that it's clear that exculpatory witnesses are protected."
2008.06-1595,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,615.09,616.073,Wouldn't that be very strange?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,645.359,647.894,--We think it is protected by the participation clause.
2008.06-1595,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,647.894,650.744,Why don't you follow what the EEOC says?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,704.314,707.933,"Well, I -- that would -- that would certainly be fine with us."
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.933,709.016,It wouldn't be fine with me.
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,709.016,712.551,We get to the same place -- we get to the same place by a different route.
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.551,717.086,What if -- what if I am indeed very much in favor of sexual harassment?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,741.784,742.651,No.
2008.06-1595,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.653,747.438,Covered by the participation clause?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,747.438,761.948,"--Because our view is that the employer's internal processes for detecting and rooting out sexual harassment, for example, is a -- is a process -- is a process that's under this title within the meaning of--"
2008.06-1595,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,761.948,763.131,Is this a real problem?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,793.334,796.352,"--It -- it is not, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,802.422,803.272,But I thought that ----
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,852.753,855.288,"Your Honor, there actually are two distinct questions here."
2008.06-1595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,874.666,880.404,And those are overlapping but not whatever it -- concurring--
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,880.404,880.904,Redundant.
2008.06-1595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,880.904,881.42,--positions.
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,885.274,885.524,Right.
2008.06-1595,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,918.759,926.098,"What is the test for determining whether an investigation has been done, and the person has testified?"
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,943.81,944.26,--No.
2008.06-1595,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,944.26,946.678,--a sort of a formal proceeding in -- in some sense?
2008.06-1595,0,23226,eric_schnapper,,946.678,955.284,"It -- it -- in our view, it doesn't have to be formal, but there are two essential elements to an investigation or a proceeding or anything other internal being under this title."
2008.06-1595,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,979.749,980.749,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,992.041,994.291,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1028.964,1037.486,"In that case, doesn't the opposing employee herself have a direct cause of action under Title VII?"
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1046.173,1046.54,Right.
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1109.198,1114.686,"Would you go as far as Mr. Schnapper in determining what constitutes ""opposition""?"
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1123.625,1127.827,"--If you -- yes, if a reasonable person could infer that."
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1136.8,1138.116,"Yes, yes, I know, but -- I know, but--"
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1138.116,1138.885,I understand that.
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1160.648,1162.5,--Facts that would constitute unlawful activity.
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1180.743,1181.462,Right.
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1182.212,1185.247,"Are you opposing it if you say -- you know, you are asked,"
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1189.083,1196.304,"--I think this is where we have not embraced the position of the EEOC, that we don't think that expresses opposition if all you do is say,"
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1211.48,1215.766,Even you knew that that was the critical fact in resolving the complaint?
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1215.766,1219.317,"If a reasonable -- well, if a reasonable person knew from all the circumstances, then maybe."
2008.06-1595,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.823,1228.941,"Well, since this is a case where the--"
2008.06-1595,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1228.941,1233.143,It seems to me that the participation clause is the line of least resistance.
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1243.867,1244.334,No.
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1253.39,1254.473,The opposition clause is?
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1254.473,1256.639,The participation clause is much broader coverage.
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1262.293,1265.245,"Well, it depends how you define the investigation--"
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1265.245,1265.711,Opposition.
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1265.711,1267.945,"--the inquiry, and that's kind of a tough issue, it seems to me."
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1267.945,1275.017,"If this were before the EEOC, everybody who testifies in that proceeding or participates in the investigation would be covered."
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1276.901,1277.402,Right.
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1277.402,1278.685,"So in that sense, it's broader."
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1288.408,1299.632,"Well, I guess the question I was asking earlier, you have overlapping but not concentric categories, so the ""opposing"" may be broader than the ""participating in"" depending upon how we define either one."
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1299.632,1312.742,"--That's exactly right, but at a minimum when you have a victim of sexual harassment who reports it to her employer in the context of an investigation where she's asked was there anything inappropriate and she recounts here, it's so clearly opposition."
2008.06-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.594,1320.629,You think -- you think the conduct in this case is also covered by the participation clause?
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1320.629,1321.262,--Absolutely.
2008.06-1595,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.262,1321.947,You do?
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1321.947,1322.547,Yes.
2008.06-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1322.547,1340.643,"The problem with that is that I -- while I have the EEOC with me, say, on -- assuming your thing -- on, from what I read, on the opposition clause, when I looked into what the EEOC actually said here on the participation clause, I don't think I can characterize it, except for their litigation position."
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1340.643,1341.059,But that--
2008.06-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.059,1345.363,I can't characterize what they've said in their compliance manual as being with you on that.
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1345.363,1346.013,--That's correct.
2008.06-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.832,1351.517,And they could easily change it.
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1352.617,1357.135,"--Yes, it is true that it's in a brief, it's on their Website, it's on home page, on their Website."
2008.06-1595,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1357.135,1357.587,Yes.
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1358.254,1362.123,"It's not in their compliance manual; it's in our amicus brief, but it is the EEOC's position."
2008.06-1595,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1365.491,1378.417,Can you think of any other situation in which the law says that a person who testifies or provides information is protected against retaliation only if that person gives testimony of a particular type or gives a statement of a particular type?
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1378.417,1381.036,"No, but you have to remember there are two separate clauses."
2008.06-1595,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1401.597,1417.208,"Well, I understand that, but I'm -- what I'm asking is, is the reason to doubt whether Congress intended in the opposition clause to provide protection only for people who testify or provide information that goes in a particular direction?"
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1417.208,1417.458,I think--
2008.06-1595,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1417.458,1427.664,"If the purpose is to -- is to elicit information and protect the people who come forward with the information, then why don't you provide the protection irrespective of what the person says?"
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1427.664,1435.42,"--I think that position is consistent with the EEOC, and I don't think we would oppose that position in the sense that it would give the greatest and broadest protection."
2008.06-1595,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1462.303,1464.772,--I think that's a very strong argument for the participation clause.
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1464.772,1465.522,--It is.
2008.06-1595,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1478.579,1482.615,The -- the other side says this is not an investigation.
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1491.553,1497.557,"--Well, I mean, we think that is border-line absurd, although all courts that have reached the issue have held that."
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1500.492,1501.075,I'm sorry.
2008.06-1595,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1501.808,1506.294,--Have held that -- that the internal investigation is covered as long as somebody has filed a charge.
2008.06-1595,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1540.383,1541.183,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1548.556,1560.114,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title VII was the result of a congressional compromise which struck a balance between protecting the interests of employees and employers."
2008.06-1595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1596.287,1604.04,What -- what more could Ms. Crawford do to make it clear that she opposes what was alleged in this case?
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1604.04,1611.712,She could have -- she could have initiated making contact with the government official to register a complaint or an objection.
2008.06-1595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1617.2,1622.604,"Well, how can the fact that what led to the statement change the characterization of the statement?"
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1635.995,1639.78,"Congress chose to use the word ""oppose"", Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1640.932,1643.017,"That's why my hypothetical uses the word ""oppose""."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1655.491,1667.549,"--If she's not taking the initiative, then she has to report it and request that something be done about it."
2008.06-1595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1682.642,1682.942,Right.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1693.18,1705.388,"Well, that's why we advocate a reasonableness standard, Your Honor, in the ears of the person receiving the information, but under the facts of this case, that standard was not met."
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1759.559,1773.549,"You mean if she had made complaints after she had answered the questions in -- and given the information at issue here, that would convert her prior statements into opposition?"
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1773.549,1781.638,"--That would -- the fact that Your Honor chose the term ""complaint"" would be a different situation from what we had here."
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1782.438,1784.357,I'm asking you.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1809.907,1813.276,--That complaint would undoubtedly be opposition.
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1814.526,1815.395,You're taking about--
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1815.395,1825.084,--Would it retroactively imbue the initial disclosure with an opposition quality?
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.5,1826.117,It would?
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1898.678,1907.118,"Your Honor, I'm uncomfortable with the concept that subsequent -- a subsequent complaint can imbue a prior statement with that--"
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.118,1909.32,Would that uncomfortable?
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1914.855,1920.009,--Perhaps yes.
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.211,1922.761,Then I don't understand your case.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,1922.761,1926.83,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't see that distinction as being relevant."
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.275,1979.612,"It isn't just a specific -- again, if I don't understand your case, it isn't just a matter of the specific practice."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2010.965,2012.667,--Your Honor--
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.667,2023.457,And I don't see how that is changed at all when you put it in the context of a specific act of harassment as opposed to putting it in the context of harassment in general.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2038.8,2040.883,"--I agree with that, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2056.743,2073.518,"--If the -- if the employee in response to the inquiry that's being made says yes, I saw my employer do ""X"" and it happened -- and I think it's terrible, that is certainly specific to the act."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2073.518,2080.505,"--It's specific to the act, Your Honor, but I -- I would argue that does not cross the line into ""and I oppose it""."
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2080.505,2096.431,"But the reason -- but the reason it doesn't cross the line is you are, in effect, saying that ""oppose"" within the meaning of the statute has got to be read more narrowly than the -- than the notion of oppose as we commonly use that word in common speech."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2106.286,2113.873,"Well, I think the word ""oppose"" can be used in a specific sense in common everyday speech and can be used in a general sense, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2114.423,2118.308,"But in my hypothetical, we're not talking about a general sense."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2145.526,2160.968,--The -- Your Honor's hypothetical of saying something is terrible would -- would -- would not be commonly understood to communicate opposition to--
2008.06-1595,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2160.968,2166.606,"Mr. Young, even under your definition, why is not the statement that's made in this case,"
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2178.028,2182.965,--Her statement to him to get out of my office would--
2008.06-1595,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.965,2185.25,Get the hell out of my office.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2185.25,2186.134,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2188.202,2194.105,Why isn't that opposition under your statement -- under your definition?
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2194.105,2218.405,"Well, the -- because the -- in the context of anti-retaliation provisions, making a statement to an alleged harasser to stop the harassment or get out of my office does not rise to opposition conduct, because the -- the -- the essence of the opposition clause is somehow putting the employer on notice."
2008.06-1595,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.516,2243.872,"Well, that isn't even -- look, the best way to oppose a crime is to cooperate with the police when they investigate individual instances."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2266.302,2269.154,"Yes, it was in English."
2008.06-1595,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2277.093,2278.193,It is your opinion.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2300.792,2302.092,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2321.705,2322.971,I'm sorry.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2324.005,2329.292,--and not sitting back and waiting for the investigation to come to them.
2008.06-1595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2329.292,2332.061,The investigation is not of her.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2334.013,2337.465,"She's offering a statement in an interview, Your Honor, as a witness, yes."
2008.06-1595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2337.465,2346.753,"And this is an act that's meant to protect people against discrimination in the workplace, including harassment."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2346.753,2347.453,Yes.
2008.06-1595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2347.453,2362.663,"This is a woman who testified truthfully -- we have to assume that because this was tossed out at the very threshold, so we have to assume that everything she alleged in her complaint is true, right?"
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2362.663,2371.971,"It is not up -- it is not before this Court on a Rule 12 standard of assuming all the allegations are true, Your Honor; but it comes to the Court on summary judgment."
2008.06-1595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2371.971,2379.458,There is no -- no dis -- then there has to be no genuine dispute as to any material fact.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2410.91,2415.545,That isn't -- that was her contention.
2008.06-1595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2417.481,2428.371,"But we have to -- everything -- for you to prevail, since there has been no trial on the facts, we have to take the facts as she alleges them."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2428.371,2433.59,"There are multiple places to report sexual harassment, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.429,2446.166,"Well, I suppose your point would be it doesn't matter what the reason was that she didn't report it."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2459.908,2462.86,"I agree with you, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2467.496,2477.202,And -- and I suppose that you -- you would require the -- the opposition to be somehow a public -- a public expression of opposition.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2477.652,2478.471,Yes.
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.471,2491.112,"I mean, if one political candidate says that the other one opposed the war in Iraq, do you think the other candidate could say, that's a lie?"
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2508.24,2509.906,"Your Honor, even when--"
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.906,2511.442,The implication is--
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2511.442,2512.242,--Even when--

2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2517.429,2518.196,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2532.621,2535.39,Why wouldn't this fall within the participation clause?
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2543.127,2544.246,Yes.
2008.06-1595,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2544.246,2546.698,So why doesn't it fall under the participation clause?
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2546.698,2556.054,An -- an employer's internal sexual harassment investigation is not an investigation under this title.
2008.06-1595,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2556.054,2560.356,"Never, even after -- even after a charge has been filed with the EEOC?"
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2560.356,2572.413,"Well, the five circuits that have squarely considered the issue have held that that's the trigger that brings the internal investigation under the rubric of the participation clause here, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2572.413,2573.515,And what's your argument?
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2573.515,2575.548,I'll -- I'll take that.
2008.06-1595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2575.548,2605.202,"And how about taking our decisions in the Faragher and Ellerth case which in a sense made the employer's internal investigation part of the EEO process because it says to the employer, if you don't have that find of effective internal complaint and investigation procedure, then you're going to be stuck on respondeat superior liability."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2624.531,2625.498,I agree.
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2649.231,2650.933,"Well, you say it's not made mandatory."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2706.685,2724.147,"--The fact that Faragher and Ellerth create an incentive to employers to develop these policies with investigate -- which include investigations, does not elevate such investigations to fall under the statutory requirement of being--"
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2724.147,2724.514,No.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2764.189,2774.663,"--Because at some point, Your Honor, the construction departs so far from what can reasonably be supported by the language of the statute itself that it--"
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2774.663,2779.983,"Well, why isn't it -- why isn't an investigation by the employer an ""investigation""?"
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2781.4,2783.602,"--It -- it is an ""investigation""."
2008.06-1595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2790.422,2791.422,I thought Faragher and Ellerth--
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.422,2793.022,"--Why couldn't he -- I'm sorry, Chief Justice."
2008.06-1595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2793.022,2797.492,--I thought Faragher and Ellerth were limited to the hostile work environment cases.

2008.06-1595,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2800.461,2802.161,"Well -- well, that's a different question."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2810.05,2817.322,My understanding of Faragher and Ellerth is that it -- it applies in the hostile work environment case involving harassment by a supervisor.
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2817.322,2833.998,"I thought you were going to answer Justice Souter with the assertion that if indeed the Court wants employers to conduct these investigations, it does not want to reduce the incentive to do so."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2880.61,2884.728,That would be the -- that would be the employer's interest.
2008.06-1595,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2903.773,2913.962,And instead they would substitute the -- the response to an EEOC investigation in which they would not have the leg to stand on in opposing respondeat superior.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2918.247,2922.632,Their -- they would lose the protections of Faragher and Ellerth.

2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2984.772,2989.843,"I have two arguments left in my quiver on summary judgment, Your Honor, that the trial court didn't even consider."
2008.06-1595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2993.378,2996.663,What are the other arguments on summary judgment.
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,2996.663,3019.676,"The lack of causation, the lack of knowledge between whatever Ms. Crawford told the investigator in this confidential interview as to which confidentiality was promised and delivered, the lack of any knowledge -- the lack of any evidence that the decision-makers regarding Ms. Crawford and her job, that they knew what she said in this interview."
2008.06-1595,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3032.836,3054.833,"When you say it's not that the employer is stuck because there's a potential retaliation claim, if the employer is certain of its grounds, that this discharge had nothing to do with her testimony, then go ahead and discharge her."
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,3054.833,3056.118,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.118,3059.153,Do you get your litigation fees if you win?
2008.06-1595,2,24816,francis_h_young,,3068.759,3074.996,"It is very difficult for a victorious defendant to recover attorneys' fees under section 1988, Your Honor."
2008.06-1595,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3083.702,3086.637,So even when you win you lose.
