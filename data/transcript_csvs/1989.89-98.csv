1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.487,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 89-98, Harold Davis v. the United States."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,11.039,14.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,87.106,94.343,"When you say that the record must be viewed in the light most favorable but the petitioners, you just mean any factual evidence that could have been drawn?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,94.343,95.978,"--Excuse me, record, the factual record, yes, yes."
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.978,110.804,"And on that point, Mr. Lee, can we take this case as one in which the donations or the payments would not have been made but for the parent-child relation?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,110.804,112.439,"Oh no, no."
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,128.098,149.346,"Well, if... suppose we had had a trial, and as a factual matter the parents said well, I just want it understood that of course I supported the church and its doctrines and the missionary movement, but the only reason I made these particular payments was the fact that it was my boy that was doing the missionary work."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,149.346,149.746,It would be--
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.746,151.298,"Would that be, then, a different case?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,151.298,152.064,--I don't think so.
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.064,154.916,So motive isn't irrelevant?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,154.916,155.55,Well--
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.55,157.202,Or isn't relevant?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,157.202,165.558,"--The motive to support the church's efforts is very relevant, because it demonstrates that the payments are for the use of the church."
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.558,169.176,"Well, then, suppose there is a mixed motive?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,169.176,175.997,"Then I think you look to what the Tenth Circuit said, what was the, who was the primary beneficiary."
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,177.949,180.484,"Well, is it the primary motive or the primary beneficiary?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,180.484,181.418,--It's the primary beneficiary.
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.423,192.291,"Well, I think those are two different tests."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,192.291,193.191,"--Oh, I think they are."
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,201.731,228.631,"Mr. Lee, supposing that... then, I am not saying the record does show this, supposing it had showed that for 20 years before their children became missionaries the Petitioners gave $500 a year to the church, and then in the years when their children were missionaries they gave $3,000 or $4,000 a year to the church, or to their children, and claimed a religious deduction."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,237.268,247.259,"No, not so long as the difference between the 500 and the amount they gave did not exceed the church's guide... which the church has identified as the amount that is necessary in order to support their work."
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.259,253.497,"Well, in my hypothetical though, they give a lot more when their children are involved than when they are not."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,253.497,254.297,That is correct.
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,254.88,261.103,But doesn't that show that there is not a detached motive of generosity for the church?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,261.103,276.712,"--What that shows, Justice Kennedy, is 160 years' worth of history in which the Mormon church prefers that its missionary work be a total family effort, including not only the family support, but also including specifically the direct payment."
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.507,355.462,"Mr. Lee, could I come back to your, as I understand your position it is that the motive doesn't matter, it is just whether the primary effect is to... is for the benefit of the church?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,355.462,357.597,"That is the way I would read the statute, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.597,383.548,"Well, then that would mean that if I... if I am walking along the street, and I'm a compulsive benefactor, and I meet a young man that I take a liking to and I say here, young man, here is $5,000, and that young man turns out to be a Mormon missionary and he uses that to live for the next year as a missionary, then I have a deduction?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,383.548,384.998,Most assuredly not.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.998,387.764,"Well, but the primary effect would be to support the missionary work of the church."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,387.764,388.716,Not because... no.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.575,431.777,"Why wouldn't he take it and give the church back the $5,000 that he is using?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,431.777,432.312,He could if you--
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.312,437.514,"And if he does that, then I would have a tax deduction, even though I don't even know he is a Mormon missionary."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,438.798,439.382,--That is correct.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.932,444.452,"--and he writes back to the church and he says you know, this fellow gave me $5,000."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,454.058,456.177,That is not for the maximal use of the church.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.098,463.348,"No, you have to take my hypothetical."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,463.881,464.514,--All right.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.459,481.442,You are not taking my hypothetical.
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,489.998,490.448,All right.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.448,495.402,"And you really think that I would have a deduction, even though I had no motivation to help the Mormon church at all?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,495.402,496.502,"No, clearly you don't."
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.502,498.921,"Okay, so motive has to enter into it somehow, doesn't it?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,498.921,504.741,I guess there is a relationship between the motive and... and it comes from the other end also.
1989.89-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,524.238,550.722,"Well, I suppose it's common ground in the government that if, if in the Chief Justice's example the family gave $500 a year to the church and then they gave... and then they send their children $5,000 a year or whatever the amount is... I suppose it's common ground, instead of sending it to them, they gave the church $5,000, that there would be a deduction."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,550.722,551.922,"Well, I would surely hope so."
1989.89-98,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.46,565.398,"So if the church ran its missionary support program differently, took the money itself from the parents, there would be no problem."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,565.398,566.665,--I would certainly hope so.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.94,636.059,Not a seminary student?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,636.059,637.428,--That is correct.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.52,732.639,"It advances their spiritual interest, surely, right?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,733.105,733.655,That is correct.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.655,738.793,"--and their parents can say I am doing this because I think it will do my, my son spiritual good."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,748.065,751.767,"Well, except that it is not the same issue for two reasons."
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,922.563,932.084,"How about the point that at the age these children were the parents might well have been supporting them, even had there been, had they been doing something else?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,932.084,932.62,Of course.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.938,975.03,"Mr. Lee, do we know from the record, as I recall these funds were sent to the locations where these students were proselytizing and deposited in a bank account in their--"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,975.03,975.847,Yes.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,975.847,983.319,"--Do we know from the record what would have happened if the children had just taken off, what would have happened to the bank account?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,985.303,987.105,"Yes, it would."
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.105,988.121,Do we know that from the record?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,988.121,990.79,"The record sets that forth, yes."
1989.89-98,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.623,1042.525,"May I ask, you say the money belonged to the church?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1042.525,1043.425,Yes.
1989.89-98,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.425,1044.794,Does the bank account show that?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1044.794,1057.434,"No, belong to the church in the sense that the church was... if I can, there was a fiduciary relationship in which the money was technically and legally in their name, but the use belonged to the church, in typical fiduciary--"
1989.89-98,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.434,1063.505,"I am sure it seldom happens, but what if a missionary did spend the money going to the theater?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1071.694,1072.427,--Yes.
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.813,1083.585,"What evidence in the record shows that this was a fiduciary relationship, and that the money would have gone to the church had the children simply run off?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1083.585,1085.319,"Elder Backman's affidavit, plus--"
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.319,1085.769,Whose affidavit?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1085.769,1086.537,--Excuse me?
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.537,1088.537,Whose affidavit?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1088.537,1094.024,"Robert Backman, and it is in appendix to the petition."
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1110.819,1112.219,"Well, we don't ordinarily consider--"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1112.219,1112.688,I understand.
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1112.688,1115.723,--appendices to amicus briefs as part of the record.
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1115.723,1116.173,I understand.
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1116.173,1119.008,What part of the record in this case shows what you want to show?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1119.008,1119.975,Elder Backman's affidavit.
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.975,1121.058,And where is that?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1121.058,1124.912,That is in the petition... in the appendix to the petition.
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.912,1125.912,Appendix to the petition.
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1125.912,1127.698,Yes.
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1128.564,1146.092,"Under that affidavit, which is at page 28a, suppose, following Justice Stevens' question, contrary to the doctrines of his church and the wishes of his parents, a missionary took the money for a color television set and bought the color television."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1153.396,1158.633,"--We have talked about that, and I think the answer is, technically, yes."
1989.89-98,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1159.1,1161.169,Is there something in the Backman affidavit that tells us--
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1161.169,1161.619,--No.
1989.89-98,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1337.95,1341.319,"--Mr. Lee, matter of curiosity, you spoke of men and women."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1344.604,1346.056,"Very, very early in the church."
1989.89-98,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1349.675,1355.412,"How many women... what is the proportion of women, roughly?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1355.412,1356.562,About four to one.
1989.89-98,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1356.562,1357.129,About what?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1357.129,1358.864,About four to one.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.864,1364.435,"Mr. Lee, just on your last point, I am not sure I understand the relevance of that."
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1388.133,1388.633,That is correct.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.633,1389.333,Or can I?
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1389.333,1390.419,"Excuse me, you cannot?"
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.419,1394.037,I cannot; I assume I cannot.
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1398.073,1398.489,That is correct.
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1399.358,1400.808,--think about the permanent things.
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1400.808,1415.201,"--I will assume with you that that is correct, but that is quite different from the church asking that they go and do things that are... that carry out a responsibility that is one of the three core functions that the church has identified, and do it on behalf of the church."
1989.89-98,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.201,1418.152,"The missionary aspect of this is central to the whole case, isn't it?"
1989.89-98,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1418.152,1419.352,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1989.89-98,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.352,1427.008,"Mr. Lee, when you resume I would appreciate your pointing out the paragraph in the Backman affidavit pertinent to our previous discussion."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1431.912,1435.114,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-98,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1512.198,1525.172,"Mrs. Peterson, do you, do you accept the proposition that if contributions were made by the parents to the church for use in the missionary program, that those are deductible?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1525.172,1541.467,"--Justice O'Connor, if the parents made the contributions to the church, and the church had complete, unfettered control over the use of those funds in its general missionary program, there is no doubt that the contribution would be deductible."
1989.89-98,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1580.258,1597.22,"Now, if the taxpayer making... filing the return was the missionary himself, I assume he could presumably deduct the expenses of his subsistence while serving in that capacity?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1597.22,1601.006,That would depend on whether or not the missionary was away from home.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.775,1643.083,"Well, I suppose you would say that... that even if the parent gave to the church some money and earmarked it for named individuals who were not their sons or daughters, that it would not be deductible either?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1643.083,1644.618,"That is correct, Justice White."
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.268,1654.157,"And so, a fortiori, it wouldn't make any difference if these particular people involved were not the children of the givers?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1654.157,1658.359,"That is correct, Justice White."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.778,1687.062,"It doesn't say that, Ms. Peterson."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1693.532,1694.301,Justice Scalia--
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.301,1698.17,"That must mean that I can give it to somebody else, so long as it is used for that organization."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1698.17,1717.297,"--Justice Scalia, 1921 for the express purpose of permitting deductions to trusts or other intermediary entities that served as fiduciaries having a legal obligation to hold and administer the funds for ultimate distribution to charity."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.785,1726.57,"Well, that might have been the immediate purpose, but its language goes beyond that."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1746.816,1756.791,"--Justice Scalia, the entire thrust of Section 170 requires that the gift be for a public benefit."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.227,1789.529,"But that is not the case, you say, when I give it to a trustee."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1789.529,1790.145,--The trustee--
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.145,1793.647,I can give it to a trustee who is not at all a charitable person.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1795.749,1804.855,"--The trustee, though, has a legal obligation to hold and administer the funds for the benefit of charity and for ultimate distribution to charity, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.855,1806.807,But that is what the church asserts is the case here.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1812.295,1820.699,"Justice Scalia, there is no evidence in the record of this case that I am aware of to indicate that these young men were fiduciaries of the church."
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1874.701,1877.101,"Well, how do we know that?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1877.101,1896.549,"The record in the case indicates that the children were the sole signatories over the accounts, and the church indicates that its control consisted of reviewing the expenditures, the total expenditures, not even the itemized expenditures, but the total expenditures that the children made, after the fact."
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1896.549,1907.172,"If... if the case showed that the... that the church had legal control over the funds, would the case be different?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1907.172,1910.458,"If, if the church had received the funds--"
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1910.458,1914.426,"No, no, it's this case, but the church has legal control over the funds."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1914.426,1921.996,"--If the church had legal control over the funds, yes, then that would be a contribution to the church, Justice Kennedy, and would be deductible."
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1921.996,1930.436,"So... so... so then your argument that it be, that it is paid directly to the missionary is, is not dispositive."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1930.436,1936.005,"Well, I am afraid I don't understand how the church could have total control over the funds if the payment is to the missionary."
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1936.005,1951.932,"Well, let's say the missionary writes a letter to the church and said as your agent I have just received $1,500, which I am depositing in a bank account subject to whatever control you wish, and until I hear further from you I shall expend it for my support during my mission."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1951.932,1956.169,If in fact a relationship was established under which--
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1956.169,1959.038,"Well, it's the case I gave you."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1959.038,1962.673,--If the agent is in fact an agent for the church--
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.673,1964.775,"Well, suppose he says that he is."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1964.775,1977.999,"--The agency... the establishment of an agency relationship, it seems to me, Justice Kennedy, requires a contract between two parties, which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been established by the record in this case, except that--"
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1977.999,1981.368,"Well, Mr. Lee said it has been established over hundreds of years."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,1981.368,1992.009,--The record in this case will indicate that the Mormon church prefers that its missionaries not receive contributions from any party except their parents.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.198,2001.448,Well now that isn't... that isn't... that can't be so.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2008.452,2020.159,"There is no question that non-parents occasionally support missionaries, Justice White, but the record in this case indicates that the church does not want its missionaries to receive funds directly from third parties."
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.401,2050.096,"Well, you don't... I take it that even if there isn't some sort of a formal contract, I would think that it's perfectly plain that the children on the missions think they are under some obligation not only to their parents, but to the church, to spend this money only for their missionary activities."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2050.096,2051.215,"Justice White, they--"
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.215,2052.081,Is that right or not?
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2052.081,2052.781,--I think not.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.6,2055.917,You think--
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2055.917,2057.583,They used it to purchase food--
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.583,2058.869,--That isn't what I asked you.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2058.869,2059.585,--They used it to purchase housing.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.585,2065.273,Do you think they feel under an obligation to spend it for... to support themselves so that they can be missionaries?
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2065.273,2068.558,"Yes, but they had to eat, and they had to have housing."
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.558,2069.225,"Well, I know, of course."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2069.225,2075.295,"And as, as the court in the Orr case said, the words"
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2096.475,2108.783,"Well, you don't argue, I take it, along the lines of the Court's earlier questions to Mr. Lee that there was a motive here that is relevant to the determination of the case."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2109.218,2110.035,Justice Kennedy--
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2110.035,2111.085,--Is that in your brief or not?
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2111.085,2117.622,"--I don't know that we addressed motive in great detail, but motive is relevant here in two respects, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2117.622,2119.323,"Well, you didn't argue it in your brief, in other words."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2119.323,2122.442,"No, and I will address that."
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2155.614,2158.699,"Ms. Peterson, what cases do you cite for that proposition?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2158.699,2161.984,"--Well, since at least 1882 this Court has recognized--"
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2161.984,2163.519,But what case do you cite in your brief for that?
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2163.519,2164.152,--Russell v. Allen.
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2165.138,2165.838,Russell v. Allen?
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2165.838,2166.671,Yes.
1989.89-98,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.077,2176.577,"Well, maybe--"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2201.227,2202.911,"That is right, Justice Rehnquist."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.911,2204.679,"Well, you can read that case."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2234.549,2245.256,"Justice Scalia, there is no doubt that the people to whom these boys were preaching were beneficiaries of the missionary program."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.329,2257.231,"Well, may I ask about--"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2257.231,2258.448,Did a qualified donee have control.
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.448,2258.981,--about control.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2277.728,2283.381,"They are... the trustee, however... well, there are two answers to your question, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.256,2297.873,The church asserts that here.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2297.873,2305.962,"--Second of all, that trustee will ultimately distribute the funds to the charity."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.196,2343.17,"But insofar as control is concerned, it is no different from here, if you assume... if you assume that the church would have the right to those funds if the child abandoned missionary activity."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2343.17,2356.078,"Let's talk about that, because I am unable to find anything in the record that would indicate that in fact the funds would be distributable to the church at the end of the mission."
1989.89-98,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.541,2378.777,Why don't you read the next sentence too.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2378.777,2391.151,"--Furthermore, if a surplus starts to develop, the missionary is expected to take action to have the amount of the donation sent to him appropriately reduced."
1989.89-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.687,2395.722,May I ask you a question on this?
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2395.722,2396.505,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1989.89-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.505,2408.196,"Supposing that they modified their arrangement in this respect, and said that the parent shall send the money in the form of a check payable to X as trustee for the Mormon church."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2427.86,2446.987,"If the beneficiaries of that trust are determined in advance, and there is an understanding between the charity and the donor that it... in fact, the funds are going to be used to benefit specific individuals, then the transfer lacks the indefiniteness which is the hallmark of a charitable contribution."
1989.89-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.654,2448.204,Your answer is that would be the same case.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2448.204,2448.689,It would not be deductible.
1989.89-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.689,2454.943,"That would be the same case, even though the church would then have a legal cause of action for misspent funds?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2454.943,2466.318,"That is correct, because any transfer that will qualify for a contribution deduction under 170 must be indefinite in nature."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2470.486,2479.726,"Now, if the church spent money to support these individuals while they are on mission work, you would not say that that money was being spent for the benefit of those individuals."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2483.344,2484.445,"--That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2484.445,2493.385,"But if the parents, if the same thing happens and the money comes from somebody else, you suddenly say that it is being spent for the benefit of those individuals and not for the benefit of the persons that they are proselytizing."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2494.018,2496.67,"Because that is what the statute requires, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.122,2504.693,"How can it be for their benefit when the parents pay it, but it's not for their benefit when it comes from the church?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2504.959,2508.728,The statute doesn't say for the benefit of.
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2559.761,2561.53,--You probably should have that covered by statute.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2563.981,2567.433,We believe that is what this statute does provide.
1989.89-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.299,2603.523,"May I ask you again, the problem of identifying... you are looking at checks, if you use my hypothetical and they wrote checks payable to X as trustee for the Mormon church, you wouldn't have any trouble identifying those checks."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2603.523,2613.812,"Well, yes, Justice Stevens, but that then goes back to the question of whether or not that transfer was designed to benefit a particular individual."
1989.89-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.686,2625.136,But there isn't even arguably a second beneficiary there.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2625.136,2626.305,"--I beg your pardon, sir?"
1989.89-98,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2626.305,2628.272,There isn't even arguably a second beneficiary there.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2635.994,2657.657,"Let me just point out that the lower court cases that have addressed this question have held that gifts or transfers to persons who are serving as missionaries, i.e., providers of services, are treated in the same way as those for receivers of services."
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.194,2706.84,"I suppose you would have the same... have the same... take the same position if some, if some member of the Mormon church agreed with the church to pay the salaries of the church employees in its office in London."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2706.84,2709.292,"I, would... I am sorry, Justice White, I didn't--"
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.292,2713.661,"Well, the church has an office in London, let's assume, and it has some employees there."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2713.661,2714.446,--Yes.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.446,2718.148,And some one agrees with the church to pay their salaries.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2718.148,2720.082,Uh-hum.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.452,2730.355,"Well, you would say, you would say that that, the amount that they pay to those individuals--"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2730.355,2730.772,Yes.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.772,2732.439,--is not deductible.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2732.439,2732.824,Yes.
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2750.151,2750.786,Ms. Peterson--
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2768.064,2770.647,"And the check is made not to the church, but--"
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2770.647,2771.599,"It is not to the church, it is made to the people."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2771.599,2772.532,--but to individuals.
1989.89-98,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2772.532,2775.468,"The donor never, didn't know it, doesn't know who they are."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2777.17,2786.276,"I would have to say that in that event they have not, again not complied with the statutory requirement of having the money passed to the qualified donee."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.029,2801.368,"Ms. Peterson, suppose you have a... a... small church, a small Catholic church, only one priest there."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2814.559,2816.225,"--Justice Scalia, it is my understanding--"
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.225,2817.159,Under your theory.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2817.159,2817.761,--Yes.
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.604,2844.578,"Why is that different from Justice Stevens's hypothetical, where you write a check to the missionary as trustee for the Mormon church?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2844.578,2852.082,I understood Justice Stevens' hypothetical to involve earmarked contributions for the direct benefit of certain missionaries.
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.521,2860.221,I see.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,2868.208,2879.433,"No, it would hinge on whether or not the priest could use it for the church's general program within St. Mary's parish, or for whatever purpose, but not for a specific individual's benefit."
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.106,3013.721,"Did I understand you to answer Justice Stevens that if I make a... if I am a member of the Mormon church and I make a, send some money to somebody, not my child, and say this is in trust for the Mormon church and you are to spend it as the church tells you to."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3015.154,3019.975,"--Oh, so long as it is not earmarked for a specific individual, Justice White."
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3019.975,3022.508,"Well, he sends it... I send it to a specific individual."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3022.508,3024.26,"But, as a trustee--"
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.26,3025.01,Exactly.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3025.01,3026.445,--in a fiduciary relationship.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3029.147,3034.266,"Well then, all, all the parent has to do every month is to write a letter like that, then?"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3034.266,3037.101,"--No, because then he has earmarked it for a specific individual."
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3037.101,3043.24,"No, I send the money to some named person."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3043.24,3043.706,Right.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.706,3045.406,And I... a missionary.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3051.494,3057.731,"Well, it seems to me that the example that you were positing is in effect a sham--"
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3057.731,3059.098,I thought that was the example that Justice Stevens--
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3059.098,3060.766,--I may have understood Justice Stevens.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.902,3067.754,"--Well, let's take my example--"
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3067.754,3072.574,--where the beneficiary of the funds is not earmarked.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3078.145,3078.645,"--Well, I am the trustee."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3089.5,3093.654,--Only if it is ultimately distributable to the charity.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.873,3105.729,"Well, the church, the donee here is under an obligation from the donor, if he accepts it, to spend it the way the church tells him to."
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3112.366,3119.889,--It seems to me that what you have suggested here is the equivalent of the sort of sham transaction that existed with the tuition payments.
1989.89-98,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.748,3144.087,So a missionary... the church has a missionary sign a piece of paper that says that any funds you receive for your support will be held in trust for the church.
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3144.087,3148.556,"Again, if it is earmarked for the use of a specific individual, it ought not to be deductible."
1989.89-98,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3153.86,3156.395,What language do you rely on for that?
1989.89-98,1,41846,shirley_d_peterson,,3156.395,3171.587,"The legislative history of Section 170, in addition to this... Court has recognized the public charity aspect and the public benefit aspect of Section 170 repeatedly, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-98,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3183.878,3185.462,"Thank you, Ms. Peterson."

1989.89-98,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3276.169,3289.746,"Well, Mr. Lee, I am sure that for the use of is construable like you say it is, but don't you think it is also possible to construe it like the government does?"
1989.89-98,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3289.746,3290.096,--No.
1989.89-98,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.214,3296.15,"Well, no court?"
1989.89-98,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3296.15,3296.816,--No court.
1989.89-98,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.348,3324.717,"Well, isn't it... isn't this construction in the regulations, or not?"
1989.89-98,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3324.717,3331.239,"I yield to no one, Justice White, in my respect for the government's... for that rule, not from this pulpit."
1989.89-98,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.727,3340.845,I asked you is it in the regulations?
1989.89-98,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3342.195,3343.547,"--No, it definitely is not in the regulations."
1989.89-98,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.547,3344.047,It isn't?
1989.89-98,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3344.047,3345.064,"No, no."
1989.89-98,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3442.525,3443.627,You can certainly shift small amounts.
1989.89-98,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3447.262,3457.636,"Justice Rehnquist, there is no one who is going to be able to live in Washington, D.C. on much less than $310 a month."
1989.89-98,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3483.418,3503.515,"It may be... it may be that the Mormon church is one example where the... maybe the problems of abuse or administration wouldn't be hard, but that might not be true of all the other situations where these kind of deductions might be claimed in connection with all sorts of other churches."
1989.89-98,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3503.515,3511.687,But wouldn't it be too bad if we lost this case and lost 160 years' worth of tradition because of problems that you might attribute to somebody else?
1989.89-98,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3511.687,3515.906,"Well, all you, you would just internalize this operation."
1989.89-98,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3520.143,3520.993,Earmarked?
1989.89-98,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3521.827,3524.429,"No, but you wouldn't have any problem."
1989.89-98,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3530.749,3533.082,"May I just respond to that, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1989.89-98,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3533.082,3534.867,"No, I don't think it was a question."
