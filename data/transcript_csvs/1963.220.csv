1963.220,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,834.872,836.022,Then what is that?
1963.220,0,16599,arval_a_morris,,836.022,865.408,"Because we don't believe that, first of all, that any state agency has power to promote undivided allegiance to the Government of the United States when many appellants in this case, professors are members of religious orders who believe that their undivided allegiance belong to God, other members believe that their undivided allegiance belongs to United Nations, other members of the faculty believe their undivided allegiance belong to mankind generally and we don't believe that the Fourteenth Amendment allows any State that power."

1963.220,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,908.265,913.416,The reason I'm asking about it is because I don't know exactly what it means by that.
1963.220,0,16599,arval_a_morris,,913.416,913.954,"Well, the undivided allegiance --"
1963.220,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,913.954,921.948,Does that you mean that you -- you construe that as meaning that a man can't like something else if he wants to?

1963.220,0,16599,arval_a_morris,,972.952,981.158,"Well, in fact, it's quite clear that the history of this country sometimes could easily be construed as teaching disrespect to the flag, Your Honor."
1963.220,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,981.158,983.519,I thought Nelson has preemption.

1963.220,0,16599,arval_a_morris,,1113.042,1130.247,Maybe I would think that the -- the state power would maybe question of a denial of equal protection then it have to find some rational basis for that classification in relation to the teaching function and I'm not really sure if there is one.

1963.220,0,16599,arval_a_morris,,1374.219,1382.754,It would appear that the purpose of this oath is to require a conformity rather than the right to dissent.
