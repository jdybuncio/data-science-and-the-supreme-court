2000.00-203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument next in Number 00-203, United States v. The Cleveland Indians Baseball Company."
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,52.199,55.385,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.228,137.103,"You know, I have just one big problem with your case, and that is the case from this Court dealing not with the taxability, but with the calculation of benefits under statutes using the very same language, where we look back at the year when it should have been paid in calculating benefits, and your opponent is going to say, and has said in the brief, that it will cause lots of disruption if we were to adopt your view in that area."
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,146.793,148.278,Let me just--
2000.00-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.278,149.145,--the wages?
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,149.145,154.899,"--I have one caveat before I answer the question, which is, actually the language in nobody's view, I think, is the same."
2000.00-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.404,166.789,"Well, but they both have language referring to wages paid."
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,166.789,168.491,"--Right, that's true, but they... it's slightly different."
2000.00-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.626,206.349,"Okay, but in answer to my question, are you taking the view that we can leave that the way it is and calculate benefits--"
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,206.349,207.383,Yes.
2000.00-203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.383,213.853,--the way Nierotko suggests and not be disturbed by the fact that it's a different view here?
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,213.853,215.722,I actually think that there's no problem at all.
2000.00-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.657,311.101,"Don't those records have to be kept for social security allocation purposes, so the employer... to determine quarters of coverage, would have to supply those records to the Social Security Administration."
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,311.101,313.036,"Well, not quite."
2000.00-203,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,391.869,418.436,"But my question really is, are you taking a position that the provisions, the FICA and FUTA, however you pronounce it, that those provisions dictate the position that the Government is taking, or are you saying, yeah, they could have gone for symmetry with Nierotko, but this statute could go either way, and our consistent interpretation, the service's consistent interpretation has been when it's paid is when it's income?"
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,418.436,423.988,"--No, I think the wages-paid language in FICA and FUTI... FUTA is entirely unambiguous."
2000.00-203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,450.473,452.824,Do you think Nierotko was wrongly decided?
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,455.693,456.493,"No, we don't."
2000.00-203,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,554.123,559.444,But none of the statutory changes address this point specifically.
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,559.444,562.046,"I think, quite to the contrary, I think they do."
2000.00-203,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,570.485,586.78,"It is certainly unambiguous with respect to the normal payment of wages in accordance with whatever the wage contract is, but if we take the position, and I will confess that I... I'm inclined to, and that's what I want you to address."
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,633.742,640.665,--I don't think that that's the... that is the philosophy when you have litigation between the wrongdoer and the wronged party.
2000.00-203,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,648.252,648.602,Right.
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,651.054,651.989,--this question--
2000.00-203,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,651.989,666.832,"But why should a neutral party, in effect, have a... in effect a different rule for its taxation from the rule which in effect determines the relationships of the two parties to the litigation?"
2000.00-203,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,669.434,676.271,--Because we know... because what Congress was looking for was an administrable rule to apply for the tax system here.
2000.00-203,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1579.44,1584.26,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-203,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2703.429,2706.131,I just have a couple of brief points.
