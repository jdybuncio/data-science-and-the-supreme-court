2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.64,"We'll hear argument next in Case 16-8255, McCoy versus Louisiana. Mr. Waxman."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,6.64,65.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a defendant maintains his innocence and insists on testing the prosecution on its burden of proof, the Constitution prohibits a trial court from permitting the defendant's own lawyer, over the defendant's objection, to tell the jury that he is guilty. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a personal defense that belongs to the accused, and whether to admit or contest guilt is the paradigmatic example of that personal defense, not only because it singularly affects the life and liberty of the accused, but also because making that decision requires weighing subjective aspirations and value judgments that are unique to every individual."
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,66.04,77.56,"Suppose the -- the charge is murder and -- and the lawyer says: Based on what I've looked -- I think your best case is self-defense, you know."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,96.44,136.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think your question raises a question both of what defense counsel may constitutionally do and also what defense counsel may not constitutionally do. I'll also note first that your hypothetical, in dramatic contrast to this case, involves, at a minimum, the shared objective of obtaining a -- an acquittal on the charged crimes. But, in addition, our position is that the one thing that counsel in that case and in no case may do is -- this isn't about what counsel can argue."
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,147.12,148.2,That was --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,148.2,149.2,"Now, your example --"
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,149.2,149.28,-- a big --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,149.28,149.48,Yes.
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,149.48,150.68,-- that was a big wind-up with the --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,150.68,151.36,That's a --
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,151.36,157.76,"But my particular question is obviously, when you say simply that my client shot the guy, that doesn't mean he's guilty."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,163.0,163.44,That's right.
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,186.8,187.16,Okay.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,187.48,188.68,-- that is for the defendant --
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,188.68,196.92,-- your position is not -- your position is not limited to the situation where the lawyer admits the client's guilt; it goes beyond that?
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,196.92,231.2,"We -- that's a hypothetical, and our position is that the framers -- that the -- that the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, the meaning of the right to defend, that the framers enshrined, that is recognized in all common law jurisdictions, is that if the defendant contests and decides to put the prosecution to its proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to an element of the offense, particularly at the actus reus, the Constitution precludes the defense -- his own lawyer from telling the jury --"
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,231.2,231.92,Any element --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,231.92,232.08,-- that he did it.
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,232.08,233.76,-- any element of the offense?
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,233.76,234.08,So --
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,234.08,241.48,"Offenses have a lot of -- I mean, some -- is venue an element of an offense sometimes? Or --"
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,241.48,247.76,"Well, the -- the most extreme hypothetical I can think of is: Was there a mailing in interstate commerce? And --"
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,247.76,250.04,"All right. Well, that's a good one. (Laughter.)"
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,250.04,250.36,Thank you.
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,250.36,250.68,Is that --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,250.68,250.84,I think --
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,250.84,255.16,"-- is that -- I mean, the Hobbs Act or something? Did you cross -- cross state lines?"
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,255.16,255.32,So --
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,255.32,256.44,That's an element of the offense.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,256.44,257.4,Yeah.
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,257.4,269.72,"So, if a lawyer says it's obvious that you did cross state lines, you've got 48 witnesses, I'm not going to argue that you didn't cross state lines; and the person says that's an element of the offense, you have to say I didn't or withdraw."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,269.72,270.88,"No, no, no."
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,280.6,281.0,Okay.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,291.88,303.88,"Just so that we're -- you and I are very clear about this, we don't think that this case presents the question because this is a case in which -- in which there was not an agreement on whether to pursue acquittal."
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,315.6,317.36,"No, I know. You -- you know how hypotheticals work."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,317.36,317.68,I do.
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,317.68,319.2,This is a different case.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,339.8,370.12,"Our position is that the defense that the framers enshrined in the Sixth Amendment and that is recognized in the entire rest of the common law world is that, whether it's admitting guilt or not, if the defendant says I did not do X, I did not kill my parents -- my family members, defense counsel may not affirmatively tell the jury that he did and ask that he be required to spend the rest of his life in prison."
2017.16-8255,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,370.12,371.28,"Well, then that's the problem."
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,371.28,375.88,So I did not -- I did not cross the Pennsylvania state line in the course of committing this crime.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,375.88,376.32,That's right.
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,391.72,394.76,Your answer is that -- this is fairly simple.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,400.52,408.96,"If there is a contemporaneous objection, the trial court may not permit the defense lawyer to admit any element of the offense."
2017.16-8255,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,409.2,410.88,Right there is the problem.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,505.28,524.96,"My response, as Your Honor's question noted, is there is -- there is no need for this Court to decide the elements question or any other hypothetical in which there is a shared objective of acquittal in order to decide this case."
2017.16-8255,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,524.96,525.08,Well --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,525.08,526.16,My position with respect --
2017.16-8255,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.16,526.8,That's surprising.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,526.8,527.92,-- my -- excuse me?
2017.16-8255,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,527.92,553.4,"That's -- that's surprising, because if we announce that we're not deciding it, there are like 200,000 criminal cases in the lower courts and there will be a kind of chaos, I mean, I fear, that as to what -- there are lots of people, you know, there are many, many defendants who go through dozens of lawyers while they're objecting to this one or that one or the other one."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,553.4,553.88,Justice Breyer --
2017.16-8255,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,553.88,555.2,And you see what I'm worried about?
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,555.2,555.36,I --
2017.16-8255,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,555.36,556.84,I think we should decide it.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,556.84,557.2,Okay.
2017.16-8255,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,557.52,558.28,But -- yeah.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,558.28,559.72,-- I invite you to decide it.
2017.16-8255,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,579.0,583.24,"But, Mr. Waxman, if we have to draw a line, it seems to me we have at least two axes we have to worry about."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,602.28,602.72,So --
2017.16-8255,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,602.72,605.56,-- why -- why doesn't it go down to that level? That's one axis.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,605.56,605.72,The --
2017.16-8255,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,605.72,610.76,The other axis would be you say it's -- the lawyer can't admit the element.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,635.72,676.8,"So I think this Court has been -- as to your first axis, the Court has been very, very clear that decisions, once a -- once a defendant chooses to be represented by counsel, decisions about what evidence to admit, what objections to raise, what witnesses to call, with the exception of the defendant, and what witnesses not to call and what arguments to be made are for the lawyer, reviewable if at all under the ineffective assistance of counsel defense. So evidence, arguments, witnesses, this case is only about -- and you say there's a small difference, but this is all the difference in the world."
2017.16-8255,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,676.8,685.6,"But sometimes -- sometimes -- sometimes, though, a piece of evidence is far more important than an element. Take -- take the Chief Justice's example of a Hobbs Act."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,695.36,702.48,"I mean, in the real world, what defendants object to -- and I've been representing death row inmates for --"
2017.16-8255,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,702.48,702.64,I know.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,702.64,713.24,-- this is my 40th year -- defendants are not drawing a line and saying you can't admit that something moved in interstate commerce across state lines.
2017.16-8255,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,723.52,737.76,"Mr. Waxman, may I -- may I ask if we -- if we concede the general proposition that you're right, the client has a right to say I didn't do it, but that's a defense."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,785.76,847.68,"Justice Ginsburg, the defendants, and even clients in civil cases, all the time do things that make counsel's job either difficult or impossible. The defendant can say: Look, I don't care, I am going to testify and I am going to give my side of the story, or I don't care, I've instructed all of my family members not to talk to you, not to provide you any information. The lawyer's professional responsibility, nonetheless, is just exactly how Justice White explained it at pages 257 and 258 of his opinion in United States versus Wade. What happens in these cases is that the lawyer doesn't have -- the -- the principle at stake here is not in any way a restriction on how the lawyer presents evidence, what defenses he actually does present, how he goes about cross-examining witnesses."
2017.16-8255,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,847.68,848.48,Can we be -- can we --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,848.48,849.32,His obligation --
2017.16-8255,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,849.32,856.68,Can we be concrete about this case? So the lawyer doesn't say to the jury he did it.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,880.24,897.84,"The -- the lawyer will cross-examine the government's witnesses, as Justice White explained, attempting to find holes in their testimony even if the lawyer believes that they are testifying truthfully. That is the hallmark of the adversary system."
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,922.64,923.16,Mr. --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,923.16,926.36,The ethics rules are very clear about what lawyers can and can't do.
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,926.36,927.36,"Now, Mr. Waxman --"
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,927.36,928.04,Mr. Waxman --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,928.04,928.8,None of that is at issue in this case.
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,928.8,929.8,"Mr. Waxman, let me --"
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,929.8,960.44,"Mr. Waxman, this sounds like a -- my ethics class in law school, and this very hypothetical of what do you do with a lying client? And it was my understanding that every ethics rule requires the lawyer to put the client on the stand but not assist the client in telling the lie by -- you can put him on the stand and say tell your story."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,984.28,991.28,"They have -- they have the same -- I mean, Your Honor's understanding, this is not a question of ethics rules --"
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,991.28,992.2,Absolutely not.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,992.2,993.72,-- about perjured testimony or anything.
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,993.72,994.28,But the question --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,994.28,996.2,Your Honor's understanding is correct as to --
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,996.2,997.28,So let me find --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,997.28,999.88,-- the vast majority of jurisdictions.
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,999.88,1001.48,"Well, could I ask you about --"
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1001.48,1002.76,So may I ask -- may I just --
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1002.76,1061.6,"Mr. Waxman, could I ask you about, because I want to understand where the -- the line is here. So let's imagine a case where the evidence of the actus reus is overwhelming, there's not a chance in the world that the defense is going to be able to convince a jury that the defendant did not commit the actus reus, but there's a plausible defense, maybe a pretty good defense, on mens rea. So -- but the client insists: I didn't do it, I did not commit the actus reus. Now, two ways of -- of approaching this on the part of the defendant -- defense attorney, and I want you to explain whether one is required or whether -- whether both are permissible or only one is permissible. One is for the attorney to concede in the opening, yes, he committed the actus reus, but there's a good mens rea defense, and develop that. I take it you would say that's not permissible?"
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1061.6,1062.28,Correct.
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1062.28,1080.92,"But could the attorney open by saying: Now, they have to prove he committed certain acts but also that he had a certain mental state, and our defense here is going to be that he didn't have the requisite mental state, and everything that's done during the trial is directed toward that."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1092.08,1093.48,So the latter --
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1093.48,1102.52,"So long as he doesn't say the magic words he actually committed the -- the -- the physical acts charged, it's okay?"
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1102.52,1102.72,Right.
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1139.12,1139.72,I -- I understand that.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1139.72,1141.52,"That's -- that's the right at issue here, and your --"
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1141.52,1142.4,I -- I -- I -- I understand your --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1142.4,1142.8,And that would --
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1142.8,1143.52,I understand --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1143.52,1143.56,Yeah.
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1143.56,1147.04,"-- your position, but what is the answer -- I want to understand where the line is."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1147.04,1147.48,So the line --
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1147.48,1149.12,What is the answer to my question?
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1149.12,1172.2,"Yes, the answer to your question is, if I understood your hypothetical correctly, there would not be a violation of this fundamental Sixth Amendment right and the defense counsel's strategy in focusing the jury on mens rea and saying nothing or cross-examining or not would be evaluated under the ineffective assistance of counsel standards."
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1172.2,1172.84,"Excuse me, Mr. Waxman --"
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1172.84,1174.6,That's okay if --
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1174.6,1175.68,"Mr. Waxman, can --"
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1175.68,1179.52,"That's true -- that's true even if -- Justice Sotomayor will have the next question, and I'll have this one."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1179.52,1179.64,I --
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1179.64,1191.12,"That's true even if the -- the accused says I want you to say that I didn't do it? The lawyer does not have to do that, right? That's your position?"
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1191.12,1193.8,Our position is that the lawyer --
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1193.8,1195.16,"Yes or no, please."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1206.12,1208.76,I believe that the lawyer does not have to do that.
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1208.76,1209.0,Okay.

2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1209.32,1210.2,Now Justice --
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1210.2,1211.08,This is only a prohibition.
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1211.08,1211.88,Justice Sotomayor.
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1211.88,1226.32,"Taking Justice Alito's hypothetical, I walk in and say it is the government's burden to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1265.52,1265.8,Right.
2017.16-8255,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1265.8,1266.24,Right?
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1266.24,1269.68,"Well, I'm -- my defense -- I -- you know, the government alleges all these things."
2017.16-8255,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1289.32,1348.12,"That -- that's easy for you to say in a case that you're imagining. What I'm wondering, if there are other cases where it might be far more difficult to come up with that answer, and, therefore, I'm asking you this question: Suppose the opinion were to say in this case the lawyer explicitly said to the jury he is guilty of the crime charged. That the Sixth Amendment forbids. But the rest of these complicated matters, whether it's elements, whether it's this, whether it's that, we leave -- at least for now, we leave to the law schools, the bars, the ethics classes and the others because we don't want to freeze the answer into the Sixth Amendment. Now, what would you think of that?"
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1348.12,1385.76,"I think that the only holding that this Court can apply in this case is that under the -- that where -- was Your Honor's hypothetical -- was Your Honor's statement of the case, which is where the defendant says, and says to the judge, promptly and repeatedly: I did not kill the members of my family, my lawyer wants to stand up and tell the jury that I did and that I am guilty, and the judge -- if the judge says you're the lawyer, you decide, that is a violation of the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause."
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1385.76,1386.04,But you were drawing --
2017.16-8255,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1386.04,1397.68,"Mr. Waxman, can I take you back to the Chief Justice's question? Because here we do have a case where the defendant is saying you can't admit the actus reus, which is killing."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1444.92,1481.88,"I don't think the logic of my position insists that you go all the way up the chain, but I'll explain to you why I think the better view would stop at affirmatively admitting -- nothing about what the trial -- how the trial is conducted, but affirmatively admitting any element. And it -- it simply goes back to my reading and my understanding -- maybe I'm wrong -- of the rule that existed, the law that existed at the time the Sixth Amendment was considered and adopted and what the framers must have understood. And we -- we go over this at some length in our brief."
2017.16-8255,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1526.52,1527.52,"Mr. Waxman, I -- I --"
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1527.52,1528.12,At that time --
2017.16-8255,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1528.12,1530.88,"-- think you're right about that, but my question would be -- I'm sorry."
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1530.88,1531.64,"No, go ahead."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1531.64,1532.68,"No, no, no."
2017.16-8255,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1533.48,1552.08,"On that, it seems to me that that's Faretta, right? That you have a right to control your self-representation if you're unhappy with your lawyer. The -- your client had an opportunity to -- this is on his second lawyer. And he -- he had notice before trial that there was a breakdown with his lawyer."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1569.96,1586.04,"There -- there's no question about it, but the -- the right to the assistance of counsel and the right to your defense are not mutually exclusive rights. Justice Alito, and then, if I may, I'd like to save some time for rebuttal."
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1586.04,1591.84,"Well, in -- when the Sixth Amendment was adopted, there was not a right to appointed counsel."
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1611.12,1611.56,I agree.
2017.16-8255,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1611.56,1622.68,-- how much you can read into the -- into the original understanding because the situation here is dictated -- is dominated by the fact that now there is the right to have an appointed attorney.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1622.68,1632.12,"Justice Alito, Daniel Webster himself could not constitutionally have done what Mr. English did in this case."
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.44,1642.56,Certainly.
2017.16-8255,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1642.56,1645.92,Thank you.
2017.16-8255,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.92,1648.6,Ms. Murrill.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1648.6,1689.04,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The state proposes a -- a rule that, in a narrow class of death penalty classes, counsel sometimes might be required to override his client on a trial strategy when the strategy that the -- that the client wants counsel to pursue is a futile charade and requires him to defeat both their objectives of defeating the death penalty. We submit that that should be treated as a Strickland ineffective assistance of counsel."
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1689.04,1692.52,"I'm sorry, you started by saying you want a narrow rule."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1704.44,1704.72,Your Honor --
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1704.72,1708.68,How do you limit your -- why would we limit your rule?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1708.68,1720.44,"Because I think we've conceded, and we would -- we would agree that in most cases that the rules of professional conduct would dictate that a lawyer follow the directives of his client."
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1720.44,1748.24,"Is it the rules of professional conduct or is it the Sixth Amendment? The Sixth Amendment requires you to be represented by counsel, effective counsel, but counsel. Or do you concede that generally or all the time -- let's not say this is a death case, let's just say this was a robbery case, all right? A robbery case. The defendant says: I wasn't the robber."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1762.36,1787.2,"I think that the rules of professional conduct inform the Sixth Amendment and that they would probably give some level of greater force to the client's wishes in certain situations, but, again, I think that goes back to Strickland. It's in -- if you -- if you evaluate it as a Strickland claim, then we're looking at it under the first prong of Strickland as a question of deficiency."
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1787.2,1789.8,So you don't think it's a Sixth Amendment violation?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1789.8,1790.16,I do not.
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1793.96,1824.84,"So -- so you're not taking the position when you're saying generally that -- that a client has any right to say I didn't do this in court? I didn't do -- I didn't shoot, I didn't rob, I didn't make that call that that witness says I made, that the witness -- that a -- that a client, once he takes a lawyer, takes -- doesn't have a right to say I didn't do it --"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1824.84,1825.48,I -- I think we --
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1825.48,1825.96,-- at all?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1825.96,1832.6,-- we wouldn't characterize it as an independent autonomy right.
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1839.96,1853.4,"One of my former colleagues said this isn't -- one must analogize these things to agency, that the defendant -- the lawyer is the agent of the defendant."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1856.64,1858.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1858.92,1870.4,"So, if the agency has ended because the client has said: Don't do this, how can it not be a violation of the Sixth Amendment to do it?"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1870.4,1872.8,Because agency principles only take us so far.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.2,1901.2,Your point -- I see your point.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1933.48,1941.08,"Your Honor, I think this was a very, very difficult client and that that -- that is part of the equation in this case."
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1941.08,1946.52,Do the ethics rule say it's all different when -- when -- when you have a difficult client? Maybe many are difficult.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1946.52,1948.6,The ethics rules don't tell us what to do.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1948.88,1953.6,"No, but you just said the ethics rule say follow the wishes of your client."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,1980.04,1994.04,"Well, Your Honor, I mean, I think the state has been -- been very clear that we think that the -- the defense that Mr. McCoy wanted was inextricably intertwined with the alibi that Mr. McCoy wanted, that it was not purely a questionable --"
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1994.04,1994.2,Yeah.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2018.92,2027.92,"Because, at the end of the day, it leaves him with a less -- less of a defense, a less -- the defense is not as strong."
2017.16-8255,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2040.32,2072.44,"Well, for sure we've given lawyers a lot of leeway to make quite a number of decisions when they're representing a defendant, troubled and untroubled, and the idea is that lawyers know better, sometimes, than their clients and that we should want to lodge a great many strategic decisions in their hands rather than in the client's. But you're not talking about here, or we're not talking about here, about how to pursue a set of objectives."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2104.52,2111.08,"Well, because -- first, Your Honor, I -- I don't think that that's entirely how Mr. McCoy characterized his objective."
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2125.44,2126.8,But he didn't say that.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2142.0,2142.4,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.4,2144.92,He wasn't talking about strategy at that time.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2173.76,2177.48,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-8255,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2222.92,2223.08,But --
2017.16-8255,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2223.08,2228.52,But the client is saying that -- that his ultimate objective is not to defeat the death penalty.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2253.88,2271.36,"Well, and so, if that's all he had said and that was the totality of the circumstances, was I don't want to admit that, and it was -- it was a rational, fine discussion, I don't want to admit that, I don't want everybody to hear that, that's fine."
2017.16-8255,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2271.36,2271.72,When we got to this --
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2271.72,2273.04,That's not what happened.
2017.16-8255,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2273.04,2273.36,-- we got to this --
2017.16-8255,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2273.36,2273.56,He --
2017.16-8255,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2273.56,2274.64,-- the situation here occurred.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2343.76,2346.44,"Your Honor, that's a very difficult question."
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2353.8,2355.4,Wasn't -- wasn't there --
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2355.4,2357.88,And -- and so the question is really about counsel --
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2357.88,2363.68,Wasn't there a motion -- there was a determination that he was competent to stand trial?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2363.68,2366.04,There -- there was a determination that he was competent.
2017.16-8255,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2376.16,2376.36,All right.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2376.72,2377.64,The -- the lawyer put on a defense?
2017.16-8255,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2377.64,2378.88,-- just move on to the -- the other part of it.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2399.28,2411.72,"Perhaps he should at a certain point in time, but I think that's a limited right in and of itself and -- and that the judge has to make that decision based on an abuse of -- and that's an abuse of discretion standard."
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2419.96,2429.12,Would the lawyer -- did -- did his lawyer put on a defense? He conceded that -- he didn't fight the competence.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2439.24,2448.92,The entire tenor of his defense was to attack mens rea and then subsequently to beg for mercy in the -- the penalty phase if there was --
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.92,2456.6,To attack mens rea on the ground that it was not -- he was not mentally competent at that time?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2456.6,2459.44,"Yes, Your Honor, that he didn't have the capacity to develop the specific intent of --"
2017.16-8255,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2459.44,2474.4,"Counsel, you've been asking us to review this under Strickland, but why -- why isn't this a structural error? The Sixth Amendment guarantees the assistance of counsel, as Mr. Waxman points out, and that is a fiduciary relationship."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2491.92,2502.4,"Your Honor, first of all, because I don't think it fits within the class of cases that have been evaluated as Cronic, to complete failure of adversarial testing --"
2017.16-8255,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2502.4,2514.48,"Well, why -- why isn't this just like Faretta, where we said, you know, that you have a right to have assistance of counsel and not to have an agent of the state assist the state in prosecuting you?"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2514.48,2518.92,"Well, initially, because I would suggest to you it was not a -- he was not an agent of the state."
2017.16-8255,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2521.2,2526.16,"You'd agree, though, that he -- he effectively conceded guilt to second-degree murder?"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2526.16,2532.08,As a strategy and a means of defeating the death penalty and testing the state's case on specific intent.
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2532.08,2556.36,"I'm sorry, I thought it's been not disputed that he thought, quite wrongly, that there was no mens rea for second-degree murder but that it's been conceded that what -- there -- that there was a mens rea both for first and second degree and he was only arguing for second degree?"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2556.36,2568.12,"Your Honor, on the facts of this case, he was arguing for second degree. Louisiana law does permit -- does -- does cover -- felony murder is not a specific intent to kill, but that was really never at issue in this case."
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2569.84,2572.0,"I'm sorry, but there is a mens rea for second degree murder."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2572.0,2573.56,"There is, yes."
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2573.56,2575.36,And so --
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2575.36,2575.92,"Yeah, I mean, I --"
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2575.92,2578.04,-- you concede that there wasn't second degree?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2578.04,2582.56,I think that that was a strategy decision that falls under the first prong of Strickland.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2600.52,2603.16,And that's -- I now understand why we are where we are.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2630.56,2631.92,Yes.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2631.92,2632.6,All right.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2658.8,2670.24,"I -- Justice Breyer, I think -- I think that you captured where the state is when you said let's -- don't freeze that answer into the Sixth Amendment."
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.52,2681.96,"Well, what's your -- what's -- that's fine to say in abstract terms, but -- but -- but our problem, I think, at least mine, is I have to write something -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.96,2711.24,"-- here that is going to be taken as a rather authoritative account. Now, what is your view as to what those words should be? That he can do anything, the lawyer, no matter how incriminating it is to the client as long as he says I want to follow a different defense, a different defense than my client wants? That's your view of it? And leave the rest to the -- to Strickland, the bar association, et cetera."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2711.72,2712.2,"Well, then I -- I --"
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.2,2715.28,"What is your view, if you can say it in a sentence or two?"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2715.28,2725.8,"That in a very narrow class of death penalty cases, counsel may be required to override the decision of his client, if that's -- if -- if the client's strategy is -- is futile and --"
2017.16-8255,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2725.8,2761.68,"Well, if -- if we're there, though, in Strickland, even in Strickland, on deficient performance, why isn't there at least deficient performance here by the lawyer admitting the element as opposed to remaining mute about it? That would have been an option that I think the lawyer could have pursued. So we'd still have prejudice prong, I understand your arguments there, but why not on deficient performance? I would have thought under the ethical rules, which I know are not controlling here, that you -- you would have had an argument for an ethical violation in conceding your client's guilt."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2761.68,2764.88,And -- and I would expect them to make that argument.
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2787.28,2790.44,But not if this is a case that comes under Cronic.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2812.96,2823.52,"And -- and so, Justice Ginsburg, I would suggest that the Sixth Amendment is not violated until -- if it is a Strickland question, which we submit that it is, the Sixth Amendment isn't violated until he has the --"
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.52,2824.24,But why isn't it --
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2824.24,2825.72,-- we have demonstrated both prongs.
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2825.72,2847.72,"-- it a Cronic question? This is a -- a -- a lawyer who has said I concede my client did it, against the client's will, has made that concession. Why isn't that a Cronic error?"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2847.72,2857.44,Because I think it's not a complete failure of adversarial testing and that it -- it fundamentally tested the state's case.
2017.16-8255,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2863.8,2864.16,Can I --
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2864.16,2865.04,What about the --
2017.16-8255,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2865.04,2886.4,"Can I put in my notes in this case -- can I take away from your argument that the State of Louisiana says that if a defendant wants to plead not guilty, the defense attorney can plead guilty if the defense attorney thinks that's the best way to avoid the death penalty?"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2886.4,2888.44,"No, Your Honor, because --"
2017.16-8255,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2888.44,2890.8,So you do not agree with that proposition?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2890.8,2892.6,I do not agree with that proposition --
2017.16-8255,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2892.6,2897.16,How is that proposition any different from what really happened in this case?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2897.16,2900.28,Because the state was still put to its burden of proof.
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2916.92,2920.4,I thought -- I thought he said I'm relieving the prosecutor of that burden.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2921.28,2927.2,"He made that statement. He did make that statement in his closing arguments, but he couldn't actually do it."
2017.16-8255,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2930.08,2955.88,"Is -- maybe this is the same question Justice Kennedy was getting at, but what if there was a discussion before and the client told the lawyer: So I understand you think you're doing your job keeping me from the death sentence, but I don't want -- it's worse for me to spend the rest of my life in jail, that's my perspective, so I don't want you to pursue your objective of saving the death penalty. He said I've got this -- and so, if that's not the case, I don't want to make it an easier case on second degree."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,2977.8,2993.08,"I think in that -- I think at the -- in that situation, you probably are going to fail the deficiency prong of Strickland and probably the prejudice prong. And -- and you are, in your hypothetical, talking about a rational conversation with someone who's cooperative."
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3008.68,3009.16,So the further --
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3009.16,3010.44,-- that I wasn't -- that I was in Houston.
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3010.44,3022.68,"So the further footnote is it's -- only happens if your client's not rational, that that's where you have the freedom to ignore your client?"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3022.68,3024.04,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-8255,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3049.4,3065.44,"But, Ms. Murrill, I -- I think all these questions go to the same point, which is Strickland seems a very awkward fit here because there's nothing wrong with what this lawyer did if the goal is avoiding the death penalty."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3102.64,3114.36,"Well, Justice Kagan, I think the record reflects that's not -- that what Mr. McCoy wanted was to defeat the death penalty by the means that he wanted it, which was his alibi."
2017.16-8255,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3114.76,3119.68,"Well, let's take Justice Kagan's hypothetical then on its own terms."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3124.16,3138.52,"I -- I think that probably to some degree goes back to Justice Roberts's hypothetical about a rational conversation with a defendant who was willing to have a conversation and not simply close the door to the discussion, which -- which is much more like the defendant in -- in Nixon."
2017.16-8255,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3138.52,3161.12,"Let's posit all of that, that we have a competent, rational, thoughtful individual who makes a calculated decision autonomously, that that's the route he or she wishes to go. Is it -- can we even call it assistance of counsel? Is that what it is when a lawyer overrides that person's wishes?"
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3161.12,3165.4,I -- I do believe it still falls within assistance of counsel.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3172.12,3172.68,Did he --
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3172.68,3174.0,-- and the totality of the circumstances.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3175.68,3198.88,"Did -- did -- I'm thinking back, I think the Chief asked you, or maybe it was Justice Kennedy, he quoted the language where he said ""I've relieved you of your burden,"" so he says, ""I've relieved you of your burden,"" he says to the jury, and he also says, ""and he's guilty."" That was earlier. Now, in the context, was that -- you're familiar with the record."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3221.48,3221.84,He did.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3223.4,3230.96,He said you cannot convict because he has a mental state that prevents you from convicting him for either first- or second-degree murder?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3230.96,3231.64,He argued that --
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3231.64,3232.0,And I'll find --
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3232.0,3233.24,-- consistently from start to finish.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3233.24,3236.2,And he put -- and his closing statement said that too?
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3236.2,3237.48,Yes.
2017.16-8255,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3237.48,3238.0,Okay.
2017.16-8255,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3238.0,3239.6,I'm sorry.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3253.64,3284.24,"It -- it -- the -- the specific words that he used -- the totality of his defense from start to finish was that he did not have the mens rea necessary to support the death penalty, the first-degree charge. And that was the gist of it. There's some creep in his arguments over time, I -- the words are there on the page, but I would submit to you, again, that is argument and that that is a deficiency question under Strickland, that that is always -- argument has always been a question of deficiency under -- under Strickland."
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3327.2,3327.96,I -- I still --
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3327.96,3329.2,-- because it's too hard.
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3329.2,3344.4,"-- and when you say Strickland question, the -- the client says I didn't do it and I have a right to take that position."
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3348.72,3356.88,"Certainly, Your Honor, I think the client can take that position."
2017.16-8255,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3356.88,3361.96,So the client can do that.
2017.16-8255,1,62953,elizabeth_murrill,,3394.16,3400.28,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that the Fifth Amendment could be implicated in certain factual scenarios."
2017.16-8255,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3452.36,3460.04,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Waxman."
2017.16-8255,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3460.04,3461.4,I know I'll never -- never do this.
2017.16-8255,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3632.68,3635.84,You can finish your third point.
2017.16-8255,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3635.84,3657.64,"As to Cronic, we don't think this is an ineffective assistance of counsel case, but it surely is -- it surely is Cronic if it were because if the constitutional right to defend means anything, it means the right to decide to test the prosecution on its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
2017.16-8255,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3657.64,3658.88,"Thank you, counsel."
