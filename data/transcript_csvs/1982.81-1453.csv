1982.81-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,78.35,"Mr. Attorney General, I think you may proceed when you are ready."
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,78.35,81.135,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,259.484,265.673,But the statute doesn't require that he be informed specifically that it may be admitted in evidence.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,265.673,267.406,"No, it does not."
1982.81-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,267.406,268.875,As the New York statute does.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,268.875,269.741,"No, it does not."
1982.81-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,269.741,279.064,Does it require that he be advised that it could be used with respect to the revocation or reissuance of his driver's license?
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,279.064,279.897,Yes.
1982.81-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,296.959,299.995,Why do you think the legislature drew a distinction between the two?
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,302.93,304.381,Perhaps.
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,344.107,351.445,"But Mr. Attorney General, does that mean that the failure to give him this advice would make the evidence inadmissible no matter how we ruled?"
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,351.445,357.683,"No, I don't believe it would, and it would be our position that it would not make it so inadmissible."
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.42,365.203,"But the trial judge ruled it would, didn't he?"
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,365.203,368.991,"Yes, but that issue has been remanded back to the trial court."
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.597,390.087,"Well, what will happen if the trial judge on the remand says, well, maybe the statute is constitutional, but the evidence is still inadmissible because of this reason?"
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,395.039,401.859,"No, I think not because that goes more to the matter of... he also ruled as to relevancy, which could change from judge to judge."
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,401.859,402.426,Right.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,402.426,407.43,But this Court can decide the issue of whether it violates the Fifth Amendment.
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.43,410.799,But that won't determine whether it is admissible or not.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,410.799,420.904,"It will under South Dakota law because I think these other matters will fall into place after that, if it is admissible and not in violation of the Fifth Amendment."
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,420.904,434.58,"No, but I mean it is still conceivable, at least, that the trial judge will say this evidence is inadmissible for two reasons that the United States has no business telling me how to decide: one, that it is not relevant, and two, you didn't give the advice you are supposed to give under the statute."
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,434.58,441.901,"I think the relevancy issue, first of all, can be decided because the legislature, in the first place, said it's relevant."
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,444.686,445.222,Right.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,445.222,446.755,There has been no trial.
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.091,478.943,May I ask one other question on the procedure.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,486.363,486.799,Yes.
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,486.799,491.751,And the trial judge may well rule one way or the other on that issue.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,498.171,500.187,I guess... yes.
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.187,501.706,It seems to me much more probative than the test itself.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,501.706,504.491,"The answer, quickly, is yes, we could."
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.647,518.834,But is it not possible... the reason I ask these questions is I want to be sure we have a final judgment here.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,536.344,554.926,"--Well, I think you must decide it because, if you will look at the lower court, the South Dakota Supreme Court case in a footnote, they are obviously going to follow this Court in the sense that as arbitrator of the Fifth Amendment, plus I don't believe they ever considered the relevancy issue."
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.282,565.915,"No, no, no, I understand that."
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,571.536,571.888,--That's correct.
1982.81-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.055,610.061,"Well, if this evidence is inadmissible under the Fifth Amendment and the case goes back on that basis and there is an acquittal, you are through."
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,610.061,611.696,That is correct.
1982.81-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.731,629.308,"Well, if we said there wasn't a final judgment and didn't review the case, then the evidence is inadmissible and you could never get review if there is an acquittal."
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,629.308,630.691,--That's true.
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.878,635.911,"Well, it isn't quite true because there could be another appeal."
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,648.769,662.827,"--I guess we can't go forward in state court unless the Fifth Amendment... the primary issue is the Fifth Amendment, and as this Court knows, we have two appellate circuits of the federal system, states on either side of the issue."
1982.81-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.055,689.511,"Mr. Attorney General, you have got a man that staggers around, he can't walk straight, he is falling all over the lot, and he says"
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,693.647,695.73,"--Well, I think the test--"
1982.81-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,695.73,698.266,Isn't that enough to convince any jury that he is drunk?
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,698.266,702.551,--We are not submitting at this point that we could get his comments in.
1982.81-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,702.551,707.807,"I know that, but I'm just saying factually then you wouldn't have had all this trouble, would you?"
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,707.807,723.65,"No, but we believe that our South Dakota Legislature in passing this statute that allows the fact of refusal to be put into evidence had a number of things in mind: first of all, to remove, or to rather allow the jury to know all the facts, number one."
1982.81-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.65,725.519,Like killing a gnat with a sledge hammer.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,725.519,735.124,"Well, I think it's important that when we look at the trial of cases, I mean the day-to-day functioning of our lowest courts that try these matters, that we take certain things into account."
1982.81-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,833.038,835.423,"He can be compelled in an open court, can he not?"
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,835.423,847.631,"He can, Your Honor, and U.S. v. Askew upheld that out of the Tenth Circuit and this Court denied cert. Well, what is even more interesting is what happens to that right of refusal."
1982.81-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.052,963.987,Doesn't anyone argue that that burdens your federal right to a jury trial?
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,963.987,968.522,"--No, because I think only those defendants... we have discussed that before."
1982.81-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1008.682,1028.393,"It's easier, I suppose, to compel a breathalyzer test or a blood test than it is a handwriting test because you can't tie a man down and force him to give a handwriting example, can you, but you can tie him down and take a blood test or a breathalyzer test."
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1028.393,1032.147,"Your Honor, I think there are some other things that are involved, too."
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.502,1262.612,"Mr. Attorney General, I know in this case you are not arguing about the conversation ""I'm too drunk"" because that has not been determined yet, but it seems to me that in order to put in the fact of refusal, just as a matter of evidentiary, you couldn't ask for the conclusion, did he refuse."
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1271.903,1280.592,I think that all of us would look at this Court's decision in this case and try to determine how much of the words we can put in.
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.602,1297.185,I object on the grounds it calls for a conclusion.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1297.185,1302.137,"Well, I was going to get to it, and I would say by his words and actions he indicated he refused."
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.137,1302.653,And I made the objection right now.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1302.653,1303.255,Because it is going to be different--
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.255,1313.028,"It seems to me... I'm not suggesting it's right or wrong, but it does seem to me just as a normal evidentiary matter, that's the way you put this kind of conclusion into evidence, by putting in the conversation that took place."
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1317.48,1321.383,--I guess the state believes we do have a right to do it.
1982.81-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1333.024,1340.362,But it seems to me that you can't really answer the ultimate question whether you can put in the refusal unless the trial lawyer knows how he is going to go about doing it.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1340.362,1344.499,"Well, we submit that first of all, the evidence itself is constitutional."
1982.81-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.618,1350.82,What do you mean when you say evidence is constitutional?
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1350.82,1361.275,"We are saying that the blood, were it taken from the individual over his objection, could be offered at trial."
1982.81-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.275,1369.214,"Well, are you saying really that there is nothing in the Fifth Amendment or Sixth Amendment or whatever it is that would prevent it from being offered at trial?"
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1369.214,1378.22,"That is what we would say, that the base evidence that we are seeking here, and the state prefers to have rather than a refusal, is a blood test."
1982.81-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1386.493,1390.628,We can't say that here so far as the South Dakota courts are concerned.
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1397.551,1398.183,That is correct.
1982.81-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.092,1453.637,"But are you in effect arguing that since the court has held that it is appropriate for the state to compel, to compel the extraction of blood, a fortiori if the blood is admissible, the refusal to do it is admissible?"
1982.81-1453,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,1453.637,1455.337,I believe it follows.
1982.81-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1659.752,1663.64,"I think we will resume there and have your argument at 1 o'clock, counsel."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,1686.053,1689.588,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1748.829,1755.566,"Mr. Gienapp, was that 1980 amendment that you just spoke about in response to a decision of the Supreme Court?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,1755.566,1768.557,"It was perhaps a year and a half later after a decision of the South Dakota Supreme Court that held that such a refusal was not admissible without a statute, basically."
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.861,1785.019,"Then was the South Dakota Supreme Court conceding, at least sub silentio, that there was no constitutional issue involved, if they were inviting the legislature to pass a statute?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,1785.019,1787.704,"No, I don't believe they really invited the legislature--"
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1787.704,1790.239,"Well, they said in the absence of a statute, you said."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,1790.239,1794.291,"--Well, I don't know if they specifically said in the absence of a statute."
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1800.761,1801.511,Was this your interpretation of it?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,1802.561,1803.611,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.546,1961.181,Do you think we have jurisdiction here?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,1961.181,1967.502,"I question jurisdiction, Your Honor, in my reply to the writ for certiorari."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.354,1972.973,Because of lack of finality?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,1972.973,1973.889,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.889,1976.341,And that is because why?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,1976.341,1984.697,Because of two other grounds that the matter has already been suppressed on at the trial court level in this particular case.
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.697,1985.497,"Well, that is not finality, is it?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,1988.415,1996.088,"No, these are... Yes, these are independent state grounds, although they have not been rule on per se by the South Dakota Supreme Court."
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1996.088,2007.812,"Well, are you suggesting that if the state prevails on the constitutional issue in this Court, nevertheless your courts may reaffirm the setting aside of the conviction on one of the other two grounds?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2007.812,2009.446,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2009.446,2011.348,Or on state constitutional grounds?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2011.348,2013.8,That would be a possibility also.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.8,2020.787,"It is curious that in the earlier case that you referred to, that they made no reference to any state constitutional issue."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2020.787,2027.623,"No, they did not, not in State v. Oswald, and I don't believe in State v. Maher did they either."
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2027.623,2040.95,"If you were to prevail on that basis, the state would really be at quite a disadvantage, wouldn't it, because the Supreme Court of South Dakota opinion in this case seems to speak only in terms of the federal constitution."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2060.947,2075.456,"They would have the chance to have the federal question reviewed in a different case where there was not the error in following statutory procedures in advising someone of the implied consent right, or--"
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2075.456,2076.44,Not in this case.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2076.44,2077.69,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.05,2094.835,But isn't there a suggestion in the opinion that that court views the two as coterminous?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2094.835,2098.62,Their history has been such that they do not.
1982.81-1453,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2098.62,2108.677,"I was merely going to add that if he is acquitted, however, the issue cannot be reviewed."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2108.677,2109.843,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.735,2145.433,"But if we dismissed this case for lack of jurisdiction and the case went back, the evidence would be inadmissible, but not only for the constitutional reason but for irrelevancy or--"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2145.433,2147.052,"That is correct, and also--"
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.052,2155.539,"--So even if we reversed, even if we reversed the constitutional ruling, the evidence in the trial court wouldn't be admissible."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2155.539,2156.658,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.658,2160.126,Because of the other two grounds?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2160.126,2161.243,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.243,2169.632,"Did the trial judge explain why he thought it was irrelevant, and if he didn't, do you have any suggestion as to support that ruling?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2169.632,2177.237,"The trial court did not explain why it was irrelevant, Your Honor, at least that I can recall, and it is not in the record."
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2209.043,2213.744,Irrelevancy was hardly the correct label for that if that was the basis of the ruling.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2213.744,2214.61,Could be.
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.61,2224.135,Can these other two grounds ever get to the Supreme Court of South Dakota for exclusion?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2224.135,2227.004,"Not in this particular case, no."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.658,2239.312,"And if the case is tried as an acquittal, the state cannot appeal."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2239.312,2240.562,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2240.562,2245.716,"Well, if they didn't raise those grounds on their appeal, then aren't they the law of the case?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2245.716,2246.982,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.982,2247.966,I didn't realize that.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2252.62,2258.607,"That is my interpretation of it, and I feel that I raised that to some extent."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.892,2270.181,"It isn't a question of finality; it is a question of an independent state ground, really."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2270.181,2273.966,It is a question of finality as to the Fifth Amendment ruling within the state.
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.966,2280.787,"Well, that is final enough, but it makes the ruling irrelevant in this case."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2288.459,2293.713,"That is my interpretation of what has taken place up to this time, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.187,2309.073,"Well, but that wouldn't answer it."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2325.815,2327.767,"That is my recollection, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.817,2332.688,"Well, that is quite important, as Justice Stevens says."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2332.688,2333.871,--The petition for intermediate appeal--
1982.81-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.871,2339.658,"Because if they raised it, the Supreme Court wouldn't have had to reach them because they had another reason for reversing."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2344.146,2363.54,"--The petition for intermediate appeal, sir... I don't have the case, or the page number off the top of my head... is embodied in the appendix for petition for a writ of certiorari, and that would specify the entire reasons for the appeal in this particular case."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.54,2366.575,You say that is in the appendix?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2366.575,2367.594,Yes.
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.296,2392.56,"Well, if this case resolves itself down to whether or not the trial judge abused his discretion under the state statute, do you think that is the kind of a case this Court would review under any circumstances, an abuse of discretion, even if it was the grossest kind of abuse of discretion?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2392.56,2397.613,I guess... Let me correct myself in looking at this petition for intermediate appeal.
1982.81-1453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2415.992,2437.238,"Well, didn't the South Dakota Supreme Court say in that regard that it affirmed the order of the circuit court suppressing the admission of refusal evidence and that it need not address the other issues raised on appeal, or deemed them to be without merit."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2437.888,2438.69,Or deemed them to be without merit.
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.79,2444.159,Here at A-35 it says two questions are presented.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2463.306,2463.823,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.823,2469.71,Doesn't that subsume the admissibility of the statements on other grounds?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2469.71,2479.165,"That basically does not include, first of all, the third ground, which relates to the statutory requirements."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.165,2479.85,Why doesn't it?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2493.925,2494.527,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2494.527,2498.729,It doesn't refer to the question of whether it was inadmissible because of irrelevance.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2498.729,2505.8,"And those were the only two issues briefed, basically, in the South Dakota Supreme Court, that particular situation."
1982.81-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.8,2512.906,"And it is correct, is it not, that the state Supreme Court treated both of those issues in its opinion?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2512.906,2513.472,Yes.
1982.81-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.472,2515.858,"The ""I'm too drunk"" comment and the constitutionality question."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2515.858,2523.963,They remanded the propriety of the statement for further trial court proceedings within the confines of Miranda.
1982.81-1453,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2523.963,2540.556,"Counsel, before you go on, I think your brief expressly agrees that the issue before us was stated correctly in the Attorney General's brief, and that, of course, was only the constitutional question."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2540.556,2541.539,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2541.539,2548.162,"Of course, agreement can't confer jurisdiction on us, but I'm wondering now what is your position."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2551.947,2559.636,"Basically, Your Honor, I have no problem with the Court deciding the issue."
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2591.941,2594.491,Let me see if I understand that.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2604.431,2610.735,Because of the other two grounds found at the trial court level for the non-admissibility of this particular--
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2610.735,2611.685,And irrelevancy was one of them.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2611.685,2612.687,--Right.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2612.687,2616.806,"Well, suppose it is a different trial judge, who might think that this was quite relevant?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2616.806,2622.793,Then I get into the res judicata rule of the case situation.
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2624.329,2625.629,"There hasn't been any trial here, yet."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2625.629,2626.212,--No.
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2626.212,2629.881,It is only on appeal from denial... or grant of a motion to suppress.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2629.881,2631.066,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.829,2660.668,What you are really saying is you would be happy to have us give you an advisory opinion on it.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2660.668,2664.47,That would be a correct assumption.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2664.47,2668.774,Is it an advisory opinion when that is the only question that brings you two gentlemen here?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2668.774,2678.647,"Well, you know, I followed through on the appeal with good faith and obviously feel that it is an issue that there is--"
1982.81-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2678.647,2680.197,"Well, you didn't ask for an appeal."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2680.197,2681.331,--That's correct.
1982.81-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2681.331,2687.569,"No, but after it was here, after it was granted, you conceded that the constitutional issue posed by the state was here."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2687.569,2691.271,I briefed only what the state briefed in their particular brief.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.987,2693.739,"And we aren't bound by what either of you say, of course."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2693.739,2700.56,--I believe I did raise a question on that regard in my reply to the petition for writ of certiorari.
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2700.56,2704.881,"And so you thought when we granted the cert, that issue had been resolved by our grant."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2704.881,2705.714,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2705.714,2707.031,He thought we knew what we were doing.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2709.666,2714.487,"That, I guess, would be a proper summation of my feelings in that regard."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2716.503,2721.224,"Very tactful, counsel."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2721.224,2739.285,"I feel, though, going to the constitutional issue, and it is Respondent's position that Schmerber, that this is clearly communicative or testimonial under the dictates of Schmerber."
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2867.118,2872.022,"Well, is that really what the statute says?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2891.352,2907.695,"--Under the facts of this particular case, you are talking testimonial, and as this Court has indicated, testimonial can be other than actual word of mouth; it can be a nod of the head, a nod of the head ""no"" or this type thing."
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2908.73,2915.051,"But he wasn't compelled to shake his head, certainly."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2915.051,2921.872,--He was basically requested by the law enforcement officer to give him a response.
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.792,2928.359,"Yes, but he certainly wasn't compelled."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2930.727,2936.631,He wasn't within the implied consent right told that.
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2962.632,2964.265,Muteness?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2964.265,2964.901,Muteness.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2964.901,2965.801,To stand mute.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2965.801,2966.684,To stand mute.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2966.684,2967.769,To refuse to speak.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2967.769,2968.503,Yes.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2982.26,2985.897,Let me clarify that.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,2996.67,3000.907,South Dakota law states that that is a refusal.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3013.381,3016.083,And you say that is testimonial.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3016.083,3021.237,I don't necessarily say the muteness is testimonial.
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3045.519,3051.34,I don't understand why you say this is a compelled refusal.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3056.576,3057.743,It is--
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3057.743,3059.195,"Well, does it?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3059.195,3060.712,--If I said compelled--
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3060.712,3061.245,Does it?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3061.712,3062.314,--Yes.
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3062.314,3063.78,"Well, then how is it compelled?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3063.78,3069.801,"If I said and used the words ""compelled refusal"", I was erroneous."
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3098.07,3102.205,"But he could under Schmerber be compelled to give the blood sample, could he not?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3102.205,3102.905,--That's correct.
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3102.905,3108.609,"They could have strapped him down and just gone ahead and taken it, as long as they had appropriate medical procedures."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3108.609,3109.711,That's correct.
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3109.711,3112.247,"And what the State was after was the blood sample, was it not?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3122.869,3124.971,I think that would be a proper assumption.
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3124.971,3129.34,Then I have difficulty understanding how you can argue there is any compelled refusal.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3129.34,3143.099,"It is compelled, the testimonial... as I indicated, it is not compelled refusal, it is compelled communicative or testimonial response."
1982.81-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3179.955,3181.057,"Counsel, I have a problem."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3191.247,3193.699,As a defense?
1982.81-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3193.699,3195.817,Either side.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3204.507,3205.323,"No, that could be put into evidence."
1982.81-1453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3205.323,3206.24,That's what I thought.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3206.24,3207.542,"Yes, that could be put into evidence."
1982.81-1453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3260.509,3264.395,"Well, counsel, if it isn't compelled, how can it violate the Fifth Amendment?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3264.395,3267.497,It is my position it is compelled.
1982.81-1453,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3274.686,3279.388,"He is not required to take the test and he is not required to answer, is he?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3279.388,3281.257,--That's correct.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3295.349,3301.67,Including standing mute and saying nothing and refusing to submit.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3301.67,3304.455,That's correct.
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3454.837,3457.788,"Well, that is what most cases are about."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3460.657,3471.43,"That's correct, although they have stated here that their main concern is so that there is not any question that the individual was not given the opportunity to take a test--"
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3471.43,3481.052,"But anyone who has tried one of those cases knows that if you don't put in the test, the defense lawyer is going to get up and that is going to be his big pitch to the jury: why didn't the state make a test?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3481.052,3490.844,"--I don't feel that it is proper, and I never have... and I have tried a number of these... argued, when the refusal wasn't admitted, argued why wasn't there a refusal."
1982.81-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3496.331,3500.299,"Well, do you think that other defense counsel adhere to your high standards in that regard?"
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3502.484,3506.686,There would be some question amongst other defense counsel as to whether or not I have high standards.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3507.419,3509.805,Your time has expired.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3509.805,3510.84,Thank you.
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3510.84,3512.357,Could I just ask you.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3523.731,3524.881,That's correct.
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.881,3525.683,Did you make the motion?
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3525.683,3526.333,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3526.333,3540.526,"And the further grounds that the procedures utilized by the arresting officer in advising the defendant of his potential rights were violative of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3540.526,3541.859,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3541.859,3550.965,"Now, do you think the trial court's ruling... and you submitted the findings of fact, the proposed findings of fact, and he adopted them, I take it."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3550.965,3551.648,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.648,3552.25,And signed them.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3584.888,3586.505,That would be a constitutional ruling.
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3589.173,3592.542,That's not based on the state statute or the state law.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3592.542,3600.231,"--Well, the failure to advise that the refusal could be used against him was a violation of state law, yes."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3600.231,3604.267,"Well, arguably it could be a violation of the Federal Constitution."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3607.019,3608.035,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3610.404,3613.473,Because this doesn't refer to the statute.
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3625.614,3632.934,"--And I believe on page A-32, then, the actual three items in the order are listed there."
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3632.934,3647.96,"Well, isn't it strange; it really is strange that the state would appeal one ground for excluding the evidence but it would make absolutely no difference in the disposition of the case."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3647.96,3654.681,"The state, I believe, was, of course, interested in the broader--"
1982.81-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3654.681,3660.251,"I know, but it wouldn't make any difference in this case."
1982.81-1453,1,20890,david_r_gienapp,,3660.251,3662.72,"--That's correct, Your Honor, that's my opinion."
1982.81-1453,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3662.72,3664.236,It's very strange.
1982.81-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3664.236,3668.188,Mr. Attorney General?
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3668.188,3671.723,"Well, we respectfully disagree with our colleague here."
1982.81-1453,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3678.996,3679.861,Right.
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3679.861,3694.102,"That says, notwithstanding another provision, such refusal... it says that if someone violates 32-23-10, such refusal is admissible into evidence."
1982.81-1453,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3715.8,3717.984,"Yes, but will this evidence ever be admissible?"
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3717.984,3718.902,"--Yes, it will."
1982.81-1453,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3718.902,3729.175,"Let's assume that we reverse this judgment and say it is quite constitutional to introduce the evidence, at least as far as the Fifth Amendment is concerned, it is constitutional, it is not forbidden."
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3733.996,3749.171,"Very clearly, because then the statute 19-13-28.1 says that the refusal evidence is admissible without regard to relevancy, without regard to what Mr. Gienapp misintends."
1982.81-1453,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3770.919,3776.239,"Well, here is a ruling that the failure to advise him excludes the evidence."
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3776.239,3788.63,"--It is the state's position that should this Court find that this is constitutional, the trial judge does not have the discretion and would subsequently reverse his ruling."
1982.81-1453,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3799.771,3801.89,It is irrelevant.
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3801.89,3802.39,--it is irrelevant.
1982.81-1453,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3815.548,3823.303,"Well, you could always appeal that to the Supreme Court of South Dakota, making it clear that you appeal both points, and perhaps you have."
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3823.303,3827.457,"Well, we think it is clear... it was remanded back on a Miranda issue."
1982.81-1453,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3831.325,3832.192,They remanded it back for voluntariness.
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3832.192,3833.611,Yes.
1982.81-1453,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3833.611,3835.327,"The voluntariness of the ""I'm too drunk"" statement."
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3835.327,3837.479,"Yes, but that goes to relevancy."
1982.81-1453,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3842.015,3843.317,"If it is irrelevant, there was no need to."
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3843.317,3845.133,Why would we go through the trauma of going through--
1982.81-1453,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3845.133,3847.569,"There is no ruling that the ""I'm too drunk"" statement was irrelevant."
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3849.454,3852.323,"--But that only occurred in the response, the refusal."
1982.81-1453,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3857.81,3862.095,"But your Supreme Court drew a distinction between the refusal and the ""I'm too drunk"" statement."
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3865.73,3873.069,"--Because they interpreted this Court's ruling under Schmerber to be it was unconstitutional, just as the trial judge did."
1982.81-1453,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3881.925,3885.127,Clearly it is not admissible in a case where it's totally irrelevant.
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3889.698,3892.816,"--That is perhaps true, Your Honor."
1982.81-1453,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3892.816,3912.111,"But if it went back to the trial court in your state, and the judge enters and makes findings and conclusions in which he just says it is irrelevant, period, then that is subject to review by the higher courts in the State on an abuse of discretion basis, is it not?"
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3912.111,3912.894,That's correct.
1982.81-1453,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3912.894,3917.348,But would we have any authority to review an abuse of discretion issue here?
1982.81-1453,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3917.348,3919.383,"No, I don't... obviously not."
1982.81-1453,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3924.735,3925.537,"Thank you, gentlemen."
