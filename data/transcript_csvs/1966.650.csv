1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,35.59,40.732,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.650,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,224.294,228.933,But in order to be qualified for jury service you have to be a taxpayer?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,228.933,234.685,"Yes, your name comes from -- all jurors come from the tax digest and of necessity, you would have to be a taxpayer."
1966.650,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,234.685,239.206,And the figures you gave us include the tax paying and the taxpayer?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,239.206,240.43,"No sir, they do not."
1966.650,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.608,242.267,Well then that would be the more accurate statistic?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,242.267,245.281,That would be a more accurate statistic of the total number eligible.
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,328.784,333.612,"May I ask, what was the history as to trial jury?"
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,339.833,340.788,"Well, there's a little --"
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,340.788,341.946,Internal cases.
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,341.946,350.186,-- little dispute about that and I can now -- I can give it to you directly from the record.
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,383.314,384.119,Who was that --?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,384.119,391.054,"That is Mr. Twitty who was a senior member of the Bar in Mitchell County, Georgia, a White member of the Bar."
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,391.054,392.493,What page of the record is that?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,392.493,396.508,It's page 9 in the record of the case number 253.
1966.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.702,400.91,Why aren't the two together?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,402.254,403.599,"Yes sir, both cases are here."
1966.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.619,431.819,"This still is not -- it doesn't have the conviction, does it?"
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,431.819,433.19,"Yes, now it does."
1966.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.93,440.58,Is this an appeal -- a direct appeal from a -- or is this a habeas corpus?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,440.58,450.095,"No, this is -- by certiorari, the Supreme Court of Georgia in number 650 and by certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Georgia in number 253."
1966.650,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,450.095,452.907,Is there are respondent's brief in 650?
1966.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.907,457.272,Was there requirements of the conviction?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,457.272,458.605,There was -- yes.
1966.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,458.605,459.683,There's an appeal for the --
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,459.683,463.754,"Yes, yes it is and a death penalty."
1966.650,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,481.041,485.327,So there's just one brief here for the respondent in both cases?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,485.327,497.308,Yes sir and we filed a brief -- we filed a brief for petitioners in both cases but the second brief adopts most of the first brief.
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,549.797,551.886,How many was called on this jury?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,551.886,566.184,"Well sir, on the second jury, 7 of 90, 7.7% of the venire were Negro -- that's a trial jury."
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,566.184,567.469,Seven out of 90?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,567.469,568.195,Yes.
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,568.195,570.387,All stricken?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,570.387,572.834,"As I recall it, none sir."
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,590.398,594.078,What was the size of the venire that the jury was stricken from?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,594.078,595.06,90.
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,595.06,595.513,90.
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,595.513,596.144,Yes sir.
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,596.144,602.191,You say they may not appear on their name -- the name may have appeared on?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,603.319,605.592,48 were put upon the defendant as I understand it.
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,605.592,611.851,"48 was put on the defendant, does this record show how many of them were colored, if any?"
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,611.851,614.675,Three of 48.
1966.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,614.675,615.548,Mr. Morgan.
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,615.548,615.747,Yes sir.
1966.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,615.747,620.365,"This grand jury, was at second indictment, was it?"
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,620.365,621.265,Yet --
1966.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,621.265,623.613,After the Fifth Circuit reversed.
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,623.613,624.259,Yes.
1966.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,624.259,625.498,And then there was new indictment?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,625.498,626.239,Yes sir.
1966.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,626.239,632.556,Now would that by a grand jury drawn from the old grand jury list?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,632.556,635.241,They redid the list along in -- about 1965.
1966.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,638.35,642.843,But another -- the old grand jury list was found to be tainted with it?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,642.843,655.529,"It was found to be tainted but it was used in the selection process according to the testimony that the jury commissioner, it's hazy beyond this but they say that they did have the old list and they went down it first and first, they checked off the names of those who were dead and those who have moved."
1966.650,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,662.332,668.692,So we don't have an issue here then of the second grand jury being drawn from the old tainted list?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,668.692,675.308,"Not directly from the old tainted list, but the old tainted list was used, I believe the record will dispose this [Voice Overlap]"
1966.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.308,679.219,[Voice Overlap] to put it aside for one reason that the list was tainted?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,679.219,681.064,Yes.
1966.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.064,683.927,And then ordered a new indictment --
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,683.927,684.359,Yes sir.
1966.650,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.426,687.844,Yes.
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,687.844,699.263,"Now, under Georgia law, the requirements for petit and grand jury duty are that a man be intelligent and experienced and upright."
1966.650,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.909,759.628,Is by subjective test you mean these have to be outstanding citizens or whatever it is?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,759.628,765.538,"That's right and perhaps the word experience, that's the additional word for grand juror but you don't have -- the amount of the experience would be a problem."
1966.650,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.538,767.384,You have to for a petit jury?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,767.384,771.591,And then you've got the question of experience in what or you know just what does this mean?
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,771.591,776.785,Do you know how many states have this so called subjective tests?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,776.785,786.219,"I'm really not certain, but it is -- we didn't go into that question and make pending of the law so I do not know the answer to that, quite a few in the South."
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,786.219,788.76,Quite a few of the Southern states have that --
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,788.76,788.957,Yes sir.
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,912.391,918.602,"But those racially designations do disappear very quickly in the process, don't they?"
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,936.745,938.213,There's not in this case either.
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,953.317,953.795,I know but --
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,953.795,955.5,"In this sense, they're yellow and white tax returns."
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,955.5,956.836,But here --
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,956.836,958.137,It doesn't exist on the cards.
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,958.137,959.996,What happens here is -- is this correct?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1004.224,1005.291,Yes.
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1005.291,1008.48,That's a stage on which you say the discrimination --
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1008.48,1016.238,"In this case, the only place where you could have discrimination based on the segregation at tax digest would be at the first instance where the names are selected by the jury commissioners."
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1016.238,1025.474,"Now, do we have anything in this record with respect to the number of Negroes and Whites that are in the array?"
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1025.474,1027.652,"Well, we have some varied estimates."
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1050.29,1051.995,That's the total number in the array.
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1051.995,1054.363,Total number in the array but as far as a racial breakdown of the array --
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1054.363,1065.625,"But the only thing this record contains is perhaps below 25% of the total array of Negroes, is that right?"
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1065.625,1067.769,A reasonable or rough estimate of that.
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1069.038,1087.629,"Now suppose that that were the fact, and suppose that the consequence of the taxes in this county were that 25% of the names in the array were the names of Negroes what -- what Negro conclusion would you draw from that?"
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1087.629,1096.904,"Well, I would take the Swain case and draw from that the legal conclusion that the petitioners here made out of prima facie case of systematic exclusion of Negroes from the petit and grand jury."
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1096.904,1099.423,On the basis of 25% figure?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1099.423,1100.788,I suppose to.
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1109.366,1120.026,"Now suppose that the state then says, “Well, alright, we accept that but we are buried by showing that 25% of the names in the array are the names Negroes?”"
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1134.062,1137.062,That's not the question here but I would think so in another case but --
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1137.062,1138.633,Why isn't it a question here?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1138.633,1142.811,"Well, because in the first place the record doesn't disclose that the state didn't come back with any figures of that."
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1142.811,1147.386,The state -- the only evidence on this record is 25%?
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1147.386,1153.459,"No, we don't really think that that's the evidence and certainly under the Fifth Circuit case, the Scott versus Walker, the recent cases."
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1170.441,1186.413,Did you make any effort to obtain more specific or more accurate figures as to the percentage of Negroes who were represented by the array?
1966.650,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1190.46,1192.622,I didn't mean you personally --
1966.650,0,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1192.622,1205.486,I think that Jones might go into that more as to what they went through down in the county and he'll speak right now if that's alright and I'll reserve a little time for rebuttal.
1966.650,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1205.486,1210.59,Mr. Jones.
1966.650,1,45122,walter_jones,,1210.59,1212.914,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1257.908,1261.152,That is the -- your challenge after the remand by the Court of Appeals?
1966.650,1,45122,walter_jones,,1261.152,1262.807,"Yes sir, my challenge after the--"
1966.650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.807,1265.443,You said your first challenge after it was remanded?
1966.650,1,45122,walter_jones,,1265.443,1266.841,"Yes, after it was remanded."
1966.650,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1279.495,1279.988,Okay.
1966.650,1,45122,walter_jones,,1279.988,1303.387,I have never read such a shameful record in my life and the solicitor had is on my right by six jury commissioners appointed by a judge in the State of Georgia.
1966.650,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1486.379,1491.171,Mr. Hand.
1966.650,2,24069,fred_b_hand_jr,,1491.171,1494.624,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.650,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1540.467,1543.072,What did he say?
1966.650,2,24069,fred_b_hand_jr,,1543.072,1549.48,"Your Honor, I do not have a printed copy of your record, this is a transcript of the original trial."
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,2829.033,2831.08,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.650,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2925.708,2932.236,"May I ask Mr. Leverett, why these tax records were segregated?"
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,2932.236,2936.205,I'm coming to that Your Honor.
1966.650,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3124.642,3126.804,So they have to investigate their race?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3126.804,3127.505,Yes sir.
1966.650,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3127.505,3127.65,For what?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3127.65,3145.246,The Fifth Circuit has said that it is incumbent upon jury commissioners to investigate the race of the jurors to be sure that they don't effectuate any discrimination because of their lack of knowledge or familiarity with the total element of the community.
1966.650,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3234.207,3241.258,What's the percentage of Negroes are taxpayers as compared with the White people are taxpayers?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3241.258,3242.624,In this particular county?
1966.650,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3242.624,3243.313,Yeah.
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3243.313,3245.182,Give me the figures.
1966.650,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3252.873,3254.272,What do you mean by that?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3258.586,3260.667,Total taxpayers were Negroes.
1966.650,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3261.174,3264.702,Compared with about 45% of the population?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3264.702,3267.401,That's right sir.
1966.650,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.787,3300.568,[Inaudible]
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3300.568,3301.058,No sir.
1966.650,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3326.676,3330.025,361 F.2d what with Davis and Davis?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3330.025,3339.868,"Davis, Mr. Justice Black is 361 F.2d 770."
1966.650,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3396.635,3411.826,I don't suppose the state takes a position that in the past tax digest were used by the jury commissioners in this county to make sure that there was a goodly number of Negroes on the jury box?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3411.826,3424.833,"Not prior to the Fifth Circuit decision Mr. Justice Fortas because the Courts adjudicated that, there's not much we can say where the court has adjudicated that you're precluded by it."
1966.650,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3635.463,3645.332,How many -- 27% of the population are taxpayers or 27% of the Negroes are taxpayers?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3645.332,3660.687,"27.1% is the actual figure that's on [Voice Overlap] of the total taxpayers in Mitchell County are Negro, but where there is a thousand taxpayers, 271 would be Negro."
1966.650,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3660.687,3665.403,And yet 47% of the population aren't --
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3665.403,3670.096,45% or 42% it's in the brief -- 45%.
1966.650,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3670.096,3672.621,What kind of tax rolls are these?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3672.621,3674.154,These are ad valorem tax rolls.
1966.650,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3674.154,3675.982,Just personal property in the --
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3675.982,3676.888,Both.
1966.650,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3676.888,3682.776,So that if anyone who does not have property is automatically excluded from jury service?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3682.776,3684.073,That is correct sir.
1966.650,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3690.415,3700.946,"Well, what you have, would you say that that -- you would say that Georgia can put on a property qualification for jury service?"
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3700.946,3703.746,The decisions of this Court up to this time have so upheld it.
1966.650,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3713.234,3714.401,They didn't raise it?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3714.401,3715.293,"No sir, it's not."
1966.650,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3716.272,3717.902,[Inaudible]
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3717.902,3718.557,How's that sir?
1966.650,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3718.557,3721.813,[Inaudible]
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3721.813,3724.727,I do not know sir (Inaudible) I read.
1966.650,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3732.233,3767.941,"I just been looking at the transcript, and I'm reading the testimony of your tax receiver and as I read it, I understand that when they changed the system of having white and yellow tags and having both white and colored, use the same colored cards that they then went to the practice of marking a “C” on each one of them for the colored and a “W” on the White."
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3767.941,3773.106,"That was on the digest, I mean on the returns I believe wasn't it Mr. Chief Justice?"
1966.650,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3777.096,3781.617,This is the testimony of Mr. Campbell who is the tax receiver.
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3801.954,3803.923,Return sheets to where they had reference to.
1966.650,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3803.923,3805.926,"Yes, what's that for?"
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3805.926,3808.752,The return sheet -- the jury selection is not made up from there.
1966.650,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3812.933,3815.126,Why do they start of in this manner?
1966.650,3,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,3820.243,3824.716,I suspect this simply as a matter of identification for the tax commissioner.
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3947.997,3956.473,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.650,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4278.469,4285.147,"And your adversary says that 1966, the law was changed."
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4287.438,4290.596,"I think it's mentioned in the brief, but the law itself was not contained in brief."
1966.650,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4291.954,4293.62,Were you reading from law of --
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4293.62,4294.081,Yes sir.
1966.650,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4302.153,4308.466,Is that available in the published report -- statutes of state now?
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4308.466,4311.029,Yes it is.
1966.650,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4511.929,4514.437,"There were how many jury commissioners, six?"
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4514.437,4515.369,"Six, all White."
1966.650,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4515.369,4517.164,And you cross-examine three of them?
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4517.164,4517.629,Three.
1966.650,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4517.629,4525.943,I think the theory was about the – your opposing counsel about the personal acquaintanceship was that these six came from various parts of the county.
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4541.367,4556.074,"I think that that would generally out as the argument not as the fact that the jury commissioners did testify that in their particular areas, they knew folks and they took them and they also testified that their word was pretty much law as to who they would take now or temporary."
1966.650,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4560.232,4561.357,Mr. Morgan.
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4561.357,4563.586,Yes sir.
1966.650,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4563.586,4574.5,Did I understand that someone from the state say that the Fifth Circuit decision held that there should be any inquiry into race?
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4574.5,4583.406,"It was talking about the case of Brooks versus Beto and this is one of the seven cases argued en banc on December the 16, 1965."
1966.650,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4635.936,4640.909,"Well, you think the jury commissioner should have any knowledge about --"
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4640.909,4644.197,"Well sir, I would go about selecting the juries is totally different but we will do it anyway."
1966.650,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4644.562,4645.932,This is the way they select it?
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4645.932,4646.186,Yes.
1966.650,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4646.186,4652.84,Under the Georgia system do you suppose it would be appropriate for them to have some access to information that bears on race?
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4652.84,4659.563,"Well, I think Mr. Justice Black pointed out that it would be difficult in a small county, a rural county of this nature, for them not to have some knowledge anyway."
1966.650,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4666.271,4667.945,[Inaudible] I guess --
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4667.945,4669.393,Do I think that they should have that knowledge?
1966.650,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4669.393,4670.257,Yes.
1966.650,4,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,4670.257,4671.38,Not at the time of selection.
