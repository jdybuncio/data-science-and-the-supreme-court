2003.03-95,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.173,"We'll hear argument now in No. 03-95, the Pennsylvania State Police v. Nancy Drew Suders."
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,11.146,14.822,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-95,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,80.991,96.473,"Mr. Knorr, I'm... I had a hard time, in reading the briefs on this case, figuring out what we ought to do with the suggestion that there's a constructive discharge theory."
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,104.996,105.163,Yes.
2003.03-95,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.163,123.533,"I'm wondering, you know, in... in Ellerth and Faragher, what we said was that when no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to the liability."
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,181.857,192.01,"Justice... Justice O'Connor, if we haven't made this clear, then the Court has my sincerest apologies because that is exactly what we suggest the Court should do."
2003.03-95,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.413,205.385,But... but Justice O'Connor is going a little bit further than that.
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,257.935,268.421,"I'm not sure if it would be tangible action or not, but it would certainly indicate that if the employer didn't respond, that it was in some sense ratifying or approving what it has done."
2003.03-95,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.421,269.247,"I mean, the point is, how can you have a constructive discharge?"
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,281.59,294.51,"That, Justice Scalia, is partly true and it partly is not true because the precise elements of what you need to prove to... to get a constructive discharge vary quite widely from court to court."
2003.03-95,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.743,311.7,"Well, what do you think it ought to be?"
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,311.7,312.776,I think it ought--
2003.03-95,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.776,314.179,"There is a right answer to this, isn't there?"
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,314.179,318.099,"--Well, that's not a question that we've presented or that the court has addressed."
2003.03-95,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,324.126,328.13,Is there... is there... you... you say the... the standards vary.
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,360.248,364.993,--I think that the short answer to that question is yes.
2003.03-95,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,411.932,436.453,"But it was in the Third Circuit because the judge somewhere in that long opinion did say that the evidence that she had complained... that that would be relevant, but not essential evidence to show the reasonableness of her reaction treating this conduct as a discharge."
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,436.453,437.689,I'm not sure the court went that far.
2003.03-95,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,443.883,447.598,I thought... I thought it was stronger than... than that.
2003.03-95,0,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,448.729,450.403,--And it... I'm sorry.
2003.03-95,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,450.403,454.286,--in different places because this opinion tended to say everything at least twice.
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1077.901,1086.157,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1184.322,1190.266,"Well, how do you think we should analyze this particular case in light of the Third Circuit's treatment?"
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1192.578,1206.036,"Well, in this... in this case you might want to... what I was going to go on to say is you might want to initially decide the logically antecedent question of what it takes to... to make out a constructive discharge claim in the first place."
2003.03-95,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1226.841,1245.706,"When you... when you posit that reasonableness requirement, I take it you... you mean to include that the employee must show either that the employee reasonably availed herself or himself of whatever grievance procedure there was or at least had a reasonable basis for not doing so."
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1245.706,1247.275,"That... that's correct, Justice Souter."
2003.03-95,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1247.275,1260.65,"Now, if... if you do that, what is... what is left of the affirmative defense, whether there was... whether there was a supervisor involved or not, because the affirmative... as I understand the affirmative defense, the affirmative defense is inconsistent with that showing?"
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1260.65,1274.396,"Justice Souter, you are right with respect to the constructive discharge claim itself; that is, proving the constructive discharge will necessarily negate the affirmative defense to the constructive discharge claim."
2003.03-95,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1274.934,1275.965,So why don't we stop right there?
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1275.965,1293.138,--Because it doesn't necessarily negate... proving the constructive discharge doesn't necessarily negate the affirmative case... defense to the claim of a hostile work environment that preceded the constructive discharge.
2003.03-95,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1293.138,1307.339,"Yes, but the hostile work environment claim... and if... if we're going to recognize constructive discharge, hostile work environment I... I presume has been subsumed under constructive discharge because constructive discharge says, hostile environment plus something more."
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1318.318,1320.935,Let me try to explain to you how this could come up.
2003.03-95,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1357.578,1375.205,"I understand what you're... I understand what you're saying, but I... I would suppose that if... if the evidence shows that it was... that there was a point at which she could have resolved this or at least a point at which it would have been reasonable to pursue grievances and so on to resolve it, and she didn't do it, that she's going to lose."
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1379.292,1399.521,"The... the way that she would get to the point that I described, Justice Souter, is if you had an escalating kind of harassment and at the last act of harassment, it would have been reasonable that... for the plaintiff to leave at that point... let us say the supervisor does a lot of things, and then on the last act says, if you come back tomorrow, you're dead."
2003.03-95,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1399.521,1400.469,I... I see your point.
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1443.565,1453.308,"Justice Souter, it would be a simpler system, but the... the system we are proposing really is just superimposing on this problem the same structure the Court created in Ellerth and Faragher."
2003.03-95,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1456.735,1457.561,You're saying it's my fault.
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1457.561,1458.304,Well--
2003.03-95,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1469.533,1470.155,But it wasn't--
2003.03-95,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.155,1474.9,"--Mr. Gornstein, could tell us what the Government proposes that we do in this case?"
2003.03-95,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1474.9,1475.288,Yes.
2003.03-95,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.265,1479.237,You... you asked us to remand because why?
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1479.237,1487.903,We would say that you would remand because it is possible that there is a... an official company act that caused the constructive discharge.
2003.03-95,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1487.903,1488.358,To wit.
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1488.358,1497.934,"To wit, the sequence of events leading up to the arrest, and that the arrest might be... we're not saying that it is... but it might be an official company act."
2003.03-95,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.163,1512.135,How... how could the... how could the arrest by an official company act?
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1512.135,1522.166,It could be an official company if it is only the sort of thing... if it depends on a grant of authority from the employer to the supervisor and it's only the sort of thing that a supervisor could do.
2003.03-95,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1522.166,1524.124,But it patently is not so.
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1530.628,1531.371,Justice--
2003.03-95,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1531.371,1537.853,"I mean, it... it seems to me that... that this action you're concerned about is not an employer type of action."
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1540.659,1555.231,"--Justice Scalia, I think it could be that you're right about that, but it also may be that it's the type of action where the... the person was wearing both hats, as a supervisor and as a law enforcement officer, and that it was the... only the sort of thing that a supervisor could have done."
2003.03-95,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1579.547,1597.38,"Suppose that the tangible employment action... say, a demotion or an arrest or a firing... could have been avoided if the employee had been prompt and reasonable in pursuing avenues for relief."
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1597.38,1598.289,In that--
2003.03-95,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1598.289,1601.467,And a reasonable employee in that position would have done that and they didn't do it.
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1604.4,1616.327,"--Then in that situation, there's a constructive discharge, but there's a potential defense to the harassment claim that would depend on whether the constructive discharge is itself a tangible employment action."
2003.03-95,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1652.365,1662.646,"I... I thought the first... the last thing you said I thought is already there in Ellerth, either at least your tangible discharge or it doesn't or does."
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1688.131,1691.186,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2003.03-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1691.186,1691.475,"Briefly, yes."
2003.03-95,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1691.475,1692.096,Yes.
2003.03-95,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.45,1708.648,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,1710.505,1716.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-95,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.868,1869.681,"Well, but that's the whole question that is presented in the... in the question here."
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,1872.587,1894.573,"Well, it's... it's the... to go back to some of the questions that Justice Souter was... Souter was raising, the issue of the... of the constructive discharge, when proven, reaches a point as a practical matter in litigation that the affirmative defense is no longer viable."
2003.03-95,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.378,1916.509,But isn't it the same?
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1916.509,1916.676,Why?
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,1945.987,1952.12,"Your Honor, I believe... Justice Scalia, I believe the... the... you can sue the employer."
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.422,1973.175,"You... you can sue, but you're going to lose unless you show that there was some official action on the part of the employer that... that caused this or... or that the employer didn't have a... a means of remedying it."
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,1973.175,1978.005,"--Well, the case would then become a hostile work environment case."
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1978.005,1978.221,Exactly.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,1978.221,1980.079,There would not be a tangible employment action.
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.988,1990.41,Why?
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2015.501,2016.244,Okay.
2003.03-95,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2032.961,2033.161,Okay.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2063.342,2063.509,Yes.
2003.03-95,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2063.509,2066.315,And that is the element... we're... we're assuming.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2066.315,2066.937,Yes.
2003.03-95,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2066.937,2074.943,That is the element that she either reasonably availed herself of... of the... of grievance mechanisms or was reasonable in not doing so.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2084.686,2085.983,"No, Your--"
2003.03-95,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2085.983,2086.831,--Is that fair to say?
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2086.831,2088.196,--No.
2003.03-95,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2088.196,2089.226,Okay.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2090.547,2093.518,It's... it's putting cart before the horse.
2003.03-95,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2119.237,2119.775,Yes.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2119.775,2152.757,"And... and we're back where the Third Circuit in its... in its opinion underlined if proven, held that if the constructive discharge... if the constructive discharge is proven, the affirmative defense... and even the... the United States admits this... is in all likelihood not a cogent defense at that point, the constructive discharge has been proven."
2003.03-95,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2153.378,2181.364,"Is the availability of avenues of redress and... coupled with a showing that there was no pursuit of those reasonable avenues of redress, is... are those components or facts relevant to determining constructive discharge?"
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2181.364,2184.386,"--Yes, they are relevant in this sense."
2003.03-95,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2184.386,2186.648,Then we're not arguing about very much.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2205.512,2206.999,I respectfully disagree.
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.456,2251.581,"Well, it isn't the responsibility of the employee I'm concerned about."
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2304.587,2307.066,Justice Scalia--
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2307.066,2309.024,He... he has in place the grievance procedures.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2318.212,2321.927,"--Justice Scalia, it begs a multitude of questions."
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.818,2338.478,That's fine.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2359.655,2361.307,"No, Justice Scalia."
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.307,2366.425,"So then... so then it's not true that it's all available to be discussed in the... I mean, what are you saying?"
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2366.425,2367.911,What... what I'm saying--
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2367.911,2369.314,It's either relevant or it's not relevant.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2370.058,2377.943,"--It's relevant and it's probative in the conduct of the case, but it's not dispositive of a... of a constructive discharge being--"
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.943,2379.346,Why is it relevant then?
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2379.346,2380.915,--being a tangible employment action.
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.397,2402.175,There's not an ounce of evidence of any... any... activity by the employer.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2415.383,2428.637,"--As a matter of law, it dispenses with the definition that set this Court on the road to Meritor and Ellerth and Faragher, and that is the definition of an employer in Title VII law."
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.345,2436.81,Threatening her life is an official act by... by his employees.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2436.81,2443.664,--To the extent the... how do we define the employer?
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.778,2447.463,"I mean, I cannot imagine an act that's more ultra vires."
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2451.094,2455.469,"--Justice Scalia, I... I may not... I may not be understanding your point."
2003.03-95,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.792,2490.371,May... may I just interrupt there because I want to get one thing clear in mind?
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2499.642,2500.052,--No.
2003.03-95,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2500.052,2504.76,So your argument would apply whether... if it's just coworkers as well as supervisors.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2504.76,2506.079,No.
2003.03-95,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.86,2534.315,"Well,--"
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2534.315,2535.801,--of the acts of... I'm sorry.
2003.03-95,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.801,2538.856,--Let me just put the... a little easier question for you.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2553.801,2562.55,"It's... it's relevant to the extent of imputing that responsibility to the broader employer, the supervisor in other words."
2003.03-95,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2564.491,2566.886,And if it's... but if it's not such a person--
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.886,2567.092,--But not conclusive.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2567.629,2568.168,--I'm sorry.
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2568.168,2569.032,But not conclusive.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2569.032,2570.973,I think in--
2003.03-95,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.973,2574.233,Just... just one of a whole mishmosh of things that we sort of chuck at the jury.
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2574.233,2584.143,"--Well, I... I think in... as I understand the original question, we're referring to a coworker-induced discharge, let's say, or... or involuntary quitting."
2003.03-95,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.994,2696.357,"Well, I don't follow what you said even in the context of the facts here."
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2743.402,2773.039,"Justice Ginsburg, you are correct in the sense that the facts of the record reflect that the employee, Nancy Suders, went to the... the top dog in the Pennsylvania State Police in the affirmative action and discriminatory area, as a result of education she received on a test... in a seminar taught by that person and because she could not locate an appropriate form."
2003.03-95,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2885.71,2892.503,Are you suggesting that the Third Circuit decided the case the way it did because its sensibilities were offended?
2003.03-95,2,20633,donald_a_bailey,,2892.503,2896.468,"--Legal sensibilities, Justice Rehnquist... Chief Justice Rehnquist."
2003.03-95,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2896.468,2901.419,That's as hard to figure out as constructive discharge.
2003.03-95,3,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,3503.182,3533.275,"If it were really true that to prove a constructive discharge and a central element of that proof would be that the employee either invoked a remedial process or reasonably failed to do so, if that were required as an element of constructive discharge, that would go a very long way toward meeting our concerns in this case."
2003.03-95,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3543.678,3549.584,You... you would find it acceptable that she didn't do it because they threatened to kill her and... right?
2003.03-95,3,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,3557.59,3563.99,"--Justice Scalia, that I wouldn't say is acceptable to us, but that problem--"
2003.03-95,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3563.99,3564.649,You could live with it.
2003.03-95,3,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,3564.649,3565.764,--That problem--
2003.03-95,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3565.764,3567.167,"It's not very logical, though, is it?"
2003.03-95,3,31227,john_george_knorr_iii,,3567.167,3574.021,"--It is a problem that inheres in the Ellerth-Faragher affirmative defense from the beginning, and we have taken that defense as we found it."
2003.03-95,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3578.329,3581.201,"Thank you, Mr. Knorr."
