1965.210,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,17.892,"Number 210, James T. Stevens, Petitioner, versus Charles Marks, Justice of the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York."
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2074.683,2077.837,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.210,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2156.299,2166.447,"Mr. Gressman, if it's given however, it's just as broad is it not, as the statute provided -- as the immunity provided by the statute in the Regan case."
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2166.447,2167.158,It is.
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.181,2231.401,"Mr. Gressman, do you claim though that he has that -- well, under the change, he must claim the privilege and then be ordered to answer."
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2231.548,2232.893,"That's right, this (Voice Overlap) -- the District Attorney --"
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.893,2237.008,And then -- and once he's ordered to answer and he answers --
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2237.008,2239.038,Then the grand jury confers -- says (Voice Overlap) given immunity.
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.038,2242.734,"Well, that in itself is a conferral of immunity."
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2242.734,2244.812,That is not completely clear under the statute but just the --
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.812,2251.344,"Well, can you tell me some case or some provision of the statute which says anything else needs to happen?"
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2251.344,2270.955,"Well, let me go ahead with this brief quotation from the Laino case which goes on to say that briefly summarize the new Section 2447 provides that to obtain complete immunity, a witness including a perspective defendant must one, affirmatively claim his privilege against self-incrimination."
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.467,2282.437,Right.
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2282.437,2282.721,Now --
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.721,2287.445,That's all there is to it and immunity follows from those events.
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2287.445,2287.906,No.
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.032,2296.426,But what the --
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2296.426,2297.391,-- in order to get complete immunity but --
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.391,2298.692,What (Voice Overlap) occurred in the --
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2298.692,2299.367,But --
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.367,2300.24,Is that --
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2300.24,2313.874,"But Your Honor, you see, all of that is premised upon the discretion of the grand jury and the prosecutor to go through those procedural steps which are said to be essential to the conferral of immunity."
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.919,2344.926,"But he was asked a question, he claimed the privilege and he was ordered to answer."
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2344.926,2345.539,"Well, no."
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.84,2350.114,But he (Voice Overlap) -- he was ordered to answer though.
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2350.114,2356.304,You have to invoke -- you have -- the prosecutor has to proceed according to 2447.
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.113,2380.814,There (Voice Overlap) --
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2380.814,2381.667,-- to command him to answer.
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.667,2387.484,-- having the state court said -- held in this case that he really did get immunity?
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2387.484,2388.938,No.
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.835,2405.029,"How about the Appellate Division, they relied on Regan and then one fundamental legs of Regan as you say is that he obtained immunity one way or the other."
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2405.029,2406.919,"Well, I don't believe the -- they expressly --"
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.919,2411.799,And did the Appellate Division decide that in this case?
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2413.617,2414.101,"Well, there -- they don't --"
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.101,2416.645,-- and the Court of Appeals denied their review of it.
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2416.645,2419.052,They don't spell out that he -- the fact as I recall --
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.052,2422.548,And Judge Weinfeld certainly thought Regan was (Voice Overlap) --
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2422.548,2424.792,Yes Your Honor and --
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.792,2425.316,-- cited in this case.
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2425.316,2441.945,"But we feel that the significance given by this Court in the Regan decision itself to the original version of this and the fact that the New York Court of Appeals says, you no longer get by virtue of the statute an automatic immunity."
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.864,2457.704,Yes but (Voice Overlap) the New York courts decided in this case that the events occurred which would have given him immunity since the New York courts thought that Regan was --
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2457.704,2457.939,Well --
1965.210,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.939,2459.269,-- applied and covered this case.
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2459.269,2509.938,"It seems to me that it was not the function of the New York court to declare whether immunity has been established or not here because the procedural steps had not yet occurred and this is precisely the reason why this is constitutionally different because it's not up to the courts to say anymore, the New York state courts to say, you have automatic immunity because you are directed to answer or because you claimed your privilege because it have to go through the precise automatic -- the precise discretionary steps that have been outlined in the new Section 4447 and Section 381 says, “In those circumstances, the grand jury then may infer immunity if it so sees that it in its discretion and not as a matter of automatic immunity attaching by virtue of the statutory command.”"
1965.210,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2509.938,2515.075,We'll recess now.
1965.210,1,22360,eugene_gressman,,2520.837,2529.625,"Concluding my references to the change in the immunity statute, I would like to summarize the change in this sentence."
1965.210,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4131.627,4135.537,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.210,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4172.343,4173.63,"Well, Mr. Uviller --"
1965.210,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4173.63,4173.987,-- invalid.
1965.210,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4173.987,4200.579,"The answer Mr. Gressman just gave me doesn't indicate that what you've said he agrees with that assuming that it was a valid waiver, I thought his whole point was that no matter what kind of immunity they gave him, the course -- and as he phrases it of the loss of job which invokes the waiver in it of itself is sufficiently of course so that at least for the purposes of a criminal prosecution even a criminal contempt that the statute is unconstitutional."
1965.210,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4200.579,4215.686,"As I understand his position Mr. Justice Brennan, it is that the coercion invalidated the waiver and so that the question of whether this -- the New York constitutional provision is unconstitutional really goes to his contention as to the validity of the waiver."
1965.210,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4215.686,4218.317,"Well, perhaps if that that's what he meant, I didn't understand it."
1965.210,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4218.317,4220.813,"As a matter of fact, he has asserted our position from the outset."
1965.210,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4286.549,4288.344,What was the date of that decision?
1965.210,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4288.344,4292.352,"That decision was October 30th, 1964 in this case."
1965.210,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4292.352,4294.46,That was after Laino or whatever that --
1965.210,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4294.46,4295.068,Yes indeed.
1965.210,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4295.068,4296.198,What page is that?
1965.210,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4296.198,4301.489,That was on 210 Mr. Justice Black at 43.
1965.210,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,8415.369,8424.621,"Mr. Chief Justice, I only want to make two brief remarks in connection with the -- these cases."
