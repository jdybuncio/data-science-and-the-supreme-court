1982.81-525,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.904,We will hear arguments next in Bowen against United States Postal Service et al.--
1982.81-525,0,45822,william_b_poff,,78.141,125.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Petitioner in this case urges this Court to hold that the American Postal Workers Union, which has been adjudicated in this case to have violated its duty of fair representation to the appellant, in fact in this case held to have done so maliciously, recklessly, and in callous disregard of his rights, be held responsible to Bowen for that portion of his increased wage loss which occurred while he was seeking the redress in the courts which the union has been found to have been responsible for seeking for him through the process of arbitration."
1982.81-525,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,260.848,266.845,"Mr. Poff, you referred to Justice Stewart's concurring opinion and commented that no one dissented from it."
1982.81-525,0,45822,william_b_poff,,270.437,276.201,"I would assume not, sir, though I would not think it unusual perhaps to find--"
1982.81-525,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,276.201,280.559,"I don't ask you to predict the vagaries of the Court, sir."
1982.81-525,0,45822,william_b_poff,,281.449,294.834,"--I would not think you reticent to do so if you saw fit, but in this instance, at least, I think it is fair to comment at least that that statement was made by Justice Stewart, and I have seen nothing to indicate disagreement with it."
1982.81-525,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.504,505.313,"Mr. Poff, don't you think that if there is any requirement of egregiousness in order to find that a union has breached the duty of fair representation, that many of those will be accompanied by a finding of malice or bad faith?"
1982.81-525,0,45822,william_b_poff,,510.247,515.246,"--You will recall, sir, that in Vaca and Sipes, two tests are really stated."
1982.81-525,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,721.945,724.678,"This was an advisory jury, wasn't it?"
1982.81-525,0,45822,william_b_poff,,724.678,728.255,"--As to the Postal Service, Your Honor, it was an advisory jury."
1982.81-525,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,769.019,781.747,"Mr. Poff, do you really care about the employer's expended liability so long as your client gets paid off?"
1982.81-525,0,45822,william_b_poff,,781.747,791.759,"I suppose that at root we do not, Your Honor, despite our interest perhaps in the law in this area."
1982.81-525,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,844.926,846.737,This is your alternative argument.
1982.81-525,0,45822,william_b_poff,,846.737,848.44,It is... yes.
1982.81-525,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,848.44,849.861,It may be your stronger one.
1982.81-525,0,45822,william_b_poff,,850.517,872.18,"Well, sir, I think that our point with regard to the actions of the Fourth Circuit in belatedly amending its decision to take $30,000 away from us is one that has been adequately briefed, and I do not desire to discuss that at any great length with the Court."
1982.81-525,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,983.698,984.729,Very well.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1003.472,1028.758,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the right of an employer to rely on the union to bring any breach by it to its attention within the context of the grievance process so that the employer can rectify its wrong and prevent the accrual of additional damages is inherent in the collective bargaining system."
1982.81-525,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1081.409,1093.856,"Well, Ms. Etkind, do I gather from your statement that the government views the kind of liability that an employer and a union would incur in this situation as more or less a kind of joint liability for pretty much the same act?"
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1093.856,1094.997,No.
1982.81-525,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.582,1120.94,"Well, why should that be?"
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1149.913,1153.74,--But the union is in a very different position than the attorney.
1982.81-525,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1153.74,1154.069,"Well, why?"
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1154.069,1165.109,"Because the union is part... there is a tripartite relationship among the union and the employer and the employee, and the union itself owes a duty to prevent the continuation of this wrong."
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.962,1191.272,Your suggestion is that the union owes a duty to the employer?
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1191.272,1192.053,"No, no--"
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.053,1194.302,"Well, it sounds like it."
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1203.657,1205.328,--It is... it isn't--
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.328,1206.64,If the employer is at fault.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1206.64,1218.541,"--It is first and foremost a duty to the employee to represent him fairly, and really the question in this case is what damages can the employee collect from the union for its breach of the duty to represent."
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.541,1225.962,"It would be logical in your submission, I take it, that the employer, if it was held liable for all the back wages, would have a claim over against the union."
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1225.962,1232.426,As to those damages that accrue subsequent to what I have been calling the hypothetical reinstatement date?
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.426,1232.77,Yes.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1232.77,1233.551,"Yes, that's right."
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.551,1241.595,Why should the employee not be able to have a judgment against the employer for the entire amount?
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1241.595,1246.031,Because in our view once the decision is made in the grievance--
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.031,1248.967,"Well, let the union and the employer fight it out."
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1248.967,1257.947,"--But the employer really should not be subject to that sort of fighting, because it is acting in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement."
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.335,1264.023,So you think the union does owe a duty to the employer?
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1264.023,1267.803,--To the employer in the sense of cutting off its liability.
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.803,1276.191,A duty that means that such a duty that the union has to pick up the back wages for a period of time.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1276.191,1276.816,"Well, that's right."
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.188,1282.624,Just a duty to pay.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1282.624,1286.623,"--That's what it is going to have to do, we believe."
1982.81-525,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1294.697,1302.508,"Before you leave that, the allocation was based on the fact that there was a shared fault here, was it not?"
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1307.645,1309.099,"--Oh, exactly."
1982.81-525,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1312.128,1313.003,Is that not the case?
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1313.003,1313.816,I'm sorry?
1982.81-525,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1313.816,1315.158,Is there any question about that?
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1315.158,1317.283,"No, no question about that at all."
1982.81-525,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1324.124,1326.17,But the employer remains liable.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1326.17,1326.905,--I'm sorry?
1982.81-525,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1326.905,1331.216,"I say, but the employer remains liable to the employee."
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1331.216,1332.777,But the employer remains liable?
1982.81-525,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1335.511,1336.917,"On your theory, no."
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1336.917,1337.574,Right.
1982.81-525,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1340.681,1345.195,I am just following up on Justice White's inquiry.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1352.911,1354.489,The employer.
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.489,1358.815,"And doesn't join the union, what if the employee just sued the employer?"
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1364.11,1374.856,"Well, no, because he would have to... the union... the employer would have a defense based on his failure to exhaust his remedies against the union."
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.856,1382.367,"Well, he comes back and says, I asked the union and the union breached his duty, and--"
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1382.367,1384.164,He would have to prove that the union breached his duty.
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1384.164,1384.773,"--Well, he proves it."
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1384.773,1392.426,"In that case, the employer should... the employee should be able to collect from the employer up until the point when he would have been reinstated."
1982.81-525,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.426,1397.736,So you say he could never get a judgment against the employer for the entire amount.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1397.736,1407.248,"No, he could not get a... unless, unless it could be shown that the employer cooperated in the union's ongoing breach, but that certainly is not the case here."
1982.81-525,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1407.248,1409.56,Even though the original fault was that of the employer.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1409.56,1410.575,That's right.
1982.81-525,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1411.62,1414.089,You are really speaking of an intervening cause.
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1414.089,1418.041,"--In the language of torts, it would be a superseding cause, I believe."
1982.81-525,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1556.345,1559.483,How many joined Justice Stewart in his observations?
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1559.483,1561.435,Justice Stewart was alone.
1982.81-525,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.412,1639.248,"This is certainly not the prototypical case that the union is going to face if your view prevails, that a guy coming back from Las Vegas and turning down 12 arbitrations in one day, I mean, that is a... I would have liked to argue that case to the jury myself, I think."
1982.81-525,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1642.856,1653.055,"--Well, that is true, but of course this Court is faced with the facts of this case, and with the jury and the district court's findings that here the union acted callously and maliciously."
1982.81-525,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1655.57,1674.297,Mr. Schwartz.
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,1674.297,1703.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I have heard a few remarks here which I would like to reply to, but before I do, I would like to urge upon the Court my original presentation, namely that the only violation upon which the claimant, the grievant rests his claim for back wages is the violation of the employment contract, and the only party that violated that contract was the employer, not the union."
1982.81-525,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.87,1733.241,"In the whole scheme of things, do you think that an employer has no interest in whether a union carries out its obligations to employees who are members of that union?"
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,1733.241,1736.552,"Oh, I think an employer does have an interest, yes, sir."
1982.81-525,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.911,1742.378,"That is the whole scheme of the system of labor relations, is it not?"
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,1742.378,1759.185,"--Yes, sir, and that employer in this particular case and in every case makes a decision to discharge an employee for just cause, and through three steps of the grievance machinery, the employer persists in that decision."
1982.81-525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.989,1903.141,"Counsel, in view of the fact that the employer's breach is a contractual one, do you think a tort doctrine is necessarily applicable?"
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,1903.141,1913.7,"I do in this case, because what we are talking about is a classification of the union's wrong as a tort."
1982.81-525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.129,1938.784,I thought Prosser's example dealt with two tortfeasors and the allocation of liability between them.
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,1941.33,1954.215,"No, the employer breached the contract and caused the damage by that breach, and it is the only party that broke the contract, but I don't think that there should be any distinction in logic between the two situations."
1982.81-525,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.585,1970.662,"Traditionally, your rules of damages under contract law, I think, are quite different than under tort law."
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,1989.311,2001.571,"Well, I do, and I think that as a contract violation, the damages to the employee is that he has been out of a job from the date of his discharge until the date of his reinstatement, and that is caused by the breach of contract, and only by the breach of contract."
1982.81-525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2024.39,2030.466,"Isn't it true that if the union had not breached its duty, those damages would not have accrued?"
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,2030.466,2033.605,"--That's not... I don't know whether that would be true or not, Your Honor."
1982.81-525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.762,2037.386,"Well, isn't that the way the case comes to us?"
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,2037.386,2039.759,--We don't know what an arbitrator would have decided.
1982.81-525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.786,2050.036,"Well, wait a minute."
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,2057.643,2058.19,That's right.
1982.81-525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.19,2061.687,And should we not presume that an arbitrator would have reached the same conclusion?
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,2061.687,2063.875,I don't necessarily agree with that.
1982.81-525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.092,2077.478,"Well, but if the employer breached his contract, and we assume the arbitration process works, the arbitrator surely would have come to the same conclusion."
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,2078.696,2079.212,Well--
1982.81-525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.212,2083.57,"If you assume the other, then maybe nobody should be liable after the date of the arbitration."
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,2083.57,2087.334,"--No, I don't assume that the arbitrator would rule otherwise."
1982.81-525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.002,2106.748,"And if there had been, and if there had been no breach of the duty of fair representation, the damages would have been cut off as of the date of the arbitration."
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,2106.748,2108.138,That's right.
1982.81-525,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2108.138,2112.622,So that both wrongs contributed to the damages post that date.
1982.81-525,2,17018,asher_w_schwartz,,2112.622,2120.212,"Well, the only wrong contributed by the union was the wrong in not presenting the case to arbitration."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3621.0,3623.576,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-525,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3658.281,3660.062,Why would that be dispositive of the case?
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3668.309,3675.883,"--Well, they have taken the position, sir, that they're not responsible at all, not that they're secondarily liable; and I took that to be an admission that they were at least secondarily liable."
1982.81-525,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3675.883,3680.788,"--Well, I suppose they're not responsible at all if recovery can be had from the employer."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3689.722,3706.042,"It seems to me, however, that while it's appealing to think of these cases in terms of simple contract or tort terms that the law of the duty of fair representation is more complex than that and cannot be considered in those terms."
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3735.031,3743.451,"Well, Mr. Poff, according to the union, the union's position was quite inconsistent with the instructions."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3747.464,3748.432,"--It is, yes, sir."
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3748.432,3752.259,And the Court of Appeals agreed with the union that it was not liable.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3767.674,3769.94,"I think it could certainly have remanded it, Your Honor."
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3769.94,3771.688,For a new trial.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3771.688,3772.672,"It could indeed, sir."
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3772.672,3777.78,Because the net effect of its holding was that the instructions were wrong.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3777.78,3779.794,"That is correct, sir."
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3784.09,3784.73,Yes.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3784.73,3787.292,--Submitted to the jury which are part of the appendix in this case.
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3789.618,3789.993,Exactly.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3789.993,3792.789,And it did so pursuant to an instruction of the court.
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3792.789,3797.99,But those instructions then were wholly inconsistent with the view of the Court of Appeals as to the union's liability.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3797.99,3799.209,"That is correct, sir."
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3806.909,3809.033,"Well, there'd have to be a new trial because it was a jury case."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3809.033,3810.033,--That is correct.
1982.81-525,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3810.033,3813.749,"And the stated remedy is still available, is it not?"
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3813.749,3814.796,"I beg your pardon, sir."
1982.81-525,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3814.796,3817.155,That remedy is still available as a result of this case.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3817.155,3819.716,"Yes, I think it would be."
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3819.716,3821.465,I suppose we would have the authority--
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3821.465,3822.465,That's our second point.
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3822.465,3827.712,"--To say that the Court of Appeals was wrong in what it did, that it should have ordered a new trial."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3827.712,3828.978,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-525,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3828.978,3834.617,"Mr. Poff, do you think the union is obliged to go to arbitration?"
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3834.617,3837.896,Do I think it is obliged to go to arbitration?
1982.81-525,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3837.896,3838.614,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3838.614,3844.237,I think that in this case it most... it was held by the trial court and jury to have been obliged.
1982.81-525,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3844.237,3846.612,But it depends on each case.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3846.612,3847.439,"It does indeed, sir."
1982.81-525,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3852.172,3852.39,"Yes, yes."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3852.39,3856.856,And I... in this case it was held that they did have that obligation.
1982.81-525,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3860.183,3861.87,So you don't have to go to the general one at all.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3861.87,3863.542,"--Do not have to go to what, sir?"
1982.81-525,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3863.542,3866.947,"You don't have to go to the general, that in all cases they have to go to arbitration."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3866.947,3867.51,"Oh, no."
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3886.33,3892.14,"Well, it suffers a substantial burden on these cases, I must say."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3896.278,3898.918,"--Well, I would think, sir, that in this--"
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3898.918,3904.79,--Certainly some financial outlays in defending the case and in paying your fees.
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3904.79,3907.18,"--They haven't paid them yet, sir."
1982.81-525,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3909.258,3912.6,"Well, part of the judgment... part of the judgment is that they must pay part of them."
1982.81-525,3,45822,william_b_poff,,3912.6,3913.271,Part of them at least.
1982.81-525,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3947.352,3948.96,"Thank you, gentlemen."
