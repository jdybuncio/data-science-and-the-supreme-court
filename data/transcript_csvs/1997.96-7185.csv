1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.754,"We'll hear argument now in No. 96-7185, Garrit Bates against the United States."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,10.189,14.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.407,150.548,"When you... you say strictly examine, Mr. Oren, are you suggesting some extremely skeptical scrutiny of the language of an indictment?"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,150.548,153.398,"No, not extremely skeptical, Your Honor."
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.651,185.536,So here you're saying all we have to look at is the indictment and nothing more than that?
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,185.536,186.554,"--That's... that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.926,261.702,"Now... now, Mr.... Mr. Oren, the question presented here in the petition for certiorari is whether intent to injure or defraud the government is an element of the offense of knowingly and willingly... willfully misapplying Federal student loan funds, in violation of the statutory section."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,285.985,301.98,"My reasoning for bringing this to the Court's attention is that the... again, the sufficiency of the indictment depends, I believe, on the actual setting forth of the elements of the offense in the indictment."
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.413,305.899,"Yes, but we're... we're not canvassing the indictment for some shortcoming."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,310.952,312.402,"--Yes, all right."
1997.96-7185,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.501,338.869,"Well, there's no agreement on whether it's an element of the offense."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,349.927,351.427,"--No, there is not."
1997.96-7185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,390.402,398.674,"Well, it doesn't say it's... here's the statute, 1097(a)... it doesn't say"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,403.161,409.215,"Well, this does present an issue of statutory construction, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.96-7185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.103,451.809,"Well, he was charged with that... several counts of knowingly and willfully misapplying Federal money, was he not?"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,451.809,452.276,Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,452.276,454.161,That was the language used.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,454.161,455.963,That... that is correct.
1997.96-7185,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.963,481.661,"And your argument, as I understand it, is that ""knowingly and willfully"" somehow incorporates a fraudulent intent, even though the statute otherwise, in describing not merely the... in describing not the... the... the offense of misapplication, but a different kind of offense, of obtaining, refers expressly to fraud as one forbidden means of obtaining property."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,497.623,517.852,"I am using the term ""fraudulent intent"", I believe, as synonymous with or indicative of what would be called specific intent of the common law or illegal purpose."
1997.96-7185,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.158,573.504,"Well, leaving aside whether you are entitled to or not, didn't you get... didn't the Seventh Circuit take the position that the government would have to prove... under the... the concept of ""willfully"", that the government would have to prove that the misapplication was made with an understanding of... of... of... that it violated the law?"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,576.891,583.879,"The Seventh Circuit, in my estimation, issued an opinion which was slightly confusing."
1997.96-7185,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,609.863,626.056,"Yeah, but fraudulent intent, as we normally use the term, is something different from an intent to misuse property with knowledge that the misuse is in fact forbidden by a Federal statute."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,653.04,653.725,Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,653.725,664.847,"And that's something entirely distinct from committing an act, whatever the act may be, with the knowledge that there is a statute that forbids the act."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,674.803,724.319,"I would... I... I guess, rely on the Morissette case, where the... this Court held that a knowing conversion of government property included a criminal intent, which would require the government to show that the defendant, Morissette, had knowledge of all the facts, which would have made his conduct a conversion."
1997.96-7185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.907,748.334,It seems to me that... it seems to me the equivalent of that in the current context would be knowing all the facts that renders the... the action a misapplication.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,752.303,753.405,Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.405,764.194,And... and do you think the... do you think the holding here did not require him to know all of the facts that... that rendered this a misapplication?
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,789.078,796.582,I believe that Morissette speaks to this issue in this way.
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,866.428,873.482,"Well, Mor... Morissette was a statute which didn't contain any requirement of intent, wasn't it?"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,873.482,884.29,"I believe that it stated the modifying term of ""knowing conversion"" in... in the statute."
1997.96-7185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.578,904.536,The words of Morissette are... are these: A knowing conversion requires more than knowledge that the defendant was taking property into his possession.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,941.376,943.161,No.
1997.96-7185,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,964.242,970.161,But the... the Seventh Circuit would give you even more than Justice Scalia just suggested that you were entitled to.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,987.79,997.296,I really do not know how to answer that.
1997.96-7185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1003.717,1021.178,"What do you do with the... the 1097(d), which states, in so many words, that there must be an intent to defraud the United States, with intent to defraud the United States?"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1034.838,1045.811,"I believe that, first of all, they're talking about two separate types of actions in (a) and in... and in (d)."
1997.96-7185,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.467,1081.569,Didn't you win this?
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1104.265,1108.552,"I believe perhaps we did, yes."
1997.96-7185,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1114.456,1108.552,All right.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1175.745,1178.696,Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1178.696,1182.35,"Now, if you're going to tell me this argument is not in the case, I'm prepared to forget it."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1201.912,1202.778,Right.
1997.96-7185,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1253.494,1262.434,"Do you agree that, if all of the facts in the indictment are established, that there was a misapplication?"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1262.434,1263.367,"No, I do not."
1997.96-7185,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1272.556,1282.597,"Well, is... is... is that the problem, then, and... and not the precise formulation of the scienter that's required, since we have ""knowing and willful""?"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1287.065,1298.44,--The indictment does not state any factual allegation of any use of the funds by Mr. Bates.
1997.96-7185,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.392,1303.159,Wait a minute.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1318.02,1318.653,--Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1319.22,1321.388,So it doesn't have to be for his own use.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1321.388,1328.209,--The allegation is not in the indictment that Mr. Bates did anything with the funds.
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1328.209,1335.046,But what are the allegations as to Bates' conduct were sufficient to state an offense?
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1345.671,1365.501,The argument that I have presented consistently from the District Court's opinion was that there were no factual allegations setting forth the elements of the offense.
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.234,1371.738,"You're... you're limited, Mr. Oren, to... to the question presented here."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1382.594,1383.129,--Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.219,1421.186,Well--
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1421.186,1421.921,And--
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1421.921,1427.408,"--But, now, it does allege that he did knowingly and willfully misapply; there's no doubt about that, right?"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1427.408,1429.058,--That's... that's correct.
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1449.321,1451.623,But that... that's not the question you've brought here.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1455.075,1455.491,--Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.491,1459.277,"But we granted certiorari on a particular question, and it's not that one."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1462.645,1462.945,Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.264,1477.404,Would it help if I asked what do you think they should have added... maybe that would... in terms of purpose of fraudulent purpose?
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1518.279,1542.894,"Well, I think, at the very least, that the... the indictment should have stated that it... that the defendant did knowingly and willfully misapply funds, in a certain amount, by converting those funds to his use, with--"
1997.96-7185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1542.894,1543.328,By what?
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1544.294,1552.767,"--By converting those funds to his use, or the use of a third party, with intent to defraud."
1997.96-7185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.527,1571.812,"Well, he knew the charge was... was that he knowingly and willfully misapplied."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1611.889,1632.802,I really did not intend for the... I... fraudulent intent... I did not mean to convey the thought that... that fraudulent intent was specific as against the United States.
1997.96-7185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.521,1639.789,Or to defraud somebody.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1639.789,1640.756,--To defraud someone.
1997.96-7185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.756,1642.175,To defraud... defraud someone.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1671.344,1689.489,I believe my point was that we are not informed of what the factual misuse is.
1997.96-7185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.489,1691.508,"No, now you're back to the pleading question--"
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1691.508,1691.808,Right.
1997.96-7185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.224,1693.874,--that the Chief Justice keeps telling you is not in this case.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1716.889,1722.36,In which paragraph of the indictment?
1997.96-7185,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1722.36,1724.062,In... in paragraph 13.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1724.062,1742.273,"That statement, or allegation, does not say anything about Mr. Bates' conduct."
1997.96-7185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1812.87,1816.572,"Well, it really boils down to what does the word ""misapply"" or ""misapplication"" mean."
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1829.979,1831.164,"--Yes, it does."
1997.96-7185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1831.164,1834.45,You read a lot into it; they read very little into it.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1843.956,1844.539,Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.539,1845.674,Yes.
1997.96-7185,0,19733,c_richard_oren,,1847.624,1848.126,Thank you.
1997.96-7185,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.126,1849.926,"Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you."
1997.96-7185,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1849.926,1862.802,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-7185,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.027,1885.399,"But would you agree with the... with the Circuit that the misuse has to be knowing, that it's an exercise of control or dominion that's a violation of the law?"
1997.96-7185,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1885.399,1887.835,"No... I mean, yes, we disagree."
1997.96-7185,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1905.462,1924.876,"If the term ""misapply"" is not clearly established in the law, then does not that argue in favor of... of interpretation of ""willful and knowingly"" such as the Circuit gave, knowing that is a violation of the law?"
1997.96-7185,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1931.747,1942.837,"The Court said in United States v. Britton, in 1883, that misapplication was not a technical or a word at common law; it was a word created by statute."
1997.96-7185,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1954.027,1958.931,"These funds did not have to be segregated at... at the time of the conduct here, did they?"
1997.96-7185,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1962.233,1963.418,That's correct.
1997.96-7185,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1963.418,1966.203,Could a third-party creditor have levied on them?
1997.96-7185,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1966.203,1970.339,I... I don't know the answer to that.
1997.96-7185,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1972.774,1987.283,"Ms. Blatt, let me... let me just raise the difficulty that I have with... with the government's position that the... the source of the prohibition need not be shown; that the knowledge of specific illegality need not be shown."
1997.96-7185,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2026.508,2029.86,"Well, we think here it means what it means in almost every case."
1997.96-7185,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.62,2046.27,"What... what is ""knowingly"", then?"
1997.96-7185,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2052.373,2053.04,--Sure.
1997.96-7185,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2066.882,2072.036,"Well, you could have a knowing act that is not purposeful, in the sense that the model penal code makes the distinction."
1997.96-7185,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,2075.889,2085.178,"--I... I push you into someone and you knowingly hit that person, but you're not deliberately hitting that person."
