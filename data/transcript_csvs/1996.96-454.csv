1996.96-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,220.636,222.116,"You left out part of the sentence, though, I think, didn't you, Mr. Phillips?"
1996.96-454,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,222.116,222.527,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1996.96-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,222.527,223.809,You left out part of the sentence.
1996.96-454,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,223.809,224.596,That's true.
1996.96-454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,227.41,229.191,"Is it... or of the... or, and of the proposed disposition."
1996.96-454,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,229.191,229.381,--Right.
1996.96-454,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1022.82,1031.445,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1049.778,1057.283,"Mr. Kent, could you... could you explain to me, then, what Judge Easterbrook meant, because you just made this common sense proposition."
1996.96-454,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1075.165,1082.008,"--Well, Judge Easterbrook, in that part of his opinion, in the, what, Hansen case, I believe, was... was thinking--"
1996.96-454,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.008,1083.37,Samson against Alton Bank.
1996.96-454,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1083.37,1084.701,"--Ah, okay."
1996.96-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.39,1131.213,"May I, just before... you're talking about replacement... market value rather than replacement cost?"
1996.96-454,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1131.213,1143.84,--Replacement cost is... is a term that can be used to describe value in the sense that value is what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller to... for the right to use the same property.
1996.96-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1148.823,1151.964,"In your submission, is that the same or different from replacement cost?"
1996.96-454,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1151.964,1160.361,"--Well, replacement cost is normally what a willing buyer would pay a willing--"
1996.96-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.361,1161.671,"You can't answer it yes or no, our favorite thing to lawyers?"
1996.96-454,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1161.671,1163.443,"--Well, I would say it's the same, but I--"
1996.96-454,2,29934,john_j_durkay,,1598.027,1600.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1647.552,1654.485,"But he does run the risk of seeing the collateral depreciate in value very sharply, does he not?"
1996.96-454,2,29934,john_j_durkay,,1654.485,1660.519,The secured creditor can insist that that depreciation never be faster than the amount of payments.
1996.96-454,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3297.713,3300.094,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-454,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.086,3349.348,"Of course, ""proposed use"" doesn't really lead you to ""retail value"" necessarily."
1996.96-454,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3354.571,3364.897,"Well, what... what it leads you to, ultimately... and the value we're looking for and the rule we ask for is what it would cost the debtor to purchase the same property in the open market."
1996.96-454,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3366.119,3369.852,"But why isn't that the same as the fair market value of this truck, as appraised?"
1996.96-454,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3369.852,3371.653,Because the--
1996.96-454,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.653,3372.063,Or is it?
1996.96-454,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3372.985,3373.806,"--Well, it... it is."
1996.96-454,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3378.478,3383.719,--But why is that different from what it can be sold for if you have fair opportunity to offer it in the market?
1996.96-454,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3390.815,3393.717,--Because of the differences of what you can get for it.
1996.96-454,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3396.158,3397.798,But you're saying there are two different markets.
