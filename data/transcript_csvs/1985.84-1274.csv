1985.84-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.442,"We will hear arguments next in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System against Dimension Financial Corporation, et al. Mr. Bradfield, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,66.442,70.488,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.304,233.796,"Mr. Bradfield, in 1966 when Congress was considering adopting the definition, did the Board propose to Congress that, in defining demand deposits, that it include accounts which in actual practice were paid on demand?"
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,237.982,251.68,"That was a suggestion that was made by... The Board took the position, not in practice, but that accounts that were payable by check, the accounts that were payable on demand should be covered by the Act."
1985.84-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.911,286.323,"Yes, but my concern is to determine whether it be the essence of the present Board rule and position was one that was suggested by the Board itself to Congress in 1966 and resulted in the adoption of somewhat formalistic language by the Congress that rejected--"
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,286.323,291.179,--The Board actually proposed the language was deposits payable on demand.
1985.84-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.869,329.32,"--Well, can we say in concluding that Congress did not intend to pick up passbook savings accounts?"
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,329.32,334.365,"Yes, I believe that that is correct, and the legislative history makes that clear."
1985.84-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.365,343.659,"Well, tell me whether you think literally the Board's new definition of a NOW account is broad enough to pick up passbook savings accounts."
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,343.659,347.547,The Board's definition does not pick up savings accounts.
1985.84-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.029,362.745,"Well, does the literal language of the Board's new definition cover... is it broad enough to conceivably cover passbook savings accounts?"
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,362.745,374.318,"--Well, technically it's possible that it might cover that, but the, the specifics of the definition do not cover passbook savings accounts because they're not payable by checks."
1985.84-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.942,437.371,"Well, Mr. Bradfield, if you turn to page 2 of your petition for certiorari, and you probably have this material at hand without turning to it, if you look at the statutory definition in 1841(c), that a bank means any institution which accepts deposits that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand."
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,463.205,467.547,This is because in practice... There are two aspects of that.
1985.84-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,491.787,496.519,"Now, perhaps that's a sensible answer to my question, but I had intended to get at another point."
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,526.74,535.972,"I don't... First, I would like to go back to the Legislative history and point out that Congress was talking about... I don't think they were making that technical distinction."
1985.84-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,566.445,569.021,"Well why, then, did they use the rather technical language"
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,571.379,579.75,--Because they believe that that was the equivalent of the demand deposit language that was already in Board regulations at that time.
1985.84-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,579.75,584.562,"But, yet, they didn't take the Board regulations, they took this much stricter language."
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,584.562,586.311,But they explained that in the legislative history.
1985.84-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.476,722.021,How does... Does a NOW account really differ significantly from the kind of account you just referred to?
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,722.021,727.488,"A NOW account, yes, very significantly differs because it has a transaction capability."
1985.84-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,774.781,805.473,"Mr. Bradfield, if your position... if the Board's position with its new definition of NOW accounts is invalid, do I understand that it would then, it would be required that some industrial loan companies go out and purchase, try to purchase FDIC insurance, which for other technical reasons they would not be able to do?"
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,807.802,829.26,"Justice O'Connor, you make a very excellent point that has been strongly made on the side of the respondents, that the Board's rule somehow upsets basic industry expectations, and I think I'd like to take a minute to refute that, because I think it's just simply not the case."
1985.84-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,861.921,867.87,"Mr. Bradfield, did these institutions change their routine practice of allowing withdrawals on demand?"
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,867.87,872.682,"That's very... that's exactly what I was getting to, Your Honor, that they--"
1985.84-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,872.682,873.274,Did they change their--
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,873.274,877.569,--Their traditional function has been not to offer NOW accounts.
1985.84-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,885.691,889.8,"--If they change the practice, where would you be then?"
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,891.721,894.954,"--Well, that is what Congress was concerned about."
1985.84-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,900.982,903.232,Then it wouldn't be like an ordinary bank anymore.
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,903.232,908.668,--So then it wouldn't be covered by the Bank Holding Company Act and we wouldn't be worried.
1985.84-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.665,1071.82,"Well, certainly other agencies have expressed disagreement with the Board's regulation, have they not?"
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,1071.82,1075.803,There are some who have expressed disagreement.
1985.84-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1112.616,1126.329,"Well, I wasn't taking so much of a poll of all the affected parties as the fact that perhaps other federal agencies who disagree might suggest that your construction of federal law might be mistaken in a way that it wouldn't be if they didn't disagree."
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,1126.329,1128.687,"--I didn't mean a poll, Your Honor, either."
1985.84-1274,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.383,1205.343,"Mr. Bradfield, Justice Rehnquist emphasized the word ""legal right"" in dealing with deposits, and I was also interested in your comments on the second statutory requirement, and particularly the word ""making"", in the business of making commercial loans."
1985.84-1274,0,35452,michael_bradfield,,1212.075,1223.555,"It... the regulation... Let me start by saying that the statute uses a very general term, ""commercial loan""."
1985.84-1274,1,29960,jeffrey_s_davidson,,1566.574,1572.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1853.552,1861.204,"Nonaction, nonaction by the Congress is hardly a very weighty consideration with the Courts."
1985.84-1274,1,29960,jeffrey_s_davidson,,1861.204,1867.967,I'm not suggesting that nonaction by Congress is a mechanism by which to interpret the statutory language.
1985.84-1274,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1908.857,1939.298,"Mr. Davidson, now the Board's new definition of commercial loan seems to boil down, basically, to saying that it covers any extension of credit between two parties where neither is a consumer, and that strikes me as perhaps consistent with the broad general term commercial loan, which Congress did not choose to define very specifically."
1985.84-1274,1,29960,jeffrey_s_davidson,,1939.298,1956.058,"--I think that the important point to think about in terms of the commercial loan language that Congress put into the statute with the 1970 amendment is that the commercial loan language, at that time the term commercial loan, is a phrase of common usage."
1985.84-1274,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1995.228,1999.275,"Well, how about some of these other items that are included in the definition?"
1985.84-1274,1,29960,jeffrey_s_davidson,,1999.275,2019.39,"--The only... the things that the Board has included in the definition of commercial loan which we are challenging is the money market and inter-bank transactions; commercial paper, banker's acceptances, broker car loans, purchase and sale of federal funds, and so forth."
1985.84-1274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.603,2194.072,"Mr. Davidson, can I just ask you one question?"
1985.84-1274,1,29960,jeffrey_s_davidson,,2194.072,2194.461,--Certainly.
1985.84-1274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2194.461,2200.818,Supposing a bank does make a big loan to a manufacturer; a million dollar loan.
1985.84-1274,1,29960,jeffrey_s_davidson,,2209.176,2213.423,Assumes the second one?
1985.84-1274,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.404,2221.575,I realize it's a commercial loan.
1985.84-1274,1,29960,jeffrey_s_davidson,,2225.074,2226.558,"No, I don't believe so."
1985.84-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2309.477,2315.772,Mr. Hawke.
1985.84-1274,2,30689,john_d_hawke_jr,,2315.772,2318.803,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1274,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2898.27,2906.423,You have five minutes remaining.
1985.84-1274,3,35452,michael_bradfield,,2906.423,2908.564,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1274,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3198.789,3199.711,"Thank you, gentlemen."
