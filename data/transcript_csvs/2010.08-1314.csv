2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.987,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-1314, Williamson v. Mazda."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,6.854,9.606,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.08-1314,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,81.468,84.218,Why would -- why would the Federal Government do that?
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,105.631,105.631,Justice Scalia--
2010.08-1314,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,105.631,115.92,"Why does that make any sense, to just say, oh, you know, we -- we don't want the State mucking around in this area, but of course juries can do so?"
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,117.605,127.294,"--Justice Scalia, I think the Court answered the question in Sprietsma when it said common law has an important role to play in providing compensation to victims."
2010.08-1314,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.781,137.166,I don't -- I don't doubt they made it.
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,141.118,142.418,Well--
2010.08-1314,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.418,150.307,"Unless I -- unless lawyers bring suits before -- before juries, maybe."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,150.307,163.817,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I believe common law has an important role to play, not only in compensating victims but also in providing manufacturers with an incentive to develop safer vehicles, even safer than the Federal minimum standards."
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,163.817,177.374,I thought the reason that the Solicitor General gives for not -- that NHTSA did not immediately require the type 2 seatbelt is because the costs would have been higher.
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,179.659,196.419,"Mr. Chief Justice, for the aisle seating position that we are talking about in this case, the reason NHTSA decided not to mandate it immediately was, A, a concern about obstructing the aisleway with the shoulder belt; and B, a concern, yes, about the cost of a possible alternative design."
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,196.419,209.594,"How come allowing -- or why doesn't allowing the relief you seek under State law impose those same costs, contrary to NHTSA's objective in not making those mandatory?"
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,209.594,220.617,"Well, Your Honor, any time NHTSA creates a safety standard it necessarily takes into account costs and benefits and the safety attributes."
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,220.867,222.452,And a State tort action does not?
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,222.452,224.202,--A State tort action does.
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,237.378,238.628,I suppose -- I understand the argument.
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,266.759,274.595,"Well, NHTSA made a decision as of 1989 that the technology -- it obviously had concerns about the technology and costs."
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,299.861,305.515,"Well, every -- there is no objective that the government pursues regardless of cost."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,318.572,330.563,"--Well, I think what the agency did with respect to these seating positions in 1989 is it, A, it recognized that there were tremendous safety benefits for Type 2 lap/shoulder belts."
2010.08-1314,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.659,376.409,Why is that different from Geier?
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,390.168,401.159,"They were, Justice Scalia, but the Court's decision in Geier did not turn on the mere fact that the manufacturers had a choice, and Mazda is not asserting that claim here either."
2010.08-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,420.704,442.7,"But you are saying that once the government gives the manufacturer a choice, then the jury -- the -- the tort system can second-guess it; and that is not consistent with a likely government intent to allow the manufacturers a choice based on the technical advances to that date."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,442.7,448.854,"Justice Kennedy, I don't think that the government gave manufacturers a choice."
2010.08-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.732,472.886,"Well, suppose the government says you have a choice and the State of Iowa passes a law and says you don't have a choice."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,475.754,478.354,"--It depends what the reason for the choice is, Justice Kennedy."
2010.08-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.354,481.289,"No, there's just -- just the statutes as I have given them to you."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,485.693,488.728,Not if it's a -- not if it's just simply creating a minimum standard.
2010.08-1314,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,490.028,494.632,"That's what the statute calls for, minimum."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,494.632,495.449,"Yes, that's--"
2010.08-1314,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,495.449,497.501,That the agency is to set minimum standards.
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,526.151,528.036,"--Exactly correct, Justice Ginsberg."
2010.08-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.209,638.035,"Of course, your theory is, if I understand your case -- correct me if I am wrong -- if GM had installed Type 2, they could have been sued on the theory that Type 1 was better and there would have been no preemption."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,638.035,641.671,"--I think that would be a much more difficult case, Justice Kennedy, but--"
2010.08-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,641.671,643.771,"But under the theory of your case, that suit could go forward."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,643.771,644.421,--That's correct.
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,672.234,678.538,What if the rule here had another provision that said you must have Type 1?
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,681.34,682.29,--Cannot?
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,682.29,684.376,"--You can have Type 2, right?"
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,696.898,698.165,My position would be the same.
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,699.081,712.489,"Well, doesn't the -- doesn't the increased costs that are imposed by the tort liability conflict with NHTSA's determination in my hypothetical that they're not requiring Type 2 because of the cost?"
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,712.489,720.494,"Your Honor, any time the agency considers costs, it is at a particular moment in time."
2010.08-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,739.575,746.312,"Well, then, if the regulation comes out July 1, you say there is a preemption until midnight July 1, but as of July 2 there could be a suit?"
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,746.312,751.181,--I think there was never preemption under this regulation.
2010.08-1314,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,751.181,774.396,"I think what you are saying -- the statute says ""minimal standards"" and the agency says ""no obstacle"", and that's it, that if there is a preemptive force to the -- to the safety standards, that it is for the government administrator to say that."
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,774.396,775.812,"Correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,788.054,790.406,"Well, it said all those thing in Geier, too, didn't it?"
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,790.406,791.806,It did.
2010.08-1314,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.171,820.623,"Your judgment here doesn't apply to the entire Mazda fleet, supposedly, right?"
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,825.36,827.06,"--No, that's not correct, Justice Scalia."
2010.08-1314,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,840.87,842.17,What about the next case?
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,853.125,859.112,"No, Justice Scalia, and that's something that the Court in Geier contemplated and discussed."
2010.08-1314,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,861.295,862.997,Geier came out against you.
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,865.349,868.468,"--It came out -- I don't -- I think Geier fully supports us, Justice Scalia."
2010.08-1314,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,879.006,885.762,Why are we looking to Geier when you have a statute that says common law remedies are safe?
2010.08-1314,0,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,890.314,891.73,"--I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.08-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,930.953,931.722,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,958.372,960.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.08-1314,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1017.744,1020.01,"No -- I agree with you, it doesn't require."
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1046.395,1049.347,"--Well, of course the baseline is that State tort suits can always go forward."
2010.08-1314,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1099.625,1100.459,"Well, it did say that earlier, didn't it?"
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1100.459,1101.893,"--I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor?"
2010.08-1314,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1101.893,1117.236,"Earlier, it said that there was difficulties with -- pre-1989, '82 or '84, that there were difficulties with Type 2 belts and children's safety."
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1123.74,1125.342,"No, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.08-1314,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1127.492,1137.15,So what do you need for the agency to say before Geier comes into effect?
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1148.957,1161.599,"--The contrast between this case and Geier is that this case, like Geier, involves options, but it does not involve a Federal policy that the manufacturer must remain free to choose among those options as it sees fit."
2010.08-1314,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1162.332,1163.415,Mr. Jay -- I'm sorry.
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1163.415,1175.609,--I was going to say in Geier the manufacturer -- the agency concluded that it would disserve safety if automatic seatbelts and airbags were not both on the market.
2010.08-1314,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1179.227,1185.214,Isn't it true that for a period of 10 years the lower courts uniformly held that there wasn't any preemption here?
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1192.801,1194.57,"Two responses, Justice Alito."
2010.08-1314,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1364.055,1371.292,"If the child were injured by a Type 2 belt, would a suit based on that be preempted?"
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1371.292,1377.779,--If the child were injured by the Type 2 belt and the suitwould be on the theory that a Type 1 belt should have beeninstalled?
2010.08-1314,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1377.779,1378.246,Yes.
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1378.246,1381.398,"At the time, no, that lawsuit would not have been preempted."
2010.08-1314,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1524.42,1528.639,"If we adopt your view, would Geier apply to any other regulation?"
2010.08-1314,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1528.639,1533.609,I don't think that Geier is good for that day only.
2010.08-1314,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1569.079,1569.863,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1574.15,1576.5,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1592.278,1593.745,Can I ask you a question?
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1669.843,1679.366,"The typical case where a Federal motor vehicle safety standard establishes only a minimum, like the standard for braking performance or roof structure is not going to be preempted."
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1681.216,1694.791,"How is this different from the hypothetical where the agency said there could be an obstruction with the entry, but manufacturers who can design it without the obstruction should really do it."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1698.41,1713.67,This case is different because the agency specifically recognized in 1984 and 1989 that there were serious safety and practicability tradeoffs between these two different design options and specifically gave manufacturers the option of installing one type of seatbelt or the other.
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1713.67,1720.007,Nothing in the agency that I can find says that the agency really wanted a mix of options.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1727.808,1728.76,I think--
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1728.76,1734.914,"And the agency would simply say, do they want to have this to be a maximum or just the minimum."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1739.033,1740.318,--We are not here--
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1740.318,1753.975,We are forced to deal with the situation we have; and the situation we have in Geier is filled with indications that they really wanted a mix because of the unusual circumstances present there.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1753.975,1755.161,--What the agency--
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1755.161,1756.944,You have to point to something here that shows that.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1756.944,1759.46,--What the agency wanted here was flexibility.
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1767.733,1768.066,But wait a minute.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1780.56,1781.993,--And--
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1781.993,1795.05,"So what's the inducement for a manufacturer to put the light into a sedan or to put a seatbelt 2, when it can, without causing an added safety risk?"
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1797.502,1804.239,"--The agency recognized here that Type 1 seatbelts, the lap-only seatbelts, themselves posed unique safety risks."
2010.08-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1816.13,1817.347,Mr. Garre--
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1817.347,1820.682,The agency preserved that very status quo in 1989.
2010.08-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1823.901,1859.04,"--Mr. Garre, in -- in Geier I think it was Justice Breyer who called attention to the agency having informed the Court that if tort suits were to go on, at -- in -- in contradiction to the government's view that there should be both of these -- that the safety standards that were set there, it would be disturbed."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1899.799,1903.001,We don't think the Court should defer to the agency's position.
2010.08-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1911.021,1913.723,But then the Court -- what was the Court doing in saying that?
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1916.675,1930.332,"--Well, I think what it said, and obviously Justice Breyer can correct me; he wrote the opinion for the Court -- was that it thought the regulatory record was clear enough, but it did ultimately say that it did agree with the agency, although it didn't make a difference to the Court's opinion."
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1930.332,1935.386,"It also said -- it did say as a practical thing, not -- not some theoretical legal thing."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1948.027,1949.146,But if--
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1949.146,1961.037,"So if the government continuously says, this is what the agency means and the agency is telling them, yes, this is what it means, the chances are they will come to a better, correct conclusion than I will with my law clerks--"
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1961.037,1961.42,--And--
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1961.42,1962.32,--because I have a lot to do.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1963.12,1964.155,"--Of course, from--"
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1964.155,1965.055,That's the practical.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1971.825,1975.713,--And from the Wyeth case we know that the Court isn't always going to agree with the agency.
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.021,1991.989,"No, but it did -- we are dealing with 1989 primarily."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1991.989,1992.656,That's right.
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1992.656,2003.463,"And in 1989, I think -- we are at least quoted on the other side -- what the agency said was, well, we see these lap and shoulder belts are actually more effective."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2034.482,2034.832,And--
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.832,2037.116,Now that's -- that's how I read what was said.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2037.116,2040.984,--And I think that's what the SG says and we think that -- that the SG is wrong.
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2060.196,2062.279,But that's always the case when the agency sets a minimum.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2066.932,2067.649,That's--
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2067.649,2075.805,But -- but you are not disagreeing that the statute by its term says that a minimum doesn't preempt State common law.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2075.805,2080.09,--The statute says that and from Geier we know that that doesn't resolve the preemption question.
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2080.09,2085.227,So I'm still not sure why creating an option is any different than the minimum.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2085.227,2092.631,Where the option is designed to create flexibility that serves the statutory safety and practicability objectives--
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2092.631,2094.916,But the default is always that the manufacturers have an option.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2099.701,2100.487,--It's not that.
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2109.675,2110.725,But you haven't explained why.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2110.725,2112.46,The reason why is because--
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2112.46,2128.154,"If the minimum by its own definition gives freedom to the manufacturer to impose more if it chooses, or not, why does the option to tell a manufacturer, pick what you think is safest, why does that do more?"
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2128.154,2141.212,"--Because the agency determined here that the flexibility was necessary to advance Federal safety and practicability objectives, and that that -- those objectives would be frustrated by a Type 2 mandate."
2010.08-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.914,2144.48,But there is no such statement.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2189.175,2191.358,--Not when you have the kind of unique standard here.
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2282.851,2285.802,"But I'm sorry, you still haven't responded to me."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2329.479,2343.889,"--Justice Sotomayor, there are hundreds of Federal motor vehicle safety standards, and I would agree with you for virtually all of them, except you have the rare standards -- and they are rare, like the one in Geier and like the one here -- where the agency quite obviously is doing something much different."
2010.08-1314,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2370.372,2378.145,"How do you tell -- in response to Justice Sotomayor, how do you tell whether the agency is giving options or simply setting a minimum?"
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2378.145,2379.312,"Well, first you would look--"
2010.08-1314,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.312,2381.597,"Because a minimum, of course, always gives you options."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2381.597,2383.597,--In a very generalized sense.
2010.08-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2427.109,2428.659,Was that in 1989?
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2437.934,2446.789,"--There was some question about a movement from tethered to non-tethered, but that only created the compatibility issue that the agency recognized in the 1989 rulemaking and 1984."
2010.08-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2466.417,2467.217,Was that in 1989?
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2467.217,2471.255,"--That was true at the time of 1989, as well as--"
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2471.255,2473.238,But this wasn't the center seat.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2474.457,2479.742,"--It was -- as the plaintiffs called it in their complaint, it was the middle seat in the middle row."
2010.08-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.996,2488.197,"I don't understand that, and I looked for a diagram."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2489.966,2492.334,"--Unfortunately, the diagrams--"
2010.08-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.334,2493.668,--Do you know what the terminology is?
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2493.668,2495.37,"--It's not in the record, Justice Scalia."
2010.08-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2495.37,2496.003,Where is it?
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2496.003,2497.453,You have three rows in the car.
2010.08-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.567,2520.319,The aisle was not between the two seats?
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2520.319,2522.069,"--No, it was on the side of the vehicle."
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2528.223,2529.806,They wrote:
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2558.242,2560.242,If I could make three points in response to that.
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.637,2586.809,Those arguments are what I think Justice Sotomayor was saying: It is a huge problem for manufacturers.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2609.406,2614.043,--We know from Geier that the agency doesn't have to make a formal statement to justify its intent.
2010.08-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2614.043,2614.56,It doesn't have to.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2622.814,2634.037,"I think the record -- we certainly think the record here -- the agency really couldn't have been clearer in saying: We don't want the Type 2 mandate, the lap/shoulder mandate the Petitioners are trying to impose here."
2010.08-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2635.154,2656.151,"If the government doesn't mean what it says the way you do -- we are being told here that far from encouraging Type 1, all along, the government says: Yes, Type 2 is a better seatbelt."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2656.151,2658.153,"--Well, that's just not true."
2010.08-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2669.71,2677.131,"No, they did say that the reason that we are not making it mandatory is because of some cost benefit analysis."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2683.554,2686.387,--And gave the very unique kind of option here.
2010.08-1314,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2719.858,2726.178,"By 1989, hadn't the agency decided that the child safety concerns were no longer applicable?"
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2726.178,2733.784,"--No, and the portion of the notice of proposed rulemaking that's cited refers to the no positive or negative effects."
2010.08-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2846.521,2848.54,"Why didn't they prohibit it, if they were so sure about that?"
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2850.909,2864.483,"Well, because this -- this was something, Justice Scalia, that the agency struggled with for almost a decade until it ultimately adopted the latch system, which resolved the compatibility issue of the lapbelt versus the lap/shoulder belt for installing the child carseat."
2010.08-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2893.867,2899.02,Why shouldn't we allow the juries to take account of those changes over time?
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2899.02,2899.87,--Because it would--
2010.08-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2899.87,2905.007,"I mean, as you say, the agency's rule only spoke of the situation at that time."
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2905.007,2907.773,--This was an area that NHTSA was carefully monitoring.
2010.08-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3030.03,3040.838,"I thought we were told that there was one manufacturer, I think General Motors was mentioned, that was doing this Type 2 belt uniformly?"
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3040.838,3042.254,I think that was later in time.
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3078.177,3079.843,But that is not the issue here.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3087.866,3092.818,--And the agency resolved conclusively that it was not practical in 1989.
2010.08-1314,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3095.97,3100.09,That goes to my point of the light in the sedan versus the van.
2010.08-1314,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3105.059,3121.687,"--It gave them that flexibility, the agency determined in the 1994 chief counsel letter and we hope the Court does read it, makes it clear that the agency concluded that in this situation, and it's a rare situation, the manufacturer was in the best position to decide what was most appropriate for its vehicles."
2010.08-1314,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3174.719,3176.603,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.08-1314,3,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,3181.821,3206.122,"First of all, I would like to clear up the child safety issue and I know Mr. Jay has addressed this to some extent, but let me be perfectly clear, there is absolutely nothing in the '87 to '89 regulatory history that mentions anything about child safety being a consideration in the agency's decision not to mandate Type 2 shoulder belts for aisle and center seating positions."
2010.08-1314,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3238.142,3246.413,"When you talk about safety to children, are you also addressing the strap going across the aisle or the strap interfering with vision?"
2010.08-1314,3,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,3252.817,3258.721,"You are right, Mr. Chief Justice, that was not expressed in any way in terms of a child safety concern."
2010.08-1314,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3300.564,3315.824,"But state tort law doesn't, juries typically don't take into account the fleet costs of avoiding liability, which as I understand from the SG's brief in this case was the reason that Type 2 was not mandated, because of the overall costs."
2010.08-1314,3,35438,martin_n__buchanan,,3327.496,3336.737,"--Mr. Chief Justice, under any state's tort law, I think cost and feasibility would be practical considerations for the jury under the jury instructions given."
