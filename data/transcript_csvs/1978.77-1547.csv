1978.77-1547,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,70.43,We will hear arguments next in Douglas Oil Company against Petrol Stops Northwest.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,75.595,81.79,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,189.841,190.687,Mr. Gillam.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,190.687,190.925,Yes sir.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,190.925,196.704,Was this is a civil or criminal action as you can see that?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,196.704,199.529,This arises out of a civil action.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.529,205.275,I do not mean the Arizona action; I mean these rather odd proceedings that took place over in California.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,205.275,219.578,They come under the heading of the miscellaneous criminal calendar as a matter of nomenclature and are regarded I believe as being ancillary to the Court’s jurisdiction sitting criminally in connection with the grand jury investigation.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.578,226.297,When you get to the Court of Appeals pursuant to what 28 U.S.C. 1292.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,226.297,227.58,"Yes sir, I believe so."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.58,229.317,This is a final decision.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,229.317,233.545,"Yes sir, it is a final decision which gave us the right to appeal."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.545,240.22,"And you – on the basis of federal jurisdiction, the District Court was what?"
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,240.22,253.755,"Basically, the basis of jurisdiction is the federal District Court’s control of what is in fact an arm of the judiciary, the grand jury, and the control which it exercises over that."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.755,262.036,"Oh, but ordinarily you do not have third-party such as your opponents intervening in a criminal case."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,262.036,265.085,"They were not sir, intervening in a criminal case."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.085,266.86,I thought that is what you said.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,266.86,271.686,"No sir, this is ancillary to the criminal proceeding, which it had already been completed."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.975,301.993,"Well, we are not bound I take it by the views of the criminal division of the central division of the District Court of California."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,301.993,303.016,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.897,316.86,"Doesn’t it bother you at all that the basis for federal jurisdiction in the District Court here or how the case got to the Court of Appeals, it’s a very unorthodox thing."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,316.86,321.949,It is not Your Honor as unorthodox as I wish it were.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.963,358.582,Anyone can then come in and ask for the documents.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,358.582,359.441,Yes sir.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.441,366.595,"And if they are turned down or if they are granted, in either case, it’s a final decision."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,366.595,367.132,Yes sir.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,367.132,368.622,Appealable to the Court of Appeal.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,368.622,375.415,Yes sir and historically regarded as such.
1978.77-1547,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,442.915,448.747,"And you said you use the term proper showing, would you define that a little more about it?"
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,448.747,449.364,"Yes sir, that is --"
1978.77-1547,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,449.364,452.681,And talk about particularized need or just what you have in mind?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,452.681,456.518,I have in mind the three requirements that Procter & Gamble set forth.
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.845,539.444,"What do you mean contrary, no need or much more need?"
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,539.444,542.3,"Much more need Your Honor, much more need."
1978.77-1547,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,603.025,620.148,"Most human beings are products of their experience and that even includes federal judges. Isn’t it true that in California, in the state courts in California, grand jury proceedings are not secret and they are pretty readily available to anybody?"
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,620.148,626.059,"Yes sir, it’s a conclusion that the issuance of an indictment of transcript of all of the proceedings is automatically given to counsel for the defendants."
1978.77-1547,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,626.059,627.7,That’s what I saw.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,627.7,629.849,That is nice in some ways and it is not nice in other ways.
1978.77-1547,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,629.849,631.839,And in many events that’s a California practice?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,631.839,632.924,Yes sir and that is the practice in several –
1978.77-1547,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,632.924,634.717,And when the lawyer is used to.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,634.717,635.224,Yes sir.
1978.77-1547,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.224,635.83,Right.
1978.77-1547,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,635.83,642.221,"Mr. Gillam, in this case as I remember is that you do have the transcripts, the defendants have the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,642.221,642.828,That is correct.
1978.77-1547,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.828,645.75,Is the record tell us how they got them?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,645.75,656.296,"No sir, the record does not tell you I believe how they got them, because that did not become an issue in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals."
1978.77-1547,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.563,697.856,Objection made on the ground that the proper remedy was in the other court?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,697.856,700.967,"No sir, objection was not made on that ground."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,707.835,716.849,What we are reviewing here Mr. Gillam of course is the Court of Appeal’s decision which said that District Court’s ruling was not an abusive discussion as I read the last paragraph of it.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,716.849,718.242,Yes sir.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.242,723.949,"Was the District Judge who passed on this motion, the one who had trialed the criminal case?"
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,723.949,724.892,No sir.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.079,743.721,You just have to be a calendar judge or a motion judge for this kind of –
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,743.721,747.569,He was a miscellaneous duty judge during that month and it was assigned to him.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,759.892,767.921,"So, then the Court of Appeals is not entitled, I suppose to rely very heavily on the District Court’s knowledge of the case."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,767.921,775.838,"Yes sir, that’s correct and Judge Gray, whom we respect greatly and think he is one of the finest judges in our district if not the country."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.838,778.1,Former President of the BAR Association.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,778.1,783.624,"Yes sir, and a pleasure to try a case before him always."
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.423,816.467,You are disagreeing with the prosecutor too I guess?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,816.467,820.259,"No sir, the prosecutor is changing the position and disagreeing with me."
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,820.259,825.07,You are disagreeing with the federal antitrust prosecutor.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,825.07,838.129,"In this case Your Honor, unfortunately the government has taken the position that the transcript should be released and I would like if it is appropriate at this time to direct my remarks at that and why in the world is the government take --"
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.129,843.427,"Before you leave the question of which, I think you are telling me which judge is the right one to say these issues."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,857.777,860.228,"Yes sir, I would still say that and --"
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.228,865.727,"So the particular, the question whether Judge Gray knew very much about the case really has nothing to do with the issue for us."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,865.727,879.868,It has very little to do with Your Honor if the Court considers the nature of the antitrust complex litigation and the enormous significance that the trial judge take hold of that litigation.
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.934,965.296,"But in this case, didn’t Judge Gray call up the trail judge and ask him whether he thought (Voice Overlap) go ahead with it?"
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,965.296,973.583,"No sir, Judge Gray offered to call up the trail judge and see if they had any objection to his releasing the transcripts and the documents."
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.77,993.487,Why would not you at that point make the very argument you are making now?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,993.487,995.068,We did make the argument I am making now.
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.068,998.768,You said that he asked you whether you should call a trial judge and you said don’t bother.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,998.768,1005.156,"He said, would you like me to call the trial judge and see if he has any objection to my releasing the documents."
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1006.66,1014.565,"Your answer, what you have been saying very persuasively after now as you very violently wanted the other trial judge to decide it, why would not you tell Judge Gray that?"
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1014.565,1014.746,We did tell –
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.746,1019.085,You are telling Judge Gray would know all the issues about your case so as the trial judge in Arizona.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1019.085,1022.846,We did tell Judge Gray that we wanted the trial judge to decide it.
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1022.846,1022.924,"Oh, I see."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1022.924,1032.561,We did not agree with him that he should call the trial judge to ask the narrow question about that the trial judge had any objection to him releasing the transcripts and the documents.
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.561,1034.116,"Oh, I see."
1978.77-1547,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1034.116,1038.412,Do you have the individual calendar or the master calendar?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1038.412,1041.565,We have an individual calendar in the Central District of California.
1978.77-1547,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1041.565,1043.819,How about the Arizona?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1043.819,1047.16,They also have individual assignments to individual judges.
1978.77-1547,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1053.268,1060.458,"The individual calendar is aimed at having one judge deal with everything relating to the case and no other judge put his hands on it, isn’t it?"
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1060.458,1070.187,"Yes sir, the individual calendar and that is both that way in Arizona and in the Central District of California and I believe in most districts around the country I have practiced in most jurisdictions."
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1090.182,1091.834,"No, I did, yeah."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1091.834,1095.967,And you asked me if we were not in fact opposed to the government here.
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.246,1106.367,"Well, they did not need to file."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1106.367,1107.632,Sir?
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.632,1110.312,They did not need to take this position that they have.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1123.855,1131.194,This is the position they have taken and I do not quarrel with the fact that they have taken it honestly.
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.602,1156.52,"Well, their partners have been in the criminal prosecution business a long time."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1156.52,1159.703,But not representing many defendants Your Honor in this case.
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.703,1161.925,"I know, but they have been calling a lot of witnesses."
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1161.925,1163.648,"Yes sir, they certainly have."
1978.77-1547,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.648,1170.937,And I suppose they would feel the first chill of their -- the first chilly wind on witnesses they would feel.
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1170.937,1173.651,They are feeling that chill.
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1398.987,1402.502,In whose behest did he file it?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1402.502,1419.072,"I can only refer you sir to the language of its first affidavit in which he said he had been contacted by counsel for Petrol Stops and Gas-A-Tron, the respondents herein and had been asked to comment on the competitive impact statement of the government."
1978.77-1547,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1423.119,1426.329,Are you prepared to say it was not filed on your behest?
1978.77-1547,0,35866,max_l_gillam,,1426.329,1430.397,"Oh yes sir, it was certainly not filed at my behest or at our behest."
1978.77-1547,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1434.295,1444.09,Very well Mr. Gillam.
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1449.171,1452.846,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.355,1502.487,Why did not you make a motion for production in the civil action?
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1502.487,1508.925,We filed Your Honor a Rule 34 request in the civil action for these materials.
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1543.048,1545.807,You say you did a Rule 34 motion.
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1550.312,1567.345,"We do and I think Your Honor in light of your other questions as I read Rule 6(e), Rule 6(e) expressly gives a quote in which a criminal action has been filed, the authority to entertain a petition for grand jury transcripts."
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.345,1570.074,"Which sentence of Rule (e), is it?"
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1570.074,1571.716,"Your Honor, it would --"
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1571.716,1580.535,"If I read it, it is just a rule is a 6(e) is a negative, it’s a prohibition that says it shall not be released unless."
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1580.535,1582.386,I do not think that is true Your Honor.
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.752,1633.323,What happened to your Rule 34 motion in the Arizona court?
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1633.323,1650.686,The Rule 34 motion they filed an objection Your Honor and we did not proceed under Rule 37 because we believe and there was again good authority for our belief that the court in Arizona could not grant that motion since it involve the secrecy of grand jury transcripts.
1978.77-1547,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.686,1653.545,You mean the transcripts already in possession of the defendant?
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1653.545,1657.472,Yes and let me say why I believe that Mr. Justice.
1978.77-1547,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.472,1665.543,"Well, certainly would not reach documents that they had, that they had given to the grand jury, those would not be submitted to the grand jury secrecy, will they?"
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1665.543,1671.679,"Well, there is certainly a question whether the documents produced to grand jury are grand jury materials Your Honor."
1978.77-1547,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.679,1677.053,You mean all that defendant has to do to make secret documents is to given to a grand jury?
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1677.053,1681.693,"No Your Honor, that’s not our position but our position was in our 6(e) petition."
1978.77-1547,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.732,1691.145,I know you did but your Rule 34 did talk out from the defendants.
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1691.145,1693.573,It did Your Honor.
1978.77-1547,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1693.573,1695.546,"Well, why were those producible?"
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1699.13,1708.693,"Your Honor, I think the answer is we never called on a Rule 37 motion to enforce our Rule 34 demand in the civil action."
1978.77-1547,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1708.693,1710.133,"In other words, you did not press it."
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1710.133,1715.152,"We did not press it in the Arizona courts, we pressed it where we thought it was proper to press it, in the California courts."
1978.77-1547,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1715.152,1725.368,Suppose you had and the court had the rule against you on the grounds of these documents completely irrelevant to anything he can imagine would arise in this case.
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1732.851,1746.499,It is hard for me to imagine that a California court faced with that kind of ruling would have granted the motion but I do not think in fact that there was even a close question with regard to the relevancy of these documents Your Honor.
1978.77-1547,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.598,1775.453,What if you do not want in the -- who pays for the copies of the documents?
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1781.657,1782.541,He did Your Honor.
1978.77-1547,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1782.541,1791.131,"And what relief you would have got when the documents just been turned over to you, would you have had to copy them?"
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1791.131,1803.969,We would have had – we were granted the right to make one copy Your Honor and we were got those documents under protective order that only permitted their use or purposes of impeachment and refreshing recollection.
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.378,1842.176,Was there any realistic chance that Judge Gray was going to interview the government employees who testified in that grand jury proceeding that he had nothing to do with.
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1842.176,1846.739,He certainly was Your Honor and they were in the room at the time the petition was argued.
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.739,1848.803,Then he could have been have questions?
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1848.803,1867.122,"Certainly, I mean the petition was addressed to the government, they filed a response saying that they had felt there have been a sufficient showing of particularized need and that they had no objection to the petition being granted but they were in the court room on the day the petition was argued and made their appearance, so he had access to --"
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.122,1870.287,"The employees, the witnesses were or the --"
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1870.287,1872.042,"Excuse me, I mean this."
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1872.042,1875.212,I thought you said the employees or I take it now you meant the attorneys.
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1875.212,1875.977,The prosecutors.
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1875.977,1877.075,Yeah.
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,1888.857,1901.828,"The only two cases, well, let me put it this way, the only cases that were before this court, Pittsburgh Plate, Dennis and Procter & Gamble all involved defendants."
1978.77-1547,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.236,2014.524,Could you explain to me why the restrictions were put on?
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2022.322,2033.661,"The only disclosure, the only doc, transcripts involved were transcripts that were disclosed to the defendants pursuant to Rule 16 which will only relate to their employees or former employees."
1978.77-1547,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.661,2044.288,"And wouldn’t any of those employees state out of court statements be, wouldn’t they ever qualify as admissions of a defendant?"
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2044.288,2049.746,While these were only their statements in terms of the transcripts made to the grand jury.
1978.77-1547,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.746,2055.001,"Only made to the grand jury, but nevertheless they were statements of fact with respect to the conduct of the defendant."
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2055.001,2058.224,"Under Rule 801 Your Honor, there would be admissions under the federal rules of evidence."
1978.77-1547,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.224,2065.404,"Why would they restrict, why would not they be admissible in your case in chief as an admission of a defendant?"
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2065.404,2072.322,"Well, I think the answer simply is that the court has an extra step to make sure that there was no abuse."
1978.77-1547,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.322,2074.304,Did not you object to that or not?
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2074.304,2075.563,"No Your Honor, we did not."
1978.77-1547,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2090.617,2098.698,"Well, I would have thought they will be much more used to you as a, you know, on unrestricted basis and an admissible in your case in chief."
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2098.698,2100.27,I think I would say this Your Honor.
1978.77-1547,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2106.068,2112.114,"If you have curtailed on your Rule 34 motion, you would have had him on an unrestricted basis, I would suggest."
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2112.114,2117.66,"Your Honor, we have surmised in my part, but I strongly doubt it."
1978.77-1547,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.672,2150.685,"Well, that may be -- as to whom, you can disclose them I would not that may be so but you should have put through them too in the trials in other matter."
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2152.774,2159.397,"We did not object Your Honor, to the restriction that they be used only for the purposes of impeachment or refreshing recollection."
1978.77-1547,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2194.228,2202.397,"Well, what make sure that a private plaintiffs should get any sort of benefit out of a plea that ends in a nolo, out of a government case ends in a nolo plea?"
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2202.397,2207.998,"Well, I think what we should get Your Honor is I think that we should get the benefit of truthful and accurate testimony."
1978.77-1547,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.788,2245.72,"Isn’t it true Mr. Berman that the Clayton Act provides that if the plea of nolos entered by the defendants that protects them from the risk of the judgment being, prima facie evidence against them, and does not that indicate some expression of confessional policy to encourage defendants to plead nolo so that the government litigation won’t be useful against them."
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2245.72,2250.986,"I think Your Honor, of course what you actually summarized the Clayton Act, I don’t dispute that."
1978.77-1547,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2281.368,2287.433,But would you concede that the disclosure may have the tendency to discourage nolo pleas?
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2287.433,2288.633,"No, I would not Your Honor."
1978.77-1547,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.633,2289.554,Not.
1978.77-1547,1,20606,daniel_l_berman,,2289.554,2290.285,I do not.
1978.77-1547,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.243,2340.609,Mrs. Beale?
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2340.609,2343.379,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.162,2469.656,When we certainly have to reach the question of whether a separate civil action can be commenced in California by treble-damage plaintiffs.
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2469.656,2479.288,"Well, I think perhaps these facts here do not present a more general issue for reason that unfortunately is not discussed in the briefs of the parties."
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2488.51,2491.341,"Mrs. Beale, you are amicus."
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2491.341,2492.352,We are a party.
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2492.352,2493.12,"Are you a party, I am sorry."
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2493.12,2494.332,Yes we are.
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2494.332,2496.286,Go ahead.
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2496.286,2503.266,Two petitioners did not commit them to retain the grand jury transcripts once they had tendered their plea of nolo contendere.
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2556.711,2559.046,What about the documents that they gave to the --
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2559.046,2564.049,The documents as we understand it really are not the focus of the petition at this point.
1978.77-1547,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.435,2570.107,"Well, I will also ask you again, what about the documents?"
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2573.826,2588.398,The documents were within the jurisdiction of the Arizona court and they were not I think subject to the same concerns of grand jury secrecy because they were thought to see what those documents said and not to learn what the grand jury was saying in that.
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2588.398,2594.563,How does the incident to which you refer create federal jurisdiction the California court.
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2594.563,2604.858,"Well, the California Rule 6 provides that as counsel read it that disclosure may be made preliminary to or in connection with judicial proceedings."
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.138,2628.896,You don’t have to get in under 28 U.S.C. 1331 or 13 --
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2628.896,2645.714,"Well, we would view this as a continuation of the criminal proceedings and we have so suggested and that is one reason that we believe petitioners who are the defendants in that case are properly parties although there was no official order permitting them to intervene here."
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2657.991,2662.857,At the request of a party who was in no way a party to the criminal action.
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2662.857,2678.337,"Well, it was not until it came before the court and filed a petition requesting disclosure which we would think is authorized by Rule 6 and Rule 6 seems in our view to clearly permit that."
1978.77-1547,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2678.337,2688.271,"But it is clear that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not add to in order to attract from federal jurisdiction, do they?"
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2688.271,2691.507,"Well, I do not know that I would want to make such a broad statement."
1978.77-1547,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2708.27,2717.587,"People who have requested this grand jury material were not parties to the criminal case, were they?"
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2717.587,2720.183,"They were not parties to the original criminal case, that’s correct."
1978.77-1547,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2785.192,2802.277,"Isn’t there an intermediate position though, even if you are quite correct that the Arizona court could not really affect the release of the grand jury minutes without the cooperation of the California court."
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2816.932,2830.052,"Well, I think in a proper case that would be possible either for the criminal court to conclude that the reasons of secrecy might permit disclosure but that it cannot evaluate particularized need and refer the matter over to the civil court or I will turn it to the civil court --"
1978.77-1547,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2830.052,2841.143,Because the criminal court might order the release of documents that were submitted to the grand jury that the court in Arizona would never have order turned over.
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2841.143,2842.205,I think that’s right.
1978.77-1547,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2850.173,2862.018,"That's what I am suggesting, why should not it be the general rule that the California court or the criminal court defer, just lift the secrecy order to the extent that --"
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2862.018,2886.481,"Well, we do think that it is very important that the court that has familiarity with the records in the criminal case with the particular concerns, the court in which the local prosecutors have appeared and the only single court, which could resolve all of these matters should in the first instance and must ultimately in every instance be consulted and give its approval for disclosure."
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2886.554,2906.321,"Well Mrs. Beale, you are talking about a court which has probably 20 judges and a motion which comes up simply on the motion docket and so you cannot mean that the judge who passes on this motion is going to have intimate familiarity with the past history of criminal case."
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,2906.321,2924.209,"Well, I think that is quite right, in particular cases that will vary how much familiarity the individual judge has but one of the concerns that we have is how easy will it be for the court to determine what the most important considerations in favor of secrecy or continued secrecy are."
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3012.532,3027.263,"But under your theory of the case, the treble-damages plaintiff come in twenty years after the nolo plea was entered and the criminal case was entered – criminal case was ended and ask for these things."
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3038.365,3057.084,"Well, I think then we have to determine what proceeding should be the norm and we don’t disagree that in cases where the criminal court determines that it cannot make by itself a determination and why this sufficient showing of need has been made that it might refer the matter over to the civil court."
1978.77-1547,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3076.223,3085.371,"I know but the government’s position, I take it as that there is not much of a burden on the fellow who asked for it, he merely has to show some kind of relevance to these treble-damage case."
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3085.371,3088.36,"Well, I think that, we do feel that --"
1978.77-1547,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3088.36,3092.764,"I understand your position, that is how particularized need amounts to."
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3092.764,3098.86,"Well, I don’t think that is quite our opposition, although I will say that we think the less --"
1978.77-1547,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3098.86,3101.179,"What else does he need to show, tell me in a few words?"
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3101.179,3106.055,I think that I would say that what was shown here is far more than relevance.
1978.77-1547,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3107.66,3113.167,"That is not what I asked you, I just asked you what your position is, what do you think particularized need is?"
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3113.167,3114.96,I think it is more than simply relevance.
1978.77-1547,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3114.96,3116.171,What else is there?U
1978.77-1547,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3116.171,3117.863,Can’t get it anywhere else?
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3117.863,3118.434,Pardon me.
1978.77-1547,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3118.434,3120.588,That you can’t get it anywhere else.
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3120.588,3125.41,"Well, I think if it is relevant and you can’t get it anywhere else, that is certainly particularized need but whether --"
1978.77-1547,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3125.41,3128.196,Now we want to pursue the answer to the question.
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3134.498,3137.637,"Well, I think it is difficult to formulate."
1978.77-1547,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.112,3149.143,"So you haven’t really formulated your own standard for this, isn’t that?"
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3149.143,3152.331,I don’t know that we can formulate it anymore clearly than it.
1978.77-1547,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3164.703,3177.753,"Well, as I read your brief, that has been the -- that particularized need in the context of a treble-damage suit by a plaintiff who wants the grand jury minutes; it is enough to show relevance."
1978.77-1547,2,40958,sara_s_beale,,3177.753,3185.919,The plaintiffs here and the showing that we found sufficient was the showing that the answers that the defendants had made in different context.
1978.77-1547,3,32037,jistice_marshall,,3208.226,3210.443,And between the two courts.
1978.77-1547,4,40958,sara_s_beale,,3210.443,3211.101,I am sorry.
1978.77-1547,5,32037,jistice_marshall,,3211.101,3213.778,As between the two courts.
1978.77-1547,6,40958,sara_s_beale,,3241.063,3269.705,"Well, we do think that the best place for all the considerations of secrecy to be taken to account is the court where the grand jury sat, where the criminal proceedings if any took place, where the local prosecutors are available, where all of the criminal records are available, all of the criminal records are not available in a civil district and indeed there may be many such civil districts, where materials --"
1978.77-1547,7,32037,jistice_marshall,,3269.705,3285.331,"Well, I don’t know but I am sure that all of the records of the trials in the Southern District in New York are not in that building, because the building is just not that big."
1978.77-1547,8,40958,sara_s_beale,,3305.081,3323.981,"Well, I think that our only answer would have to be or our best answer would be that there is a possibility for those judges to be familiar with the local circumstances, with the parties to have before them the prosecutor and indeed I suppose that one could well first sent from the repository to the Arizona court."
1978.77-1547,9,32037,jistice_marshall,,3328.4,3338.261,"Usually, isn’t the ""prosecute"" of the antitrust case after the nolo, isn't he now back in Washington?"
1978.77-1547,10,40958,sara_s_beale,,3338.261,3340.714,"Well, in fact there is a local office at the --"
1978.77-1547,11,32037,jistice_marshall,,3340.714,3342.21,Is he now here in the Washington?
1978.77-1547,12,40958,sara_s_beale,,3342.21,3348.062,"No sir, there is a local office at the antitrust division in Los Angeles and that was the office that handle this case."
1978.77-1547,13,32037,jistice_marshall,,3356.506,3363.206,But isn’t true that all antitrust cases are under the immediate supervision of the Attorney General of the United States?
1978.77-1547,14,40958,sara_s_beale,,3363.206,3366.329,"Well, I would not disagree with that for a moment."
1978.77-1547,15,32037,jistice_marshall,,3366.329,3368.492,And he is in Washington?
1978.77-1547,16,40958,sara_s_beale,,3368.492,3371.412,"Usually, often."
1978.77-1547,16,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3383.002,3384.985,Mr. Gillam.
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3384.985,3386.115,May it please the court.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.104,3450.291,What is your standard on particularized need?
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3450.291,3455.272,My standard on particularized need sir is that it must be relevant and useful to litigation.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.272,3456.012,Is that it?
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3456.012,3456.506,No sir.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3456.506,3457.001,"No, alrightr."
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3457.001,3458.66,That’s for the first point.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3489.934,3502.461,You would say that in no case would just the plaintiff’s desire to save himself expands the time and trouble of deposing those same witnesses would be enough?
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3502.461,3504.184,"Yes sir, and may I say that’s apart."
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3504.184,3506.159,"Yes sir, you mean, it would never be enough?"
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3506.159,3508.027,It would never be enough.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3523.41,3530.995,"I understand that you would make the plaintiff, you would say the plaintiff must be taking a deposition and find out that he really does need the materials?"
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3530.995,3533.362,That’s highly likely Your Honor.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.162,3584.983,"Mr. Gillam, let me ask you one question just makes just a little difference in some cases and Mr. Beale adverted to, -- is it correct that there was an order outstanding that required you to return the transcripts?"
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3584.983,3585.989,Yes sir.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3585.989,3587.782,And but did you comply to that order?
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3587.782,3593.953,They had not been returned at the time the Rule 34 request was made for production in Arizona.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3602.546,3604.424,"When they will say, no we thought it was very important once the case (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3604.424,3619.691,"No sir, we were embroiled so in the Tunney Act hearing in an attempt to get a consent judgment in the civil companion case, where the charges of cover-up and what have you that I think it just slipped the government’s mind and it slipped ours."
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3619.691,3629.195,"It seems to me it might make a difference if the time (Inaudible) take depositions if the witness has a lapse in memory repeatedly within that particularized need, something like that."
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3640.939,3641.288,Yes sir.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3641.288,3643.258,"But that is not true here now as I understand, you would be --"
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3643.258,3651.018,"Well, it’s not true here now because we don’t know what witnesses are going to be at the time the District Court rule."
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3657.688,3669.398,"I suppose, part of it is, one witness leads to another and the government finds out which people are involved and then they know which witnesses to interrogate and the plaintiff may not know those names when he starts out."
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3669.398,3679.986,Yes sir but please I have not succeeded in at least one aspect of what I am attempting to do today.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3718.515,3723.05,"What you are saying is that part of the transcript would fairly clearly be irrelevant, or partly irrelevant."
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3723.05,3723.907,Yes sir.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3723.907,3725.847,And how do you find out that --
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3725.847,3731.664,The exact way that Judge Newman went about it in Baker versus United State Steel.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3731.664,3733.334,Had the trial judge read the transcript?
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3733.334,3744.379,"No, no, he had the criminal judge sent him -- I am sorry, Judge Newman was the trial judge, sent him the transcript and he went through it and excised those portions which were highly irrelevant."
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3768.644,3777.782,"Mr. Gillam, in this case, you objected any disclosure, did you also alternatively suggested the trial judge that he should edit the transcripts and edit out the material that you would say was prejudicial."
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3777.782,3782.648,"No sir, we have never had an opportunity to discuss this particular thing with the trial judge."
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3783.978,3788.718,I mean the trial judge in San Francisco whoever was in California.
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3788.718,3790.796,"That’s right, the criminal duty judge?"
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3790.796,3792.492,Yeah.
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3792.492,3793.662,No sir.
1978.77-1547,17,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3801.967,3805.791,"Well, it is your submission that that function is for the judge in Arizona."
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3805.791,3809.862,"Yes sir, because he is the one, he has assigned to that case and he knows what’s relevant to it."
1978.77-1547,17,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3813.35,3817.929,"If I can interrupt you Mr. Gillam, this question was asked and you answered it I think, but I did not get the answer."
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3821.406,3824.6,A Rule 34 request is not self-executing.
1978.77-1547,17,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3840.151,3841.544,So you are not going to force that.
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3841.544,3843.455,"Sir, yes, that’s correct."
1978.77-1547,17,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3843.455,3845.369,And so that just --
1978.77-1547,17,35866,max_l_gillam,,3845.369,3846.029,It is sitting there.
1978.77-1547,17,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3846.029,3846.986,Never was result.
1978.77-1547,17,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3846.986,3847.708,Thank you gentlemen.
