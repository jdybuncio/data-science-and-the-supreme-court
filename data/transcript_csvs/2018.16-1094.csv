2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.4,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1094, Republic of Sudan versus Harrison. Mr. Curran."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,8.4,45.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When we're talking about a mailing and a requirement that the mailing be addressed and dispatched to a specified person, we naturally understand that to require that the mailing bear the address of the person and be sent to that address. That plain meaning of 1608(a)(3) is reinforced by other features of the FSIA's service provisions."
2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,70.96,92.84,"I have to say, if -- my first instinct if I wanted to mail something to the head or cabinet member in a foreign country, I would -- that would be my first thought: Why don't I deliver it to the embassy. I mean, the idea of mailing it to the foreign minister in some country and assuming it's going to get there in any reasonable time, I think you're much more -- much more likely to reach them through the embassy."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,92.84,93.24,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,116.76,123.24,Suppose somebody -- suppose somebody sent you a letter addressed to the White & Case office in New York City.
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,126.04,128.08,"It might get to me. Yeah, it -- it should."
2018.16-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,128.08,131.48,Would that not be addressed -- would that not be addressed to you?
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,131.48,141.92,"I -- I don't think it would be addressed and dispatched to me, no. My address is always held out as 701 13th Street, Washington, D.C."
2018.16-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,172.2,176.8,"But it just -- I'm not so sure that the ""addressed and dispatched"" language do the trick for you."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,194.76,198.2,"Under the jurisdiction. Well, Justice Alito, I guess I would draw an analogy."
2018.16-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,216.84,218.4,"Yeah, it might -- it might not be."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,230.32,231.04,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,261.76,297.0,"But, Mr. Curran, I guess I'm wondering, the -- the statutory language does not say ""at his own office."" And -- and in the absence of that kind of language, I suppose this is maybe what the Chief Justice was -- was gesturing towards too, that there seems something special about the embassy situation that's not like one of these Third Circuit situations, that's just everybody understands that embassies are supposed to be the point of contact if you want to do anything with respect to a foreign government."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,297.0,298.4,"Yeah, I -- I -- I don't agree with that."
2018.16-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,329.44,336.88,"What -- what, in fact, happened? Was this notice sent to the foreign minister?"
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,336.88,354.6,"Well, that's a -- it's complicated, right? It was -- it -- it named a former foreign minister, and it said it was being sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it was addressed and dispatched to the Sudanese embassy here in Washington, D.C., on Massachusetts Avenue."
2018.16-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,354.6,363.48,"My -- my question was, did the foreign minister, the addressee, receive this notice?"
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,363.48,368.12,There's nothing in the record that tells us that he did.
2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,368.12,381.28,"You say this was not -- the embassies are not there for the convenience of -- of people wanting to sue or plaintiffs, but they're there for the convenience of the host -- or the country, Sudan in this case, right?"
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,381.28,383.52,And to facilitate diplomatic communications --
2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,383.52,383.64,"Well, I --"
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,383.64,384.32,-- between the countries.
2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,384.32,395.24,"-- I would have thought it would be much more -- I mean, they tell us not -- I would have thought it would be much more convenient for them to get notice that they're going to be sued in the United States at the United States embassy."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,398.32,398.44,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,398.76,403.32,-- much more likely for them to hear about it if you give it to the embassy here.
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,403.32,410.92,"Yeah, I think that the -- the amicus briefs that Your Honor has received, that this Court has received, from foreign states suggest otherwise."
2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,424.8,425.2,Flummoxed?
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,425.2,426.0,Flummoxed.
2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,426.0,426.2,The --
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,426.2,427.56,Flummoxed.
2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,427.56,430.88,And somebody in Khartoum isn't?
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,430.88,435.52,"Someone in Khartoum knows, ah, this is the kind of thing we see from time to time."
2018.16-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,461.0,472.96,"May I ask you the ""address and dispatch"" concept, much of the brief was centered around that being where the minister sits in the capital of the foreign state."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,488.52,489.08,Okay.
2018.16-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,489.08,490.04,-- in a nearby building --
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,490.04,490.2,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,490.2,493.44,-- or in another city within the state.
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,504.04,504.68,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,504.68,505.72,-- for an extended period.
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,505.72,506.56,"Well, I --"
2018.16-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,506.56,517.52,"Is ""address and dispatch"" to his home in the foreign state, to his normal place of business? What -- what -- what's -- how do we define it?"
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,517.52,517.56,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,517.56,519.04,If I'm writing this opinion --
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,519.04,519.36,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,519.36,525.04,-- because I don't actually think you mean to -- to say -- to add a phrase --
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,525.04,526.16,I don't mean to add a phrase.
2018.16-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,526.16,528.4,-- at the foreign state's ministry or something.
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,528.4,533.28,"It's -- it's where -- where -- where the foreign minister has an address, it's got to be sent."
2018.16-1094,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,578.52,582.28,"What's his -- his or her official address, is that it?"
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,582.28,588.36,"I think it should be the official address, but -- but, again, here, it wasn't sent to any address of the foreign minister."
2018.16-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,588.36,607.6,"When this statute was enacted, do you think Congress thought that sending something Return Receipt Requested to Khartoum, for example, was -- was a simple thing? It would be like sending something Return Receipt Requested to, I don't know where, someplace in the United States?"
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,607.6,607.68,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,644.52,646.84,But I'm just asking about the practicalities of this.
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,659.04,659.04,Yes.
2018.16-1094,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,659.2,664.44,-- you send a Return Receipt Requested and -- and it comes back from the far reaches of the world?
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,664.44,668.96,"Yes, but it did require the cooperation of the mail service in the foreign country."
2018.16-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.92,745.48,"And yet, when the question came up to a sister nation, the U.K., they said the Vienna Convention doesn't prohibit --"
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,745.48,748.08,"Yeah, Your Honor's probably referring to the Reyes case."
2018.16-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,748.08,748.44,Yes.
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,748.44,748.56,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.32,819.92,"But, on that, the -- the U.K. decision did -- did speak to the inviolability."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,842.48,843.04,I -- I agree.
2018.16-1094,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,865.08,882.32,"If I could take you back, Mr. Curran, to the text of the statute. I mean, one of the notable things about 1608(a)(4) which is not replicated in 1608(a)(3) is that 1608(a)(4) does specify an address."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,888.48,888.84,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,889.08,894.92,And -- and 1608(a)(3) does not say at his office in the Sudan.
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,894.92,895.56,Correct.
2018.16-1094,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,917.2,928.44,"I guess I don't really quite understand that, because, here, they clearly thought that they had to specify when they wanted to specify, you know, at his office on -- on -- in -- in Washington, D.C."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,928.44,932.12,"Yeah, but they -- they didn't say C Street in Foggy Bottom, right?"
2018.16-1094,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,932.12,933.04,"Well, you know, close enough."
2018.16-1094,0,18627,christopher_m_curran,,933.04,939.4,"So under the plaintiff's -- yeah, but under the plaintiff's theory, oh, if it's not precluded, then any other indirect method of service is okay too."
2018.16-1094,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1095.84,1112.44,"Thank you, Mr. Curran. Ms. Ross."
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1112.44,1124.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start off where Mr. Curran left off, which is how other states understood the Vienna Convention when it was actually enacted."
2018.16-1094,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1163.84,1168.64,"If the -- if the Court were to rule against you on this, how would the interests of the United States be harmed?"
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1168.64,1171.24,"Your Honor, Justice Alito, I'm glad you asked that question."
2018.16-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1194.12,1194.24,What --
2018.16-1094,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1194.24,1196.76,Why -- why is that -- go ahead.
2018.16-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1196.76,1199.64,Why doesn't it? Why doesn't the United States accept it?
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1199.64,1200.24,The United --
2018.16-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1200.24,1201.08,What's the harm?
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1201.08,1207.6,"So the United States doesn't accept it, Your Honor, because it's not consistent with the Vienna Convention and with international law more generally."
2018.16-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1207.6,1212.28,But is there a more particular harm that comes from accepting it at an embassy?
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1212.28,1215.16,"Your Honor, I think there is an administrability harm."
2018.16-1094,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1218.64,1220.36,"I understand that, but I'm more --"
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1220.36,1242.48,"But even moving on from that, I think that the harm is that the United States has embassies all over the world, obviously, and sort of deputizing each of those to accept service on behalf of the United States is quite problematic. It's even more problematic if you accept a standard like the one that my friend suggests at page 34 of their brief, which is that service would be permissible at any place likely to have a direct connection to the foreign ministry."
2018.16-1094,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1258.92,1292.64,"I still don't -- I don't quite understand it in practical terms, although I see your point about the consulates, but say that the United States is sued in -- in Germany, and if process is served on the embassy in Germany, I assume that the embassy there would promptly send it to the State Department in Washington. But I also suspect that the State Department in Washington would send it back to the embassy in Germany to -- because if -- if it was necessary to go into a German court, somebody would have to find attorneys to go into the court to represent the United States in the foreign country."
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1292.64,1296.44,"Justice Alito, I'm not sure that's actually how it would work in practice."
2018.16-1094,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1296.44,1296.64,"Well, okay."
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1297.56,1325.36,"So my understanding, Your Honor, is that the Office of Foreign Litigation actually in Washington, D.C., oversees all of that foreign litigation, and so it makes perfect sense in our system that we would want that to be coming to the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C., if at all, and in that case, under diplomatic note rather than through direct mail service. But I think it's important to note that all of these questions sort of get to this idea that, well, it might make sense for service on an embassy, maybe that will, in fact, reach the foreign minister."
2018.16-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1421.88,1422.48,You say --
2018.16-1094,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1422.48,1422.64,I --
2018.16-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1422.64,1424.0,Go ahead.
2018.16-1094,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1424.0,1439.76,"As I understand it, 1608 is already a lower bar than what the United States itself asks for when it is sued or what other nations ask for when they're sued."
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1452.84,1524.8,"So, Your Honor, two responses to that, one practical, one legal. My practical understanding is that attempted service by mail to the embassies -- to United States embassies abroad happens nearly every day, and so that is actually a very large concern for us as a practical matter, whereas attempted service by mail to the State Department is actually much less frequent, just on the practicalities. As a legal matter, obviously, we think that the United States has a reciprocity interest in having foreign litigants or foreign sovereigns brought into our courts only under the same circumstances that we ask abroad. I don't think that there's a way to -- to read (b)(3) that doesn't permit service by mail to the foreign state, but -- to the foreign ministry in the foreign state, and so I think our reciprocity interests really come in where we think the text is clear under (a)(3) that you can't serve on an embassy, but -- but if, you know, there's any ambiguity there, that's where we think our reciprocity interests should be brought to bear. I would note more generally I think the United States' interests here are not only in reciprocity; they're also in consistency and predictability, which is something that this Court noted in Helmerich is especially important in the context of foreign sovereign immunity because we are bringing foreign sovereigns into our courts."
2018.16-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1524.8,1526.84,But if I could ask you to pause just for a moment.
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1552.2,1555.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think this is an ordinary letter."
2018.16-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1567.36,1568.64,It's not literally them inserting their hand.
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1572.16,1574.48,"Your -- Your Honor, again, I think it's not just a regular letter."
2018.16-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1582.08,1586.8,But why -- why is it any more of an affront if you send it to one place than if you send it to the other?
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1586.8,1597.4,"Well, Justice Kagan, the foreign minister -- or the foreign ministry abroad is not protected by the Vienna Convention, and so there isn't this idea that you have inviolability of those premises."
2018.16-1094,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1606.6,1622.76,Is there a regulation that suggests that the State Department under (a)(4) can -- can serve to the embassy if the foreign state otherwise -- if the foreign state so requests or if otherwise appropriate? So is that also a violation of the Vienna Convention?
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1622.76,1623.8,"It's not, Your Honor."
2018.16-1094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1667.52,1680.12,"But how does -- how does that work, mechanically, the (a)(4)? So there's a quest -- request for the Secretary to send what used to be called a letter rogatory; is that what it is?"
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1680.12,1687.28,"Well, so -- so what would happen in practice, Justice Ginsburg, is that the litigant would ask the State Department to serve abroad."
2018.16-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.2,1716.24,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.16-1094,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1716.24,1717.0,Thank you.
2018.16-1094,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1717.0,1722.24,Mr. Shanmugam.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1722.24,1753.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Sudan seeks to reverse a $300 million judgment in favor of the USS Cole victims based on an unstated procedural requirement. Sudan argues that the Cole victims improperly served their complaint by sending it to the Sudanese Embassy, a component of the foreign ministry, where it was signed for and accepted. The relevant provision of the FSIA does not contain Sudan's requirement that the complaint be sent to the address of the headquarters of the foreign ministry in the foreign state."
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1773.0,1800.4,"I've done a little bit of research on the service of process rules in the 50 states, and in virtually every one of them, in some manner or form, it basically says serve the person or the entity where they live, where they're doing business. Now you would say this is doing business in the embassy."

2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1820.04,1852.08,"And that's not at most embassies, except in the rare visits which are very big state things, so I -- I -- I'm not sure that you can avoid reading ""addressed and dispatched"" as having some sense that this is a place where this person is regularly to be found, not merely where his entity has -- does some transactional business occasionally."
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1852.08,1879.84,"Justice Sotomayor, I take your point about state service rules, but I think that that cuts in our favor and not against us. In our brief at page 23, we cite a number of federal provisions that are to the same effect, that in a wide range of contexts, ranging from FDA notices to the Longshoreman's Act, various federal statutes and rules specify places where documents should be served. They specify residences or businesses or last known addresses."
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1925.08,1928.56,But we can't ignore that it's not the place where the person usually is.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1932.88,1939.36,"But I don't think that you can get that out of the phrase ""addressed and dispatched."" I think that the outer bounds of due process --"
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1939.36,1953.28,"Well, ""addressed and dispatched"" has a very sense of urgency. You're going to send it to the person and not to some far distant place from where that person may be on occasion."
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1953.28,1974.52,"But, Justice Sotomayor, as you are well aware, the outer bound of due process, the familiar Mullane standard, is the notion that it must be reasonably calculated to give notice. And our standard gives effect to that because, as you will be aware from our brief, we think that the phrase ""addressed and dispatched"" requires the service pack to be sent in an expeditious manner."
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1975.16,2015.48,"Isn't it -- isn't it strange to think that we have the Vienna Convention that protects the embassy from a service processor knocking on the door and hand-delivering something, but you can go in by mail and place a burden on the embassy by requiring either that it put it in its diplomatic pouch or hand-deliver it or do something else, do the mailing for you, to the foreign minister? Isn't that the exact kind of burden that the convention was intended to avoid?"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2015.48,2067.0,"I do not think that there is anything strange about the distinction between a process server on the one hand and service by mail on the other. If you take a look at the critical piece of drafting history, the 1958 revised commentary, which really is the definitive commentary of the International Law Committee on the Vienna Convention, in the paragraph on which we rely, the very paragraph, they draw precisely this distinction. And the reason I would submit that they draw this distinction -- and this is also captured in Lord Sumption's opinion for the U.K. Supreme Court in Reyes -- is that there is something relating to dignitary interests about personal service, the notion that some person is going to turn up at the embassy or skulk around at the embassy and wait for someone to arrive so that they can hand them a document. That interferes with the functions of the embassy in a way that a mailing does not."
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2067.0,2067.36,All right.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2255.24,2265.8,"Well, I'm not going to say you're wrong, Justice Breyer, but I will address what I think were really the three parts of your question: first, text; second, policy; and, third, the practice of other countries. So, with regard to the text, as you know, our submission is quite simple."
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2457.4,2481.84,"Well, I didn't talk about retaliation, you see? So now where I am is -- because I -- you'll see what I'm going to say in a second, but -- but I -- I think that -- that, yeah, maybe my purposing was -- I'm not sure how overstated, because I do worry about these small embassies, but text, you can't get me too far."
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2530.16,2532.48,"Well, let me then offer a fourth answer --"
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2532.48,2532.72,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2533.2,2540.68,-- which is that you ought not to be nervous about that because there are things that countries can do in your Botswana hypothetical.
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2577.6,2582.32,But those are all subject to the discretion of the district court.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2587.8,2588.4,But I think --
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2588.4,2628.16,"What happens -- I -- I hate to use a country, but let's assume a country that's more than 24-hour mailing away, and they only have a pouch once a week, it gets to them, they send it back, it's now going to take whatever amount of time to come back, and the judge says no, waiting a month, waiting six weeks is just too much time. That doesn't respect the dignitary expectations of all other states, including this one, the United States, that --"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2628.16,2629.88,"For the record, I'm sure that Justice Breyer --"
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2629.88,2630.44,-- that kind of serve --
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2630.44,2632.68,-- I'm sure Justice Breyer did not intend to malign Botswana.
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2633.8,2633.92,"No, no --"
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2633.92,2637.0,"Moreover, I know a very good lawyer in Botswana, actually. (Laughter.)"
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2637.0,2638.8,And I worked with her for quite a while.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2668.76,2669.6,"I mean, perhaps."
2018.16-1094,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2693.56,2693.96,"Well, on that --"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2693.96,2694.44,"But, Justice Sotomayor --"
2018.16-1094,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2694.44,2725.24,"-- on the routing issue, Mr. Shanmugam, could you tell me exactly what rule you would like us to apply? In your brief, you say it -- it must be sent to a location that is likely to have a direct line of communication to the foreign minister. So would that apply to every consulate? Would it apply to the Number 2 person in the embassy, the Number 3 person in the embassy? They all have a direct line of communication."
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2725.24,2757.04,"I -- I think that the -- the better view is that if it is an official address of the foreign ministry that is likely to have a direct line of communication -- and I think Mr. Curran agrees that it has to be an official address, so a home address or other address would not qualify -- I think that that would satisfy our standard. But I think that if this Court were concerned about that breadth -- and I'll explain in a minute why the Court shouldn't be -- it could draw a line around embassies because embassies certainly perform the full panoply of functions of the foreign ministry."
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2757.04,2758.92,"Well, but, counsel, if we're concerned about the text --"
2018.16-1094,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2758.92,2771.24,"Mr. Shanmugam, can we back up? And this is -- are we -- we talking about a question of personal jurisdiction? What is the basis of subject matter jurisdiction in these suits?"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2771.24,2775.36,So the basis for subject matter jurisdiction is the waiver of immunity.
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2896.12,2905.4,Are you asking us to -- are you suggesting that the U.N. embassy would be a place to effect service under this provision?
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2905.4,2910.8,I think it would satisfy our statutory text -- our statutory text argument.
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2914.56,2915.36,"Well, yes."
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2929.84,2930.04,Well --
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2930.04,2938.8,"I would think consulates, trade offices, tourism offices that are part of the ministry would all be included, I would think, under your interpretation."
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2938.8,2963.32,"Well, I think our textual argument is that at least the verb ""dispatched"" connotes some notion of expeditiousness and promptness, and we're all in agreement about the relevant dictionary definitions. And I think with an embassy, ex-ante, I think it is reasonable to think that it's going to get to the foreign minister because of the direct line of communication and because embassies are directly in communication with foreign ministries all the time."
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2963.32,2966.04,"Well, I'm positing all sorts of different kinds of entities that are also --"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2966.04,2966.4,But I --
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2966.4,2970.64,-- directly in communication with and responsible to ultimately the foreign minister.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2974.6,2982.04,"Well, I think it's just that it is less likely to arrive in an expeditious manner if you send it to a tourist office and the like."
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2992.44,2993.68,A second question if I might.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2993.68,2994.0,Sure.
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2994.0,3029.44,"What do we do about the fourth subsection, which does specify diplomatic means, addressed to the Secretary of State, if you -- if you failed under 3, you go to 4, and 4 says then you send it to the secretary of state here in Washington, the United States Secretary of State, and -- and the Secretary will then use diplomatic means to get it to the appropriate folks. And when Congress speaks so clearly about the question of diplomatic means in one place, we tend to usually think it's excluded elsewhere."
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3032.12,3037.16,"Well, I don't think that that hurts us, and, in fact, I think that (a)(4) helps us in numerous respects."
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3045.84,3046.84,I understand that argument.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3047.8,3048.6,Yes.
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3078.56,3078.92,All right.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3081.16,3081.2,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3087.08,3089.16,We understand that the State Department is large.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3097.72,3098.04,Correct.
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3098.04,3102.04,And there is an express discussion of diplomatic means.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3102.04,3102.48,Correct.
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3102.48,3109.08,And its presence in (4) would suggest its absence in (3) was not accidental under our normal canons of interpretation.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3110.76,3111.4,"Well, it's a --"
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3111.4,3112.8,So what's the -- what's the answer to it?
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3112.8,3117.76,"That's a somewhat different argument, I think, from the arguments that Sudan and the United States have made, and so let me address it directly."
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3117.76,3119.88,Let's -- let's say I disagree with that.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3119.88,3120.12,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3136.28,3140.44,But -- but -- but -- but your reading of (3) is that it has to get to the foreign minister.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3151.12,3164.56,"Well, we are -- I -- I -- I would hesitate to say that we're using diplomatic means other than in the very generic sense, Justice Gorsuch, which is to say that in any form of (a)(3) service, you know, you are going through the foreign ministry."
2018.16-1094,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3177.12,3185.04,"You're counting on (a)(3) that -- that the embassy's going to send it through a diplomatic pouch or otherwise to the foreign ministry, right?"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3185.04,3195.8,"Or some other means. But, again, diplomatic channels, it's a defined term and it refers to communication from one sovereign to the other. You know, that is what diplomatic channels means."
2018.16-1094,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3213.28,3225.0,"As a practical matter, as a practical matter, is that hard to accomplish? In other words, the system going forward, if we were to say you can't do it at embassies, is there a problem going under that mechanism?"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3225.0,3239.92,"Well, you know, the problem is that I don't think it's necessarily certain that you'll be able to attain service. We're certainly hopeful that we will be able to attain service under (a)(4) in the Kumar case, but, again, you know, this Court has to give effect to Congress's judgment."
2018.16-1094,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3239.92,3244.08,Are you aware of any problems trying to effectuate service generally under (a)(4)?
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3244.08,3247.88,"Well, I think it could break down if there is not --"
2018.16-1094,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3247.88,3248.48,"It could, but are --"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3248.48,3250.04,-- if there's not a diplomatic relationship.
2018.16-1094,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3250.04,3250.2,Does it --
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3250.2,3273.2,"I mean, that's the bottom line, right, is that if there is not a diplomatic relationship, there are not going to be diplomatic channels. But I think, tellingly, the regulation for (a)(4) service contemplates the possibility of service of process at the embassy in the United States of the foreign state, which I think belies the notion that this is somehow forbidden by the Vienna Convention."
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3273.2,3280.8,"In your research, did you find a single example, any example of someone tried (a)(4) and they couldn't get it done?"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3280.8,3282.44,I'm not aware of an example.
2018.16-1094,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3299.72,3300.52,But you're saying --
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3300.52,3301.52,I thought it was usual.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3309.2,3309.52,Well --
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3309.52,3310.44,"Unusual, I mean."
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3310.44,3315.36,"-- no, I took your question to be whether I'm aware of any cases of (a)(4) service failing --"
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3315.36,3315.6,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3315.6,3316.8,-- so that a party is completely out of luck.
2018.16-1094,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3316.8,3317.4,That's right.
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3317.4,3326.2,"And I think that if there would be such a case, it would be in a context in which the United States has no diplomatic relations and, therefore, there are no diplomatic channels."
2018.16-1094,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3336.56,3341.68,How many of them have embassies in the United States where there's no diplomatic relations?
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3341.68,3345.76,"Well, I think that that is, you know, to be fair, an -- an unusual situation."
2018.16-1094,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3354.6,3355.24,But the point --
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3355.24,3356.2,"But, of course, our whole point about the inequity --"
2018.16-1094,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3356.2,3386.12,"Counsel, the point -- the point you're making is it's not a big deal to allow service at an embassy, even though the United States objects and even though, as Justice Breyer points out, no other country appears to allow that. And -- and my response in addition to that is, is it really a big deal to, from your perspective going forward, I know about this case, but going forward as a system, to go through the (a)(4) mechanism rather than (a)(3) at -- at an embassy?"
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3386.12,3391.36,"Well, I would flip that around and say that it's not a big deal to permit service on the embassy under (a)(3) --"
2018.16-1094,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3391.36,3391.84,But that --
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3391.84,3396.48,-- precisely because a country can adopt a policy and simply decide not to accept (a)(3) service.
2018.16-1094,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3396.48,3410.64,"But I -- if I were starting afresh like the Chief Justice's first question, I -- I might agree with you, but the United States and all the countries in the Vienna Convention all seem to say, actually, it is a big deal."
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3410.64,3413.56,But I think that there are two separate questions.
2018.16-1094,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3463.0,3476.4,What would be the consequences in this particular case if you had to go back and if we were to rule against you and you succeed in achieving service under (a)(4)? Is there any indication that Sudan would appear?
2018.16-1094,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3476.4,3483.84,"Well, I think that's a question for Mr. Curran, but we would certainly have to start over in this case."
2018.16-1094,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3537.36,3541.28,"Thank you, counsel. You have two minutes remaining, Mr. Curran."
2018.16-1094,3,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3541.28,3549.52,"Justice Alito, Sudan is committed to appearing and defending itself. It believes that the default judgment was ill-founded."
2018.16-1094,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3554.68,3564.68,Is there -- do you want to suggest that the -- the government of Sudan had forgotten about the Cole incident or didn't realize that this litigation was going on?
2018.16-1094,3,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3564.68,3564.76,Well --
2018.16-1094,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3564.76,3567.48,It didn't get notice? It didn't know that this litigation was going on?
2018.16-1094,3,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3567.48,3585.68,"Well, we -- we do have a bona fide concern about the way the service package was sent, right? Page A-75 of the Joint Appendix shows -- is the Postal Service record, and it shows that the package was not actually delivered to the embassy but, in fact --"
2018.16-1094,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3585.68,3586.12,But that's not the --

2018.16-1094,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3586.6,3592.28,"The question is, did Sudan have actual notice? Mr. Shanmugam said a few times --"
2018.16-1094,3,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3592.28,3592.68,Yeah.
2018.16-1094,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3592.68,3593.36,-- it did.
2018.16-1094,3,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3598.52,3605.96,We can't contest that someone at the embassy knew about the case through plaintiff's counsel.
2018.16-1094,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3612.24,3621.96,Did they know about it before the 60-day period for replying and preventing the default judgment passed?
2018.16-1094,3,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3621.96,3624.24,I don't know and there's nothing in the record on that.
2018.16-1094,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3625.92,3630.8,"Well, you know -- you know that they knew as of -- as of when? The process is mailed."
2018.16-1094,3,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3636.44,3636.8,Yes.
2018.16-1094,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3636.8,3643.48,"Now do we know when they really knew about it, before the default or after the default?"
2018.16-1094,3,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3643.48,3670.92,"Yeah, I think it was after the motion for default judgment but before the default judgment itself, okay? That's -- that's my assessment of the record. My -- my colleague, Mr. Shanmugam, advocates a reading of 1608(a)(3) that is broad and unpredictable and leaves too much creativity for plaintiffs and courts."
2018.16-1094,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3670.92,3671.84,"Thank you, counsel."
