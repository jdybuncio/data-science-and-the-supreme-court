1958.276,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.682,"Number 276, Robert C. Herd & Company, Incorporated, Petitioner, versus Krawill Machinery Corporation et al."
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,16.296,19.811,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,270.72,274.638,On the time they loaded it from or from tackle to tackle?
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,274.638,276.9,It didn't say from tackle to tackle.
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,767.863,769.817,(Inaudible)
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,769.817,770.604,Yes.
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1013.185,1022.369,Would you be good enough to spell out a little bit what is meant by “Authorized by the Goods of Carriage by Sea Act” if the bills of lading were authorized?
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1022.369,1022.886,"Well, I'd say it's limited."
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1022.886,1027.186,What's the part -- what is the connection between the --
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1027.186,1027.768,"Well, only to this --"
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1027.768,1034.877,-- the Goods of Carriage by Sea Act and to making out of the particular bill of lading as in this case?
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1034.877,1054.5,"Well, I think the bill -- the Section -- Subdivision (b) of Section 301 says this, “The term contract of carriage applies only to contracts of carriage covered by a bill of Lading or any similar document title insofar as such document relate to the Carriage of Goods by Sea.”"
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1054.5,1058.785,Hence there must be a bill of lading in order to have the Goods of Carriage Act to come up --
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1058.785,1060.284,"Well, it would seem so."
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1101.638,1104.134,The carrier him -- itself.
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1112.949,1115.448,That's right.
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1115.448,1131.486,"And you draw from that the inference that broaden, that is, that the bill of lading is a recognized mode of doing this international trade business."
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1131.486,1132.515,That's true.
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1132.515,1140.22,And that the fellow who carriers what used to be the carrier's function is as it were in loco of the carrier?
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1140.22,1140.796,Yes sir.
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1140.796,1141.488,That's your argument.
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1141.488,1142.724,Yes sir.
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1207.906,1212.632,Well if -- if assuming the unusual situation.
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1230.942,1234.075,"None whatever, either by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act or the limitation --"
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1234.075,1234.548,By the bill of lading.
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1234.548,1237.749,"-- of the bill of lading, none whatever."
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1309.976,1336.859,"Of course, that knowledge with the right be attributed to Congress if -- if I may say so, a double-edged sword because it might well be argued if Congress knew that -- since Congress knew that, why didn't they put things -- put the stevedore in explicitly and why do you have to go about this argumentatively of saying since it is the purpose of the Jones Act, crew business, and it should also be crew business in the purpose of this carriage of property by a sea Act."
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1336.859,1338.048,"I realized that, Your Honor was thinking --"
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1338.048,1338.913,Now what's the answer?
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1339.106,1344.626,That's the answer -- that -- that argument is being made in this case by the other side?
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1346.226,1346.593,But that --
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1346.593,1347.03,-- only answer --
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1347.03,1347.296,-- that's what --
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1347.296,1347.823,-- I can --
1958.276,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1347.823,1348.951,-- one can exempt it.
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1348.951,1349.302,Yes.
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1395.32,1417.048,"(Inaudible) I understood you to say that -- excuse me -- had the ship been doing its own stevedoring, there would be no question about the fact that its liability for this casualty would be limited to the $500."
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1417.048,1417.864,That's true.
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1417.864,1420.774,"Now, my question."
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1439.652,1451.031,"I think under the Congress' decision, he should and only with International versus Haverty and Sea Shipping versus Sieracki, I think he should be allowed the limit."
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1451.031,1454.691,The employee then stands in the same position you -- as you argued the --
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1454.691,1455.252,"Yes, sir."
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1455.252,1456.075,"-- stevedore, independent contractor."
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1456.075,1466.48,"I think anybody who -- who did that work, that the carrier was called upon to duty, any of his agents who did that work should be entitled to this limitation."
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1466.48,1469.046,"Now, let me I ask you one more hypothetical."
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1496.066,1496.219,I believe so.
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1496.219,1498.233,-- truck company and the truck driver.
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1498.233,1499.336,I believe so.
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1499.336,1506.799,Now would the truck driver in that case have a privilege of the carrier's immunity?
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1506.799,1507.162,I think --
1958.276,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1507.162,1507.952,Or limitation?
1958.276,0,26235,george_w_p_whip,,1507.952,1513.795,"I think it was and I refer you to a Court of Appeals, a New York Court of Appeals case."
1958.276,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1601.872,1604.249,Mr. Grimes.
1958.276,1,44768,william_a_grimes,,1604.249,1608.143,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1958.276,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2175.416,2185.183,"Mr. Grimes, I'm surprised you use such strong language as outrage because you could not have been unfamiliar with the English law which -- had also outrages."
1958.276,1,44768,william_a_grimes,,2185.183,2185.555,"No, sir."
1958.276,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2188.16,2194.528,"I'm not talking about the Australian case but I'm talking about the English cases.In particular law, it has discrepancies."
1958.276,1,44768,william_a_grimes,,2194.528,2194.696,In the --
1958.276,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2194.696,2198.144,I forgot to tell you what a waging fellow here in the admiralty field.
1958.276,1,44768,william_a_grimes,,2198.144,2199.45,"In the Elder-Dempster case, you --"
1958.276,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2199.45,2200.75,"No, later."
1958.276,1,44768,william_a_grimes,,2200.75,2201.938,"Oh, the Mercy case."
