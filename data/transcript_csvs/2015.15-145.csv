2015.15-145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.855,"We'll hear argument next in Case No. 15-145, Husky International Electronics v. Ritz. Mr. Dvoretzky."
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,7.855,18.14,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress amended the discharge bar in 1978 to add actual fraud as an additional ground for barring discharge."
2015.15-145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,68.14,85.355,"You'd -- you'd acknowledge, wouldn't you, that if the language we used in Field against Mans is applicable, or if we meant it, that you lose? Some degree of reliance is required to satisfy the element of causation inherent in the phrase ""obtained by""?"
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,85.355,88.81,"I don't think that language is applicable here, because that language has to be --"
2015.15-145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,88.81,90.81,"No, no. I understand, and I understand your argument there."
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,96.245,100.96,"Yes, if you believe that ""obtained by"" invariably requires reliance, but it does not."
2015.15-145,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,122.8,132.05,But you would have to -- you would have to show down the road that the -- the money was obtained by Ritz.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,145.09,146.88,"That -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.15-145,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,163.5,170.515,"Would you have to show under State law not only the veil-piercing -- that there's veil piercing, but that there is fraud under State law?"
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,170.515,171.28,Correct.
2015.15-145,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,194.19,201.075,"Are you piercing the corporate veil as to the first company, or as to the transferee companies?"
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,201.075,209.735,"We are piercing the -- it could be either, but -- but I think we are piercing the veil as to the transferee companies because we're pursuing this on a recipient theory."
2015.15-145,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,209.735,210.12,Right.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,214.3,214.525,Correct.
2015.15-145,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,214.525,217.235,"And your brief, you know, makes some sense as that."
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,229.165,233.64,So the complaint fully spells out all of the details related to the transfers.
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,280.15,280.73,I -- I know.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,336.18,336.815,Yes.
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,336.815,337.4,Okay.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,400.25,407.51,"I think the way your hypothetical works, Justice Breyer, is that the recipient in that instance, the wife --"
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,407.51,407.975,Uh-huh.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,407.975,410.57,-- commits actual fraud herself.
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,410.57,411.03,Yeah.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,411.03,415.525,"And when she commits actual fraud herself, she incurs her own debts."
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,415.525,421.925,So for the fee -- the problem with her is she is not trying to deceive a creditor of hers.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,432.19,433.32,True.
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,439.11,439.38,All right.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,466.145,467.09,Yes.
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,467.09,467.79,Thank you.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,467.79,470.32,She -- she commits -- she commits fraud.
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.96,479.2,Thank you.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,479.2,489.24,"That understanding is consistent with the common-law understanding of actual fraud, which is what Congress codified in order to add an additional ground for discharge."
2015.15-145,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,501.505,508.28,"It does make the language ""false pretenses"" or ""false representations"" completely superfluous, yes?"
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,508.28,533.385,"It does, but the key point here is that it also expands upon that language, whereas the Fifth Circuit's -- the Fifth Circuit's interpretation also makes ""false pretenses"" and ""false representations"" superfluous without giving Congress's amendment any additional work to do. So too for Respondent's interpretation, which first of all, merely restates a preexisting scienter requirement, so it gives the amendment no additional broadening scope."
2015.15-145,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,561.67,587.965,"So you -- you would like the Court to -- to hold that ""actual fraud"" means something other than false pretenses or misrepresentation; that it's -- it's a broader term, it includes things that were not already included, period, and then whatever other issues would be -- to be resolved on remand?"
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,587.965,603.73,"That's -- that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. With respect to Respondent's interpretation, first of all, as we established in our reply brief, false pretenses and false representations already required intentional fraud."
2015.15-145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,657.275,663.225,"Why did Congress take the term ""fraud"" out of the Bankruptcy Act in 1903?"
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,663.225,666.765,The legislative history doesn't tell us why Congress did that.
2015.15-145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,694.72,698.78,So all -- all you've got in 1903 is one -- one legislator.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,698.78,699.66,Yes.
2015.15-145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,702.05,710.37,"I have a big -- this isn't necessarily hostile to your position, but it's kind of a big change to take fraud out of a bankruptcy statute."
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,713.685,722.38,"Nobody seems to know why. We don't dispute, of course, that typically, most commonly frauds will involve misrepresentations, and so those frauds were still covered."
2015.15-145,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,795.695,804.29,"Ms. Murphy points out that there are lots of other provisions in 523(a), which have a lot of overlap on this provision on your reading."
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,809.59,810.27,Sure.
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,909.97,910.4,All right.
2015.15-145,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,916.09,918.23,So the overlap is inevitable.
2015.15-145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,941.04,943.335,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.15-145,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,943.335,945.52,I'll ask.
2015.15-145,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,949.504,953.44,Ms. Harrington.
2015.15-145,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,953.44,965.345,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court of Appeals erred in holding that Section 523(a)(2)(A) always requires proof of an intentional misrepresentation in order to prove actual fraud."
2015.15-145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1091.45,1097.265,"That's the part -- you see, it's still gnawing at me is I wish you had read this case."
2015.15-145,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1210.3,1215.15,"Well, see, there are all kinds of debts that -- that do survive a bankruptcy, including the debt for the transferor."
2015.15-145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1215.15,1215.25,Yeah.
2015.15-145,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1217.875,1225.025,Well -- so I think it is important to realize there are two distinct debts: There's the original debtor -- there's original debt from the creditor to debtor one.
2015.15-145,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1271.745,1271.97,I see.
2015.15-145,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1271.97,1280.635,-- against the person who actually has the stuff at the end of the day. And so I think that's why our -- our reading is consistent with the purpose of the -- of the Code in general.
2015.15-145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1280.635,1288.86,"Is -- is the veil piercing that's going on here with respect to Chrysalis as well, or just the company to which Chrysalis's assets were shifted?"
2015.15-145,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1288.86,1324.52,"Well, you know, Mr. Dvorestzky suggested that it's -- with -- with respect to the recipients, recipient corporations, I think that there -- there are many questions about the State law cause of action that would need to be resolved on the remand if the Court were to reverse. And I would just point out, on -- on the final page of our brief, we have the text of the veil piercing -- the Texas veil piercing, such that in -- in order -- in order to prevail under that section, the Petitioner is going to have to prove there's an actual fraud for the direct personal benefit of the holder. And so they're basically going to have to prove that Mr. Ritz obtained money or property by actual fraud, in order to prevail under the State law cause of action."
2015.15-145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1324.52,1334.01,"So how does that work in the bankruptcy case? We say this debt can't be discharged, but maybe it will turn out that it could have been, depending on how -- how the State law claim goes?"
2015.15-145,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1334.01,1340.33,There's -- so what happens is there's an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy -- in the larger bankruptcy proceeding itself.
2015.15-145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1348.39,1351.28,So the bankruptcy court will decide the question under State law?
2015.15-145,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1351.28,1352.47,"Yes, yes."
2015.15-145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.47,1352.9,Okay.
2015.15-145,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1352.9,1373.7,"And the bankruptcy court held that it -- it wasn't satisfied in this case, because the bankruptcy court viewed those Texas laws as requiring a misrepresentation, and also as 523(a)(2)(a) is requiring misrepresentation. And so I think there -- there are a lot of things that would need to be sorted out about the State law cause of action on remand. I just want to say one last thing on redundancy, if I could."
2015.15-145,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1436.74,1445.36,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Murphy."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1445.36,1457.345,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 523(a)(2) applies to a specific type of debt, a debt for something with which the debtor has fraudulently induced the creditor to part."
2015.15-145,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1509.63,1514.67,"Well, what -- what would Congress have to write to cover a scheme like this?"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1514.67,1515.1,"Well, I think --"
2015.15-145,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1515.1,1516.93,You say it's not covered under (a)(2).
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1516.93,1517.35,Sure.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1550.765,1579.0,"Well, you have the 1924 Massachusetts statute copied from the Uniform Commercial Code, which, in referring to fraudulent conveyance in Section 7, uses these words: ""Each conveyance made with actual intent as distinguished from intent presumed in law to"" -- da, da, da -- ""hinder, delay, or defraud present or future creditors is fraudulent."""
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1579.0,1579.62,Sure.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1579.62,1589.37,"I grant they did use the word ""actual intent,"" rather than ""actual intent to hinder delay, defraud,"" and then they said it is fraudulent."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1593.225,1599.595,"And -- and to be clear, we don't dispute that fraudulent conveyance is a form of actual fraud."
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1618.45,1618.87,"Well, a --"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1618.87,1619.28,-- actual fraud.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1619.28,1638.87,"The -- the friend who obtained the $40,000 which the friend knew was owed to the creditor of the transferor has obtained money, money through -- it is a debt."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1658.87,1660.06,I don't think it was.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1660.06,1660.53,Because?
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1660.53,1664.045,Because she didn't use the fraud to obtain the money.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1674.13,1674.44,That's true.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1674.44,1675.81,-- of the conveyance to the creditor.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1675.81,1676.56,But it doesn't say --
2015.15-145,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1676.56,1677.12,We're not limited --
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1677.12,1677.4,Sure.
2015.15-145,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1677.4,1679.935,We're not limited to fraudulent conveyances here.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1696.52,1697.37,Sure and -- and --
2015.15-145,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1697.37,1705.055,"And -- and if it continues through the whole chain, the person on the end of the chain may have never had any relation with the innocent party at all."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1705.055,1711.055,"Well, I think that what you need to have the fraud that comes within (a)(2) is inducement."
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1735.895,1740.68,I'm totally confused because I think -- I was following you up until that last statement.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1740.68,1741.095,Okay.
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1741.095,1749.33,All right? I was following you up to when you said that it has to be a debt you obtain by fraud from the person.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1749.33,1749.89,Yes.
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1749.89,1755.265,"Whether I agree with you or not, that's a different issue because I'm not sure that you fully answered Justice Breyer."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1774.705,1781.11,"Well, as far as I can tell, and Petitioner hasn't suggested otherwise, there's really only two forms of fraud here."
2015.15-145,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1799.01,1804.98,"Well, you just said you're not contesting that fraudulent conveyance is a form of actual fraud; is that right?"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1804.98,1808.74,"When it's done with intent, you know, the necessary intent to make it actual fraud."
2015.15-145,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1809.99,1824.255,"So, now, this language -- I mean, the language just seems a lot more simple than you're making it, because you add inducement to the language, you add from the creditor to the language. But the language doesn't say any of those things."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1853.54,1861.335,"I think that there is two -- two problems with that, in our view. First, I don't agree that the fraud is how you obtained the money."
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1875.12,1879.65,That leaves out every conspiracy theory that exists.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1885.905,1886.24,Right.
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1893.03,1895.28,A conspiracy theory says you don't have to commit every act.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1895.28,1895.38,The --
2015.15-145,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1895.38,1903.26,"The transferee -- the transferee obtains the money by way of the fraudulent conveyance, right? How else does the transferee obtain the money?"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1903.26,1908.52,"The transferee obtains the money through the transferor that decides to give them the money, and that --"
2015.15-145,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1908.52,1909.88,Through a fraudulent conveyance.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1909.88,1911.85,The fraud occurs on the back end.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.59,1945.82,"What about Mr. Ponzi's cousin who, in fact, had nothing to do with any of the misrepresentations, but knowing the entire truth says Ponzi, my friend, when you get those bags of cash, hide them under my bed, all right? Now, he himself has not, in fact, lied to anybody or made any misrepresentations, but he's part of the big scheme."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1945.82,1946.13,Well --
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1946.13,1951.63,"And I take it we would say that that money under the bed has been obtained by actual fraud, hasn't it?"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1951.63,1952.24,Not by him.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.24,1953.96,"Oh, so you're going to get him off, too."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1953.96,1956.87,"I mean, I'm not quite sure in your hypothetical, where, you know --"
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.87,1963.21,"There was -- I mean, you know, there are dozens and dozens of cases where -- where people do have misrepresentations."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1971.015,1972.02,Sure.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1972.41,1984.5,"And those people, I would think, would -- you would expect to have fall within -- since they're part of the big Ponzi scheme, they would be right within this statute and their debts would not be forgiven --"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1984.5,1984.64,Well --

2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,1986.15,1989.025,(a) just -- it's not a conspiracy statute.
2015.15-145,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2067.885,2079.83,"But it would be a very strange thing, Ms. Murphy, if -- if I agreed with you, if I were Congress and I said, I want to make it really clear that this should be only intentional, false pretenses and false representation."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2116.705,2122.19,So -- so here's why -- and two responses as to why I don't think it's actually that unusual in this context.
2015.15-145,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2146.88,2151.95,"But if I have that case right, that case is actually a case about a fraudulent conveyance."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2168.74,2180.645,"That's ignoring the second half of what the sponsor said, because they didn't say, we intend this to codify Neal v. Clark, period. And Neal v. Clark didn't hold that fraudulent conveyance was something that comes within the scope of the statute."
2015.15-145,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2184.745,2185.21,Whatever --
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2185.21,2185.4,-- because --
2015.15-145,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2185.4,2209.9,"Whatever may have been said in -- in the course of the legislative history, the statute says ""or."" And I think you would concede that your reading requires converting ""or"" into ""by""; that is, misrepresentation, false pretenses by actual fraud."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2209.9,2221.15,"I think that's a fair statement, but I think that this case is pretty analogous to the McNally case where this Court also had the disjunctive ""or"" before it in interpreting the Mail Fraud Statute."
2015.15-145,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2275.335,2296.565,"Do you have any other example in all of the U.S. Code where the word and series of words A, or B, or C, and ""or"" is taken to mean ""by,"" and refer not to a discrete category, but modifies the earlier category."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2296.565,2300.96,"I'm not sure I have an example where it would -- you know, where -- where it quite works like that."
2015.15-145,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2342.8,2351.445,"Can you give me an example in common parlance, not -- not in the U.S. Code, where someone would speak along the lines you're saying the statute is written?"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2351.445,2352.12,Sure.
2015.15-145,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2367.39,2367.86,That's not great --
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2367.86,2372.405,"-- the veterinarian says, you know, I will treat these three types of animals."
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2609.61,2619.22,"I don't know that that moves me that much. Does that mean that if you're a -- if you've accepted a fraudulent amount of money, you get to keep it?"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2619.22,2620.49,"Absolutely not, because --"
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2620.49,2621.43,"Well, that's what you're saying --"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2621.43,2622.0,"No, I'm not."
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2625.53,2628.935,"But if they choose not to, that still means you get to keep it."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2628.935,2629.68,Well --
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2629.68,2630.74,That one creditor has --
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2630.74,2631.99,The creditor has the ability to --
2015.15-145,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2631.99,2632.68,"-- the expense, et cetera."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2632.68,2638.595,"-- try and get the trustee to void the transaction, and the trustee can void the next transaction on down the line as well."
2015.15-145,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2689.17,2693.815,"What does it take to show -- what is it, the phrase ""malicious,"" or what?"
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2693.815,2694.9,"""Willful and malicious --"
2015.15-145,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2694.9,2694.97,Oh.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2694.97,2695.19,"-- injury to"" --"
2015.15-145,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2695.19,2696.725,-- what -- what does it take to show that?
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2696.725,2704.095,"So it can be either subjective intent to cause injury, or it can be a substantial certainty that injury will result."
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2744.25,2744.7,That's your case.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2744.7,2745.425,-- would result.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2745.425,2751.6,"And I'm still -- as Justice Sotomayor said, seemed to me there is a -- look what you're saying here."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2800.225,2805.16,"Well, I think it's actually kind of true in every fraudulent conveyance case because typically the --"
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2805.16,2807.46,It's also true in every misrepresentation case.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2808.85,2809.71,Not at all.
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.47,2825.18,"So he does, perhaps, to a thousand."
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2826.735,2827.62,"Well, then each one of them --"
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2827.62,2828.36,There are a thousand victims.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2837.65,2855.38,"I -- I don't think it is because in that context you are going to have a creditor-specific injury and a creditor-specific remedy, and I think you need that, too, in the fraudulent conveyance context. So if, for instance, you know, the jewels belonged to one of the creditors, then they're going to go use (a)(6) and get the jewels back."
2015.15-145,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2860.19,2860.295,I see.
2015.15-145,2,22816,erin_e_murphy,,2860.295,2867.87,-- interest. So you don't need it over here when you have a very different statute that has been focused on this concept of inducement.

2015.15-145,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3181.22,3191.205,Are you limiting actual frauds to just fraudulent conveyances? Are there other deceptive schemes that you would include?
