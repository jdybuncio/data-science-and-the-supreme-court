1978.78-156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,68.462,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Addonizio.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,72.672,75.674,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,155.034,167.791,"And is a party a third point even if they had some legitimate expectations, and even if those -- and even if there has been a change of policy of the parole board nonetheless?"
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,167.791,173.957,Yes and my point then is that there is no collateral remedy for that sort of thing.
1978.78-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,174.214,177.558,"And even if you're mistaken on the first two points, nonetheless?"
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,177.558,180.131,"Nonetheless, that's the sense in which I intend to present."
1978.78-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,180.131,185.468,Where is the phrase of legitimate expectation come from Mr. Easterbrook?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,187.584,188.233,The --
1978.78-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.233,188.97,Roth against the United -- in Roth.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,188.97,191.184,-- legitimate has been used in Roth.
1978.78-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.699,196.24,You think judges have property rights and liberty rights under Roth?
1978.78-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,196.24,197.515,And their prisoners?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,197.515,201.178,I don't want to argue that judges have liberty or property rights under Roth.
1978.78-156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,264.326,268.208,What was the timeframe in which he expressed that view?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,268.208,269.532,This was in 1970 Your Honor.
1978.78-156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,269.532,271.408,That's when he imposed the sentence?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,271.408,273.304,"Yes, when Mayor Addonizio was convicted."
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.542,363.688,And who is now deceased.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,363.688,364.844,And who is deceased.
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,366.479,368.224,"Yes, two weeks ago."
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,368.224,380.926,"The Third Circuit affirmed in Addonizio case and reversed in Whelan's and Flaherty's, and it gave two principle reasons for holding that district judges have authority to reduce their sentences in response to parole decisions."
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,651.983,654.107,Well Mr. Easterbrook may I?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,666.546,667.445,A judge could --
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,667.445,672.243,Can he do that extent impinge upon the authority of the parole?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,672.243,677.941,"Your Honor he could not say three to seven, because three is more than one-third of seven, he could say two to seven for example."
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,677.941,678.879,"Whatever, yes."
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,678.879,684.129,And he could say that he wants the Commission to release him at the end of four years.
1978.78-156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,684.129,689.516,What standing does that advisory utterance have?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,689.516,696.152,The Commission is now required by statute to consider what the judge says in that respect.
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,702.477,703.126,Well I --
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,703.126,703.705,In that sense its --
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,703.705,709.362,"What I'm trying to get at is, can the judge require that he be -- you say it should be two to seven."
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,714.769,718.551,"No, Your Honor he can't, he has no authority to require him to be held."
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,718.551,719.627,I understand.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,719.627,724.306,"At the end of one-third of the sentence, the Parole Commission can release him not withstanding the judge's desires and expectations."
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,724.306,726.959,Right.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,726.959,746.121,"One of the ironies of this case is that if you credit the Third Circuit's view that the Commission cannot consider the nature and seriousness of the offense, the Parole Commission would presumably be prohibited from releasing someone early in the sentence on the ground that the crime was trivial and the defendant didn't deserve to stay in jail."
1978.78-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,970.947,979.263,"Well Mr. Easterbrook, we were advised some years ago by a public official, pay attention to what we do not to what we say."
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,979.263,979.92,Precisely.
1978.78-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,979.92,981.016,And --
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,981.016,983.339,"The Commission's deeds comported with its words, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1978.78-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,983.339,984.607,Well that's what I understood.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,984.607,996.584,"In the 1970 Parole Commission by any of a report which collects figures from 1966 to 1970, so a report of the release decisions over that period."
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.288,1064.772,"Mr. Easterbrook, was it not true at that time if there were a number of narcotics offenders who were ineligible for parole?"
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1064.772,1065.471,It's true.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.471,1068.383,And how much do they account for on that?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1068.383,1075.159,"The data in this brief contain only people who were eligible for release on parole, that's my understanding."
1978.78-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1091.951,1094.125,Are there any figures for the first offenders?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1094.125,1098.445,"Yes, the first offenders are in the first paragraph in the note of page 47."
1978.78-156,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1100.241,1102.584,That is on note 47 on page 55?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1102.584,1111.026,"Note 47 on page 55 of our brief, first paragraph does try to breakdown into first offenders, distinguishes first offenders from all offenders."
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1122.469,1127.617,"Mr. Easterbrook, on that footnote 47, how precise is this one-third?"
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1137.318,1145.769,"No, in fact that was pointed out that we haven't been sufficiently precise by respondent Addonizio."
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.72,1161.672,I see.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1161.672,1167.289,The reason for the two-month gap is because many people didn't have their hearings until very close to the one-third point and couldn't be released for some period afterwards.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1167.289,1170.66,"Well, in fact they didn't have it until after they pass the one-third point, isn't that right?"
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1170.66,1170.85,In some --
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.85,1176.786,"The regulation provide that there's no hearing until the one-third, then you have the hearing and then whatever time it takes to do the paperwork, a lot of people being released."
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1176.786,1179.829,"That -- yes Your Honor that was the reason for the allowance of the two months, yes."
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.829,1184.1,And this two months enough to take care of everybody who was successful of this first parole hearing?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1184.1,1186.336,The Parole Commission believes it is.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1189.106,1191.11,But it is correct is it not?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1195.419,1196.248,"Yes, there was."
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.248,1196.535,And it is the --
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1196.535,1202.094,With the exception of persons sentenced to under what's now the V2 sentence.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.094,1202.134,Right.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1202.134,1202.831,That is persons who are eligible for parole at the outset.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.831,1204.695,And they were even later worked out.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1210.045,1215.223,Some people as the data show got released at the allegedly meaningless first hearing.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1216.808,1217.225,Right.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1217.225,1223.343,"In many events because the Commission thought the crime was trivial, and there was a policy of winning them out."
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.187,1226.033,But in any event there was --
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1226.033,1227.141,-- that did happen.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.141,1233.436,"-- putting those two aside, there was a regulation which mandated the hearing after one-third of the sentence had been heard."
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1233.436,1234.035,There was.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.035,1234.642,Approximately.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1239.111,1239.67,Oh yes!
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.277,1251.333,Yes.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1251.333,1254.445,And that is I think still the case.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.445,1268.983,"And, I just want -- is it your position that the judge could not reasonably anticipate that an offender who had a good institutional behavior would very likely be released at the end of approximately third of the sentence?"
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1268.983,1279.808,I think in 1970 a judge could reasonably have anticipated that a substantial proportion of all prisoners with good institutional behavior would be released near that time.
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1289.61,1289.87,Right.
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1289.87,1298.59,"And even in 1970 there was, if you can visualize a bell shaped curve, there surely a tail off toward the more serious end."
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1314.308,1319.725,"Mr. Easterbrook, if the Government prevails here, does Addonizio have to adjourn the pleading?"
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1319.725,1325.453,"If the Government prevails here, Mr. Justice Brennan, his original 10-year sentence will be restored."
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1338.803,1344.391,Well didn't Judge Barlow actually reduce the sentence to time served?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1344.391,1346.734,He did and he had served five years and two months.
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1346.734,1348.211,And you challenge --
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1348.211,1348.531,We challenged --
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1348.531,1350.814,-- the power to reduce it to time served?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1350.814,1352.032,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1359.962,1361.749,How long has he been out now?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1361.749,1364.731,He has been out for a little more than two years now.
1978.78-156,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1366.208,1368.713,Didn't I release him at one time or so?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1368.713,1379.441,"Your Honor, the -- Judge Barlow released him, the Third Circuit ordered him to return to jail and the Supreme Court, by vote of 7 to 2, ordered him released again."
1978.78-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1667.163,1675.006,"Mr. Easterbrook, was there ever a claim in this case that the Commission change in regulations constituted an ex post -- violation of Ex Post Facto Clause?"
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1675.006,1678.889,"There has never been such a claim in this case, Your Honor."
1978.78-156,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1678.889,1683.787,"Mr. Easterbrook, did the judge also served refer to Affronti and his opinion at all?"
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1683.787,1686.162,"He did not, nor to Murray."
1978.78-156,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1686.162,1687.921,Was it urged him that the Third Circuit?
1978.78-156,0,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1687.921,1693.897,I believe it was Your Honor.
1978.78-156,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1693.897,1699.174,Mr. Edelson.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1699.174,1702.487,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1763.408,1769.164,"That's putting it mildly, isn't it, in light of the excoriating statements he made at page 10?"
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1769.164,1780.361,"Well, if I may Mr. Chief Justice, in that entire indictment Mr. Addonizio was accused of receiving $4,000.00."
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1780.361,1785.011,Well I'm not -- I'm concerned with what the judge said about the nature of his offense which he committed by betrayal of trust as the highest elected official of Newark.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1785.011,1790.468,"Alright, I will --"
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1811.398,1812.853,And he was the then mayor?
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1812.853,1813.871,He was the then mayor.
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1826.175,1832.951,Well are you suggesting that this record doesn't show that he was in it up to his eyes?
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1832.951,1838.308,"I am suggesting, if Your Honor please, that this record does not show that he was in it up to his eyes."
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1838.308,1844.086,But then was an outrageous statement on the part of Judge Barlow make.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1844.086,1854.34,"Judge -- I understand that, yes he -- Judge Barlow found it to be extremely severe and as Your Honor said that may be an understatement."
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.34,1854.4,Yes.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1854.4,1859.969,"What Judge Barlow has said is clearly set forth, the words are there."
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1877.632,1889.585,Don't you suggest that Judge Barlow was not fully aware that the parole authorities would ultimately take into account what he said in passing on possible parole release?
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1889.585,1901.54,I suggest to Your Honor that he was in one -- he was not aware that the parole board would reevaluate the severity of the offense and take into consideration his statements --
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1901.54,1912.517,"Well -- to reevaluate it, they're just -- it shows very clearly in the record that they didn't reevaluate it they just took Judge Barlow's evaluation."
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1949.176,1949.436,Well --
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1949.436,1964.742,"-- the parole board was doing what it should do, namely take into account the total record up to the time of the imposition of the sentence including everything in the presentence report, everything that the sentencing judge said either by way of mitigation or aggravation, isn't that correct?"
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1964.742,1981.333,"If Your Honor please, in reviewing the presentence report and everything said by way of mitigation and aggravation and the weight that they ultimately gave to that review, I suggest to the Court that they were in fact reevaluating the severity of the offense."
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1981.333,1992.181,"Well I would read the parole board statement as much more moderate than Judge Barlow's statements, not involving any reevaluation at all."
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,1992.181,2005.252,"Well, if Your Honor please, we do at least know that Judge Barlow felt that the punishment which fit the crime and his evaluation of the severity would have been incarceration for a period of three and a half to four years."
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.113,2033.108,"Mr. Edelson, with respect to 2255, did Judge Barlow or the Third Circuit give any explanation for why they thought this was a sentence subject to collateral attack in view of our holdings in Murray and Affronti?"
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2033.108,2039.235,"Well neither court addressed Murray and Affronti, but yes they did give reasons why they felt Section 2255 --"
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.235,2045.261,I've read their opinions and I'm amazed frankly that they didn't even discuss Murray or Affronti.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2047.974,2061.109,"Well I -- Murray and Affronti, if Your Honor please, did both -- if I'm correct did both deal with the interpretation of probation statutes."
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.696,2093.612,"So did Murray and Affronti suggest that was at all relevant, whether or not there'd been a radical change?"
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2093.612,2100.836,"Well, I would agree that there is a suggestion there, but I also believe that the cases are in fact distinguishable."
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.692,2189.083,But maybe Congress didn't want to give Judge Barlow the power either to guarantee a minimum or to give him any expectation as to a maximum?
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2189.083,2193.515,Well I think they did give him the right to guarantee the minimum.
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2193.515,2196.317,By fixing the higher maximum.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2196.317,2196.826,That's correct.
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2196.826,2197.016,Yes.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2197.016,2207.187,Because the statute provides when there's -- provided when -- and still provides when there is a straight sentence then the inmate is not eligible for parole until he has served one-third of his sentence.
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.187,2215.578,But there's certainly nothing in the sentencing statutes about giving a judge any expectation as to a maximum.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2215.578,2220.157,"Well, there is nothing -- I would agree that there is nothing in the statute."
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.03,2225.385,In this Court?
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2225.385,2243.04,"Not in this Court, if Your Honor, I don't -- although there were -- there are general comments on the philosophy of parole which I assume were shared by trial courts into their expectation of how the parole system worked."
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.839,2252.137,But before we have your --
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2252.137,2255.009,"-- of Barry versus United States, excuse me I just wanted to give you this cite."
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.009,2256.137,Yes.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2256.137,2262.646,The way the court said that the reasonable expectation is the prisoner will serve one-third of the full sentence.
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.646,2275.003,"Well the fact that the Third Circuit opinions may have given Judge Barlow, who was a district judge in New Jersey an expectation, certainly doesn't bind us in any way, does it?"
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2275.003,2287.795,"If there was such an expectation and if sentences were imposed based upon that expectation, it is our contention that there was a crucial error in the imposition of sentence."
1978.78-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.795,2294.47,Even though this Court had never sustained the Third Circuit's position?
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2294.47,2329.803,"Yes, even though this Court had never sustained the Third Circuit's opinion, because there was nothing from this Court to say whether or not there was an expectation other than this Court -- there are -- there is language in Morrissey versus Brewer for example which is similar to language in many circuit court cases that the object of parole is to release the inmate as quickly as the parole authorities have determined that he has shown rehabilitation and can be put back on the street without the fear of recidivism without --"
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2329.803,2351.86,"Isn't there another factor that's added at every level and that is whether in weighing looking at the seriousness and gravity of the crime, the release at that time will disparage and depreciate the administration of justice and undermine the deterrent factor of punishment?"
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2351.86,2381.922,"If Your Honor please, that was very specifically added in the 1976 Parole Commission and Reorganization Act, a comparison between 184203 and the present 184206 (a) which sets the criteria shows that first of all, the old criteria did not tell the Parole Commission or parole board at that time, to look at the severity of the offense."
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2455.422,2463.384,Would you suppose they were in the minds of people who were experienced in this activity and judges who were imposing sentences?
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2463.384,2464.172,I --
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2464.172,2467.533,There's nothing new about those concepts.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2471.924,2482.791,"Judge, I believe that until the new Act, the punishment, retribution, deterrence aspect were covered generally by the sentence imposed."
1978.78-156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2513.363,2518.281,Are you familiar with any of the sentencing institutes?
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2518.281,2519.449,I'm not --
1978.78-156,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.449,2521.942,"You never heard them, have you?"
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2526.293,2531.701,I am familiar with the federal judges attend institutes on sentencing.
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2585.008,2595.933,Well there certainly was a flip flop by the sentencing judge from the expressions he gave at the time of sentence and the expressions he made when he took his final action.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2595.933,2598.877,"Well, my time is up by if I may just respond to that?"
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2598.877,2598.927,Yes.
1978.78-156,1,35748,michael_edelson,,2598.927,2601.612,I don't think there was a flip-flop at all.
1978.78-156,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2622.776,2624.99,Very well.
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,2640.276,2644.417,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-156,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2849.257,2853.197,Do you think Judge Shaw's right survives his death?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,2853.197,2855.341,It's not a question to Judge Shaw's rights.
1978.78-156,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2906.802,2910.285,"Well where do you find those rights, you find them on acts of Congress, don't you?"
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,2910.285,2911.233,No sir.
1978.78-156,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2916.941,2923.246,You mean a judge could impose whatever sentence he wanted after a guilty verdict regardless of what Congress had said about it?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,2923.246,2923.895,"No, sir."
1978.78-156,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3002.57,3007.529,"What is you explanation then of the federal rule, you must have some explanation of it?"
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3007.529,3008.437,Rule 35?
1978.78-156,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3008.437,3009.096,Yes.
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3009.096,3015.359,"I think that Rule 35 deals with entirely different proposition, and that's not the proposition we have before us."
1978.78-156,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3020.766,3029.448,"Well I don't want to know what your explanation is of 2255, tell me what the explanation is of Rule 35 which you say is such a different proposition."
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3029.448,3044.345,"If the judge has made a mistake, if something has happened where the judge for one reason or another, wants to do something different then Congress has given the judge the authority to change his sentence for whatever reason or no reason the way I see Rule 35."
1978.78-156,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.436,3067.58,What about Affronti and Murray?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3067.58,3069.893,Affronti and Murray have absolutely nothing to do with this.
1978.78-156,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3069.893,3073.247,"I know, that's why I would expect you to say that why not?"
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3087.198,3089.282,"Well, all I could say about --"
1978.78-156,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3089.282,3090.168,Don't they say that?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3090.168,3097.779,"Sure but that doesn't apply here, simply because Affronti and Murray assumed that the judge had changed his mind, that the judge wants to do something different than what he wanted to do before."
1978.78-156,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.779,3105.668,"Well it does, yes, he certainly does and I thought you said that 2255 would be available for the judge to --"
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3105.668,3106.626,"No sir, I didn't say that."
1978.78-156,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.956,3146.863,"What if the judge discovered some facts, what if the probation officer came in and said “I gave you a very bad report last year, this fellow should have really gone on probation, instead he is in prison for five years.”"
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3167.912,3172.381,"If Your Honor please, I don't know that that wouldn't be a good rule, but I'm not arguing that rule."
1978.78-156,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3191.921,3197.089,"Well you'd have to do something about the -- about Affronti, wouldn't you, and Murray?"
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3197.089,3200.77,"In that case, I certainly would but not in the case that I argue here today."
1978.78-156,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3315.033,3327.425,How can the judge at that stage have any idea how the prisoner is going to conduct himself in prison over a period of three or five years into the future?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3327.425,3346.102,"He can't and that's precisely why the only discretion that's invested in the executive department under that set of sort of circumstance is, is to determine whether or not he is adapted to the prison life, whether there is going to be recidivistic tendencies, and whether the other criteria which are set forth in the statutes and the regulations are met."
1978.78-156,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3346.102,3349.952,You mean the parole board can not take into account the nature of the crime?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3349.952,3351.619,Absolutely not.
1978.78-156,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3376.511,3378.148,Not longer than what?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3378.148,3378.615,Excuse me sir?
1978.78-156,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3378.615,3379.863,Longer than what?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3379.863,3386.538,Longer than the expectation of the judge in sentencing because of the severity of the crime.
1978.78-156,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3389.46,3391.626,So the Parole Commission is just a rubberstamp?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3391.626,3393.77,"No, it's not just a rubberstamp."
1978.78-156,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3404.882,3408.774,That's not -- well I just have one -- I didn't say a word about the judge did I?
1978.78-156,2,34493,leon_j_greenspan,,3408.774,3413.868,"No, you didn't Your Honor, that was my own language, but that's what I would learn from that."
1978.78-156,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3512.958,3514.074,Thank you gentlemen.
