1982.82-23,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.295,We will hear arguments next in Marsh v. Chambers.
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,62.505,66.379,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.82-23,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,112.735,119.749,"On the basis of his claim, would it make any difference whether it was a paid or an unpaid clergyman?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,119.749,156.187,"Senator Chambers' precise claim was that the prayers, apparently definitionally being a per se violation of the Constitution, by practical operation obviated the necessity for compensating anyone to provide them, obviated the necessity obviously, again, from practical considerations of even having a prayer book, and in that way the compensation of the chaplain would fall."
1982.82-23,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,214.289,218.631,"Does the record show what the compensation was, how much it was?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,218.631,221.723,It changed from time to time.
1982.82-23,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,235.061,238.685,"So it is seven months, $320."
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,238.685,242.527,"Roughly, seven months per two-year session."
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,398.058,404.664,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, you never had a non-Christian chaplain, did you?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,404.664,406.866,"We don't know that, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,408.991,414.364,"Well, I was going to ask you, if you said so, name him, because I'm sure there's not... I thought that was admitted."
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,414.364,416.238,"--No, I don't believe it was, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,425.266,428.608,"Well, you have the prayers are in the record, aren't they?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,428.608,432.357,On three occasions during chaplain--
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,432.357,433.42,Aren't the prayers in the record?
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,433.42,434.247,--Certain of them are.
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,434.247,441.104,"Do you have any prayer in there that doesn't invoke the guidance of Christ, C-h-r-i-s-t?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,444.15,452.598,"I believe there are prayers that make reference to deity identifiable to the Judaeo-Christian heritage, as Chaplain Palmer put it."
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,468.499,469.733,"But you don't admit it, do you?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,470.358,471.39,"Don't admit what, Your Honor?"
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,471.39,474.793,"That they're all Christians, all of the chaplains have been Christians?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,474.793,477.059,"We simply have no idea, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,477.059,478.839,You have no idea?
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,478.839,480.214,Absolutely none.
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,480.214,480.947,I see.
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,480.947,489.912,The only thing we know about any prior chaplain is that Chaplain Palmer himself became a candidate for the post because of the death of his predecessor in office.
1982.82-23,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,611.427,623.266,"Mr. Cronk, is there evidence in the record that Chaplain Palmer ever refused to allow any guest chaplain to appear?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,623.266,627.436,There is no evidence in the record that there was any such refusal.
1982.82-23,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.001,671.589,Does the record disclose when the prayers were recited and at what point in the orders of the day that that practice occurred?
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,671.589,672.417,"--The record does, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,938.968,945.277,"Mr. Cronk, in this case did the chaplain do anything other than give a prayer?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,945.277,956.444,"--I think the record indicates that his only service is the provision of the morning prayer, and that's provided for by legislative rule."
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,956.444,960.099,"Yes, but I mean that was actually true?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,960.099,961.988,This is true.
1982.82-23,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.988,968.877,May I ask you if you think the result would be the same if the rule had provided that every committee hearing shall open with a prayer?
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,968.877,984.918,"It's difficult to assess whether the result would be the same in any particular situation, because this, like most establishment clause cases, has to be determined on the basis of its own facts and circumstances."
1982.82-23,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.96,998.396,"The same reason here, to have a solemn beginning and get everybody in the proper mood to start their deliberations."
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,998.396,1006.814,"--It doesn't strike me that we necessarily would conclude that that, such a practice, moves us more toward the impermissible."
1982.82-23,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.381,1046.252,"Would you have any trouble with the Nebraska rule if it said... if 16 years ago they passed a rule that said, for the next 16 years the prayer shall be conducted by a Presbyterian minister?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1046.252,1057.294,I think that that moves us more toward... the suggestion in your question is that that singles out a particular denomination officially.
1982.82-23,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.294,1059.965,"Well, that's one of the things that apparently troubled the Court of Appeals."
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1067.648,1074.849,I think that that would cause more problem than has been caused by this situation that we actually have before us.
1982.82-23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.62,1103.791,"How was his appointment... how often was his appointment made, did you say?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1103.791,1109.288,"The sessions, the actual process, is every two years."
1982.82-23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.288,1112.459,Is it for every... is he reappointed every session?
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1112.459,1114.271,Every two-year session.
1982.82-23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.457,1120.316,And who designates him?
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1120.316,1125.47,The Executive Board recommends to the full legislature for approval.
1982.82-23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.172,1139.292,"Is that one of the early... is that one of the first things a new session does, is to--"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1139.292,1139.964,The Executive Board?
1982.82-23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.109,1172.937,"--Does he, does the chaplain, have an office?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1172.937,1174.529,"--No, he does not."
1982.82-23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.092,1178.981,He just comes in every morning--
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1178.981,1179.575,--Yes.
1982.82-23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.575,1180.48,--for a few minutes?
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1180.48,1181.152,Yes.
1982.82-23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.152,1184.416,So he has no place to hang his hat?
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1184.416,1188.337,"As far as I know, and the record is silent on whether that's the case."
1982.82-23,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1214.497,1214.997,Excuse me.
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1230.476,1231.428,--We don't know.
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1256.418,1259.245,"Well, what about the Lutheran minister that applied?"
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1259.245,1263.135,"I have been asking myself the same question, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1263.135,1266.086,"Well, I know, but the record said that at least one did apply."
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1266.086,1272.786,The record says nothing about the denominational affiliation of any other chaplain except Reverend Palmer.
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1272.786,1274.988,"I said applicant, not chaplain."
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1274.988,1284.485,There is an indication that in 1979 the outgoing Executive Board recommended another cleric--
1982.82-23,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.485,1284.782,That's what I thought.
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1284.782,1286.047,--denomination unknown.
1982.82-23,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1302.773,1307.787,"General Cronk, let me ask you one other question."
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1325.749,1327.389,I wish I knew for certain.
1982.82-23,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1327.389,1328.42,Kind of puzzling.
1982.82-23,0,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,1328.42,1336.933,"The Plaintiff, Respondent here, challenged the expenditure of state funds for the prayer book."
1982.82-23,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1524.482,1525.529,Very well.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1529.324,1533.776,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.82-23,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1564.746,1568.261,"Mr. Friedman, would you still be here, however, if the compensation weren't in the case?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1568.261,1568.995,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1568.995,1570.401,I thought so.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1575.102,1578.273,"No, Your Honor, I think the compensation is part of the issue."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1578.273,1580.554,"Well, your response to Justice Blackmun?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1580.554,1585.301,"I'd still be here, but certainly the compensation is part of this issue."
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.362,1593.471,I take it you would also be here even if they changed chaplains every session?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1593.471,1594.532,I think so.
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.532,1596.921,"You'd be here, but your case wouldn't be as good?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1598.046,1601.405,"I wish I'd said that, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1601.405,1617.834,"What if, Mr. Friedman, as is often the case, you had a clergyman who was a member of the legislature and as an economy measure they drafted him to give the invocation every morning?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1617.834,1619.725,Same clergyman every morning?
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1619.725,1621.771,"A member of the legislature, yes."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1621.771,1622.318,I understand that.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1625.333,1628.425,"Well, we ask hypothetical questions very frequently."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1632.641,1635.063,We would disapprove of it.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1635.063,1636.156,"Well, disapprove."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1637.983,1641.685,We'd say it would be unconstitutional if there was prayer in the legislature.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1641.685,1642.232,All right.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1654.274,1658.958,The same religion every day?
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1662.879,1664.706,"All right, let's change it, then."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1675.578,1678.577,Certainly less unconstitutional--
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1678.577,1679.186,Why?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1679.186,1680.077,--but in our view still unconstitutional.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1680.077,1680.514,Why?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1680.514,1684.044,Because it still mixes religion with government.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.044,1684.716,You said less.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1686.902,1693.994,Because it makes it less obvious that one religion is singled out as being the official religion.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1693.994,1708.018,"Well now, the Congress of the United States, or the Senate, I believe, for about... until recently had, by coincidence, a Presbyterian chaplain for about eight or ten years."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1710.83,1712.735,"I would think so, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1712.735,1721.903,"How about our invocation that the Marshal announced this morning when he concluded calling the Court and said at the end,"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1725.965,1736.367,"I don't think this lawsuit is asking this Court to take a judicial hammer and chisel and do away with all of the terms of religion, including the opening ceremony by Marshal Wong."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1749.174,1753.188,"Well then, we go back to the members of the legislature."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1760.622,1761.794,We'd prefer that they didn't.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.434,1766.042,"We're not here on preferences, Mr. Friedman."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1776.413,1786.502,"--Your Honor, it seems to Senator Chambers that any time you have a prayer in the legislature it's probably unconstitutional."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1807.338,1820.411,"Then it would follow, I suppose, that the Constitutional Convention engaged in an unconstitutional practice by having a prayer to open each session in Philadelphia."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1820.411,1827.766,"They were certainly inconsistent, Your Honor, and there's no question that that matter was never raised at that particular time."
1982.82-23,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.201,1842.825,You mean even before the First Amendment was adopted?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1844.511,1845.464,"No, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.493,1853.758,"Well, wasn't there opposition to the prayer in the First Congress?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1853.758,1854.54,"--Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.54,1861.271,"Well, so it was brought to it... it was put on the table, but that was just by a minority."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1861.271,1863.192,It was debated.
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.192,1866.924,"Yes, and the people who raised it didn't prevail."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1866.924,1869.126,At that time they didn't.
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.126,1870.063,Yes.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1880.013,1881.902,"Well, I don't know that--"
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.902,1885.683,"Well, isn't that a pretty decent inquiry, though?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1885.683,1886.948,--As to what the First Congress--
1982.82-23,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1886.948,1887.463,Yes.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1887.463,1891.087,--Your Honor--
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.087,1896.053,"Well, I just wonder, isn't it a relevant inquiry as to what the framers intended?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1896.053,1900.849,"--It's an interesting historical inquiry, but I think it's more important--"
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.849,1902.317,None of it... it has no legal significance?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1902.317,1909.282,"--I don't believe it has the legal... I don't believe it has binding legal significance, Justice White."
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.975,1936.131,"They paid them, though."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1936.131,1938.052,They did pay them.
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.113,1944.16,To pay them.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1944.16,1944.644,--To pay them.
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.644,1945.159,Yes.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1945.159,1956.092,"And it's an inconsistent... perhaps one of those inconsistent things that's come down through two centuries, and we have never brought it to this Court before."
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.811,1959.7,That's... you're just assuming it's inconsistent.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,1965.447,1967.993,"I suspect that's what the lawsuit's about, Justice White."
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.579,2031.204,"Where are you reading from, Mr. Friedman?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2031.75,2032.079,--Yes.
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.71,2052.913,"Well, doesn't that just mean ""as far as I know""?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2052.913,2054.35,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.35,2056.957,"And how long has he been in the legislature, seven years?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2056.957,2058.379,"Seven or ten years, something like that."
1982.82-23,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.379,2075.967,"Mr. Friedman, is there any evidence, apart from the symbolic evidence that you just referred to, that the tenure of Reverend Palmer has had the purpose or the effect of favoring one particular religious viewpoint?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2075.967,2084.635,"I think the fact, Justice O'Connor, is that it's always been a Christian and it's always been a mainstream Protestant Christian."
1982.82-23,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2089.647,2104.689,"Well, what I was asking was, is there anything other than that rather symbolic evidence to demonstrate that a particular religious viewpoint was being advocated?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2104.689,2113.685,"Other than the fact that the symbolic inference here is that one religion stands out, there isn't."
1982.82-23,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2119.589,2134.598,Could you also address exactly what effects the practice in Nebraska has had on Senator Chambers with some precision?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2134.598,2135.129,"The record is clear on that, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2141.267,2146.188,"Is that what you call your members of your unicameral legislature, ""senator"", all of them?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2146.188,2147.563,"Yes, Justice Blackmun."
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2198.151,2204.587,"Didn't the chaplain make some adaptation to Senator Chambers' feelings, though, after he learned of them?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2204.587,2205.337,He did not.
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.337,2209.194,I thought that he omitted the reference to Christ.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2209.194,2212.895,"That was after Senator Fellman, a Jewish Senator, came up to him and commented."
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.895,2222.095,"Well, then he, the chaplain, did make some adjustment after receiving a comment from another Senator who didn't like the Christian aspect of the prayer."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2222.095,2225.234,He devoided himself of the uniquely Christian aspect.
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2236.2,2240.04,"Well, he simply not only didn't believe in God, but prayer as such bothered him, I take it?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2240.04,2242.291,Prayer in the legislature bothered him.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2252.38,2258.987,"It wouldn't do him much good to question the right of people to pray, would it, with the First Amendment and the religion clauses?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2258.987,2259.049,Of course not.
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.049,2260.642,And no one requires him to pray.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2260.642,2263.501,"Oh, I think that's quite true, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2291.192,2313.809,"What if before the legislature met they announced throughout the state that every clergyman in the state would be invited to... or every clergyman in Lincoln, Nebraska, to eliminate the travel problem, would be invited to come and give one day in rotation?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2321.056,2322.603,"We think it would, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2323.242,2328.412,"Well, then the Presbyterian factor is irrelevant to your argument, isn't it?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2328.412,2332.082,--The fact that Dr. Palmer is a Presbyterian?
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2332.082,2332.644,Yes.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2332.644,2338.188,The fact that Dr. Palmer is a member of a mainline Protestant faith is not irrelevant.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.188,2345.609,"But you say the result would be the same if you had all the clergymen in Lincoln, and I suppose there must be 50 or 60 of them, maybe more."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2345.609,2347.326,More than that.
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.748,2353.355,"Mr. Friedman, you've used the term ""mainline Protestant faith"" a couple of times."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2355.276,2363.477,"--Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that basically deals with the Protestant sects who have the most members."
1982.82-23,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2367.817,2368.426,"Be careful, now."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2372.144,2374.581,"--I'm treading on thin ice, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.581,2380.985,Is that based on a church membership approach?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2380.985,2381.235,Basically.
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2456.672,2467.746,"But you've said several times that even if you had chaplains picked at random one day at a time, you'd have the same objection."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2467.746,2468.824,"I think that's true, Your Honor."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.512,2511.399,You seemed to make a difference earlier in your argument between legislatures and courts.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2522.927,2525.692,"I would think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2525.692,2531.658,Then how about this very short version that the Marshal uses to summon the Court?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2531.658,2538.061,"I suppose that's the... that's the one question I suppose that I knew was going to be asked, and the one I have been dreading answering, I suspect."
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2546.339,2552.009,"Well, you don't have to go that far, do you, to make... to win this case?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2557.132,2569.923,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we believe that the opening ceremony of this Court, as well as the name of God on public buildings and God on the currency, have lost all religious significance."
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2592.711,2597.334,"Mr. Friedman, do military units still have chaplains?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2597.334,2599.959,"--Yes, they do, Justice Powell, and we don't quarrel with that."
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2599.959,2600.802,Why?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2600.802,2621.574,"We feel that people who are in the military service are taken away from their normal place, they are oftentimes overseas, and to deny them some sort of religious inspiration would probably be a violation of the other part of the clause, the free exercise clause."
1982.82-23,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2621.574,2628.775,Don't you think legislators are called away from their home counties and are in need of some guidance and inspiration as well?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2628.775,2633.835,"That may be true, Justice O'Connor, but I don't think that that's the same, what we're talking about."
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2639.6,2649.861,"If you have a military unit stationed at some foreign post, remote generally from other people, are you suggesting the chaplain has no opportunity to influence them?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2649.861,2653.157,"--I'm sorry, Justice Powell, I didn't understand the question."
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2653.157,2658.919,"I said, military units are stationed all over the world and they're often quite isolated."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2676.398,2681.302,"I think they do have some influence, and I guess the answer is I don't know, either."
1982.82-23,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2681.302,2700.763,"Well, in any event, Mr. Friedman, I gather what you're suggesting is that in the case of the military chaplain or the prison chaplain there's a tension between the free exercise and the establishment clauses, and the free exercise clause in this instance, and the interests, override the establishment complications."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2700.763,2702.043,"That's correct, Justice Brennan."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2704.418,2713.963,"There's a tension in every application of the religion clauses, a tension between the two branches of the religion clauses."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2716.352,2717.867,"That's correct, Chief Justice."
1982.82-23,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2748.137,2760.414,"But Mr. Friedman, that comes back, of course, to the practice of Congress and the practice in Congress at the formation of this nation and at the time of the adoption of the First Amendment."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2760.414,2773.705,"Justice O'Connor, at the time of the First Congress I believe most of the members sent their children to segregated schools."
1982.82-23,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.761,2797.398,"Might be named Brown, Brown versus the Board of Education."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2798.273,2800.975,--I think you had something to do with that case.
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.172,2865.339,"Well, certainly Congress in 1789 had... represented and realized it represented Catholic constituencies, certainly some Jews, some deists."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2868.025,2869.65,"That's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2869.65,2873.711,"So to say it's pluralistic now, it was pluralistic then, too."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2873.711,2875.695,It was not nearly as pluralistic.
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.695,2883.582,"Well, but does that change in degree really mean that we can't accept the meaning that was intended by the people who drafted the amendment as applicable today?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2883.582,2890.298,I can't believe that the framers of the Constitution today would accept the practice in Nebraska.
1982.82-23,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2909.852,2916.865,"Well, should we take Madison at the time he drafted the amendment or as he recanted many years later?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2916.865,2920.489,I think what we have to do is take--
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.489,2921.503,What he said is that he had made a mistake.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2921.503,2924.362,--That's correct.
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2927.204,2932.0,"That's like saying, well, I know the First Amendment means so-and-so but I wish it meant it something else."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2932.0,2939.84,"--Justice White, this matter really has never had the opportunity to be presented to this Court."
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.947,2944.493,"Well, you have the opportunity now."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,2944.493,2946.884,"--That's what we're trying to do, Justice White."
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3060.98,3072.63,"Mr. Friedman, you have to support the position, don't you, that the primary effect of what has been done in the legislature is to promote the establishment of religion?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3075.114,3075.848,"That's correct, Justice Powell."
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3075.848,3077.692,What evidence is there of that?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3077.692,3081.314,Circumstantial evidence and symbolic evidence only.
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3082.674,3084.47,"Well, what is the circumstantial evidence?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3093.184,3093.856,--No.
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3093.856,3098.527,Have the number of parishioners in Protestant churches?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3098.527,3098.746,Absolutely not.
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3098.746,3106.242,"Well, in what way has any establishment of religion been enhanced or furthered?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3108.585,3111.662,"I understand what you're saying, Justice Powell."
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3145.773,3147.585,"And that is an establishment, you say?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3147.585,3150.396,I perceive it as an establishment problem.
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.396,3156.784,"Like the... well, you have to say that that is the establishment, like the symbol on the flag."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3156.784,3157.799,That's correct.
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3157.799,3159.235,"That would be the establishment, wouldn't it?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3159.235,3162.078,I think 40 years ago in another establishment--
1982.82-23,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.078,3178.26,"You must take that position or else you'll have to then prove that that symbol on the flag or the symbol before the legislature had some real consequences, which you don't care to undertake to prove."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3178.26,3179.447,--I can't prove that.
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3179.447,3181.04,May I ask this.
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3197.579,3200.297,"That's correct, Justice Powell."
1982.82-23,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3200.688,3206.482,"There you had a true establishment, that the church and state were essentially the same."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3206.482,3223.148,"--I think that a legal historian could probably make a good argument that one of the reasons they called it ""establishment"" was that many of the states had their own established churches at that time and they didn't want the Federal Government to get involved in it."
1982.82-23,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3229.723,3241.078,"Mr. Friedman, before this case was filed, in your own estimation how many people outside the legislature knew about the chaplain?"
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3241.078,3242.17,"Oh, I think the whole state did."
1982.82-23,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3242.17,3243.17,The whole state?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3243.17,3245.732,He was an official--
1982.82-23,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3245.732,3250.683,You mean the same state that don't know their own legislators would know that there was a chaplain there?
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3250.683,3251.854,"--Oh, I think they knew there was a chaplain."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3254.651,3260.117,"Now, this has been going on for more than 200 years, right back to the Confederation."
1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3269.146,3271.551,"I can't say that, Mr. Chief Justice."

1982.82-23,1,26955,herbert_j_friedman,,3275.097,3281.124,"Symbolically, one religion appears to dominate through government."
1982.82-23,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3316.501,3321.453,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Cronk?"
1982.82-23,2,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,3321.453,3323.249,"Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.82-23,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.796,3410.87,"Mr. Cronk, do you take the position that you never could prove an establishment clause violation without proving that the membership of the favored church had increased over the period that the challenged practice was in effect?"
1982.82-23,2,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,3410.87,3414.4,"--No, I wouldn't take that blanket position, Your Honor."

1982.82-23,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.637,3454.041,"There are some cases... I'm not suggesting this is one, but there are some cases where you can just look at the practice and say it favors one religion over others, can't you?"
1982.82-23,2,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,3454.041,3458.492,"--Well, I would have to know a little bit about--"
1982.82-23,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3458.492,3459.039,Maybe this isn't such a case.
1982.82-23,2,41115,shanler_d_cronk,,3468.378,3469.174,--Absolutely not.
