2007.07-330,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.466,"We will hear argument first today in Case 07-330, Greenlaw versus United States."
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,8.388,20.884,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For over 200 years, this Court has held, without exception, that an appellate court may not modify a judgment in a party's favor unless that party has filed a notice of appeal."
2007.07-330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,57.384,58.134,May I ask you this question?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,68.175,68.863,--No.
2007.07-330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,70.159,72.049,The district judge could not have increased it?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,82.28,84.81,"--If... he would have been foreclosed, yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,84.81,87.45,What's the authority for that proposition?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,87.45,90.995,Simply that the... the district--
2007.07-330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,90.995,98.663,"Say, if it was a capital case and he won on appeal, he could get the death sentence the second time around, which is a little more serious sentence."
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,102.193,112.44,"--This is a... the case actually in United States versus Harvey, which was a case out of the Third Circuit, and, although the district court could order the same sentence, it can't increase the sentence."
2007.07-330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,115.126,119.312,Is that based on any... any precedent of this Court's?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,119.312,120.327,No.
2007.07-330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,122.701,125.309,So just on the cross-appeal rule?
2007.07-330,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,125.309,131.76,I would have thought it would depend on what the mandate from the court of appeals said.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,141.568,142.24,Certainly.
2007.07-330,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,152.766,161.482,"Well, but the court of appeals... if your argument is correct, the court of appeals is limited solely by virtue of the failure to file a notice of cross-appeal."
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,164.309,170.401,"No, that's certainly true, that it would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule to allow the district court to do something that--"
2007.07-330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,170.401,174.212,"And it would also, I take it, be circumventing what could happen in the district court."
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,178.241,179.427,"--Yes, under this rule."
2007.07-330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.427,180.318,Other than for assistance--
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,180.318,184.238,"Yes, the district court has, I believe, seven days to correct the sentence."
2007.07-330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,184.238,185.988,This would not be a mathematical error?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,185.988,186.832,No.
2007.07-330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,188.612,201.029,I could have sworn that I've seen more than one petition for certiorari in which the claim is that the sentence was increased on remand vindictively.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,217.725,218.272,"--Yes, we--"
2007.07-330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,218.272,220.051,--Perhaps that's after a new trial.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,220.051,222.001,--Perhaps.
2007.07-330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,222.001,233.5,"What happens if it's... what happens if the sentence is five years, reversed on appeal, error in evidence, same... same offense, same indictment?"
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,235.936,242.372,I think it might be different if it were... if there were a new trial on the same indictment.
2007.07-330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.166,256.678,"What do you think is the rule if there's a new trial and the judge says, you know, what about this, I heard the evidence again; I think I'm going to increase the sentence?"
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,256.678,266.221,"Well, our argument would be that the government had forfeited the right to make that argument and that the district court would not be... you know, that would essentially be sua sponte ordering--"
2007.07-330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,266.221,269.11,But what's sua sponte--
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,269.11,269.86,"--You know, if the government had--"
2007.07-330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,269.86,270.485,--It's a resentence.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,273.015,279.184,--New judgment and conviction... it... the rule may be different.
2007.07-330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.2,284.667,Double jeopardy if it's a new judge?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,286.604,289.524,I... I'm not sure.
2007.07-330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.524,291.961,Who asked this question?
2007.07-330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.725,304.877,"Let's go back to where you started, and that was with the statute, 37... what is it?"
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,305.501,306.11,42.
2007.07-330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,306.11,306.814,--(f).
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,342.424,343.502,"Certainly, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-330,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,488.585,490.835,What happens if it's just the converse case?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,491.552,491.88,--I'm sorry?
2007.07-330,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,491.88,494.535,We have a government appeal.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,524.79,526.477,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2007.07-330,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.477,527.648,"Well, that's a pretty tough position."
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,556.511,557.104,Well--
2007.07-330,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,557.104,560.978,How is it supposed to work in your system that we get those errors corrected?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,560.978,562.572,"--I have three points, Justice Breyer."
2007.07-330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.826,597.122,I believe you say it has decided not to make an exception to the cross-appeal rule.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,601.525,605.352,"--The cross-appeal rule itself is not statutory, but--"
2007.07-330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,605.352,610.647,It's an arguable rule among the courts of appeal as to whether there is such a rule.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,610.647,613.833,"--It is indeed, Justice Stevens, but--"
2007.07-330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.833,616.176,So it's not surprising that Congress didn't make exception to a rule that isn't that firmly established.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,616.176,624.672,"--It is not surprising, but we know from the Organized Crime Control Act that Congress certainly was aware of the cross-appeal rule, because in that case it did carve out a limited exception."
2007.07-330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.492,652.317,I thought it was sort of an important part of your case that the cross-appeal rule was an established rule.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,654.738,658.159,"Well, we do believe it is jurisdictional, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.065,661.846,Not just jurisdictional but well-established.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,661.846,665.172,--We believe it is both well-established and jurisdictional.
2007.07-330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.332,700.518,But you say it is a well-established at least rule of practice.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,700.518,701.252,Absolutely.
2007.07-330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.252,703.062,And what's to be said against that?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,705.999,708.997,The Eighth Circuit in this case certainly does not apply it.
2007.07-330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.778,711.606,"Well, they--"
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,711.606,712.778,--They acknowledge.
2007.07-330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.778,714.823,--They didn't apply it under this statute.
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,725.07,733.988,The District of Columbia Circuit and the Ninth Circuit both regard it is a rule of practice that may be subject to exceptions and exceptional circumstances.
2007.07-330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,744.061,745.655,What difference does it make?
2007.07-330,0,16153,amy_howe,,757.665,763.679,"It makes a difference, Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that it cannot be waived if it is jurisdictional."
2007.07-330,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,784.123,784.905,"Thank you, Ms. Howe."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,798.993,818.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court of Appeals erred in increasing Petitioner's sentence for two reasons: First, it lacked jurisdiction to do so in the absence of a notice of appeal by the Government under 18 USC 3742(b)."
2007.07-330,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,834.791,840.025,"Now, if the cross-appeal rule is jurisdictional, how do you account for the sentencing-package cases?"
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,849.848,862.498,"--Those cases are not inconsistent with the finding of jurisdictional, Justice Alito, because in those cases the court of appeals has granted the defendant's requested relief, and it has vacated the judgment at the request of the defendant."
2007.07-330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.73,888.66,"But in this very case could the court of appeals said: We will grant the appellant a new sentencing hearing and send the case back to the district for resentencing; and, by the way, district judge, when you do the resentencing, take a look at the section that imposes a mandatory minimum?"
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,889.832,898.564,"If the court of appeals had found an error at the defendant's request, yes, Justice Stevens, and remanded it, depending on the scope of the mandate and under the scope of the mandate--"
2007.07-330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.564,902.625,And you could have ended up with precisely the same result that they ended up with in this case.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,902.625,910.435,--But it would have been a key difference in the sense that they would have found some of the defendant's claims on appeal correct.
2007.07-330,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,920.446,940.501,"So if the Court of Appeals had said that the sentence that was imposed by the district court was unreasonable by two months and accepted the defendant's argument to that extent and then remanded, on remand the district court could have corrected the sentence on the gun counts."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,940.501,942.547,It would have depended on how the mandate was worded.
2007.07-330,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.529,952.808,Even though the prosecution didn't ask for it?
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,975.174,976.549,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-330,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,990.372,991.261,Why not?
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,999.259,1005.709,"Before the district court, Justice Ginsburg, the government would be required to press the law."
2007.07-330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1033.291,1039.898,"Well, usually the mandate in these cases simply says, you know, the case is remanded to the district court."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1045.741,1058.547,"--The courts of appeals have different rules, Your Honor, about whether or not a general mandate of the type that you posit should be assumed to open up all issues for sentencing or not."
2007.07-330,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1062.594,1067.607,"Well, actually rule 35 was changed because it used to be based on the mandate."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1077.541,1078.682,"Well, no, Your Honor."
2007.07-330,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1093.456,1096.283,"Within the scope of the appeal, which brings us right back to this case."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1096.283,1097.971,--Within the scope of the mandate.
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1097.971,1104.263,I don't understand your mandate rule as being consistent with your general theory of the case.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1136.986,1137.72,Well--
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1137.72,1150.73,"Because, in effect, I think you are saying, by structuring the mandate in a certain way, the court of appeals can open the door to something that the court of appeals, itself, could not do."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1170.409,1179.251,"--I don't think it is anomalous, Your Honor, in a case in which the court of appeals has jurisdiction over a claim, grants the requested relief, and vacates the sentence."
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1182.936,1183.951,All right.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1207.737,1213.984,I don't know there's any court of appeals that has held that it could do that.
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1214.437,1222.231,Then what is the play in the mandate that you are assuming when you say it depends on the mandate?
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1226.433,1231.275,"--Well, I'm not sure I understand the--"
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1231.275,1246.566,"Where is the... what option does the court of appeals... given the limits on what the court of appeals itself can order, what are the options that the court of appeals has in writing the mandate that will determine what the district court can do?"
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1247.363,1258.342,"--I'm not sure that that's... I don't know the precise contours of that, Justice Souter, but if the court of appeals grants the Petitioner's request to vacate the sentence--"
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1258.342,1258.842,Yeah.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1258.842,1266.979,"--and then remands for resentencing, in a general way, that could leave open to the district court the ability to resentence."
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1266.979,1267.447,Okay.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1267.447,1268.072,But one--
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1268.072,1273.679,"Now you say that could leave open... if a mandate is general, that could leave open."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1276.491,1280.114,--Given the lack of an appeal here.
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1280.114,1280.708,Yeah.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1280.708,1281.145,By the government?
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1281.145,1281.504,Yeah.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1281.504,1294.078,I... I suppose it... it might do that.
2007.07-330,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1296.794,1299.966,I don't know about your initial premise.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1309.805,1310.508,--That's right.
2007.07-330,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1310.508,1313.069,"If he cross-appeals, fine; if he doesn't cross-appeal, he knows what the stakes are."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1313.069,1313.491,That's right.
2007.07-330,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1313.491,1321.035,"But now you're saying that if the sentence is... is vacated, they can start all over?"
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1329.767,1351.522,"Well, because it... once the court... if the Petitioner... I mean... at any risk in any appeal, and this is true in civil cases, too, you know, if you seek a new trial on damages, for example, in a civil case, because of instructional error, and you go back, I think, you know, the jury who decides the damages a second time isn't bound by the first jury's decision."
2007.07-330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.069,1359.864,So the... the defendant who is appealing has to be very careful about the relief he requests?
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1370.499,1381.369,--I think if the court of appeals finds error in the sentence it vacates under the... the remedial provisions in 3742 for the... for the court... for the district court to resentence the Petitioner.
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1381.776,1405.986,"Well... if that's the case, if the... if the... if it cannot be structured by the request for relief as the Chief Justice is suggesting, then on the Government's theory, in a case like this, if the defendant wins on appeal, he is in serious trouble when that case goes back to the district court; whereas if he loses, he can't be any worse off than he is now."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1408.562,1421.62,"--Well, if the defendant wins in the sentencing appeal, there... there's always a chance that on... on remand, the... the district court will reconfigure the sentence."
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1421.62,1436.676,"But in effect that means then... and this... I didn't understand this to be your position... but that means, in effect, that the cross-appeal rule is essentially, as you're arguing for it, a formality."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1455.981,1459.588,"Well, I think, you know, if you look at cases... recent... I think post-Booker for example--"
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1459.588,1463.789,"Well, I want to look at them but I want to know what your position is first."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1487.546,1487.952,--Right.
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1516.066,1521.299,Then the cross-appeals rule is essentially a rule of appellate court procedure and nothing more.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1521.299,1525.578,"--Well, I think in this situation, actually... it definitely is a rule of appellate court procedure."
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1525.578,1525.844,Yeah.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1526.155,1527.045,And it's definitely a mandatory--
2007.07-330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1527.045,1528.264,--But it doesn't go beyond that?
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1528.264,1529.67,--I think that's correct.
2007.07-330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1541.821,1547.912,"In that context, aren't... aren't you concerned about enlisting the court of appeals in doing something illegal?"
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1556.205,1557.096,--No.
2007.07-330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1562.704,1565.28,I'm reminded of what we do in statutory cases.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1579.071,1584.773,"Well, the Government is not agreeing that there was... with the Petitioner there was no deal error."
2007.07-330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1594.643,1595.987,"No, in my hypothetical they weren't agreeing."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1599.033,1599.705,Fair enough.
2007.07-330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.705,1600.938,And the right answer was C.
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1600.938,1607.67,"Fair enough, but here it is, there's no disagreement about what the merits of the governing law is; the question is, is that question properly before the court of appeals."
2007.07-330,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1607.67,1610.497,Why didn't the Government cross-appeal in this case?
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1610.497,1615.478,"There's nothing in the record to indicate why the government didn't cross-appeal, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1638.219,1642.03,Is there problem of getting the Solicitor General's office to authorize the appeal?
2007.07-330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1643.311,1645.326,Ms. Maynard--
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1645.326,1645.826,--But the--
2007.07-330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.826,1657.868,"--It seems to me many of these horribles really exist, however we decide this case."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1674.923,1677.922,"--Well, the amicus is arguing that's the meaning of 3742--"
2007.07-330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.922,1681.734,The statute talks about the general--
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1681.734,1682.451,--In general--
2007.07-330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.451,1683.201,--The general cross-appeal rule--
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1683.201,1684.654,--But there--
2007.07-330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.654,1692.432,"--It happens all the time, that there's an error in the judgment which the court of appeals does not... does not reach because there's no court... no cross-appeal."
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1694.495,1695.79,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2007.07-330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.531,1718.906,May I just ask this one question?
2007.07-330,1,21224,deanne_e_maynard,,1747.238,1748.785,"--Well, if I could make two points."
2007.07-330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1773.291,1773.853,"Thank you, Ms. Maynard."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,1778.46,1791.142,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three questions really in this case, and the Court need not resolve all of them depending upon how it resolves the others, but some of them get lost sometimes, so I would like to state what the three are."
2007.07-330,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1880.372,1889.477,"Mr. Jorgensen, suppose I think there's a larger anterior question to all of this?"
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,1963.572,1970.617,"--The answer to that question, Justice Ginsburg, is multi-part, and I'll try to move through it quickly."
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.343,1992.952,"Me, too."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,1995.138,2006.385,"The point being that once a crime has been proven, the law kicks in, and the defendant must be sentenced in accordance with lawful."
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.556,2062.063,"Could we discuss... let's leave aside for the moment what the background rule of law is and discuss whether... I guess it was your first point... whether this particular statute proscribes the answer, and therefore, we don't have to go any further."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2063.846,2072.404,"I believe that it does, Justice, because everybody agrees that the Sentencing Reform Act was a clean break with the past and imposed an entirely new regime."
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.219,2150.185,"Well, why would... why would Congress want a different disposition for (f)(1) than for (f)(2)?"
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2189.95,2191.777,"If I can give a two-part answer, Justice."
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.806,2242.71,"Wait, (2)(a) and (b) I thought... do I not have this right, (2)(a) and (b) say the same thing as (1)?"
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2256.297,2256.969,Indeed.
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.969,2260.359,"Subject to (g), which has to do with the district court."
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.525,2279.976,Not if it's too high and the defendant has appealed.
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2279.976,2280.679,That's what--
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.679,2283.021,Not if it's too high and the government has appealed.
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.021,2283.349,--That's right.
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.349,2287.302,"If it's too high and the government has appealed, you don't get any relief under... under--"
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.302,2287.724,"Yes, do you."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2295.172,2296.969,"You're exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.266,2350.651,"--Of course, that difference disappears if you say that, in fact, the whole thing assumes that the factor complained of has been brought to the court's attention by the proper person."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2373.455,2384.965,"--That... that... if the Court were to go there, Justice, I believe that goes back to you previous question of: Should we assume or should the Court believe that Congress was aware of its history--"
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2384.965,2393.775,The way to do this then is... is... I see... this section foresees basically what the other side is saying.
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2397.991,2398.428,--It is a very--
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.428,2408.284,"So the way you should handle it, given this section, is the court of appeals would send... I'm trying this on... the court of appeals says, well, it's the defendant that appealed, who appealed."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2437.71,2442.49,"--Well, importantly, Justice, one, two, three, and four, one being: Is it posed in violation of law?"
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.009,2472.166,But you don't have--
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.166,2482.756,"But it's not enough to say, well, we've noticed by the way we're... you know, in looking at the proper appeal by the proper... my goodness, look what we've noticed."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2502.936,2503.373,Indeed.
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2503.373,2504.107,And it's extraordinary.
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2504.107,2511.4,"Indeed, although it is what 3742 says, and I believe it's actually not that different than what happens with jurisdictional issues."
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.962,2514.431,Precisely so.
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2514.431,2518.194,"And then the court notices the ones that are obvious, has a duty to look for them because--"
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.194,2522.146,Which is why we have tried to pare down what is jurisdictional.
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2522.146,2530.237,"--And on that question, I... before the time runs out, I want to, Justice Scalia, follow up on your question, which is: What if the Court assumes that 3742 does not provide the answer?"
2007.07-330,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2607.503,2612.033,"Well, if it's discretionary, how would you... I assume it's reviewable for abuse of discretion."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2612.033,2612.733,--Indeed.
2007.07-330,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2612.733,2614.343,How would you know whether it's an abuse of discretion or not?
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2628.4,2633.538,"I believe the one that refused to correct such a plain error, obviously."
2007.07-330,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2633.538,2634.303,I thought you might say that.
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2636.74,2638.943,"But your question was, what is the standard?"
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2659.607,2660.607,"--Well, could do you this?"
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2713.336,2714.039,--I--
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2714.039,2722.457,"So if you were going to do something other than that, in the court of appeals, you'd have to have a reason, and it would have to be a fairly good reason."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2731.984,2733.859,"--I believe it does work, Justice Breyer."
2007.07-330,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2733.859,2734.968,All right.
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2734.968,2735.437,And I believe it--
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.437,2737.248,This argument is not an argument under the statute?
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2741.982,2743.169,--I believe that's right.
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2743.169,2745.62,And you would limit the background rule to plain error?
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2745.62,2747.572,"Yes... yes, Your Honor, I would."
2007.07-330,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2775.717,2777.405,But if it's such a--
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2777.405,2778.077,--of the same--
2007.07-330,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2778.077,2782.621,"--If it's such a plain error, it's fair to to ask why the Government didn't cross-appeal."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2783.058,2785.433,"--There is nothing in the record here, Justice, on that."
2007.07-330,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2793.649,2794.04,A blunder?
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2794.04,2794.773,--A blunder.
2007.07-330,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2802.771,2818.294,"Well, if this were to be a more frequent occurrence, i.e., plain errors, then we were to rule for you and court of appeals generally would do this, then a defendant might think twice about appealing in a complex case."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2818.294,2819.357,"That's true, Justice."
2007.07-330,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2819.357,2828.072,"Because there's nothing that could happen... once the district court rules and the seven days for error goes by, there's nothing that anybody can do to raise it."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2828.072,2833.866,"Well, the first part of your question was true, Justice Kennedy, but respectfully the second part was not."
2007.07-330,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2847.767,2851.109,"Well, he doesn't have to pursue it if the Government appeals."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2851.109,2851.671,That's exactly right.
2007.07-330,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2889.626,2897.467,I didn't understand that a party couldn't voluntarily withdraw a notice of appeal.
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2922.16,2924.457,"--That's a critical difference, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-330,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2931.812,2932.234,Yes.
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2932.234,2936.919,"But under the hypothetical we were discussing, I perhaps assumed incorrectly."
2007.07-330,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2946.166,2946.431,Right.
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2946.431,2951.539,"But if the government had never filed, you're exactly right that the defendant could take his back."
2007.07-330,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2969.079,2973.984,"Mr. Jorgensen, may I take you back to something you mentioned earlier in the argument?"
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,2995.131,2995.553,--Right.
2007.07-330,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2995.553,3003.097,"--the concern is that, if there is an error, it's an error which will in effect infect all cases."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,3044.19,3053.202,"Well, Justice Souter, the lines between A 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not as bright as they might be."
2007.07-330,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3074.819,3078.396,"If that's all it said, I would certainly understand your distinction."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,3078.396,3088.281,"And then 2 is an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines, which, again, at the time of the Sentencing Reform Act were intended to be, I believe, mandatory."
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3088.281,3089.078,So that it was a violation of law?
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,3089.078,3089.828,Indeed.
2007.07-330,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3105.463,3115.957,"I guess the problem I still have is some incorrect applications of the sentencing guidelines pre-Booker were, in fact, violations of law."
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,3146.274,3147.79,"--I think that's right, Justice Souter."
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.261,3183.588,"What do we mean by the ""sentencing packaging rule""?"
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,3183.588,3186.025,"--That's a very good question, Justice Scalia."
2007.07-330,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.62,3257.9,"Getting what he deserves, right?"
2007.07-330,2,31206,jay_t_jorgensen,,3257.9,3258.135,--Exactly.
2007.07-330,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3416.384,3417.634,"--Thank you, counsel."
2007.07-330,3,16153,amy_howe,,3420.586,3423.413,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have two points."
2007.07-330,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3483.779,3485.184,(E) also contradicts (f)--
