2009.08-538,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.279,"We'll hear argument next in Case 08-538, Schwab v. Reilly."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,7.168,8.229,Thank you.
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,56.758,65.614,"Mr. Goldblatt, I thought that what she said -- I'm looking at Schedule C, property claimed as exempt."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,92.383,94.879,"With respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's incorrect."
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,177.534,194.513,"But she -- in her inventory, she gives figures, and they add up to the amount that she's claiming, so she evidently thinks that those numbers will cover all of her business equipment."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,194.513,199.512,"Justice Ginsburg, it may -- that may well be true."
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,218.502,222.156,"Mr. -- Mr. Goldblatt, this is -- this is really my concern."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,251.066,255.021,"--Your Honor, the debtor here may well have wanted the equipment."
2009.08-538,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,291.941,304.67,"Well, that would be a remarkable coincidence if her equipment happened to be worth exactly what Congress said she could exempt, which is a very odd way of reading what she's put in the schedule."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,304.67,317.808,"We -- Mr. Chief Justice, we think the most natural way to read what she has said in the schedule is that she's claiming exactly what she says, which is that she is claiming a $10,718 interest in the property."
2009.08-538,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,318.416,328.71,I would have thought the most natural way of reading it is that she's claiming the equipment because she thinks that's the value of the equipment.
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,328.71,335.908,"--If she wanted to claim the equipment itself as exempt, there were a number of ways that one could do that."
2009.08-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.372,352.731,"Where would she say that, 100 percent interest in the equipment?"
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,355.543,357.789,"In either column -- yes, in column 3."
2009.08-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.789,360.335,"Column 3 says ""Value of claimed exemption""."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,360.335,363.758,Debtors can certainly list in the schedule.
2009.08-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.736,371.128,"Well, I mean, you say that."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,377.033,377.423,--There's a--
2009.08-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.423,380.14,"It has a column that says ""Value of claimed exemption""."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,380.14,385.307,"--Correct, and the value of the claimed exemption here was $10,718--"
2009.08-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.307,385.744,Right.
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,385.744,388.51,--which is exactly what the trustee proposes to give her.
2009.08-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.51,389.183,Right.
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,389.183,390.665,That claim of exemption was proper.
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.65,432.226,"Then you're going through all the administrative expenses of having an auction where if the trustee had tipped her off, it would be like amending your pleading."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,432.226,441.565,"--Well, in fairness, in this case itself, the trustee happened to come to the section 341 meeting and say: I believe that there's value here for the estate."
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,444.092,450.292,"And she was so -- so upset, she said: I'll get out of the bankruptcy; I want my cooking equipment."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,450.292,451.201,"--That's right, but--"
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,451.201,453.244,It was very clear that that's what the debtor wanted.
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,453.244,461.617,--And it was equally clear that the trustee took the position that she was entitled to the exemption that Congress permits and no more than that.
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,462.665,481.141,"The question is whether -- the question is whether the trustee had to make an objection, when it seemed really as clear as could be that what she was seeking was to keep her equipment, not to get the -- some monetary equivalent for it."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,481.141,500.729,"--With respect, Justice Ginsburg, imagine you had a debtor who -- who came into court and said: Look, I believe my equipment is worth something equal to the amount that is permissible, that I may permissibly claim as exempt, but I don't mean to make an improper in-kind exemption."
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,545.258,554.659,"Well, then she has -- on your reading, her claim is improper because she's claiming more than she's entitled to."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,559.374,564.404,"--Justice Ginsburg, it's only improper if it's read to mean something different from what it says."
2009.08-538,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,588.098,595.469,"When I look at that number, I -- and maybe I don't understand this, so maybe you or your adversary can clarify it for me."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,619.003,622.192,--That's -- that's certainly -- we think that that's right.
2009.08-538,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,622.192,625.503,And the question is which of those is the more plausible reading?
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,625.503,632.966,"Right, and we -- we think that -- that for a number of reasons, the more plausible reading is to say: All I want is what the law permits me."
2009.08-538,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.777,654.882,"Except that the -- that the last column does -- it's very clearly entitled ""Current market value of property"" without deducting exemptions."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,665.36,675.623,"--That's exactly right, Justice Scalia, but the critical point is that there is no requirement that any trustee come in and object to a valuation if the valuation is improper."
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,676.31,690.96,"Can you -- can you -- that was -- what you've just said, no requirement that the trustee object to valuation, one of the briefs -- it may have been wrong, but it's the NACBA brief at page 27 -- said"
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,697.94,701.204,"--Let me -- let me explain this for a moment, if I may."
2009.08-538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,743.139,747.733,"In that case -- in that case, I guess there wouldn't be a -- a lawsuit."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,747.733,748.091,--No.
2009.08-538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.043,750.482,"I mean, in that case, the debtor is never going to object."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,751.434,752.061,That's exactly right.
2009.08-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,786.748,794.823,"Well, they don't always liquidate the asset, if they -- if they elect -- if everybody agrees that they get the asset itself, they don't have to sell it."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,794.823,795.837,That's exactly right.
2009.08-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,800.212,805.131,"What -- what -- what you are doing there, you -- you argue that ambiguities are construed against the person that made the form."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,812.926,813.269,--Well--
2009.08-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,813.269,830.059,"On the other hand, I think what you have going for you is that the trustee is going to always be at risk that the asset is worth more than what's listed and is going to have to take steps to value it in every -- every case."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,840.979,843.646,"--That's right, and that was subject to a security interest here."
2009.08-538,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,843.646,851.691,"And -- and if you take that together with -- and -- and the kitchen equipment comes next, and she -- and the value is the same in each column."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,856.657,866.075,"With -- with respect to the -- the automobile, there's -- there's a claim of exemption and the rest is subject to a security interest."
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,910.479,915.381,"My concern is keeping it simple, giving fair notice to people."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,946.994,956.848,"--With respect, Justice Ginsburg, a -- a simpler rule would be that if a debtor wants to say, I have an in-kind exemption in an asset, the debtor should say that."
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.691,965.548,But it's not in kind in the sense that she keeps the asset no matter what.
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,965.548,968.044,"Well, that's exactly what the debtor is contending here."
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,973.386,982.553,She is contending that she would like to keep her cooking equipment and she was entitled to notice before it's going to be sold at an auction.
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,982.553,985.037,"--With respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's not right."
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1010.232,1016.074,"Then -- then her claim is wrong, her claim is objectionable, and the trustee should have made an objection."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1016.074,1039.58,"But the best reading of her schedule is not to make such a claim, but rather to read her schedule to -- to mean what it says, which is that she claimed to have a $10,718 exemption in the property, and insofar as the property is worth more than that, that that's -- that -- that is a question of valuation, which isn't the subject of an obligation to raise an objection."
2009.08-538,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1071.064,1075.877,"Has that happened in the two circuits that apply a rule similar to this, the Sixth and the Third?"
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1075.877,1087.403,"What I understand, Justice Sotomayor, is that that -- the answer to that is yes and that in the Third Circuit following this decision that trustees are filing those kinds of pro forma objections."
2009.08-538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.403,1087.793,Why?
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1098.975,1100.038,And--
2009.08-538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1100.038,1102.584,"If it appears everybody can work everything out, fine."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1103.645,1108.332,--The -- the question is what is the rule where -- where there remains disagreement?
2009.08-538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1108.753,1115.531,"The rule is -- and that's what it's about -- the rule is about where you object, the trustee objects to the list."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1116.705,1117.407,--And -- and--
2009.08-538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.407,1118.062,That's called Schedule C.
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1131.492,1132.12,"--No, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-538,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1132.12,1132.603,What's the problem?
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1132.603,1135.586,It's just different from what the -- what the statute says.
2009.08-538,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1160.968,1174.663,"If it's not the asset itself and it's just about money, here I have a piece of property and it wouldn't matter whether it was a case of widgets or my grandmother's diamond ring."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1193.439,1207.478,"Well, but those have always been subject -- as this Court explained in Owens v. Owens, those types of -- of -- of assets have always been subject to monetary caps, and the same is true here, and 522(d) makes that clear."
2009.08-538,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1213.896,1215.46,"Well, thank you, Mr. Goldblatt."
2009.08-538,0,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1216.832,1217.71,"I appreciate that, Your Honor."
2009.08-538,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1217.71,1224.238,Mr. Wall.
2009.08-538,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1224.238,1236.607,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government is not saying that it's a coincidence that these numbers in the third and fourth columns are the same."
2009.08-538,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1288.354,1300.614,"What she did do, she said: That unsettles me so much that I'm going to withdraw from this bankruptcy proceeding; beyond anything, I want to keep that -- that property."
2009.08-538,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1300.614,1301.503,--That's right.
2009.08-538,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1324.962,1333.459,But the -- but the Bankruptcy Court did that simultaneously with saying: And I'm going to deny the trustee's motion to have an auction.
2009.08-538,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1333.459,1333.927,That's right.
2009.08-538,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1383.985,1386.14,What she could have done is trimmed some items from the list.
2009.08-538,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1386.14,1387.639,--And she still could on remand.
2009.08-538,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1412.99,1414.16,That sounds very complicated.
2009.08-538,2,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,1423.986,1424.813,Well--
2009.08-538,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1424.813,1426.248,Look at the procedural rule.
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1463.376,1465.375,"--Well, there are a number of questions there, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-538,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.023,1484.241,But Rule 403 doesn't say that.
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1495.16,1495.55,That's right.
2009.08-538,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1495.55,1496.19,"It says ""the list""."
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1509.51,1512.244,"Well, it says the list of property claimed as exempt."
2009.08-538,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1547.32,1558.516,Is it also true -- tell me about this: One of my concerns is that the trustees simply don't have time in every case to have a creditors' meeting and go through every asset.
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1569.153,1570.997,I think that's entirely fair.
2009.08-538,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.519,1598.08,He has to.
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1601.936,1602.342,Exactly.
2009.08-538,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1613.51,1622.086,"So what does she put down if she thinks this is what the property is worth, but she doesn't know for sure?"
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1626.645,1634.783,"Well, the debtor would do exactly what she did here, and if the trustee went to sell and she had remaining exemption left, she could come in and amend her schedules and say--"
2009.08-538,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.783,1645.37,"But that goes through -- I think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you have to go through a long process if you're going to have an auction, and for this sole proprietorship, it seems like a waste of money and time."
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1645.37,1651.773,"--Well, if the debtor actually wanted to claim, say, full value or 100 percent of value -- there are debtors that commonly do that."
2009.08-538,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1656.413,1656.866,"Well, that's right."
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1668.518,1670.472,--I don't even think it has to be an asterisk.
2009.08-538,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1685.746,1692.99,"That's much less informative than if she said -- I mean, here she -- she has one list that's showing what she paid for it."
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1748.361,1757.014,"--Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, the debtor does have a duty to report the market value in the fourth column, what she believes it to be, but the third column supports her claim and--"
2009.08-538,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.014,1760.84,"That -- is that where she would write 100 percent -- in the third column, rather than the fourth?"
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1760.84,1761.308,"--Well, no."
2009.08-538,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1802.838,1803.041,Would she--
2009.08-538,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1803.041,1804.211,"Well, now, wait."
2009.08-538,3,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1833.09,1842.43,"Justice Scalia, wherever the debtor lists a contingent term in the third column, whether it's unknown or 100 percent of value, the trustee absolutely has to object."
2009.08-538,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.788,1848.677,I see.
2009.08-538,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1848.677,1854.581,"Thank you, Mr. Wall."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1861.218,1867.511,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Ginsburg, your reading of the schedules is completely accurate."
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1879.397,1880.29,"But she could have said ""in full""."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1883.336,1884.725,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the form--"
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1884.725,1885.551,"Or 100 percent of value> [""]."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1885.551,1887.957,"--Justice Kennedy, the form doesn't call for that."
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1889.205,1893.05,"Now, you've said that there's nothing else she could do, and I said, of course, there's something else she could do."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1895.503,1896.096,--That's--
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1896.096,1900.311,"I mean, I understand your position, but you can't say there's nothing else she could have done."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1901.531,1910.199,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, but consistent with the form and the information the form requests, she completely and accurately provided the information the form requests."
2009.08-538,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1951.586,1965.421,"So if it turns out that this business equipment was worth $100,000 and the trustee looks at it and says, oh, she's only claiming -- you know, less than she's entitled, $10,000, and doesn't object, she gets that dramatic windfall."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1965.421,1972.229,"--Just so I'm clear, Chief Justice Roberts, if she claims that she -- $15,000, but she puts a value of $100,000?"
2009.08-538,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1972.729,1973.384,"Oh, no, no."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,1987.411,1992.831,"--Well, if she undervalues her equipment, for a hundred years, Chief Justice Roberts, that has been grounds for objection."
2009.08-538,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1994.956,1996.08,"Well, this -- the trustee doesn't know."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2012.321,2023.782,"--Not quite, Chief Justice Roberts, and here's why: The trustee gets the form, and then there is the meeting of creditors, and the trustee gets to ask questions before the deadline actually occurs."
2009.08-538,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2047.476,2050.318,"No, but the point is, that drags out the whole process."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2068.405,2070.841,"Yes, Your Honor, but that's what the statute does."
2009.08-538,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2154.322,2165.725,"Well, when she put down the figure $10,718 on page 58a of the Joint Appendix, what did she mean by that?"
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2165.725,2170.707,"In the last column, Justice Alito?"
2009.08-538,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2170.707,2170.895,Yes.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2170.895,2178.858,She meant that the value she claimed in full of her property was what she was claiming as exempt.
2009.08-538,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2179.295,2179.841,She meant that that was--
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2179.841,2180.168,--She held the property.
2009.08-538,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2180.168,2188.104,"--She had -- she had figured out the value of the property, and her estimation of its fair market value was $10,718?"
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2188.104,2188.868,Yes.
2009.08-538,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2192.304,2194.398,"It wasn't $10,717?"
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2199.552,2203.503,"--That was her valuation of the equipment, Justice Alito."
2009.08-538,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.503,2204.86,"Well, it's not a realistic valuation."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2213.073,2215.057,"No, Justice Scalia, because she didn't exhaust--"
2009.08-538,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.057,2222.93,It's just -- her valuation just happened to be exactly the amount that the two exemptions she had would add up to.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2222.93,2226.398,"--No, Justice Scalia, she did not exhaust her exemption availability."
2009.08-538,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2265.191,2267.471,But that's a -- that's a totally different question.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2290.168,2294.523,"--No, Justice Alito, because $10,718 is not her max."
2009.08-538,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2311.688,2324.105,"Now, can you elaborate on this additional -- she -- you said she could have listed something that came to a higher number."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2331.912,2334.536,--She used it for perishable food items.
2009.08-538,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.315,2339.021,"Well, but she was maxed out."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2358.352,2360.383,"Actually, the other way around, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2369.379,2371.723,But how do you know that from the form?
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2402.351,2404.52,"Actually, I think, Justice Kennedy, the opposite."
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2414.875,2419.73,"Well, but therein -- the problem was triggered when they put in the word ""unknown""."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2419.73,2426.278,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy, but that was the appropriate thing to say for that particular asset, an unliquidated lawsuit."
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.016,2453.157,Do you have any sense of how it works in practice?
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2501.87,2507.306,"Yes, Justice Breyer, there has not been an avalanche of pro forma objections being filed in these cases."
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2507.306,2509.209,"Yes, but how did it work normally for years and years?"
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2515.078,2516.096,Yes.
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.096,2521.2,"And when that happened, did trustees file objections within 30 days or didn't they?"
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2521.2,2522.729,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2522.729,2523.353,How do we know that?
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2527.132,2528.789,"In the court of appeals, yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2530.15,2531.835,"He had been a bankruptcy judge, so maybe he knows."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2531.835,2532.958,Certainly--
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2532.958,2537.801,"Now, I don't know who knows, because I'm worried the government has looked into this, and somebody's telling them who knows it's the opposite."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2537.801,2560.574,"--Justice Breyer, under the rules, the trustee has the burden of objecting if the trustee has any basis for objection, including valuation, and -- but the trustee has to have a good faith reason for objecting, and how that is determined is the trustee looks at the schedules, asks questions at the meeting of creditors, a section 341 meeting, and then if the trustee has any objection at all, present it."
2009.08-538,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2565.195,2571.739,"Now, under your rule, the trustee has 30 days to get this good faith basis."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2597.136,2602.069,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor, and the trustee has had that burden for about a hundred years."
2009.08-538,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2608.913,2617.363,"No, there's a huge difference between a rule that says you don't have to actually go after this information in a formal way."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2649.99,2654.486,"But they'd have to do that in their motion to sell anyway, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2668.774,2672.836,"You mean in every single case where an asset is sold, there has to be a valuation beforehand?"
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2672.836,2678.865,"--In a situation where the debtor claims the property as exempt, yes, and here's why, Justice Kennedy: Because the trustee again can--"
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2678.865,2680.815,If -- if he claims the whole property is exempt?
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2680.815,2706.572,"--Well, if the debtor claims the whole property is exempt, then it's not property of the estate unless the trustee interposes a timely and successful objection, because section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, which authorizes sales, only specifically authorizes sales of property of the estate; and if someone claims property as exempt, if no objection is interposed under 522(l), then the property claimed as -- is exempt."
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2706.572,2716.254,"My question was -- I thought I understood your remark to say anytime there's a sale, there has to be a valuation or an appraisal before the sale."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2716.254,2720.204,"If, in fact, the debtor claims the property as exempt, that's correct."
2009.08-538,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2726.151,2727.543,Do we know what -- what's--
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2727.543,2735.213,But that -- but the very fact that it's -- that there's going to be a sale may indicate that your premise is not true most of the time.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2735.213,2746.8,"No, Justice Kennedy, and here's why: because the statute, for example, points that the court is going to determine in the first instance whether the objection claim is valid, if there is in fact an objection."
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.24,2785.646,I'm very confused because of your answer to Justice Sotomayor.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2797.188,2797.796,"I'm sorry, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.796,2798.498,You said less time.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2824.1,2824.942,I am certain about it.
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2824.942,2825.083,You are certain?
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2825.083,2826.471,"I would say that, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-538,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2831.362,2831.798,All right.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2844.574,2849.851,"--Justice Breyer, the practical reality is that there are over a million bankruptcy cases that are filed a year."
2009.08-538,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2895.225,2908.842,"--Here I thought that the trustee got the appraisal before the creditors' meeting, because at the creditors' meeting he said to her, you put down, what, 10,000; I have an estimate that says $17,000."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,2908.842,2910.374,--Yes.
2009.08-538,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3002.072,3007.632,"Mr. Brunstad, do we know what is the division among bankruptcy judges on this issue?"
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3025.231,3030.619,"--Not precisely, Justice Ginsburg, because many of these issues are resolved by unpublished orders."
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3049.112,3052.329,"Well, once again, Taylor had the word ""unknown"", and this doesn't."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3052.844,3058.982,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, so the courts have to apply the holding in Taylor to a slightly different factual context."
2009.08-538,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3083.084,3084.753,You mean if the trustee thinks there's a problem?
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3084.753,3086.879,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, thank you for correcting me."
2009.08-538,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3093.562,3104.106,"Counsel, in -- what's interesting is that all of the circuits or most, the majority, have not announced the fixed rule."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3161.628,3170.639,"I can see that, Justice Sotomayor, but I think that here are much worse incentives with the trustee's rule, and much worse problems, much greater harm to the statutory scheme."
2009.08-538,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3217.932,3218.385,No.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3258.507,3263.881,"--It's not an irrational conclusion, except it is one that is contrary to the statutory scheme."
2009.08-538,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3269.879,3270.035,No.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3282.327,3288.791,"Yes, but, Justice Sotomayor, it is the filing of the objection that triggers the negotiation, and this is key."
2009.08-538,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3303.567,3308.047,"Most of these cases, the objections are -- the discussions are not at the time of objection."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3320.405,3325.401,"--But if there is no objection, then is no involvement of the court, and the conversation stops."
2009.08-538,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3412.787,3425.453,But this debtor did know at the creditors' meeting -- she certainly knew that the trustee was claiming the property was worth more than what she listed it as being worth.
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3445.162,3448.426,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-538,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3607.112,3609.343,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-538,4,25004,g_eric_brunstad_jr,,3609.343,3609.577,Thank you.
2009.08-538,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3609.577,3611.327,"Now, Mr. Goldblatt, 2 minutes."
2009.08-538,5,18983,craig_g_goldblatt,,3611.327,3614.155,Thank you.
2009.08-538,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3747.631,3748.77,"Thank you, counsel."
