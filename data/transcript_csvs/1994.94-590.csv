1994.94-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.737,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-590, Vernonia School District."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,8.07,9.653,"Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,9.653,11.272,--Versus Wayne Acton.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,12.555,15.657,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,36.403,45.493,"Has it identified that threat as drug use, as opposed to, sort of a lot of bragging about drug use?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,73.095,108.084,"--The hard evidence of drug use consists, Justice Souter, of observations on numerous occasions by a teacher of students smoking marijuana across the street, arrests of student athletes for using drugs, confiscation of drug paraphernalia on school grounds, admissions by students to the principal that they have used drugs, admissions by certain student athletes to the coaches that they had used drugs, coaches' observations of marijuana coming from the room of athletes the day after a serious injury--"
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,108.084,110.101,"Well, there was one example of that, for example."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,110.868,112.303,"--I'm sorry, of what?"
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,112.303,122.825,"I mean, the... as I recall the briefs, there was one example of a coach going into a... I think it was a wrestler's room, and he smelled... after the kid had been injured, and he smelled pot."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,124.944,132.515,"There were no other instances that I can recall from the record, Justice Souter, where the smell of marijuana, where the teachers or coaches noticed the smell of marijuana."
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,132.515,152.428,"I think that's what's bothering me, because... I'm sure you didn't intend this, but I think you spoke of it in the plural, and yet there was only one instance of it, and that's why I'm troubled by the difficulty of figuring out just what is provably there about use, as opposed to what is generalization, or what is generalization about student bragging."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,152.428,175.709,"Well, I could only answer that by saying that I believe that we have numerous... I don't believe, we do have numerous observations, admissions, proof of athletes being arrested for the use of drugs, and there is... I believe what you're referring to is, there is one instance, and I did not mean to speak of it in the plural, where a wrestler... where a coach smelled marijuana coming from a wrestler's room."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.565,199.242,"Well, Mr. Volpert, did the school district try a drug testing scheme based on reasonable suspicion that a particular student might be experimenting with drugs?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,199.242,202.877,"--If you mean urinalysis drug testing, Justice O'Connor, no, they did not."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.877,208.281,"Well, the same kind of testing you're doing under... or the school was doing under this random--"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,208.281,209.448,"No, they--"
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.448,210.3,--testing.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,217.703,218.403,--We did not--
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.403,220.005,--Ask them to be tested.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,220.005,221.222,--Excuse me.
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.059,225.926,Why not?
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,225.926,229.861,There's no direct evidence in the record with regard to that.
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.601,268.386,Or relying on what people have been saying.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,273.89,274.373,"--Well, the--"
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.373,275.075,--that it might be true?
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,275.075,289.419,"--The problem is that if someone says on Wednesday that they have used drugs in the past, I am not at all convinced that there would be a reasonable suspicion sufficient to test them at that time, just based on conversations of past drug use."
1994.94-590,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,289.419,317.902,"Do you think that the rule that we announce ought to be a rule that's specific on a school-by-school, case-by-case basis, or would it be plausible for us to say, a) there is a drug problem of dangerous proportions in this middle and high school population throughout the country, and that even those schools that are relatively drug free have a strong interest in keeping themselves that way?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,317.902,325.842,"Justice Kennedy, I believe that this Court's holdings in Skinner and Von Raab, this Court could reach such a conclusion."
1994.94-590,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.232,338.515,"Each district, or each school?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,354.361,367.669,"If the school district on the local level determined that there was a serious drug problem in one of the schools, and after deliberation reached a reasonable conclusion that there was an immediate threat to the other schools, I believe you could."
1994.94-590,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,367.669,375.958,How about our decision in the City of Renton case dealing with adult bookstores and so forth?
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,387.415,396.121,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that certainly a school district could rely on evidence of a drug problem in neighboring school districts."
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,433.211,439.013,"Now, by the same reasoning, shouldn't testing then be allowed through the entire school population?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,450.321,464.663,"Justice Souter, under the facts of this case, I believe we have probably made a sufficient case for drug testing of the entire student body of the Vernonia School District."
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,464.663,474.538,"Because your argument basically is that the nonathletes tend to follow the lead of the athletes, so that if your hypothesis is right, then sort of--"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,474.538,475.854,No.
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,475.854,477.74,--throughout the school population you're doing this.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,477.74,479.323,"No, that would not be our argument."
1994.94-590,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,503.021,512.913,"Mr. Volpert, isn't there a significant difference between the people who go to school, who are required to go to school by State law, and athletes?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,535.577,544.432,"Justice Ginsburg, in this case we have a serious threat to athletes and a serious threat to preservation of discipline and order in the schools."
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,564.36,568.83,"But didn't you also say that you had it here, that you had made the case here, or could have made the case here?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,568.83,573.115,--I think hypothetically we could have made that case under these facts.
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,573.115,581.221,"So that you didn't... on your theory you didn't need, as Justice Ginsburg points out, the feature of the voluntary consent form."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,581.221,585.858,Our case is based on both.
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,594.048,598.416,"Serious enough problem, you don't need the consent; less serious problem, you might need it?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,598.416,600.452,Extreme problem.
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,600.452,601.718,Let me ask a different question.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,611.407,625.567,"Well, I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because if you... it's kind of hard to characterize the record in this case, but when you read the record in its entirety, you realize the extent to which drug use became... the extent to which disciplinary problems became pervasive."
1994.94-590,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,625.567,626.602,"But Mr. Volpert, we have findings."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,632.506,632.906,Correct.
1994.94-590,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.906,635.039,Rejected... even though the Ninth Circuit came out the other way.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,651.967,669.929,"The district court found, Justice Ginsburg, a startling and progressive increase in the use and glamorization of drugs, characterized the studert body being in a state of rebellion, characterized... said a general flagrant attitude that there was nothing the school could do about their conduct or drug use typified a usual day."
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.368,678.802,None of that sounds like it's confined to athletes.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,678.802,679.654,Pardon me?
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.654,681.87,None of that sounds like it's confined to athletes.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,681.87,690.26,"Justice Stevens, the district court found that the athletes were among the leaders of the group in the classroom who were causing disruptions."
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.26,694.663,How do they know that if they don't have individualized suspicion?
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,695.546,696.779,How do they know that--
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.779,697.263,Yes.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,697.263,699.898,--That the athletes were being disruptive?
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,699.898,700.567,"No, no."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,707.554,725.266,"Well, the district courts referred to the conclusion that this was... that the conduct was drug-related, if that's what you're asking, as being inescapable, and the Ninth Circuit said that the district... the district officials observed conduct which was so far out of the norm that drug use was a logical conclusion."
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,725.649,727.551,"Well, that would be individualized suspicion, wouldn't it?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,727.551,730.52,"--Well, I don't think so necessarily."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,751.766,764.558,"But Mr. Volpert, isn't that pretty much what the Fourth Amendment is designed to require, something based on individualized suspicion, and the school district didn't even try that, did they?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,764.558,765.426,--Well--
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,765.426,783.737,"I mean, the school made no effort to at least launch its program on the basis of some kind of testing based on individualized suspicion, and I think in the school context we've said it doesn't have to be probable cause, but there was no effort made to do that, was there?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,783.737,786.089,"--There was no... let me draw a distinction, Justice O'Connor."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.375,789.725,Right.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,789.725,794.493,"The district took many, many steps to try to solve it as a behavioral problem--"
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,794.493,794.945,Well--
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,794.945,795.962,--observing behavior and dealing with it.
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,795.962,796.779,--let me ask you this.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,827.583,832.035,We have never relied on the consent form in this case.
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,832.535,832.968,But could you?
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,832.968,833.737,--did not sign a consent.
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,834.837,840.908,"Yes, so you might have some combination in effect."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,840.908,849.747,"The problem, Justice O'Connor, with individualized suspicion is clear in our record in the problem of drugs, it was clear in the record in Skinner, and clear in the record in Von Raab."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,858.185,861.804,"A reasonable suspicion doesn't mean for certain, does it?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,861.804,885.753,"--No, it does not, but when you are asking a teacher to actually make an accusation of drug use, and that accusation is based on a number of circumstances, it is far less intrusive in a circumstance like this to allow the random drug testing rather than just fingering individual athletes, taking them to the principal's office, and make them submit to the test."
1994.94-590,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,886.539,895.144,"It's not only less intrusive, I take it the suggestion of individualized suspicion would alter fundamentally the relation between the student and the teacher."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,895.144,896.96,"--I think it would, Justice Kennedy."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,911.82,916.641,"Not accused, just asked to be tested, isn't that the proposal?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,916.641,930.382,"--Except that in the situation of individualized suspicion, you are telling an individual student, I believe that you are using drugs, and I think the Court must focus on the burden that that places on teachers to actually make that type of accusation."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,932.068,946.743,"Well, if it's combined, however... if all the school wants to do is test student athletes, and if all but a handful have signed valid consent forms, I assume as to those with valid consent forms that the existing program could be used."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,952.731,953.947,That would.
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,969.693,973.728,How long was this random testing in effect in the school?
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,973.728,979.132,"It began in the fall of 1989, and the decision from the Ninth Circuit was rendered last spring."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,979.132,984.035,"And during that interval of time, how many tests turned up positive?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,984.035,989.17,"I believe the testimony was, an estimate from the superintendent, two or three."
1994.94-590,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.17,991.939,"It must have been a very effective program, then--"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,991.939,993.272,"Well, it was a very effective--"
1994.94-590,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.572,995.407,"--Shows how effective it was, I suppose."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,995.407,997.041,"I believe it does, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-590,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,997.341,1000.961,"One side says it shows no problem, the other side it shows how effective it is--"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1017.387,1021.339,--I will focus on the question about alcohol.
1994.94-590,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.217,1049.156,"Well, maybe it was because they did not think that the drinking of alcohol, which kids have been doing for a long time, produced the kind of classroom disruption that harder drugs do."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1049.156,1054.226,"There is a comment, Justice Scalia, from Principal Aultman to that effect, that alcohol has been around for a long time."
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.943,1060.48,"That makes alcohol use by high school students okay, that it's been around a long time?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1060.48,1061.414,"No, I think--"
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.414,1062.43,I don't understand that one.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1062.43,1072.855,"--No, I'm not... no one's saying it's okay, Justice Stevens, but I think the school board made a determination that these drugs were what were causing the problem, and it's one of the types of decisions the Court--"
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.855,1077.24,"Do these tests pick up steroids, which I suppose athletes might be more inclined to take?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1077.24,1078.406,--It did not test for steroids.
1994.94-590,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.406,1083.227,The one athlete related drug that might be involved.
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1083.227,1091.731,"There's no evidence in the record as to why that is, although I understand that steroid testing is very expensive, and the district may have made the determination based on the cost."
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1091.731,1095.368,"May I ask you a question which you may have answered, I just seem to be unclear on it."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1113.246,1118.447,"Justice Souter, we have never argued or briefed that issue."
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1118.447,1128.255,"So your position is... here is that both, i.e., the behavioral evidence and the consent forms, are sufficient, and that's as far as your argument goes?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1128.255,1128.838,No.
1994.94-590,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1140.996,1142.529,"Oh, even without the consent from?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1142.529,1144.615,"Even without the consent form, yes."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1149.168,1159.874,"But I thought you answered my question about the consent form to the effect that that alone would provide the basis for random testing, if you didn't have more."
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1162.992,1166.694,"I didn't understand that to be your question, Justice O'Connor."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1166.694,1169.396,So what is your answer?
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1169.396,1171.912,Could I ask you to restate the question?
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1171.912,1189.108,"Suppose all you had was a consent form, validly obtained, knowingly, willingly given by the student and the student's parents, is that enough for that student to be randomly tested for drugs, using the test in this case?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1189.108,1192.809,"We have never taken the position that it was, because consent was not given in this case."
1994.94-590,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1192.809,1193.677,"Well, what is your position today?"
1994.94-590,0,43417,timothy_r_volpert,,1193.677,1196.379,"I'm sorry, I do not have a position on that."
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1204.367,1215.025,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-590,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1362.121,1367.841,"Mr. Seamon, do you think the evidence would have supported a random program not limited to athletes, but for the entire student body?"
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1367.841,1371.793,I don't think that it would have supported a program for the entire student body.
1994.94-590,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1390.255,1394.075,"It's a little bit like saying going to graduation is a voluntary activity, as far as I'm concerned."
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1417.006,1424.262,"--The required courses are of course more important, in our view, than extracurricular activities."
1994.94-590,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.056,1448.46,"So I guess a school where it has a problem with drug use where it isn't the athletes who seem to be leading the thing, they're just sort of out of luck."
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1459.851,1461.101,We would not draw a line--
1994.94-590,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.101,1461.867,Very strange.
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1461.867,1464.636,--to limit drug testing to student athletes.
1994.94-590,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.29,1472.492,That wasn't the question you were asked.
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1478.996,1482.697,--I'm sorry if I misstated our position.
1994.94-590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1507.998,1514.752,Didn't the district here have some fear of injury to the athletes as a result of drug use?
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1514.752,1515.802,"Yes, that's right."
1994.94-590,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1527.043,1539.886,"Well, Mr. Seamon, you started, I thought, to tell us why the school district couldn't rely on individualized reasonable suspicion, but I never heard you answer that question that you posed."
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1540.603,1544.921,"--Well, I... let me complete the answer to that question."
1994.94-590,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.896,1557.515,But some was.
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1559.815,1560.3,--And some was.
1994.94-590,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1560.3,1568.553,Could the school district have relied on the consent forms for... as to those students who had validly executed them?
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1568.553,1572.357,"Yes, to the extent that valid consent was given under this Court's cases."
1994.94-590,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1572.357,1574.674,That doesn't trouble like your predecessor.
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1574.674,1575.226,No.
1994.94-590,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.528,1581.313,Even though it was coerced?
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1585.098,1585.732,This is--
1994.94-590,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.732,1588.967,"I mean, it seems to me the consent form is bound in with the whole program."
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1603.476,1606.345,"--Well, this is the difficult question."
1994.94-590,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1618.736,1624.873,"Well, do you rely on the forms because athletics are in effect an incidental, voluntary activity?"
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1624.873,1627.092,--We don't rely on the forms.
1994.94-590,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1633.996,1634.281,All right.
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1661.598,1663.415,I'm not sure of the answer to that.
1994.94-590,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1665.45,1682.079,"Isn't the reason that you're concerned about it that you know perfectly well that if these kids want to get into a good college and they're not in the Honor Society or the record says, couldn't join the Honor Society because they wouldn't consent to drug testing, that they're going to be at a tremendous disadvantage in college application?"
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1682.829,1683.596,"--That's right, and--"
1994.94-590,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1683.596,1686.88,Why isn't there a like problem for the student athletes?
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1691.367,1705.711,"--That's right, and that's why we rely on the extracurricular, voluntary nature of the activity than the concept of consenting to it or not, because questions of consent can become very difficult, depending on the value of the benefit that you're conditioning the consent on."
1994.94-590,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1706.327,1713.098,"Mr. Seamon, you answer that you have some reservations about testing everyone based on what this Court did in Von Raab."
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1717.919,1718.702,"--Yes, that's right."
1994.94-590,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1718.702,1725.607,"Do you know what was the follow-up on remand with respect to all those other people, the accountants, the animal caretakers?"
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1725.607,1725.907,Yes.
1994.94-590,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1745.336,1751.656,Do you take the position that the relation between schools and their students is the same as between the Government and its employees?
1994.94-590,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1751.656,1752.773,"--No, we do not."
1994.94-590,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.708,1784.975,"Thank you, Mr. Seamon."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,1789.696,1791.981,"Mr. Chief Justice, no, you're not."
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.664,1794.18,"Christ, Mr. Christ."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,1794.18,1797.466,"Thank you, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-590,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1849.584,1871.83,"If you have an unruly student, the teacher reports a student as unruly, on your individual testing, or individual suspicion basis, could every unruly student be then subject to urinalysis because the teacher says, I've got a discipline problem here, maybe it's drugs, let's test her?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,1871.83,1893.03,"It depends on the misbehavior, but I think if there is sufficiently disruptive behavior to justify their conclusion now that these misbehaving students were all on drugs, that would perhaps, under T.L.O., present individualized suspicion to test that student."
1994.94-590,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1893.03,1902.468,"Mr. Christ, I'd like you to be as concrete as possible about this, because I was troubled by your, well, you can... the answer is individual testing."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,1917.228,1942.343,"Well, the problem with the random selection is that you are subjecting every student, including those who are not disorderly, not misbehaving, to this intrusive degrading experience, and that's the problem, on the one side, to be balanced against this risk that maybe the school district would pick out certain students."
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.83,1971.28,"Well, I mean, suspicion, unless you mean by suspicion probable cause, I mean, a high degree of proof, you're always going to get people who are utterly innocent, and I frankly would find it much more shameful to be picked out and sent to have a drug test because I'm suspected of using drugs than I would to be part of a general school population who just repeatedly do this."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,1988.741,1994.895,"--No, I don't think... there wasn't in T.L.O. a requirement of a hearing before the school officials looked into the student's purse."
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.251,2005.203,And you don't think it was a lawsuit if they didn't have reasonable suspicion?
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2020.712,2035.138,"Well, I think the intrusion here is less if you pick out the few students who are disbehaving and disorderly, and subject them to testing as opposed to take every student, including those who are well-behaved and simply want to play school sports--"
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.138,2036.888,"I see, you're not suspected of using drugs."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2044.744,2051.165,"--Well, my first point is, if you want to deter disorderly conduct, you just see it and you punish it appropriately."
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.587,2074.112,"You think it's better to be selected as one of the few in the school to be drug-tested on the basis of a suspicion, than to be part of the general... what is the intrusion that is involved?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2074.112,2082.369,"Well, if you are disrupting class, then you have justified, perhaps, school officials in taking you out and subjecting you to a test."
1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2088.523,2089.773,Do you think--
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2089.773,2092.641,"--The random test, though, didn't subject everyone."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2101.062,2105.45,"No, it is every student athlete, every athlete who tries out for sports."
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2105.45,2106.383,"Well, the initial test."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2106.383,2107.818,Initial test--
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2107.818,2110.018,"Yes, but I'm talking about the random testing."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2110.018,2118.423,"--Thereafter they're testing 10 percent of each student each week, so that during the course of the season you're eventually probably going to get to everybody."
1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2118.423,2138.521,"Do you think the district could reasonably conclude that the dangers of an individualized suspicion requirement go beyond the danger that the teacher might single out the unpopular student, but that it changes the whole relation between the teacher and the student?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2143.991,2151.479,"I don't want to turn them into policemen, Your Honor, but there is... the relationship is, at times, adversarial."
1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2161.552,2193.758,"But you want us to structure the law on drug testing for individualized suspicion, which it seems to me is a very significant step forward in assigning the responsibilities of this sort of very, very difficult and highly intrusive judgment to the teacher, whereas a random testing program eliminates that need altogether, and it seems to me the school district at least could make the plausible argument that this is a reasonable alternative for it to adopt."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2193.758,2197.892,"Your Honor, I don't want to misstate my position here."
1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2215.687,2221.508,"Well, it's rather hard for us to write an opinion to say that there's a less intrusive alternative but that that's unconstitutional, too."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2221.508,2245.79,"I think you should find that any urine testing is unconstitutional on the justifications that are given to you, but if they cannot prevent random testing of everyone, including my client, who is well-behaved and simply wants to play sports, then I'm suggesting that short of that you should have testing for those who are not well-behaved, and who are disorderly, and who are disrupting classes."
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.568,2272.191,"But surely the drug problem goes deeper than just... if it exists, and the courts below found it did, goes deeper than just misbehavior in class, doesn't it?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2275.761,2276.411,--Sure.
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2293.539,2323.058,"Well, what if the justification offered was that there's an increased risk of physical harm, health risks to athletes who are using drugs, and as part of our policy in the school to weed out those with heart problems, or those with other special risks in athletic programs, we're going to require this kind of testing for health purposes."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2326.51,2328.76,"No, we don't believe that's sufficient."
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2328.76,2329.212,"Well, why not?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2336.133,2344.889,"Well, I don't know that the school district can compel anyone to submit to an examination for those purposes, but under the safety standard that you set in Skinner and Von Raab--"
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2344.889,2358.315,Surely you would not take the position that a school can't protect itself from risk of injury to its student athletes by requiring physical exams for all those problems.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2358.315,2361.35,--I'm not contending that the school district does not--
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2361.35,2365.385,"Is that your position, that the school district can't do that for a student athlete?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2365.385,2367.837,--That's not my position.
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.883,2394.405,"You agree, don't you... and surely it's done all over the country for every high school sport... you've got to take a physical exam before you can participate?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2394.405,2405.962,"True, and my client took a physical exam here, too, which was required here, but the circumstances of that examination indicate the privacy that attaches to the passing of urine."
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2410.581,2419.151,"Well, how much privacy is there in a boy's locker room with a bunch of urinals lined up against the wall, guys walking naked from the shower to the lockers?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2419.151,2423.222,The point... it's substantially different.
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2441.016,2450.556,"Well, would it make any difference to you if the test... if the student had an option of going to a private clinic, or private physician to have the test done?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2450.556,2452.074,It would make--
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2452.074,2453.658,"Would that save it, in your view?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2453.658,2469.786,"--No, it would not save it, but it would make it less intrusive, and that was one of the procedural safeguards that you identified in Skinner and Von Raab as necessary to reduce the intrusiveness of urine testing to a constitutional permissible level."
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2476.773,2478.856,"But you say if all those things were done, it wouldn't make any difference."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2481.141,2482.008,--Correct.
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2482.008,2483.343,"Well, what is enough?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2483.343,2490.681,I don't think anything is enough to justify urine testing of students for the purposes that have been advanced by my opponents.
1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2490.681,2493.033,Do you have a fallback position?
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2495.135,2498.686,"Well, that's the position I'm taking is, if they cannot--"
1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2498.686,2502.304,"I know that's the position you have taken, but I mean it seriously."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2504.34,2516.981,"--My fallback position is, if they are justified in urine testing, in implementing a program, they are not justified in implementing this program because it lacks the procedural safeguards you identified in Skinner and Von Raab."
1994.94-590,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2516.981,2517.981,Then what is the program?
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2545.783,2549.818,You identified... let me respond this way.
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.289,2586.258,"Well, you have some factors here that didn't exist there, and that is the... this is an athletic program."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2602.452,2610.558,"Those are two factors that do reduce the intrusiveness, but as... let me speak to both of them, first the fact that this is voluntary."
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.783,2627.485,"You painted a very depressing picture of this town, as I recall."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2632.972,2635.591,"Actually, that was my opponent who painted that picture, but--"
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2635.591,2635.824,"Oh, I see."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2640.744,2648.331,"--That was the testimony they presented, and I'm just illustrating the ramifications of that."
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2706.35,2710.652,Haven't we allowed schools to impose mild corporal punishment?
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2710.652,2714.456,I don't know.
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.456,2720.043,"Yes, I think we have, and why is that?"

1994.94-590,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.783,2760.299,"Let me ask you a question on that one, if I might."

1994.94-590,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.191,2775.309,It would not?
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2775.309,2781.981,"It would not, we don't believe, if they required just as a condition of going to school that they take a urine test."

1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2815.868,2819.737,Does that rest on your assumption that there's no Nation-wide drug problem in the schools?

1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2827.174,2829.343,--No.

1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2855.391,2869.15,"No, because my first contention is that you don't need the drug test in order to solve the problem of disorders... disorderly behavior in the schools, so whatever--"
1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2869.15,2871.336,I'm talking about solving the problem of drugs in the schools.

1994.94-590,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.923,2882.792,Are you saying actually you can't have a medical test?
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2903.538,2905.721,They do require a physical exam.
1994.94-590,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.721,2912.109,"I mean, so... couldn't... are you saying they couldn't require physical exams for students to come to school?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2914.944,2916.277,I'm not saying that.
1994.94-590,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2918.527,2918.877,All right.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2934.155,2936.122,Because this is so highly intrusive.

1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2946.379,2953.45,--The medical exam you're talking about is being conducted in private by the student's doctor.
1994.94-590,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2954.652,2957.77,"Well, people urinate, you know, in men's rooms all over the country."

1994.94-590,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2974.78,2974.946,All right.

1994.94-590,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.467,2982.917,--That's what I'm aiming at.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,2982.917,2984.0,--It's not the mere act.
1994.94-590,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.245,3014.936,"A serious point, which is difficult."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3041.854,3064.119,"I appreciate the help, and what I think is the point here is that this is being compelled by the Government, they're watching you do it, they're taking your urine, and they're analyzing it to see what secrets therein, and at the same time they are compelling a student to come forward and disclose all their private medications, and that is highly intrusive and personal to most people."
1994.94-590,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3064.119,3065.152,"That's what I wondered, too."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3084.449,3097.59,"The disclosure of private medications, both prescription and nonprescription, is compelled by the policy statement itself, and is also compelled by the... Exhibit 109 is the urine sample specimen form."

1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3126.026,3128.042,--It's part of the case.
1994.94-590,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3138.0,3140.536,Your case is not one to modify this program.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3144.654,3146.12,"Correct, but--"
1994.94-590,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3146.12,3149.641,--not that it can be tailored in some way that it would be satisfactory.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3149.641,3164.484,"--But as Justice Souter indicated, that... my fallback position is that if you say drug testing is okay, then I at least want to stop this drug test because it is being performed in an especially intrusive fashion."
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3164.484,3191.718,"Mr. Christ, supposing that instead of feeling that drugs were the problem in the high school, the board had felt that it was alcohol that was a problem, and that they had the same reason to attribute it to athletes as the board here did to... drugs to athletes, and so... but they don't set up a urine testing program, they set up a breathalyzer program under exactly the same circumstances here."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3205.978,3211.882,"No, we think not, but the problem here is twofold."
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3222.088,3230.509,"Well, isn't there something broader, the idea that drug use has a lot more... brings with it a lot more problems than that, just to try to ferret out drug use?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3230.509,3248.988,"--Well, Your Honor, drugs do have a problem, and no one is denying that, and they're a problem for the young and the old, and if simply the problem of drugs on the user is sufficient to justify the Government in compelling urine tests, then we should all be subjected to urine tests."
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.988,3257.494,"Well, but school performance on tests, not necessarily disruptive performance, but it just affects a student in many, many ways, doesn't it?"

1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3284.727,3285.227,"Yes, but--"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3285.227,3285.427,--as to students.
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3285.427,3296.433,--surely the school... the school has an interest in seeing students learn and perform in a way that the Government has no interest in seeing citizens in general.
1994.94-590,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3300.653,3302.02,Students are kids.

1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3308.306,3310.256,But the schools don't.

1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3365.642,3366.075,--I'm sorry.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3366.075,3369.527,"--I'd just point out, they're old enough to vote and serve on juries."
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3369.527,3371.16,"Well, your client's in seventh grade?"

1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3386.703,3388.536,May I take you back to the question--
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3388.536,3389.738,--which will take him to age 17.
1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3389.738,3392.088,--I seem bent on interrupting you.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3408.033,3411.418,"Well, as I understood, a random breathalyzer test."
1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3411.418,3412.001,That's right.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3412.001,3412.568,Yes.
1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3412.568,3414.651,"Other things being equal, administered the same way, just do it by breath."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3414.651,3414.984,Correct.
1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3414.984,3416.286,And you said that would be unconstitutional.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3416.286,3416.72,Yes.
1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3416.72,3458.18,"I take it, then, that the intrusive feature, or features, which are of concern to you in the urine test in fact are not the quasi-exposure of having to produce the sample with someone standing behind you, because that doesn't occur in the breath test, so I take it the reasons that you find the intrusiveness to be unreasonable is that you are disclosing the contents of something... chemicals in your urine, chemicals in your breath... and you are being forced as a protective measure in appropriate cases to disclose any drugs you may be taking that might affect the test."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3462.382,3471.607,"Correct, and I would add that you're doing all of that without ever having given suspicion to suspect that you've done anything wrong."
1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3471.607,3471.857,Right.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3489.751,3490.984,Correct.
1994.94-590,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3490.984,3492.436,Yes.
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3492.436,3500.257,"Now, presumably the disclosure of what other prescription drugs you might be taking could be easily cured."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3521.17,3531.026,"It must be possible, because it was in Skinner and Von Raab, although I do not know why the school district here did not, after Skinner and Von Raab, adopt the same procedures."
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3532.026,3539.613,"Well, if it did, then that would go a long way towards solving your objection, I gather."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3539.613,3540.263,--Not--
1994.94-590,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3540.263,3542.798,And make this a more reasonable program.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3542.798,3545.917,--It would not go far enough.
1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3545.917,3550.504,"On this record, were the results disclosed to the school officials?"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3550.504,3551.554,Pardon me?
1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3551.554,3553.137,"On this record, in this case--"
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3553.137,3553.37,Yes.
1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3553.87,3557.488,--And there's no particular guarantees of confidentiality?
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3557.488,3561.19,--The disclosure is made to the school officials who are conducting the test.
1994.94-590,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3564.058,3564.741,I see.
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3564.741,3569.026,"--at the time, and so when you disclose your medication, you are disclosing to the school officials."
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3569.026,3569.942,"Thank you, Mr. Christ."
1994.94-590,2,42496,thomas_m_christ,,3569.942,3570.526,Thank you very much.
1994.94-590,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3570.526,3589.042,The case is submitted.
