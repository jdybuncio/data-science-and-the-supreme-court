1971.70-5037,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.004,"We will hear arguments next in number 5037, Lego against Twomey."
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,32.475,37.247,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5037,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,82.069,85.93,"Now, just to be sure that I have it in focus."
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,90.431,97.191,"It is an issue that in the light that Mr. Justice Black adverted to in Jackson v. Denno in its dissenting opinion, it was left open."
1971.70-5037,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,123.396,132.224,It has been -- in this case also presents the question or not whether after the determined voluntariness whether that issue is again submitted to the jury?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,132.224,160.047,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan that is, if in fact the first question were decided against the petitioner, we submit and our contention is that the two are interrelated that if in fact this Court were to sustain a standard less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt for a trial judge making such a finding, it should constitutionally require that at the very least the jury get a second look at that issue."
1971.70-5037,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,160.047,170.957,"But then on that, if that would it be so, I take at the jury as in all other issues would make that determination by reason beyond the reasonable doubt standard?"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,170.957,174.975,"That is right, we think that is what would be constitutionally required?"
1971.70-5037,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,174.975,185.551,Do I understand you to say in effect on that point that a confession in this context is like any other piece of evidence?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,195.991,211.611,"Well, I think my second point is slightly different from that because I think, as Your Honor has stated the position, I think it does reflect a position similar to that of the state in this case."
1971.70-5037,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,237.44,242.751,I did not mean to include that -- include that in my hypothetical.
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,250.404,251.205,Yes sir.
1971.70-5037,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,263.553,284.863,"Would it be sufficient for these purposes if hypothetically the instruction was that when you come to consider the confession which has been admitted in evidence, you will bear in mind that as with other elements, it must find this voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,284.863,285.82,"Yes, that –-"
1971.70-5037,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,285.82,287.186,That would be enough?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,287.186,291.141,That instruction we think would be constitutionally sufficient.
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.281,305.129,"Well, that is an issue that it was not left open in Jackson against Denno?"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,305.129,307.109,"No, that was not adverted to --"
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.109,308.897,"Now, wait a minute, wait a minute."
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,315.379,315.488,Well --
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.488,321.839,"Even though the Judge has passed on it in advance, in a proper manner?"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,321.839,329.408,"I am saying that only Mr. Justice White, if he is permitted to pass on it by some standard less than beyond a reasonable doubt."
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,351.019,373.471,So you would be quite satisfied if the judge just said I think the voluntariness is -- I find it to be voluntary as admissible and then he says to the jury you must find the contention admissible beyond a reasonable doubt as a preliminary matter to use?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,373.471,374.943,You must find it voluntary beyond reasonable doubt?
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,374.943,376.224,Yes.
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,376.224,377.436,Yes.
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,377.436,379.169,You think that would be enough?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,379.169,383.195,I think for the petitioner’s (Voice Overlap) I think that is right.
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.195,400.725,"If that would be enough, why would it not enough for the judge to say there is enough evidence in the case to find it voluntary, I do not have to pass on it, but I will give it to the jury and single that out and say you must find this voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,400.725,403.916,That is what Jackson v. Denno foreclosed.
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.916,405.195,I would think he would foreclose.
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,406.524,410.119,"Well, we do not have to --"
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,410.119,413.474,If the confession must be found voluntary beyond the reasonable doubt?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,413.474,432.288,"Well, Mr. Justice White, the petitioner’s position in this case is that the Court need not go -- need not reach if it decides not to the question whether the judge must necessarily find the confession voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt."
1971.70-5037,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,692.823,715.88,"Mr. Lewin, suppose the evidence, let us avoid the word confession for the moment, but suppose a piece of evidence was offered by the prosecution in the form of a letter written by the defendant to some third person which contained the essence of a confession, would you say that must fall under this same rule?"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,715.88,725.931,Only to the extent Mr. Chief Justice that there is some constitutional danger if the letter had been ceased in violation of either Fourth or possibly Fifth Amendment standards.
1971.70-5037,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,725.931,729.821,Let us assuming that the recipient turns it over to prosecution?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,729.821,766.867,"No, where there is no constitutional problem, where we are referring simply to the preliminary questions or any, not even preliminary question, just any ordinary question on which factual issue on which admissibility depends then of course it is standard procedure and we do not contend that the constitutional requires otherwise that the judge make that factual finding, he alone may make it in the actions of the jury, then permit the evidence to go in and not comment any further on it to the jury and not raise those underlying factual issues to the jury at all."
1971.70-5037,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,766.867,769.971,And the jury can accept it or reject it as they see fit it?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,769.971,774.64,As they see fit in the context of all the other evidence.
1971.70-5037,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,856.213,857.829,I do not understand that.
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,857.829,858.163,Well –-
1971.70-5037,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,858.163,862.28,The Fifth Amendment right is a right against compulsory self-incrimination?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,862.28,868.731,"And a defendant in custody at least and certainly under Miranda, I think what the court went in to say --"
1971.70-5037,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.731,870.507,You state as part of Miranda?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,870.507,874.388,Well I think in Miranda of course the Court relied on ground on Bram in prior cases.
1971.70-5037,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,901.92,903.505,"Well, that is what Miranda --"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,903.505,903.931,Right.
1971.70-5037,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,903.931,915.728,"-- and other cases have held that compelled confessions come under the language of the Fifth Amendment, but only compelled confession?"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,915.728,935.472,"Right, but a defendant in custody, when a defendant is being held in custody and he then makes a statement, the question of whether it compels or not is really a question of whether he and it is very close I think to the border of whether he has waived the Fifth Amendment right."
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.465,998.694,"So you think in a Miranda situation before, in custody statement would be admissible, there must be a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the warnings have been given, etcetera, and there is beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a waiver?"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,998.694,1004.71,"That I do not think that question has to be reached, Mr. Justice White in a square coerced confession."
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.71,1011.354,"I know it does not need to be reached, but would not a holding here on your side determine that issue?"
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1011.354,1011.994,(Voice overlap)I think a holding in our side --
1971.70-5037,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1011.994,1014.32,(Voice Overlap) as much have just told us?
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1014.32,1015.028,I think --
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1015.028,1016.667,It follows in --
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1016.667,1018.621,"Well, let me just say."
1971.70-5037,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.229,1066.73,Oh! Sure we could say it.
1971.70-5037,0,37177,nathan_lewin,,1077.11,1102.995,"Our initial argument is that one would have to make those findings whenever there is a constitutional issue, but alternatively and I think the point that covers this case, we contend that one need only make one, the Court need only hold in this case that one must make those findings as to a confession case because confessions are particularly devastating in the context of a criminal prosecution."
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2092.576,2097.34,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2128.505,2129.951,Was that true --
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2129.951,2130.356,That was --
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2130.356,2133.382,"(Voice Overlap) you are describing for us, is that -- would that be true in this case?"
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2133.382,2135.274,"Yes, that has always been true."
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.274,2136.366,And still --
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2136.366,2136.885,And it still true.
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2136.885,2138.192,Still true today as it was then?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2138.192,2138.716,Yes.
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2138.716,2139.89,Yes.
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2139.89,2150.465,So of course the issue is to whether it is permissible to place a burden on the defendant is not really before the Court.
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2154.725,2155.486,May I just ask one other question?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2155.486,2156.16,Yes.
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2156.16,2163.293,Under your procedure is the evidence taken on the question of voluntariness in the presence or outside the presence?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2163.293,2164.153,Outside the presence.
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2164.153,2164.695,Outside.
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2164.695,2167.068,And that has always been the procedure in Illinois.
1971.70-5037,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2173.006,2174.874,Was that in fact so in this case?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2174.874,2175.26,Yes.
1971.70-5037,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2175.26,2177.834,Because it did not come through clearly to me in the record?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2177.834,2178.589,"No, that is true."
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2187.476,2188.976,Before they impanel the jury?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2188.976,2190.339,Before the jury is impaneled.
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2192.464,2196.263,"Yes, and was that was also true of the Purims case?"
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2196.263,2199.228,"Yes, yes."
1971.70-5037,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.657,2243.002,It does go to truth or falsity?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2243.002,2244.702,It does go to truth and falsity.
1971.70-5037,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.702,2251.232,And to whether or not it might be a factor in determining whether the defining of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2251.232,2253.428,Yes.
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2550.452,2557.94,The constitutional error might be something other than the wrongful admission of evidence in the case?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2557.94,2558.966,"Yes, that is true."
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2558.966,2564.029,"Well, you are not, fairly in the Chapman area dealing with the weight of evidence?"
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2564.029,2564.482,Well I --
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2564.482,2577.697,"It might be the manner or method of trial or it might be comment by the prosecutor on the defendant’s failure to testify, it might be any other ordinary --"
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2577.697,2578.452,Well I --
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2578.452,2580.074,-- different constitutional errors.
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2583.412,2629.599,"Yes, that is true, except I would suggest that in particular, the Griffin versus California problem dealt with in Chapman is at base away of the evidence problem because the prosecution is using silence as an evidentiary fact that is saying this silence helps to establish our case, although I concede that -- I admit that is conceivable that there would be cases where harmless was applied that you could not say that that the error in question dealt specifically with evidence, but still it is essential in the resolution of that problem, usually to waive the evidence as a whole which is what the Hamilton versus California made very clear."
1971.70-5037,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.413,2732.523,But Rogers and Richmond also said that your instruction about probable truth of lawsuit is gone too?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2732.523,2738.814,I think that Rogers and Richmond dealt with the determination of voluntariness.
1971.70-5037,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2751.304,2756.026,You say that probable truth and falsity was not in Rogers and Richmond?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2756.026,2756.826,I am saying that --
1971.70-5037,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.826,2758.913,Please do not say it because I am looking at it.
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2758.913,2765.555,No I am saying that probable truth and falsity is excluded from determinations of voluntariness.
1971.70-5037,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.555,2771.729,"Well, does your instruction say that you decide through the falsity?"
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2771.729,2777.529,The jury is not instructed on the issue of voluntariness at all.
1971.70-5037,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2778.058,2780.15,I thought you said that was specific?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2780.15,2783.109,"Yes, but that only goes to its weight."
1971.70-5037,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.712,2785.707,"Well that is truth and falsity, is it not?"
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2785.707,2789.28,"Yes, but it is only as to the weight of the confession."
1971.70-5037,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.118,2795.602,And if the Rogers and Richmond says that is not enough then that is not enough?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2795.602,2797.437,I would respectfully disagree.
1971.70-5037,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2804.978,2815.443,"Well, it did not validate the instruction of the jury in Illinois because of the Connecticut case that I agree with?"
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2815.443,2829.412,I might add that it is my understanding that instructions similar to those given in Illinois are given in Federal criminal trials with respect to the weight of the confession.
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2996.082,2997.201,That is the Schipani opinion?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2997.201,2997.744,That is Schipani.
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2997.744,2998.824,The judge Weinstein?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,2998.824,2999.907,Yes.
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2999.907,3011.397,Who was -- have you analyzed the analysis of the mathematical laws of probabilities contained in that opinion?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,3011.397,3016.018,"Yes, at least I was familiar with that before I read the opinion."
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3019.29,3019.473,Right.
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,3019.473,3027.852,Assuming as it is often done that preponderance to the evidence equals 50 plus and reasonable doubt equals 95 plus.
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3036.372,3040.643,Then the 50 times 95 comes out to 50 minus?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,3040.643,3042.771,It comes out to 50 minus.
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3044.521,3047.602,It gives a valid analysis of this problem?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,3047.602,3070.52,"I think not because that the kind of shock attitude that one gets toward facing a criminal judgment on the 50 minus probability is essentially a shock resulting from the recurrence of convicting an innocent man and, but you do not get that fact."
1971.70-5037,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3079.223,3087.528,Judge Weinstein as Mr. Lewin points out in his brief is formerly a professor of evidence of the Columbia Law School?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,3087.528,3111.014,"That is correct and I might say that his opinion is -- it follows very closely an analysis of similar problems by two Columbia professors, Jerome Michael and Professor Waxton."
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3125.869,3128.452,That reflects in the value of law review (Inaudible)?
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,3128.452,3130.423,"Well, I have written a couple myself."
1971.70-5037,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3130.423,3132.955,Where are the copies?[Laughter]
1971.70-5037,1,33731,james_b_zagel,,3132.955,3140.062,And I would generally read the opinions first in the Law Review article.
1971.70-5037,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3393.133,3394.389,Thank you Mr. Zagel.
1971.70-5037,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3398.479,3399.908,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-5037,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.908,3407.031,"On behalf of the Court, we express our appreciation for your assistance to the Court and of course, your assistance to your client."
1971.70-5037,2,37177,nathan_lewin,,3407.031,3407.483,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.70-5037,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.322,3413.034,The case is submitted.
