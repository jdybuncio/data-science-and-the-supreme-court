1970.534,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.247,"We'll hear arguments next in number 534, United States against Reidel."
1970.534,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,24.366,28.022,May it please the Court.
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1099.514,1104.585,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1216.44,1234.243,"The only thing Mr. Rosenwein that if you make that same argument, if he were requesting from a pharmaceutical house a forbidden drug like narcotics on the ground that he was going to use it just for himself, wouldn’t possibly hurt anybody else."
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1234.243,1247.785,"Well, I think the difference would be that we're dealing in one case with the First Amendment application, implication and the other with something that falls outside First Amendment protection."
1970.534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1247.785,1254.378,"Well, I was taking your rather sweeping phrase about people doing what they want to do?"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1254.378,1258.514,In the light of First Amendment protection let me add that first.
1970.534,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1259.976,1276.482,"May I ask Mr. Rosenwein, am I correct in my recollection that the Roth indictments grew out of a similar situation that is a postal inspectors writing Roth, it was the same --"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1276.482,1279.629,I think the Solicitor General has proper dimension.
1970.534,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1279.629,1285.111,"So I gather your submission would require overruling Roth, is it not?"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1285.111,1292.831,"It would in one sense require overruling Roth, but not on the narrow ground that Your Honor is putting it for this reason."
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1443.787,1448.972,Does it mean the right to somebody to use the mails to mail it to him?
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1448.972,1450.15,"Yes, exactly the point."
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1450.15,1451.857,Where did Stanley said that?
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1451.857,1453.295,"Well, Stanley says --"
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1453.295,1456.788,Where did Stanley said that?
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1456.788,1463.511,"Specific Language obviously, nothing is mentioned of that because we're not at that moment --"
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1463.511,1467.938,"(Inaudible) Under Stanley, he could have gone out in the street bought it, maybe that was alright."
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1481.745,1483.711,"Well, that is the point that I'm dealing first."
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1483.711,1491.465,"The recipient of this material is not here in this case, right?"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1491.465,1492.41,Right.
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1492.41,1494.071,It’s only the right of the mailing it.
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1494.071,1495.227,Right.
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1495.227,1505.427,"You say because a person has the right to read something in his home, anybody has the right to use the mail to send the material too, is that where you are?"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1505.427,1506.998,"Yes, that's exactly the position I take."
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1506.998,1509.424,Correct me if I'm wrong.
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1509.424,1522.324,"Well, I'm getting by Roth by that and I'm getting -- I am making my argument built on Roth and all the cases including Redrup and Stanley thereafter for this reason Your Honor."
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1548.389,1549.649,To send through the mail?
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1549.649,1551.976,"Yes, to send through the mails because you have said --"
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1551.976,1554.937,There are other ways of getting it to him without using the mail?
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1554.937,1579.895,"Well, Your Honor as far as that is concerned the Court has said on the number of occasions that on today’s situation not to send through the mails which is a form of communication that is most often used in an organized society today and of course the government's position cuts broader than Your Honor’s inquiry because they would say that you can’t disseminate in any form from which its follows."
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1579.895,1598.137,"There is nothing to follow Stanley that used mail because right happenstance the case involved a bookshelf in Atlanta, Georgia which was selling the same stuff, but in no con -- in no way you can get out at the Stanley case that he got it through mail, there is no way?"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1598.137,1599.295,That is true Your Honor.
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.527,1687.218,"The case the Solicitor General referred to was the case where a man and wife have pictures of each other and that’s all they were and is this, the petitioner here, respondent different from that?"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1687.218,1694.784,"Well he’s only different in the sense that the material is different, but he is sending at the request of somebody who wants it, that's all."
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1694.784,1697.078,"It is not a one shot deal, is it?"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1697.078,1698.063,"Well, I don’t know."
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1698.063,1700.718,Nobody saw any pictures but the man and --
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1700.718,1709.106,We have three solicitations here and three adult citizens asked for it and received the material.
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1709.106,1713.977,"Well, judging from the material I think you printed more than three of them?"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1713.977,1727.506,"Well, there was some material seized, yes, but Your Honor this started with an advertisement and adults answered an advertisement, three adults answered the advertisement and it was sent to those three of those."
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1757.753,1758.621,Who Stanley?
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1758.621,1759.987,Yes.
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1763.687,1768.131,"(Voice Overlap) Library was in the desk drawer, the desk in his bedroom."
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1768.131,1771.06,But there was a reference to the library in the (Inaudible) opinion.
1970.534,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1771.773,1773.475,"No, that’s the (Inaudible)"
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1773.475,1781.18,"But now my only point is that and I‘m only quoting -- I quote here from Blount against Rizzi, Mr. Fleishman has handed me the opinion."
1970.534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1791.051,1797.153,"Mr. Rosenwein, you were speaking before about a point that I would like to have you clarify."
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1810.38,1811.429,Right.
1970.534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1811.429,1822.008,Now where do you find any constitutional limitation to exercise your First Amendments rights in a particular way as distinguished from exercising it?
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,1822.008,1833.145,"Well, in generally speaking, in broad terms, there have been so called, imitations of what we call time, place and manner."
1970.534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.87,2054.443,Would you agree that the Rowan holding must be read as a having placed limits on the use of the mails in a way that had not been done before?
1970.534,1,41981,sam_rosenwein,,2054.443,2062.766,Yes I think that’s – and to some degree that’s true and that congressional decision has been upheld.
1970.534,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2318.608,2319.648,Mr. Solicitor General?
1970.534,2,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2319.648,2320.632,(Inaudible)
1970.534,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2320.632,2321.047,Very well.
