1987.86-594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.122,"We will now hear argument in Cause Number 86-594, National Labor Relations Board v. United Food and Commercial Workers Union."
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,15.176,27.983,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,209.681,210.8,Where does the charge come from?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,210.8,212.716,--Any person may file a charge.
1987.86-594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.036,222.238,You mean just any person in the United States?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,222.238,223.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,223.19,226.492,Whether he's an employer or employee?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,226.492,228.927,That is correct.
1987.86-594,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,235.081,238.8,"Well, this particular case is one between two unions, isn't it?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,238.8,241.585,Between two unions and an employer.
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,333.178,336.213,Does the Regional Director decide the complaint solution?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,336.213,340.249,--The Regional Director does.
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,345.585,350.437,He's not the Board's representative?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,350.437,352.889,"No, he's not the Board's representative."
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,459.706,461.489,There's something in the way of a case.
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,466.943,467.427,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,467.427,474.914,"But suppose the party doesn't want to engage in any settlement discussions, does he have an appeal?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,474.914,477.116,"At that point, he issues a complaint."
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,477.116,478.366,Oh.
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,480.818,481.835,He issues a complaint.
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,481.835,487.739,"And the party against whom it's issued has no appeal to the General Counsel before he has to answer the complaint, does he?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,487.739,497.779,Not normally.
1987.86-594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.52,621.757,"These settlements are provided for by regulations, aren't they?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,621.757,623.442,"Yes, they are, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.442,626.644,And both the formal and the informal?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,626.644,627.661,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.985,643.837,Does it indicate how old those regulations are?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,643.837,650.907,Those regulations were promulgated many years ago.
1987.86-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.234,698.221,"That shows something of the ambivalence of the whole scheme, though, doesn't it?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,720.467,761.127,"Well, for housekeeping purposes, Congress decided instead of setting up a separate administrator to put the General Counsel in the same agency as the Board, and the way these regulations work out or have worked out is that although they are issued in the name of the Board, those having to do with the operation of the General Counsel's phase of the administration are worked out jointly with the Board and the General Counsel."
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,798.485,808.59,"Where there's a formal settlement, any order of the Board is subject to judicial review, is it?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,808.59,811.375,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,811.375,818.814,"And the question we have here is whether where there's an informal settlement, is it subject to judicial review."
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,818.814,819.314,Yes.
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,820.198,822.35,Do we have any other issue to decide in this case?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,822.35,853.654,"If, only if, you decide that it is subject to judicial review, would you have to reach the second question as to whether or not a charging party who objects at the settlement is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on its objections because that is what the 3rd Circuit held and the remand is for the Board to hold such an evidentiary hearing."
1987.86-594,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.654,870.247,"Mr. Come, if the case had proceeded far enough to have a hearing, at that point, is there any authority to settle the case and dismiss it on the part of the General Counsel alone?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,870.247,874.199,The General Counsel cannot do that unilaterally.
1987.86-594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.548,930.619,"What's the difference, Mr. Come, between a formal settlement and an informal settlement?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,930.619,974.029,"The difference is that a formal settlement leads to a Board order that is enforceable in the Court of Appeals, and so that if there is non-compliance with that order, the Board can either proceed to get it enforced on consent or, if there was a consent also to a court decree, move for contempt of the order."
1987.86-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.141,1039.654,"Suppose the General Counsel changes his mind after one of these informal settlements, there hasn't been any violation of the informal settlement by the party with whom it's made, but the General Counsel just decides it was a bad idea, would anything prevent him from going ahead to reinstitute the complaint?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1039.654,1057.366,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor, because he acts in the public interest here and there's no estoppel, as it were, that would operate against him, but--"
1987.86-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.366,1066.637,"Has it ever happened, to your knowledge, that without a violation of the informal consent agreement, the General Counsel just decides--"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1066.637,1075.91,"--I wouldn't say never, but if it's ever happened, it's so rare that--"
1987.86-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.91,1077.56,--You don't personally know that it's ever happened?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1077.56,1078.112,--No.
1987.86-594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1104.929,1109.714,"Mr. Come, doesn't that ninety-two percent figure cover settlements pre-complaint?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1109.714,1115.785,--There's a substantial number pre-complaint.
1987.86-594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.785,1118.987,Are there very many of these post-complaint pre-hearing settlements?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1118.987,1119.356,"Yes, there are."
1987.86-594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.814,1162.449,Let me ask one other question on the universe we're dealing with.
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1170.872,1174.324,--We have not had many cases.
1987.86-594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1189.334,1196.67,"Well, there's been a right to review in the 6th Circuit for twenty years without any cases, hasn't there?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1196.67,1198.189,--In the 3rd Circuit.
1987.86-594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1198.189,1198.822,"3rd Circuit, I mean."
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1198.822,1199.622,In the 3rd Circuit.
1987.86-594,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.622,1203.724,"Twenty years, they had this rule, and nobody ever used it for twenty years, isn't that right?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1203.724,1316.063,"But as I say, the potential would be there and human nature being what it is, it is not unreasonable to expect that if there were not only the right to review but also the right to Board review, as my brother here is urging, that a party for technical reasons would play out the string here, and this isn't just a labor versus management-kind of issue because the employer can be in the role of the objecting party as can the union, and experience has shown that in order to resolve most effectively labor-management disputes, the... it's better to get things resolved quickly and with some degree of certainty and that if you tack on review to an informal settlement, there would be a strong disincentive to settle because one of the reasons for settling is to avoid the cost and also the risk of litigation."
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1316.063,1325.752,"Well, Mr. Come, in the ninety-two percent of the cases settled how many are... what proportion are informal and what proportion formal?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1325.752,1341.178,"I would say that the vast majority are informal settlements and, of those,--"
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1341.178,1347.248,"When you say vast, is that half of the ninety-two percent or three-quarters or what?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1347.248,1379.803,"--Well, in the 1983 statistics, which we have in our brief, the formal settlements were about six-tenths of a percent of the total number of settlements."
1987.86-594,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1401.919,1408.406,"But in either event, neither is subject to judicial review, is it, pre or post?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1408.406,1434.973,"That is correct, with the possible exception that an informal that is entered into after hearing, where you have to get the approval of the administrative law judge and the Board, those... there have been two such cases in the 7th Circuit and those have been reviewed."
1987.86-594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1434.973,1455.137,"But as between formal and informal settlements after complaint issues, what is roughly thirty-five percent of the total universe is informal, and.6 percent is formal?"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1455.137,1463.909,"The.6 percent... yes, that's about right, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.453,1487.322,"Mr. Come, I don't understand what you just said."
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1502.848,1514.906,"Yes, because it hasn't resulted in a Board order in the conventional sense that--"
1987.86-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1514.906,1517.674,Why isn't the approval of the Board a Board order?
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1522.078,1528.566,"--Well, I think that it is, and that's why we've... those have been reviewed."
1987.86-594,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.566,1534.902,"But you say it just doesn't result in any command by the Board, the violation of which you--"
1987.86-594,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1534.902,1536.036,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1539.087,1542.223,"Very well, Mr. Come."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1543.908,1551.347,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1987.86-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1634.001,1639.053,"Well, Mr. Gold, the statute certainly doesn't expressly make that clear."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1639.053,1640.071,No.
1987.86-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1640.421,1649.261,Is this not a case where some difference to the interpretation of the statute by the agency is due?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1649.261,1674.642,"--In this instance, Your Honor, we do think that the statute pushes very hard in the direction of the position we take and that this is what the understanding was at the time."
1987.86-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1707.43,1709.465,It's been consistent since then?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1709.465,1712.584,"--Yes, it has been consistent since then, but--"
1987.86-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1712.584,1717.671,"Well, do you think that's an unreasonable interpretation of this language of the statute?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1717.671,1747.523,"--I think that it's an interpretation of the statute which cuts very deeply against the statutory provisions and, moreover, as the discussion thus far has indicated, it is an interpretation of a statute which has resulted in a number of lines being drawn, none of which seems to have much in the way of logic."
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.507,1776.524,Excuse me.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1806.11,1810.264,--That isn't the way it works.
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.712,1836.997,"He calls them informal settlements, I think."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1840.115,1853.607,"--They produce a Board order, it would seem to me, in the sense that under 10(f), it's certainly an order of the Board and nobody would protest that it's not reviewable."
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.814,1865.314,All right.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1865.314,1866.414,--by the Respondent.
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1866.414,1870.134,"You call those formal settlements and you think he calls them that, too?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1870.134,1870.468,Yes.
1987.86-594,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1948.068,1957.157,"Mr. Gold, is anything judicially reviewable that does not involve a Board order?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1957.157,1965.43,"--As we read 10(e) and 10(f), you need a Board order, but--"
1987.86-594,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1965.43,1966.596,Yes.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1972.084,1975.452,--The language of the statute--
1987.86-594,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1975.452,1976.821,No.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1977.688,1981.19,--We think so.
1987.86-594,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1981.19,1982.557,And what is it?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1982.557,1995.532,The language of the statute says that orders of the Board are reviewable in court or at least certain kinds of orders of the Board are reviewable in court.
1987.86-594,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2022.083,2025.151,Even though there exists no formal Board order?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2025.151,2026.836,--Yes.
1987.86-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2036.626,2050.369,"Mr. Gold, if you were right in your interpretation, then, presumably, even an order withdrawing, deciding not to file a complaint in the first instance, would be a final order by the Board."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2050.369,2050.702,--No.
1987.86-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2051.969,2057.606,"I mean, I just think your logic would carry you to a very peculiar place."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2057.606,2059.725,"Well, there--"
1987.86-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2059.725,2072.449,"For every action that the General Counsel takes is automatically a final order of the Board by your reading of the statute, then even his decision not to file a complaint would be reviewable."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2072.449,2078.018,"--No, we don't think that that's what the statute says, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2098.6,2113.792,"But if you apply the APA to this, under your reading, of Section 153(d), anything the General Counsel did becomes a final order of the Board."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2113.792,2122.798,--There's an exception in the APA for matters left to agency discretion.
1987.86-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2250.778,2257.366,"Mr. Gold, if you take the language of 10(f) literally, the review should be directly in the Court of Appeals."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2257.366,2259.201,"Yes, and that is what we did here."
1987.86-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2259.201,2264.038,And where then does the authority for the evidentiary hearing come?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2264.038,2270.942,"Well, we had... we are making a procedural complaint."
1987.86-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.631,2290.689,"So that your position... just so I'm clear, is it if a General Counsel dismisses a complaint and they say it's not reviewable before the Board, you say your remedy is to go directly to the Court of Appeals?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2290.689,2291.739,--Yes.
1987.86-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.328,2329.995,Hearing before whom?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2329.995,2335.749,--lawsuit... a hearing before an administrative law judge and the Board.
1987.86-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.601,2339.303,But you don't say that hearing is commanded by 10(f)?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2339.303,2341.02,"--No, no."
1987.86-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.922,2347.54,What statutory provision commands that hearing?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2347.54,2347.992,--Right.
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2386.764,2392.668,"Well, supposing that's true, what issues are there in the evidentiary hearing that you say you have a right to?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2396.02,2397.722,Yes.
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2412.815,2417.184,"Well, a district court ordinarily doesn't conduct any hearing if the parties stipulate to a settlement."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2417.184,2418.468,But here one party doesn't.
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2438.382,2438.849,The charging party.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2438.849,2440.349,--doesn't agree and that's why--
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.349,2442.584,"So, what, then, are the issues?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2442.584,2452.54,--The issues are it would seem to us the same kind of issues that a district court has to--
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.54,2452.94,Okay.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2454.19,2468.533,"--Whether it is fit and proper for the settlement to be entered into, whether it carries out the intent of the Act, whether there have been irregularities."
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2468.533,2472.318,It's a review of the General Counsel's exercise of his discretion.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2472.318,2481.84,"In the... the only reason I'm afraid of that statement, Chief Justice, is that it says you said ""his discretion""."
1987.86-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2510.193,2515.846,You said here one of the parties hasn't agreed to the settlement.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2528.388,2528.721,Yes.
1987.86-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.308,2536.344,Even without a special order of intervention?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2536.344,2536.71,Yes.
1987.86-594,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.71,2537.627,He's automatically a party.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2558.774,2562.725,Any order finally disposing of a complaint.
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.725,2565.76,Finally disposing of a complaint.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2565.76,2568.045,Yes.
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.379,2598.313,"Well, I don't see that."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2636.754,2637.554,Yes.
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.554,2647.296,"--is engaging in an unfair labor practice, the Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and shall cause to be served on such person an order in one direction or the other."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2655.132,2671.744,"It's partially the kind of order because you have... in part, it is that kind of order, and what we're... I guess what we're struggling with is what happens in this class of case."
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2690.956,2697.775,But 10(c) only says an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2700.144,2701.596,"Well, the order--"
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.596,2704.298,The whole section it entitled Prevention of Unfair Labor Practices.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2716.023,2716.073,"--Well, in those terms, an order... there's more of 10(c)."
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.861,2778.729,It may be reviewable but not under 10(f).
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2778.729,2779.396,"Well, if we--"
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.396,2785.3,"If it's reviewable, it would be under the APA, which means it would go into district court, which is where it should be if there hasn't been any formal proceeding."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2787.283,2831.495,"--Perhaps it's where it should be if you're fighting about the substance of the settlement, but if the claim is that the General Counsel has run around the procedure entirely, so... and has taken an action which is in reality an action which we believe is an action which can only be taken by the Board, it seemed to us that the logic of the situation was that kind of law question, when, as well, and ostensibly to the Court of Appeals."
1987.86-594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.081,2899.889,"Mr. Gold, if the Government is right, I take it that the Board itself could not prohibit the General Counsel from entering into informal settlements."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2899.889,2901.406,--That's right.
1987.86-594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.885,2926.289,"Why shouldn't that be the same trump card if the proceeding has started, if the hearing has started?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2926.289,2943.131,"--That's what's a total mystery to us and it may be that if you rule for the Board here, the Board will greatly regret having joined hands with the General Counsel."
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2943.131,2953.106,"Mr. Gold, take the stage of the proceeding where the General Counsel issued a complaint but the charge party has issued no response."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2971.984,2981.524,"That is the rule in the district court, but our argument here is that the statute draws a different line."
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2983.641,2990.129,But you were arguing before that you had the same kind of hearing that a district court would have.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,2993.683,3040.128,"--I'm saying that the issues to be presented to the tribunal in this kind of a three-party situation are analogous to the issues on whether or not to approve a settlement in a normal district court case brought by a plaintiff after answer in a class action case brought after the class is certified, which is very close, because that, too, is one where you have a representative rather than just one party on the plaintiff's side."
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.128,3047.401,"Those district court case examples have gone considerably further than just the filing of a complaint, which is all we have here."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3047.401,3073.801,"That's true, but it is also true that the mere filing of a complaint is a less painstaking process than in a civil case than the filing of a complaint by this public agency after quite an elaborate system for trying to separate the wheat from the chaff."
1987.86-594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.087,3107.772,Formal or informal or whatever?
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3107.772,3139.744,"Formal or informal or whatever, and that the overall thrust of the 1947 amendments were to provide a higher level of procedures, open procedures, by disinterested decision-makers and less staff determination than had been true prior to 1947."
1987.86-594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.475,3196.914,"Mr. Gold, the due process concerns that motivated Taft-Hartley weren't basically concerns about fairness to the charging party, were they?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3196.914,3229.802,"--Oh, I think they were, Your Honor, because as the Court has remarked in other circumstances, what was sauce for the goose became sauce for the gander because Taft-Hartley for the first time created charging party rights in employers against unions, and Senator Taft and his colleagues were very solicitous of the rights and interests of that new class of charging parties."
1987.86-594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.212,3276.164,"You think they've just been making a mistake for thirty years, forty years?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3276.164,3280.485,It's been a mistake which--
1987.86-594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3280.485,3281.018,This whole--
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3281.018,3281.618,"--Well, first of all,--"
1987.86-594,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.618,3284.02,--practice has been going on for a long time.
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3284.02,3286.805,--But without judicial approval.
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3333.517,3336.386,"Mr. Gold, that practice was a Board-created practice."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3336.386,3337.321,--Yes.
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.321,3348.594,"And what you're arguing here is that somehow Congress intended to freeze that practice and the only thing you can point to as being a freezing of that practice is 10(f), right?"
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3348.594,3369.673,"No. 10... I think that practice was one which the agency created but which was one which the statute has always intended because it seems to us that Section 10(b), which has always been there, contemplates that once the complaint issues, the matter will be determined by the Board."
1987.86-594,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3369.673,3385.767,"But what I'm saying is if I don't read 10(f) as applying to this kind of an order, the only thing that applies to this order is the Administrative Procedure Act, and there's no intent there to freeze the agency into a particular administrative scheme that existed in 1947."
1987.86-594,1,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3385.767,3397.241,"I guess the way we view this case, Justice Scalia, that two aspects to the judicial review question."
1987.86-594,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3431.331,3432.481,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3437.985,3443.989,"Just a couple of points, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.181,3519.02,"Mr. Come, could the Board require informal settlements by the General Counsel to be reviewed by the Board?"
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3519.02,3540.719,"Not, we believe, certainly prior to the issuance of the complaint, and--"
1987.86-594,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3540.719,3543.485,"Well, what about in this very case?"
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3543.485,3577.039,"--post-complaint, I think that the Board could not go back to the point of the issuance of the complaint without doing violence to 3(d) because 3(d) talks about the General Counsel's final authority, extending not only to the investigation of charges and the issuance of complaints, but with respect to the prosecution of such complaints before the Board."
1987.86-594,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3584.526,3593.668,"So, your answer is no, the Board could not require him to get the approval of the Board for informal settlements after the complaint is issued?"
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3593.668,3595.884,At least up until before the hearing opens.
1987.86-594,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.884,3602.94,"Well, what... why wouldn't that same rule apply to post-hearing while the hearing is going on?"
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3604.49,3605.891,"Well,--"
1987.86-594,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3605.891,3608.427,I take it you agree then that the Board has to agree.
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3608.427,3610.577,--no.
1987.86-594,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3651.285,3654.67,You mean the Board and the General Counsel was reasonable?
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3654.67,3656.522,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3656.522,3667.747,"Just to settle terminology, do you consider that a formal settlement or an informal settlement, where all the Board approves is a dismissal of the complaint, no order from the Board?"
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3667.747,3672.049,I would regard that as an informal settlement.
1987.86-594,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3741.776,3742.343,Your time--
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3742.343,3743.145,--to go for enforcement.
1987.86-594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3743.145,3745.011,"--Mr. Come, your time has expired."
1987.86-594,2,37058,norton_j_come,,3745.011,3745.545,Right.
1987.86-594,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3745.545,3747.295,The case is submitted.
