1998.98-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.297,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-85, James B. Hunt v. Martin Cromartie."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,62.771,64.873,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-85,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,180.773,193.153,"Was there any allegation that the... the precinct numbers were used as a surrogate for race; that is to say, precinct numbers were used in order to include people of a certain race in the district?"
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,194.235,218.751,"I take it, Justice Kennedy, that is the... the heart of the case, that there is this... this overlap, and so given the fact that this... that the precincts included in district 12 are more Democratic and that there is a correlation... it's more African-Americans adhere to the Democratic Party and registration at the present time... that one could have done that as a pretext."
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.111,286.916,"Mr. Dellinger, you say that there's no evidence, but I... some of the districts that... that were carved up in order to create this unusually shaped district or some of the... some of the counties were indeed overwhelmingly Democratic, and it would have been easy to put in more Democrats without putting in more black Democrats."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,332.719,333.4,"Well, you make--"
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.4,341.165,"--there may not be enough evidence, but it seems to me to go too far to say that there's no evidence that... that there was any racial gerrymander here."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,341.165,356.756,"--Well, to be precise, Justice Kennedy's question was whether there was any evidence that they... that they made a pretextual use of creating a Democratic district, of using Democratic precincts in order to create a district that was more African-American."
1998.98-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,518.659,520.871,"Mr. Dellinger, may I just interrupt for a second?"
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,520.871,521.051,Sure.
1998.98-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,521.051,526.453,"Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that there's a... there's a question whether the chain of causation is broken or not."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,540.482,541.333,"Well, we're making two points."
1998.98-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,546.216,546.687,"Okay, but--"
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,546.687,547.648,--in granting summary judgment.
1998.98-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,547.648,551.791,--the only thing we've got from... in... in front of us is... is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment.
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,551.791,578.308,"Well, we would hope that the Court, having before it the permanent injunction against the legislature's '97 plan, would clearly indicate that the State on facts like these was entitled to prevail, it's entitled to summary judgment, because what the State puts on is both direct and supporting evidence demonstrating that the shape of the district reflected a--"
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.308,579.939,"Well, that... that's true, but--"
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,582.523,582.713,--Yes.
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.974,585.154,Did you cross-appeal?
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,586.106,586.296,No.
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.296,587.355,"Well, we... we--"
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,587.355,588.757,I understand that--
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.757,593.88,--can't give you a judgment here that is... that goes beyond what... what you've asked for.
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,593.88,627.623,"--In the course... it would not be beyond the course of an opinion of the Court holding that the district court was, of course, wrong in granting summary judgment against the direct evidence of the... of the State that politics was used, to make it clear to the district court that the State's explanation, both direct and supported, that it created a Democratic leading district in a sea of Republicans, and that that is a fully explanatory answer and which was contradicted--"
1998.98-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,627.623,634.226,"Well, it may be a fully explanatory answer if we assume there is nothing else in the world that might come in as an evidentiary matter here."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,635.297,652.047,"--No, you can't assume that, but... but... but I think the State would be... the State would feel vindicated if it were known that on this kind of record where there are really just three things that were said to impeach the State's direct case."
1998.98-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,700.89,703.872,"Yes, but it sounds to me very much like a cross-appeal."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,724.174,725.917,I... I understand--
1998.98-85,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.917,726.505,Or the State didn't take.
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,726.505,736.383,--that the... the... what the State is... wishes to establish is that the preliminary injunction... the permanent injunction was in error.
1998.98-85,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,741.897,753.684,"Well, if the summary judgment case wasn't right, you could have the injunction vacated, and then it goes back presumably for further development."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,771.177,778.333,"--I do not believe that the State... I am not aware... we haven't thought through to that point, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.486,797.767,It's the other side.
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,797.767,798.177,--that it needs to put on.
1998.98-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,798.177,804.311,"It's the other side that... the other side, if they're denied summary judgment, that I guess would have a right to put in some evidence."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,808.705,808.945,I think that's right.
1998.98-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,809.436,818.022,"--wouldn't that automatically say to you, well, if the law doesn't permit them to win, if this evidence doesn't permit them as a matter to law... of law to win, it must permit somebody to win?"
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,822.944,824.794,"--Well, it would be interesting to me to know what other evidence they could have."
1998.98-85,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,825.405,825.696,"Well, that's their problem."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,825.696,826.277,--That's right.
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.748,829.99,What evidence... what evidence do you have?
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,839.978,841.921,"--Well, anyway, we have both direct and circumstantial evidence."
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.921,848.145,"And now, it... it has to be evidence showing that there is a controverted issue of fact."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,871.76,872.701,"No, I certainly wouldn't think so."
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.701,877.696,"So, despite these statements by the legislatures... legislators that, oh, no--"
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,877.696,878.956,I believe the record doesn't need--
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.956,890.133,"--this was just politics, it is conceivable that the district court looked at those statements, looked at the... looked at the district that had been drawn, looked at other statements, and said these things are inherently incredible."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,892.427,893.083,--Yes.
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.94,901.442,"Well, I didn't mean to imply that."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,901.442,901.85,--I understand that.
1998.98-85,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,902.922,905.085,It was what is known as a hypothetical felon.
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,905.425,907.196,--someone who is a 10-times convicted felon.
1998.98-85,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,955.929,963.896,"You don't contend that the Shaw line of cases and Miller apply only to majority-minority districts, do you?"
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,963.896,965.054,We... we do not.
1998.98-85,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.102,982.216,"Well, it seems to me that it was somewhat troubling for some of those who drew the district to say, good news, this isn't majority-minority."
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,983.518,984.269,--Right.
1998.98-85,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.269,984.8,--of Shaw v. Miller.
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,984.8,985.371,It... it--
1998.98-85,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,985.371,988.513,--in itself circumstantial evidence that impermissible fact--
1998.98-85,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,988.513,997.129,--It is circumstantial evidence in the sense that it doesn't communicate the message that this is a district whose representative is supposed to only care about the interest of one racial group.
1998.98-85,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1000.963,1002.495,"--Very well, Mr. Dellinger."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1004.756,1017.834,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.951,1031.373,What does a predominant motive mean?
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1033.213,1034.375,I think the--
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.375,1042.422,"Suppose... suppose the district would have been drawn almost this way, but... but a few curves in it were put there just for racial reasons."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1045.044,1059.732,"--I think that that... I think the... the fact that there were substantial parts of the district that may have been put there for racial reasons would be evidentiarily very significant, but I don't think the fact that there were a few isolated pockets would be sufficient to establish a predominant motive."
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.783,1077.235,Why is... why is that the test?
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1102.976,1103.356,--I agree with you.
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.75,1110.272,"So, don't... don't you think predominant maybe just... just means ultimately determinative?"
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1110.272,1112.032,"No, I don't think so."
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.823,1117.338,It can be the ultimately determinative factor in how you drew this... this district.
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1117.338,1119.639,--It can be in how you drew a--
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1119.639,1121.148,"But if it's not the predominant one, it's okay."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1121.148,1130.013,"--It can... it can be a... it can be a determinative factor in how some isolated portion of a district was drawn, along with many other factors, like going to putting a plan together."
1998.98-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1130.013,1130.795,"Well, do you have to look at the whole district?"
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1147.928,1152.841,"I'm not sure that the hypothetical... I'm not sure it's sketched out enough for me to give a yes or no answer, but I think the main point is--"
1998.98-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1152.841,1159.937,"The hypothetical, as I understand it, can you... can you ever use race specifically in designing part of a district?"
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1159.937,1162.448,"--I... I take... first of all, I--"
1998.98-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1162.448,1167.24,"If your only motive is to use race for part of a district, can you do that?"
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1167.24,1174.816,"--I take the Court's decisions where it's repeatedly talked about the predominant motive, not just any motive or not just something that was a factor--"
1998.98-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1174.816,1176.006,But it didn't say as to the whole district.
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1176.006,1182.49,--I think that in the Miller case the Court talked about a predominant motive for a substantial number of people.
1998.98-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1194.498,1202.606,"Well, what would be the rationale which would allow you to use... to use race only as the sole factor in... in comprising part of a district?"
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1205.708,1221.927,"Well, I... I think the rationale would be that the Court has... when it's discussed the issue, has talked... has mentioned the fact that race... legislators commonly are aware of race when they draw a district, as they are aware of many of the other demographic factors of the district they're drawing."
1998.98-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1223.539,1224.097,I'm not talking about awareness.
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1225.78,1240.2,"--Right, but I think given that awareness, the Court has also said, or at least the plurality said, in Bush that the mere desire to draw even a majority-minority district, which this isn't, that even that doesn't... doesn't render it automatically subject to strict scrutiny."
1998.98-85,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.293,1281.177,"So, the position of the Justice Department is that in drawing districts, race and race only can be taken into account for some neighborhoods."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1282.168,1288.91,--For... for a small... I believe that's the position that the Court has taken when it has talked about the predominant motive of drawing districts.
1998.98-85,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1289.631,1300.77,"Aren't you saying, Mr. Feldman, that the... that whatever predominant means, it at least does not include cases in which the governing motive is to avoid a section 2 or a section 5 violation?"
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1303.342,1311.617,"--You know, I... I'm not sure I'm saying that because it may be that the question of avoiding a section 2 or section 5 violation may be relevant."
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.05,1319.711,Let me get the Justice Department's position correct.
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1351.232,1351.984,"No, I don't--"
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.984,1355.535,So long as it's only a... less than half?
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1355.535,1360.659,"--I think that what you're describing is a case where someone is trying to dilute either the white, black, or the black vote."
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.468,1375.181,But they're not going to say we did it for dilution.
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1381.345,1381.626,--But... but--
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.626,1386.57,"To protect the incumbents, we took race into account for a little... for a little bit of the district."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1386.57,1397.628,"--And I... I think that... as I said before, where that would be... it may be very powerful evidence that the predominant motive in drawing the district is race, but I don't think that it's... as the case--"
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.628,1400.54,"So, it can be the predominant motive for just a little part of the district."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1401.261,1412.387,"--When the Court has said that a motive for drawing a district can be race, I think it necessarily means that there can be some portion of a district where that is a motive in drawing one part of a district line."
1998.98-85,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1412.387,1423.093,"When you say a motive, I thought this was a case in which, in respect to all groups of minority voters, the State was saying, look, we put all of them in there because they're Democrats."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1428.198,1429.067,That... that's correct.
1998.98-85,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.067,1430.439,"We may have also thought, well, fine."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1437.367,1438.056,That... that's correct.
1998.98-85,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1438.777,1438.957,All right.
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1439.528,1448.374,"But I don't think on this point, on a summary judgment record, you can conclude that any line in this district was drawn in order... was drawn predominantly or even motivated by race."
1998.98-85,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1449.486,1453.996,Dominantly it was never only motivated by race.
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1453.996,1454.166,--Right.
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.23,1475.131,What in the world does that mean?
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1475.131,1475.412,--and the after that--
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.412,1478.714,What does... they took racial fairness into account.
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1479.536,1486.35,"--I... I take that to mean, if you read the affidavit, to mean they were conscious of their obligations under sections 2 and 5--"
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.35,1488.461,To use race in drawing the districts.
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1488.461,1489.232,"--And... no, I don't think so."
1998.98-85,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1514.069,1519.853,"You had a statistician who said that it was... if you had to pick between the two, was more likely political."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1519.853,1522.915,"That's right, and... and yes, that's correct."
1998.98-85,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1522.915,1530.619,"The district court didn't seem to do anything but say, well, we're talking about registered Democrats here."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1530.619,1551.833,"That's correct, and I... I think that was where the district court went wrong, because it was completely consistent with the State's evidence to say, well, there are some registered Democrats who are left out, to say what the legislature claimed it did was not trying to draw districts that had a lot of registered Democrats, it was trying to draw a district that had precincts that include those who would reliably vote Democratic on election day."
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.742,1586.858,"Mr. Feldman, don't you think it's appropriate for the district court to take into account that this is not some brand-new legislature that's walked up here creating a brand-new district, but it's a legislature that has been told to redistrict precisely this district because the last time they clearly did it on... on a racial basis, which was invalidated by the courts and upheld up here?"
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1586.858,1587.266,I--
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1587.266,1594.933,Do... do they have to pretend that this is not a legislature that has been pulled kicking and dragging into... into drawing a fair district?
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1594.933,1595.133,--No.
1998.98-85,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.133,1600.816,"And then when they're given another district that looks pretty much like the... like the old one, they cannot take that into account?"
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1600.816,1601.407,No.
1998.98-85,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.585,1618.627,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
1998.98-85,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1618.627,1619.178,--Thank you.
1998.98-85,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.178,1620.828,"Mr. Everett, we'll hear from you."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1620.828,1638.071,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-85,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1647.298,1663.787,"Well, certainly they are, but I think, at least speaking for myself, my concern is that there may well have been sufficient evidence here to preclude the court from granting summary judgment on this question."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1668.261,1671.022,"--Your Honor, we... I think the maps are a key to that."
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1679.819,1681.512,Do we have it in front of us?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1683.562,1687.275,"--They... this is the one I believe on 61a, the 1992--"
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.275,1691.079,This is 61a of the petition... or the jurisdictional statement.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1691.079,1691.828,--Jurisdictional statement.
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1782.119,1789.793,"Well, is it because they're taking the wrong point in time to determine the incumbency to protect?"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1807.324,1822.285,"Your Honor, I'm saying they're perfectly free to say, yes, we like this balance, but they're not... they're not free to say we like this balance and we're going to replicate it by having six Democratic districts of whom two will be racially constructed, and particularly--"
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1822.285,1828.899,"But they are entitled to say, we're going to have six Democratic districts, all six of which are democratically constructed."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1828.899,1829.649,--They... that would be--
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1829.649,1833.853,The problem that I have and I think the problem that Justice O'Connor tried to raise is... is this.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1842.748,1842.988,--Sure.
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1842.988,1844.23,--because I can see that it has some.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1899.128,1911.788,"Your Honor, we... we would maintain this, that their statements as to predominant motive are purely legally... legal conclusions in the present context, that as far as the material issues of fact, there are none that are in dispute."
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1911.788,1913.43,But let's take one thing about--
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1949.598,1952.53,"Well, Your Honor, there a couple of things that seem very important in that context."
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.112,1973.504,But... but explain why the registration of white Democrats is probative of how they'll vote.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1973.504,1977.607,"--Well, certainly a registration indicates a preference."
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.889,1984.913,Is it not true that there... that maybe a third of the registered Democrats vote Republican in Federal elections?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1984.913,1986.653,"--Certainly, that is quite true, Your Honor."
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1987.775,1993.248,And is it also true... just I want to ask you... that your case relied entirely on registration rather than voting results?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,1993.248,1994.098,"--No, Your Honor, that is not the fact."
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.153,2033.406,It was 66.49 percent and the other two were 62.8 percent and 61.5 percent.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2033.406,2033.746,--It was... it was about a--
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.746,2034.297,That's right?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2034.297,2037.449,--4 and a half percent in one instance and a--
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.449,2039.973,But each of the three you described won by over 60 percent.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2039.973,2041.545,"--Each... that's correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2044.026,2054.344,"But regardless of what might have been in the evidence, as I read the district court's decision, they are relying exclusively on registered voters."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2085.476,2087.788,It certainly was permissible to look at the actual results.
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2125.383,2148.507,"But the question of the districts that were excluded and what their composition was... for that you used, and the district court accepted, registration figures to determine how Democratic they were and whether they were excluded because they had white voters but who were Democratic."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2159.437,2166.921,"Well, the thing that was significant was that they wanted to put the African-American voters there because they could tell that would be a firm partisan core."
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2189.306,2200.573,"So, are you telling us essentially it doesn't matter, that maybe the district court was wrong to use the registration instead of the actual results, but it doesn't matter, we should win anyway?"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2200.573,2204.186,"--I would say in this particular instance it doesn't matter, that you--"
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2204.186,2212.103,But the district judge relied... the district... two of the district judges relied on... on the registration figures.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2212.103,2217.085,"--But in addition, the actual result figures point out the same thing."
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2228.905,2239.992,"Yes, but we're not going to reconstruct the record and we're not... another question was about looking at only 32 precincts when there are 120 surrounding that might have given a different picture."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2249.566,2268.98,"--What I'm asking you to find, Your Honor, is this, that these judges, who were very familiar with the situation, particularly Judge Voorhees who had been on the Shaw panel, looked at this evidence, considered it in the context, and realized there was nothing in the post hoc affidavits of the legislators... of Cooper and McMahan."
1998.98-85,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.928,2288.965,"Mr. Everett, can... can one say that on summary judgment, that it's a post hoc rationalization?"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2298.77,2311.479,"--Well, Your Honor, we... we would... we point out in our brief that there are some decisions of this Court which would certainly suggest that post hoc affidavits by legislators are not competent to show what the intent was at the time."
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2364.125,2367.287,What do you do with the conclusion of the State statistician?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2368.609,2369.33,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2369.33,2381.427,--What... what do you do with the evidence of the State statistician that says that the... the facts statistically analyzed are just as consistent with the incumbency protection as with the predominant racial motive?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2381.427,2394.225,"Well, it's a little hard for me, Your Honor, to see how incumbent protection of someone who has been elected pursuant to a race-skewed, race-based plan is permissible in this particular context."
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2395.166,2406.493,"So, do you think as a matter of law then... I take... is it your position that as a matter of law, his conclusion should be discounted to... to nothing for summary judgment purposes?"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2406.493,2409.235,--I think... I think basically that it could be discounted.
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2411.586,2425.076,"But isn't... isn't that what we... I mean, isn't that what we do at trials, if we do it at all, is... is... I... I'm... I'm just having difficulty in seeing what the theory is on... on which you discount it to nothing as a matter of law for summary judgment purposes."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2425.076,2433.24,"--Well, Your Honor, my impression is that when affidavits are conclusory and do not bear on--"
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2433.24,2434.202,"Well, but this is not conclusory."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2454.639,2466.115,"--Well, the... what you have here is a situation where the legislators are saying that, yes, we had this desire to create six and six."
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2469.457,2470.849,"Yes, but how about the statistician's conclusion?"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2480.985,2499.629,"--Well, the... the use of that which was impermissible, used as a base... as a benchmark of a plan which was determined to be unconstitutional, creates a situation where reliance on that... on that plan, even an indirect reliance as here--"
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2499.629,2518.881,"So... so, you're saying his conclusion is really beside the point, and the reason it's beside the point is you can... if I understand you correctly, that you cannot justify by incumbency protection the preservation of an incumbency which itself resulted from... from the scheme which has been knocked out on constitutional grounds."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2518.881,2523.746,"--I... I am saying that you can't justify by use, continuing use, of a plan that's... which is race-based."
1998.98-85,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2524.357,2525.068,Well--
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2551.024,2551.835,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.98-85,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2551.835,2556.247,There's no doubt that there's controversion as to what the conclusions might be here.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2556.247,2557.389,"No, Your Honor."
1998.98-85,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.609,2565.143,What fact did the... did the statistician controvert that hadn't been controverted before?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2565.754,2567.507,"--We are unaware of any, Your Honor."
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2569.85,2570.09,--Is racial motivation a fact?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2572.282,2575.364,Racial motivation was a fact originally.
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2578.566,2580.497,"Well, it's... isn't it the nub of what we're... we're litigating now?"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2580.497,2582.307,--Well--
1998.98-85,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2582.307,2585.111,And doesn't the statistician's conclusion bear on that?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2585.111,2588.223,"--Well, the racial motivation is apparent from all the circumstances here."
1998.98-85,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2589.766,2602.335,"Mr. Everett, the original plan that this Court looked at in Shaw v. Reno is reflected in your 1992 base plan map."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2603.594,2604.335,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-85,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2604.335,2614.232,And the plan with which we are now concerned is represented by the '97 plan?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2614.232,2614.883,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.98-85,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2615.484,2620.548,And... and how long are the terms of legislators in North Carolina?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2620.548,2623.969,"--Well, the legislative term is a 2-year term."
1998.98-85,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2623.969,2628.083,"So, we are not dealing with the same legislature in--"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2628.083,2630.466,"You're dealing with a different legislature, but they're--"
1998.98-85,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2630.466,2630.637,--1997 plan.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2631.525,2634.308,--They're acting with the same advice from the Attorney General's office.
1998.98-85,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2634.308,2635.459,But different people.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2635.459,2636.06,There are some--
1998.98-85,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2636.06,2636.922,Different legislature.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2636.922,2637.71,--some different people.
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2638.051,2642.144,That gets back to the... your original statement.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2658.519,2658.756,Correct.
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2658.756,2664.681,"Then legislators get together and say, you know, that plan was really a pretty good plan because it had a partisan balance."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2683.403,2693.01,"Well, we would say that where you're dealing with something which is remedial, there's a special consideration of showing that the original predominant motive has been eliminated."
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2693.01,2694.092,"No, no."
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2706.901,2708.894,We think that is not permissible.
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2708.894,2709.373,Why?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2709.373,2714.557,"We believe that in that situation it is tainted by the past, that it still carries forward the message."
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2715.156,2728.806,"But if what were driving at is... is preventing districting based on an impermissible motive, how is that furthered by your... by your conclusion here?"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2728.806,2744.448,"--Well, in a situation where the boundaries are so similar to those of a clearly unconstitutional plan, even though it's no longer majority-minority, we would submit to the Court that the same message is being conveyed that was found impermissible in Shaw v. Reno."
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2752.836,2765.155,"But isn't that just a show of perhaps a flaw in... in the reasoning of our cases, that you can't use race at all is... I guess is what you're saying."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2765.155,2780.144,"We're saying that you cannot use race to the extent where it is clearly determinative, where as, for example, in Shaw v. Reno there is a reference to... to persons in disparate areas who are placed in the same district because of the stereotype of race."
1998.98-85,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2784.629,2790.702,"What in your basic view, to go back to basics for a second, in your own mind... what is it in the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2819.452,2832.66,"--Well, we think, again, it's a matter of the purpose, that if it is done to... if it's targeted to elect an African-American as such, whether Democrat or Republican, that is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment--"
1998.98-85,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.66,2836.093,"Suppose race is just a surrogate for something else, Mr. Everett."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2854.004,2855.336,"--We would say no, Your Honor."
1998.98-85,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2858.028,2868.626,"And... and I suppose it's also use of race as a proxy if you say, well, there are Democrats and there are Democrats, but black Democrats are really strong Democrats."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2875.742,2879.185,--That would be a proxy and that is again a use of racial statistics.
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2879.185,2886.591,Would it be a proxy if you looked at those who had regularly voted Democratic without knowing their race but just look at what happened in the ballots and use that as a proxy?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2886.591,2897.877,"If that were a starting point, Your Honor, without any prior history, where it was not a treatment of race as a proxy, where a voter was not just a statistic because of race."
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.877,2899.079,Then let me ask you this question.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2911.418,2915.93,"Well, I think it would be... either would be very helpful."
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2915.93,2918.063,Which do you think would be the... which do you think would be the more reliable?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2918.063,2928.729,I think in a situation where it was... in North Carolina I think the... the registration insofar as it revealed race would be the more important.
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.012,2934.555,Why would their registration be... be the better choice?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2934.555,2949.387,"--The... why would the... in that particular instance, where it is identified and you're knowing whom you are targeting on the grounds of race, that would be a better choice if you were trying to get a particular result predicated on race, which in--"
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2949.387,2950.566,But if you're trying to avoid a choice.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2957.754,2964.577,"--If you were trying... if you were totally trying to avoid any... any use of race, certainly you could say I will forget all about it."
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2966.169,2971.954,"Well, if you were trying to district on a basis of race, I guess registration... I guess voting patterns would be better then too."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2971.954,2974.154,"--Well, what they... what they did here--"
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2974.154,2976.725,In some... in some instances and under some hypotheses.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,2976.725,2977.026,--Right.
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3037.447,3046.313,"Mr. Everett, in terms of summary judgment, one procedural feature of this case is... is disconcerting."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3084.36,3095.436,"Well, in a situation like this, Your Honor, where the statistics are forthcoming from the State itself... there's no controversy about it... we would say that the granting of a summary judgment was entirely appropriate."
1998.98-85,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3097.257,3107.476,"Well, on burden... on burden of proof, after a district has been invalidated as a racial gerrymander, perhaps the burden of proof should shift to the State to show that the district was not dominated by race."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3107.476,3109.049,--We have argued that.
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3140.901,3147.656,Was there a reason for starting over when you had two plaintiffs who qualified so that you could have carried on the old?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3150.07,3153.593,"--Well, Your Honor, there was a suit that they had filed."
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3176.249,3183.976,"So, there are none... none of the people who are now in the... in the plaintiffs' lineup from the 12th district were plaintiffs in Shaw v. Reno."
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3183.976,3186.73,There are two that were amended plaintiffs.
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3190.233,3190.701,But not in the original.
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3190.701,3191.722,--Not in the original.
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3198.838,3200.54,What is the status of the 1st district?
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3202.533,3203.883,That one didn't go up.
1998.98-85,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3216.722,3219.855,"No, but where... what is the posture of that litigation right now?"
1998.98-85,2,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3219.855,3225.969,--The posture of that litigation is that it's in a holding pattern awaiting the disposition of this case.
1998.98-85,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3383.971,3384.261,"Thank you, Mr. Everett."
1998.98-85,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3387.093,3412.599,"Justice Scalia said in the first argument this morning that the Court has a responsibility not just to look at the particular case but to look to the future, and what we're most concerned with when you do that is to think how important it is to make clear that there's a heavy burden on those who would challenge a State legislature in the exercise of one of its most sovereign functions of... of State self-definition as a political entity."
1998.98-85,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3413.27,3422.686,"In... in the hypothetical that we were working with where they keep exactly the same districts, would the voters still have that same heavy burden after a district had been previously declared invalid?"
1998.98-85,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3422.686,3435.936,"--I think that the... that the same district would mean that you had not, nearly to this extent, eradicated the message harms of the... of the 1st district, Justice Kennedy."
1998.98-85,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3463.366,3464.258,Mr.... Mr. Dellinger--
1998.98-85,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3464.258,3464.478,--Yes.
1998.98-85,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3464.478,3470.011,--I'm not sure from your... from your prior presentation what your answer to these questions are.
1998.98-85,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3481.739,3482.17,No.
1998.98-85,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3483.472,3488.273,"Could you race as a determinant of who are yellow-dog Democrats, so-called?"
1998.98-85,3,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3488.273,3488.474,--No.
1998.98-85,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3488.474,3492.037,Those who will vote for a yellow dog that's a Democrat.
1998.98-85,4,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3492.037,3492.218,No.
1998.98-85,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3492.218,3492.639,Right?
1998.98-85,4,39164,robinson_o_everett,,3492.639,3500.185,"Race can not only be used not only for its own sake, but as this Court has taught, it shouldn't be used as a proxy or a surrogate for other things."
1998.98-85,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3590.729,3592.381,The case is submitted.
