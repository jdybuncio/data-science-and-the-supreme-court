1988.86-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.445,"We'll hear argument next in No. 86-1088, the City of Canton v. Geraldine Harris."
1988.86-1088,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,65.152,68.004,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.86-1088,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,254.767,261.913,Is there anything in the record that anybody at any time had the vaguest thought of taking her to a hospital?
1988.86-1088,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,261.913,262.584,Yes.
1988.86-1088,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,269.346,271.349,"I mean, that they asked her."
1988.86-1088,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,271.349,275.33,"They asked her that to see whether that, which is one of the things that you're supposed to do under regulations."
1988.86-1088,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,275.33,279.964,"What I'm asking is did they... they could have taken her to the hospital without her consent, couldn't they?"
1988.86-1088,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,279.964,281.665,"Well, they could take her to the hospital."
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1480.556,1487.582,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.86-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.516,1559.387,"Mr. Rudovsky, did you make this point in your brief in opposition to certiorari?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1559.387,1576.358,"I personally was not on the case at that point, but in the opposition to certiorari, and I will get to that point, even at the stage of opposition of certiorari, the city's submission on the certiorari petition was not that training can never amount to a policy under Monell."
1988.86-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.394,1697.327,Did you say this in your opposition to the petition for cert?
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1697.327,1721.703,"As I said to Justice White, the opposition, which I did not file, I did not become part of this case until the brief on the merits, that point was not made in the opposition brief, but it was not made, as in Kibbe, the same reason, because the brief for certiorari, the petition for certiorari, itself expressed this issue in terms of inadequate training, which was the same position as taken by the court below."
1988.86-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.87,1845.865,"Do you agree, Mr. Rudovsky, that the questions actually presented and worded in the petition are properly before the Court?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1845.865,1850.549,"As worded, they are."
1988.86-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.274,1900.681,"But do you think at least the questions presented in the, as worded in the petition... I know that the wording is somewhat different in the brief... are properly before the Court?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1906.745,1920.193,"I certainly concede that, and the brief in opposition didn't, I think, for the reason that it appeared that the city was taking the same position in its petition for certiorari that it took in the lower court, that is whether simple negligence would be sufficient."
1988.86-1088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.656,1961.372,"Haven't they, haven't they at least preserved the question of whether inadequate training can ever be a policy or a custom for purposes of Monell?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1962.852,1965.065,"--Not in those terms, because they have conceded--"
1988.86-1088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1965.065,1972.379,"Well, the question on cert is whether inadequate training can be found to be a policy or a custom within the meaning of Monell."
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1972.379,1973.23,--That's true.
1988.86-1088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1981.295,1985.808,"Well, but it seems to me they raised it here and that we can answer that question."
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,1989.0,1995.804,"--We raised it as they did in Kibbe, at the first opportunity where it became clear to us that they are now changing their position."
1988.86-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.811,2056.745,We should dismiss as improperly granted?
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2056.745,2057.175,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.86-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.937,2061.467,And other cases.
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2061.467,2063.369,--And obviously it's discretionary.
1988.86-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.769,2092.007,"But the rule you're talking about, is it just a rule of the court that we normally don't hear cases that... hear issues that weren't presented below?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2092.007,2094.969,It's certainly discretionary in this Court.
1988.86-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.974,2198.537,"Well, is that by itself supposed to be a violation of the equal protection clause?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2198.537,2200.279,I don't think it's an equal protection matter.
1988.86-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2201.408,2205.372,Treating mentally disturbed people differently than physically--
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2205.372,2205.773,"--No, no."
1988.86-1088,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2243.306,2246.448,--What Constitutional right do you say was violated by--
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2246.448,2253.674,"--Her right, ultimately her right under the 14th amendment to necessary medical care as a person in custody, pre-trial custody."
1988.86-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.297,2282.823,"--If that was the custom, I suppose it was based on a notion that people who are just emotionally, sort of emotionally disturbed, they don't need medical care."
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2282.823,2285.244,"--Well, you have to remember, though, the facts in this case."
1988.86-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.745,2288.136,"Well, isn't that... that must have been the opinion."
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2288.136,2289.568,"--It, it may have been the opinion."
1988.86-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2358.851,2361.663,"In your view, is there a difference in a custom and a policy?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2361.663,2362.655,There is.
1988.86-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2374.353,2376.393,"Well, why is that any different than a policy?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2376.393,2382.21,"In effect, Justice Kennedy, this custom and practice becomes the policy."
1988.86-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2388.331,2389.743,So in this case it is a policy?
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2389.743,2409.144,"I think it amounts to a policy, although this Court, and the reason I hesitate to say blanketly it's a policy, is that this Court has used the terminology ""practice and custom"" where you have a written regulation which is supposedly the policy, and then over time officers by lack of training or supervision adopt a different practice."
1988.86-1088,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2412.557,2418.211,What do you have besides this one officer's testimony?
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2418.211,2419.202,That is the testimony.
1988.86-1088,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.963,2421.112,What else do you have?
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2421.112,2443.148,"--Oh, the other factor I want to mention in terms of the other piece of evidence is the testimony of the chief of police, who at least at the time he testified was the chief of police, who testified that we give no training... we're not talking about inadequate training... we give no training to police to help them distinguish between symptoms that may just be symptoms of an emotional disturbance, as opposed to physical problems."
1988.86-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2541.866,2546.068,Do you think every hotel in the country has the duty to give that training to hotel desk clerks?
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2546.068,2548.199,They may under state law.
1988.86-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2548.199,2548.99,I--
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2548.99,2550.669,But they certainly don't under the Constitution.
1988.86-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2550.669,2553.972,--Do you think they're negligent under state law if they don't do that?
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2553.972,2558.837,In some states the failure to provide training to security guards... is that the question?
1988.86-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2558.837,2559.385,No.
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2560.517,2560.967,No.
1988.86-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2567.022,2576.976,"You think police officers, in addition to all their law enforcement duties, have to have more training than hotel desk clerks so far as admitting people for a half-hour booking, hour booking?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2576.976,2580.479,"--Well, in this case it amounts to two hours, and it could have been more."
1988.86-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2580.799,2582.161,I thought it was 40 minutes.
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2582.161,2582.71,--No.
1988.86-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2693.073,2698.656,"You, you pick gross negligence from our cases, or from the statute, or just because you think it would be a good idea?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2698.656,2699.087,--No.
1988.86-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2709.035,2719.881,"Justice O'Connor and I were given a case in law school, which... that defined gross negligence as the absence of even that care which careless people exercise."
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2723.384,2730.118,"I have some law students who I teach in the courtroom and, they've been unsatisfied with some of my definitions, as we go along the continuum of culpability."
1988.86-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.719,2844.022,I'm also concerned about a jury speculating about what is gross negligence.
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2874.401,2876.064,You might in some cases.
1988.86-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.243,2880.135,"Why wouldn't you inevitably, if it's as foreseeable as you say it is?"
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2880.135,2882.136,"--Well, but I think that's the definition of gross negligence."
1988.86-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.27,2895.136,"Yes, but I'm a little worried about having the jury guess about that, whereas a practice you can look out there and say, here are ten instances of adequate, inadequate medical care."
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2895.136,2906.322,"--I think the response to that, Justice Scalia, in part is that to the degree you're worried that the jury may be deciding on some other basis, and maybe the officer acted not because of lack of training but because of predisposition, say, and how do we know?"
1988.86-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2936.764,2939.485,That's a realistic hypothetic you're giving us?
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2939.485,2940.867,Not only is it realistic--
1988.86-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2940.867,2947.139,"The realistic hypothetical is going to be what happens here, that the officer gets off and the deep pockets, the city, gets held liable."
1988.86-1088,1,21464,david_rudovsky,,2947.98,2956.035,"--I have seen it happen in the qualified immunity context, where the officer in fact says, I acted the way I acted because I wasn't properly trained."
1988.86-1088,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3265.827,3267.229,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.86-1088,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3300.311,3303.773,Respondent says it's not fair to him.
1988.86-1088,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3316.833,3322.347,"Justice Scalia, the truth is that the evidence in this case doesn't meet any standard with respect to the city."
1988.86-1088,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3326.16,3326.799,That's the evidence that was put in.
1988.86-1088,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3328.741,3334.024,"But even, even in the worst of circumstances, he knew he was obliged to put in enough evidence to demonstrate that the city was negligent."
1988.86-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.848,3352.357,"--Both of you, I take it, think that the Court of Appeals was wrong on its standard."
1988.86-1088,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3352.357,3352.875,Yes.
1988.86-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.339,3366.175,"And so the question is, if we just dismiss as improperly granted an admittedly wrong decision, the Court of Appeals is going to govern in a new trial?"
1988.86-1088,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3366.175,3366.595,--Yes.
1988.86-1088,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.837,3375.471,But you just said that you haven't heard your opponent defend the--
1988.86-1088,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3375.471,3378.112,--That's correct.
1988.86-1088,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3460.368,3461.519,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
