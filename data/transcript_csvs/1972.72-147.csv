1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,304.086,309.167,"Yes sir, an injunctive relief, excuse me sir."
1972.72-147,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,387.605,398.944,"Mr. Jaworski, has the court has said at least once and perhaps more often that a good deal more flexibility is permitted in state legislature then in congressional districts?"
1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,398.944,403.805,That's what this Court of course said in the Mahan and Howell case.
1972.72-147,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,403.805,405.861,"Well, we have said it before that?"
1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,405.861,407.804,"And also said it, yes sir in the Reynolds --"
1972.72-147,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,407.804,408.991,Reynolds against Sims.
1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,408.991,414.647,"Right sir, but it was quite well emphasized in a case that was decided or relevant in [Voice Overlap]"
1972.72-147,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,414.647,418.451,So that there was nothing new in Mahan against Howell in that respect?
1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,418.451,420.781,"No, I do not think so."
1972.72-147,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1307.462,1312.621,You say the reason Mr. Jaworski was - historically this is always this is been--
1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,1312.621,1331.247,"No sir this is -- I didn't intend to say that sir, I didn't intend to say that that was true as far as Dallas was concerned and I believe Bexar County because they have -- but it was not true as far as Harris County is concern. Harris County had some election in past they have floatorial representative or even."
1972.72-147,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1353.687,1358.349,And Dallas and Bexar is directly have had multi member?
1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,1358.349,1360.485,Dallas and Bexar historically have had multi member.
1972.72-147,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1360.485,1362.93,And Huston has also had multimember plus (voice overlap)
1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,1362.93,1373.091,Has had but also some mixture Mr. Justice Stewart there have been mixtures of floatorial representative and such as that are whole voters.
1972.72-147,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1373.091,1390.016,"Now wasn?t there a state policy expressed somewhere earlier that should have, -- that the state would have multimember until a number got to 15 is not somewhere here written."
1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,1390.016,1393.534,That may have been in the history of --
1972.72-147,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1393.534,1396.706,And thereafter you would have.
1972.72-147,0,34642,leon_jaworski,,1396.706,1402.758,"I do not think that this was a part of what was before the board, I do want to make mention of this."
1972.72-147,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1580.86,1583.245,Very well Mr. Jaworski.
1972.72-147,1,21412,david_r_richards,,1585.395,1590.024,May it please the court Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.72-147,2,22517,ed_idar_jr,,2794.845,2797.602,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3594.044,3612.872,"Correct yourself Mr. Chief Justice that is not our position, our position is that any minority except perhaps a political ones such as I represent is entitled not to have the area structured so that they do not have a fair opportunity to participate."
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3726.379,3728.24,And here ? what about jurisdiction?
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3728.24,3732.129,I intent to say word on that and I will commit.
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3732.129,3735.311,Jurisdiction if you talk about the early and as the case it would be --
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3735.311,3751.26,"Customarily Mr. Justice White it does, I will attempt to deal with that right now, and in the past this Court has word shortly is the expert on its own jurisdiction."
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3766.645,3769.745,Do you challenge the legitimacy of this Three-judge court?
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3769.745,3772.64,"No, not at all, not at all Mr. Justice White."
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3772.64,3774.747,So there was properly constituted at Three-judge court?
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3774.747,3776.16,There is no doubt of that Your Honor.
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3776.16,3778.128,And only question is whether there was injunctive?
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3782.809,3786.609,Mr. Justice White in the Gunn case.
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3813.245,3814.559,You do not have any authority for that.
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3814.559,3825.214,"No sir, we have no authority whatsoever but I suggest that by melding of what the Court has held in the Moody and in (Inaudible) with his decision in Gunn."
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3825.214,3826.982,Does that what you says an injunction?
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3826.982,3834.1,I am aware of that Your Honor however I would like to point this out to the Court to find --
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3834.1,3836.028,-- you are dealing jurisdiction question raised in.
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3836.028,3837.058,Yes Your Honor.
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3837.058,3846.192,"Let's assume there is an injunction, let's assume that we just agree with you and said that there was a jurisdiction have what?"
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3846.192,3852.224,Of the injunction which applies to Dallas county and Bexar county Mr. Justice White I should say.
1972.72-147,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3852.224,3859.297,And you would say that you would not have jurisdiction that would not extend to reviewing the judgment of the court with respect to the variations.
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,3859.297,3864.57,I would not wish to say that the Court's penalty jurisdiction would not extend in there Mr. Justice White.
1972.72-147,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4099.484,4114.341,"Mr. Gee, supposing Dallas county where a 100% White or 100% Negro?s they didn?t have any racial question, would you say there is a constitutional claim simply on the basis of the facts that its created as a multimember district?"
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4114.341,4116.742,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would."
1972.72-147,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4128.701,4130.872,But would it be an equal protection claims?
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4130.872,4131.441,"Yes, yes."
1972.72-147,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4131.441,4141.379,"Well supposing the Houston, supposing Harris and Bexar and Dallas are all multidistrict types of places."
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4146.483,4163.41,"I do, I think it would be very bad policy to have district of that size, Mr. Justice Rehnquist but it seems to me that it is the desperate treatment, the selection of different systems that represented the government in Texas which raises the equal protection question."
1972.72-147,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4163.41,4172.111,In your view how many people should be in the district for the state legislature under the constitution?
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4175.929,4177.363,That?s very clear sir.
1972.72-147,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4177.363,4181.978,I am not talking about the federal I am talking about state legislature.
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4181.978,4189.425,"Well, between 74,000 and 75,000 people Mr. Chief Justice that?s all we can do."
1972.72-147,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4194.059,4196.957,"I am just talking about district, take your chance?"
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4196.957,4204.9,Mr. Chief Justice I don?t know what it would be but I am satisfied that it is actually less than an million and half.
1972.72-147,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4236.582,4262.544,"I just saw, Mr. Gee going back to my brother Rehnquist questions, that you were making the argument that in the district as big as Dallas, quite apart from how the state treat Houston and quite apart any racial discrimination that you are making the basic argument in a district as big as Dallas it violets the constitution have multimembered districts, aren?t you making that issue?"
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4262.544,4270.266,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I certainly have and if I will answer your question that I was not -- I beg you Mr. Justice Rehnquist pardon."

1972.72-147,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4275.286,4275.98,Is that what you are talking about?
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4275.98,4277.117,Yes I am sir.

1972.72-147,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4356.732,4367.144,"Does the Texas legislature ever passed laws dealing with all cities having populations over a million or over a million five hundred thousand, are they sustained by the courts?"
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4367.144,4377.899,"They aren?t in some instances Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we call this back at legislation and this is the main whereby the legislature attempts to get around this provision."
1972.72-147,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4444.819,4445.978,Out of how many?
1972.72-147,3,42758,thomas_gibbs_gee,,4445.978,4462.466,"Out of 254 Mr. Justice Rehnquist, 19 counties have been got and four them have been exploded, cut into three pieces in the defiance of the Texas supreme court mandate the in Smith v. Craddick."
1972.72-147,4,34642,leon_jaworski,,4495.167,4497.443,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the court.

1972.72-147,4,34642,leon_jaworski,,4538.131,4540.663,"No sir, no sir."
