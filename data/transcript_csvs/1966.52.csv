1966.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.554,"Number 52, National Labor Relations Board, petitioner, versus Acme Industrial Company."
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,26.317,30.688,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.52,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,488.064,490.215,Does the company have other plants Mr. Come?
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,490.215,493.751,The company had other plants in the area.
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.402,700.964,"Well, Mr. Come with that letter of the company accurately as saying that no matter what we're doing, no employee is being laid off, no employee is being discharged because there's no basis for a grievance?"
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,700.964,716.681,"I think that that is -- that is what they are saying however, our position is that that goes to the merits of the grievance and not to the union's right to obtain information."
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,727.277,739.313,"Well, you're taking the position then that even if no employees were affected it's nevertheless an issue whether that the refusal to supply the information constitutes an unfair labor practice."
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,739.313,740.269,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.269,749.896,Even though the arbitrator might reach the conclusion that under the agreement there's no violation of the agreement because the no employees are affected.
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,749.896,756.106,"That is correct, because the union first of all thought that there were some employees affected."
1966.52,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,775.57,786.788,And I supposed all that this assumes is that the Board has jurisdiction order that information be given to the union as ancillary to a grievance -- to the grievance procedure.
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,786.788,791.339,That is correct Your Honor and that is the question that I intend to get to --
1966.52,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,791.339,809.094,"Because I suppose when that -- can I ask you, is there any doubt that the Board has a power to order a company to give the union information as ancillary to collective bargaining?"
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,809.094,818.965,"No, there is no doubt about that and I think we can start with two principles as to which there is no doubt."
1966.52,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,909.966,917.711,Can I clarify this for myself in a kind of a simple way.
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,947.054,968.88,"I think that it would Your Honor and I think that's the -- that is this case is, as we view it because as I will attempt to show although the company in it's brief attempts to raise some question as to whether this is really a grievable matter under the contract."
1966.52,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,977.808,1007.3,"So that we have here the hard question as to whether the Board has a power under the statutory scheme, the order of the company to give the union information relating to a grievance not for purposes of collective bargaining in either sense, either in the sense of making the agreement or the administration of the agreement."
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1007.3,1020.588,That is correct with this footnote that I would interpolate that the processing of grievances is regarded as part of the process of collective bargaining.
1966.52,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1053.278,1072.306,"Well, let's cut right into the bone with that analysis because doesn't the statute say that the Boards for now in effect that the Boards have no jurisdiction to what, construe the terms of the collective bargaining agreement?"
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1072.306,1089.768,"Well, I don't think that the statute says that in so many words and I might say that this issue is -- in our view is going to be presented in sharper focus in the case that follows."
1966.52,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1089.768,1090.993,Yes.
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.014,1133.817,"Well, would that go so far Mr. Come, that this agreement had said on this very issue."
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1170.072,1178.112,I would say and start out with the outset by saying that that is a much more difficult case than this one.
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.678,1180.239,I know but it was --
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1180.239,1180.764,"Yes, sir."
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1180.764,1182.987,If you're reliance in 10 (a) --
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1182.987,1183.373,"Yes, sir."
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1183.373,1185.679,"-- is solid, then why wouldn't that apply even that?"
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1185.679,1194.649,My position would be that under 10 (a) the Board would have power but nevertheless find an unfair labor practice in the situation that you're --
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.649,1195.867,In a theory situation.
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1195.867,1198.235,"In the situation you're presenting, yes Your Honor."
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1198.235,1207.342,"I'm -- I just wanted to add to this agreement the provision I had suggested and then give the very situation we have before us, you would still be here, you tell me?"
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1207.342,1235.829,"I may not be here not for the reason that the Board would not have power but as Your Honor is aware, the Board as a matter of policy or discretion thus differ to arbitrable arrangements and adjustments and whether that sort of a situation would be an appropriate one for Board deferral would be the question."
1966.52,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.028,1238.283,"Is that discretional, that power?"
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1238.283,1239.52,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1966.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1862.509,1874.517,"Mr. Come, may I ask, has this been the usual procedure in recent years in the labor movement to do this?"
1966.52,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1874.517,1885.595,I think the usual procedure as I understand it has been to supply this information.
1966.52,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1939.636,1949.518,Mr. Kovar.
1966.52,1,22631,e_allan_kovar,,1949.518,1953.896,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.3,2021.562,"What did you call it, Mr. Kovar?"
1966.52,1,22631,e_allan_kovar,,2021.562,2022.696,A chucker machine.
1966.52,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.696,2024.29,C-H-U-K-K-E-R?
1966.52,1,22631,e_allan_kovar,,2024.29,2027.893,"C-H-U-C-K-E-R, I believe."
1966.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2128.025,2139.343,"Well, Mr. Kovar, I supposed though that in this principle as applied to your small company, it would also be applied to General Motors, wouldn't it?"
1966.52,1,22631,e_allan_kovar,,2139.343,2161.523,"Well, I think as this Court stated in the Truitt case Mr. Chief Justice and I quote, ""The inquiry must always be whether or not under the circumstances of the particular case the statutory objective to bargain in good faith has been met so that what applies in the General Motor situation may or may not apply in the Acme Industrial situation."""
1966.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2169.13,2180.531,"Well, do you mean that if the facts were the same in the General Motors case as it is in the Acme case that there would be a different rule?"
1966.52,1,22631,e_allan_kovar,,2180.531,2190.874,"Well, it seems to me the question poses and impossible situation while the Treasurer of Acme Industrial would no doubt enjoy status of being equal to General Motors --"
1966.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2190.874,2191.068,"Oh, I'm not -- we're not --"
1966.52,1,22631,e_allan_kovar,,2191.068,2192.289,General motors cannot be Acme Industrial.
1966.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2192.289,2207.572,"We're not talking about that but if the machinery was moved from General Motors under the same conditions that it's moved here, wouldn't the same principle apply?"
1966.52,1,22631,e_allan_kovar,,2207.572,2210.338,"Under the same circumstances, exactly yes."
1966.52,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2210.338,2210.683,That's is all I want --
1966.52,1,22631,e_allan_kovar,,2210.683,2220.845,But there cannot be the same circumstances of course because the two companies are so totally dissimilar in size if nothing else that one would have to look in to the relationship with the parties.
