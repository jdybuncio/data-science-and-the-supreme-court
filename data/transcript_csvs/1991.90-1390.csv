1991.90-1390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.968,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-1390, General Motors Corporation v. Evert Romein."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,53.365,59.329,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it please the Court:"
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.983,272.729,"Mr. Geller, what is the contract exactly that you say was impaired?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,272.729,279.093,The contract is the contract of employment between employers in the State and these employees.
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.093,298.145,"Well, if you look back at the original employment contract with people who were hired before 1981 who were injured and put on disability before then, I assume under the terms of the original program, there would be no coordination of benefits."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,298.145,298.997,There was no--
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.997,301.04,That was the original understanding.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,301.04,304.57,"--Well, there was no coordination of benefits at that time, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,305.12,307.19,So how can that contract be impaired?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,307.19,320.541,"I think because the terms of the contract, we allege, Your Honor, are that employers will make workers' compensation benefits to disabled employees in whatever amount is lawful at the... during the period of time of disability."
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.121,365.28,"Well, I think you could certainly argue that the contract was that of the original understanding between the employer and the employees, that they'd get what the law provided when the--"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,365.28,367.892,I don't think that can be argued in this case because the Michigan--
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.892,371.345,--when they were disabled and started receiving the benefits.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,371.345,375.906,"--First of all, Your Honor, I think the terms of the contract are essentially a question of State law."
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.463,399.721,"Well, for purposes of a contract clause assertion, is it purely a matter of State law or is there a Federal law component to what a contract is?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,399.721,403.094,There is a Federal law component in determining whether the contract has been impaired.
1991.90-1390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.952,435.655,"Mr. Geller, are the respondents in this case members of a class?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,435.655,437.526,"No, this is not a class action, Your Honor."
1991.90-1390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.526,443.55,So when did each of these people go to work for General Motors and for Ford?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,443.55,454.279,"They went to work well before the 1981 statute was passed, although they did not become disabled, at least in the case of one of the respondents, until right before the 1981 statute was--"
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.279,456.3,What were the terms of their contract?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,457.031,457.769,--It was an at-will.
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.769,458.82,--At-will contract?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,458.82,459.251,Yes.
1991.90-1390,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,460.511,467.267,"When you say lawful, you mean the absolute minimum that could be required by law; is that correct?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,467.267,471.328,--They satisfied their obligations during 19... during the period 19--
1991.90-1390,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,471.328,474.731,That's what you mean when you say the contract was... what was lawful at the time.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,474.731,478.723,"--That's right, they satisfied completely their obligations under the existing law during that period of time."
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.723,481.745,Were they represented by a union?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,484.526,486.339,"There was a collective bargaining agreement, yes."
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,486.339,488.78,"--Well, how could it have been at will?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,488.78,492.684,The collective bargaining agreement covered terms and conditions of employment--
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,492.684,496.775,"I know, but I suppose it probably provided that you couldn't be fired except for cause."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,496.775,497.676,--I suppose.
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.676,499.236,You suppose that is an at-will contract?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,499.236,501.58,I am not familiar with the specific terms.
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.619,504.482,"Well, don't say it's an at-will contract if it isn't."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,504.482,506.955,--I think these employees may have been at-will employees.
1991.90-1390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.399,523.756,So the essence of the contractual provision that you are arguing here is that the employers are liable to pay what's required for that pay period?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,523.756,524.397,Exactly.
1991.90-1390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,524.397,531.87,And that contract is based on long tradition and usage in Michigan?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,531.87,532.501,Yes.
1991.90-1390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,548.283,561.991,"Well, there had been in Michigan some retroactive adjustments of workers' compensation benefits over very minor manners... matters and reaching back just one legislative session, or is that incorrect?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,561.991,563.022,"I don't believe so, Justice Kennedy."
1991.90-1390,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,563.521,564.943,It had always been prospective?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,564.943,565.524,Absolutely.
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,686.683,697.218,"Mr. Geller, may I ask, supposing in 1985 that the Chambers case had been decided the other way, then the company would have had to come up with the past-due money, but that would have been because the effective date--"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,697.218,699.559,That would have been on construction of the 1981 statute.
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,699.559,709.737,"--Now, what if the legislature, while the case was pending, had passed this very same statute and said, we don't want the supreme court to make a mistake, so we will say this is what we meant back in 1981 or whatever it was."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,711.958,715.191,"I think we would have the same attack, although I think our reliance interest would be marginally weaker because--"
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.191,716.913,"Well, there is no difference in the reliance interest."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,718.826,724.089,--Except that here we have a definitive construction of the 1981 statute by the Michigan Supreme Court.
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,724.089,726.57,But you are challenging not just payments since 1985--
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,726.57,726.991,That's right.
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.991,727.581,--but all the way back.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,727.581,729.002,I think for the period from 1981 to--
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.002,735.536,I don't see analytically how it would be any different if the statute had been passed just before the Michigan Supreme Court had acted.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,735.536,737.656,--I think we would have much the same arguments.
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,750.035,751.187,"Well, there was some prompt reaction."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,751.187,753.097,--but we know for a fact that it did mean what the Chambers court said.
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,753.097,754.92,Wasn't there some prompt reaction to the decision?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,754.92,761.715,"There was a prompt reaction to the Chambers decision, but it wasn't until 19 months later that the statute was passed overruling it."
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.715,771.941,Would you... supposing in '87 they just made the new law prospective... changed--
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,771.941,773.253,"Yes, we would have no challenge to that."
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.253,775.814,--It's just the... going back to '81?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,775.814,776.445,In fact--
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,776.445,777.464,Just going back to '81?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,777.464,778.375,"--'81, that's right."
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,866.832,872.637,"But, Mr. Geller, under this argument wouldn't the 1981 act have been retroactive the way you are arguing it?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,872.637,875.328,"No, the 1981 statute was prospective only."
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.058,880.091,"It had adjusted rights that had accrued for already retired employees, didn't it?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,880.091,884.785,"--Once again, it gets to the question we were talking to Justice O'Connor about, what was the nature of the contract?"
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.145,904.026,It was a lesser amount than it had been before.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,904.026,908.88,"It was a somewhat lesser amount, and General Motors and Ford paid that amount lawfully during the period between 1982 and 1987."
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,910.43,921.398,"Mr. Geller, you take the position that these workmen' comp benefits are in effect contractual?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,921.398,922.74,--We do.
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,923.761,926.272,And yet the State court found they were not--
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,926.272,927.411,"--Well, the State court--"
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,927.411,930.564,"--part of the contract, as a matter of State law."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,930.564,931.916,"--Well, it's not clear, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,933.285,939.989,"Well, what if we think that's what they meant, that as a matter of Michigan law, that isn't part of the contract."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,944.534,946.605,"--Yes, and I think you can for two reasons."
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.831,989.862,"Mr. Geller, I have this problem."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1018.172,1019.952,"Yes, but I think--"
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.952,1021.294,"So prospectively, retrospective."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1027.807,1035.182,"--I think we... Justice Scalia, I think there is a substantial difference between the situation where in the future the amount might be increased, might be decreased."
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.069,1043.56,There is a difference.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1043.971,1044.402,--Yes.
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.402,1047.294,--but I am not sure the difference relates to contractual expectations.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1047.294,1048.103,"Well, if you assume--"
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1048.103,1051.415,"I mean, it may be a due process claim, but I don't see how it's a contracts clause claim."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1051.415,1052.046,"--Well, we also have a due process claim--"
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.046,1052.897,I know you do make that.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1063.563,1081.916,"--Exactly, and Your Honor, that's exactly what the employers in this case did between 1982 and 1987 they paid the exact amounts that Michigan had said they were obligated to pay under their workers' compensation obligations, and they took that into account in making a number of business decisions as to what their expenses were during that period."
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.916,1085.859,"--Oh, but they didn't know under 1985 that they'd made the right calculation."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1092.732,1099.457,"They weren't darn sure, Your Honor, but they looked at the plain language of the 1981 statute, which draws no distinction between people--"
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1099.457,1103.46,"No, but it bumps into a presumption against retroactively reducing benefit--"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1103.46,1112.176,"--But Your Honor, you have to look at the reason why the legislature in 1981 passed this coordination of benefits provision, and I think the Michigan Supreme Court in Chambers asked that question."
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.205,1172.053,"--Mr. Geller, didn't the '81 statute increase... although it let the pension payments be offset against the workmen's compensation, didn't the level of workmen compensation payments go up?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1172.053,1173.395,Not in 1981.
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1184.973,1187.243,But not for people who were hurt before?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1187.243,1190.586,"--No, that's not true, Your Honor."
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.978,1241.53,"So that... you say that the workmen's compensation payments that were due to... after 1981, that were due to employees who were hurt before were the same as the workmen's compensation payments for employees who were hurt after 1981?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1241.53,1250.116,--The obligation to coordinate was exactly the same and people who were injured prior to 1980 did get an increase in benefits in 1980.
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.116,1250.917,You didn't answer my question.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1257.219,1257.719,No.
1991.90-1390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1269.897,1272.359,How about those hurt before 1981?
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1272.359,1283.538,"--People who were hurt before 1981 were entitled to get supplemental workers' compensation benefits under a statute passed in 1980, and some of these benefits were very substantial and led to increases of up to 85 percent in their benefits."
1991.90-1390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1348.818,1353.542,"Would you say the same thing about a minimum wage statute, that that's contractual too?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1353.542,1355.433,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we would."
1991.90-1390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1372.795,1379.75,So that all this government regulation of conditions of employment become contractual really--
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1379.75,1388.655,"--No, Your Honor, I think many regulations are in fact just that, a regulation of the employer, and it's irrelevant whether the employer has contracts of employment or whatever."
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1428.941,1448.836,"--No, but this is... workmen's compensation is a little different because you got a private... anyway, supposing they added a new kind of injury they hadn't included and said that we've just learned that there are a lot of injured former employees of the automobile companies out there who were injured by a certain kind of exposure to something in the plant and we therefore want to retroactively have compensation for them."
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1451.006,1455.15,"I think it might well raise problems under the contracts clause, although the reliance interest--"
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.15,1457.742,"It would be pretty close to the coal miners' case, wouldn't it?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1457.742,1465.066,"--But you know the Turner Elkhorn case, Your Honor, which was not, of course, a contracts clause case, was a law that was retroactive in the secondary sense only."
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.177,1510.225,"But if seems to me if you have contracted to pay whatever Michigan law says in the future, even after the person has left your employment, that's what you say the contract is... we'll pay whatever Michigan says in the future... why can't you have promised to say we will pay whatever Michigan says we should pay in the future including, if Michigan changes its mind and goes back and decides that we should have paid more for some earlier period."

1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.897,1512.356,"I mean, if you buy into some of Michigan law--"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1512.356,1512.876,"--Well, because I think--"
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.876,1514.487,--why can't you buy into all of Michigan law--
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1514.487,1515.078,--It's a question--
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.078,1516.65,--in which case there's no contracts clause violation.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1516.65,1520.651,"--It's a question, Justice Scalia, of what the contractual expectations are."
1991.90-1390,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1527.116,1527.907,There always has to be a first time.
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1527.907,1534.182,"--Well, I think the question is whether on the first occasion, that it can be imposed retroactively, in light of the reliance interest."
1991.90-1390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1693.476,1705.525,Had the legislature passed resolutions earlier saying they had never intended the result that the supreme court of that State--
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1705.525,1711.809,"--Yes, in 1982, Justice O'Connor, the legislature had passed a resolution saying they didn't intend the 1981... but there are two things to be said about that."
1991.90-1390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1732.623,1736.803,"--That's probably because it wouldn't have taken care of the people from '81 to '82, isn't that right?"
1991.90-1390,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1736.803,1740.527,"--Perhaps not, but it would have taken care of a large percent of the people."
1991.90-1390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1743.909,1745.76,"Very well, Mr. Geller."
1991.90-1390,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1747.432,1750.295,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.131,1917.966,I suppose the people who were complaining were already retired and not employees any longer.
1991.90-1390,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1917.966,1921.199,"--That is precisely correct, Your Honor, because what--"
1991.90-1390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1921.199,1931.367,And I suppose the union probably didn't have any interest in what GM did to these former retirees.
1991.90-1390,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1931.367,1933.988,"--I wouldn't go that far, with all due respect to Your Honor--"
1991.90-1390,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1933.988,1935.978,It must not have been a bargainable issue.
1991.90-1390,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1935.978,1945.704,"--It was not a bargainable issue, and under the law of this Court it could not have been a bargainable issue because once these employees retired, they ceased to be employees by definition."
1991.90-1390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.283,1983.85,"I think the claim is that it was the prior contract, that the term of the prior contract when they were employed was that the employer would pay to them in the future whatever the then-applicable Michigan law required."
1991.90-1390,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1983.85,1985.429,"--I understand that, Justice Scalia."
1991.90-1390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.429,1987.71,"And it makes sense, whether you accept it or not."
1991.90-1390,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,1987.71,1995.097,"Well, Justice Scalia, of course, I don't accept it, and of course there is nothing in the Michigan case law or the Michigan statute which supports any such interpretation."
1991.90-1390,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.79,2065.411,Suppose they did with the minimum wage.
1991.90-1390,1,43354,theodore_sachs,,2082.042,2088.928,"The answer to your question, Your Honor, would depend upon all the facts and circumstances under due process scrutiny--"
1991.90-1390,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3425.882,3428.454,"Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-1390,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3489.675,3490.624,"Thank you, Mr. Geller."
1991.90-1390,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3490.624,3491.235,"--Thank you, Mr.--"
1991.90-1390,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.235,3492.146,The case is submitted.
