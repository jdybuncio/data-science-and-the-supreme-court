1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,16.785,21.662,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,199.374,201.056,"What was the date, please?"
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,201.056,205.786,"July 1st and 15th, Your Honor, 1954 as when they were announced in the press releases."
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,205.786,209.064,Is that remanding stationary to date?
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,209.064,213.53,"Yes, Your Honor, they have not been changed except as in case -- by case determination."
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,214.402,216.212,They are general -- they are general persons.
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,216.212,217.75,That's right.
1956.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,663.592,671.254,Can it do that employer by employer or does it claim the right to do it by a general rule?
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,671.254,694.267,"As I read Section 10 (a), Your Honor, it says in any cases and then it sets down at the -- in those cases, the state statute must have corresponding provisions not inconsistent with the federal statute, and I would think it would have to do it by general categories and not on a case-by-case basis."
1956.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,694.267,707.184,"Well, then in this case, did they do it on a basis of renounced jurisdiction on the basis of this particular case and what it involved or did they do it on the basis of a general rule such as a general law would be?"
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,707.184,713.135,I would say that we did it on the basis of their jurisdictional yardsticks which are general rule.
1956.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,736.038,740.189,As to whom -- as to whom -- presume that might possibly make a difference.
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,740.189,742.57,"I presume it might well, if --"
1956.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,742.57,758.657,"If -- if not, the Board could -- if it saw fit, subject employers at exactly the same type, to one law and other employers of that type to a different law without the fact, putting them within in the Jones category."
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,758.657,767.018,I would say they could only do that if they -- if the state law were -- met the requirements of Section 10 (a) of the National Act.
1956.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,767.018,768.695,"Yes, I -- I understand that's your position."
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,768.695,769.108,Yes.
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,770.082,775.419,But they do that everyday when they entertain a complaint or when they don't entertain a complaint.
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,783.381,784.995,"Yes, that's perfectly true."
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,785.085,789.465,And the whole point of having an intervening administrative agency doing to accept this.
1956.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,789.465,789.517,I was --
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,789.517,790.489,"Exactly, Your Honor I --"
1956.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,790.489,792.16,I -- I wasn't asking you about that.
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,792.16,792.897,Yes.
1956.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,792.897,794.492,I don't claim.
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,794.492,794.879,My point is --
1956.280,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,794.879,817.176,"What I -- what I was asking was whether -- not whether they would hear one employer and -- and not hear another, but whether they could by declining to hear one employer and not hearing another and sending it to a state court, whether they could do that knowing that the law would be entirely different to be applied to one employer would be applied to another."
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,824.349,832.933,"Well, I would say, Your Honor, that they could not take such action unless the state law were consistent."
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,834.035,847.148,"You mean under -- you mean if they avail themselves of the -- a party to see -- formally to see to a state, the state jurisdiction, is that what you're talking about?"
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,847.148,849.63,That and I say that is the only way they may do it.
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,849.63,850.397,"Well, I understand that."
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,850.397,852.069,"So that if they did at any other way, they are in effect --"
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,852.069,853.058,I understand that.
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,854.229,854.348,Yes.
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,854.348,855.476,-- then the other problems doesn't arise.
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,855.476,856.539,Yes.
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,886.941,889.324,(Voice Overlap) and to raise this kind of --
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,889.324,894.611,"I think it raised the very -- clearly, Your Honor, in the how can the Utah Board --"
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,894.611,896.993,You mean argumentatively raise this?
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,896.993,899.115,"Well, yes.It was not raised down there, surely."
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,917.838,925.868,"(Voice Overlap) -- that was a problem of the defendants, not quite in that form but that would be essentially, this difficulty that the defendants had in the San Diego case."
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,925.868,926.519,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,966.29,986.932,"I wouldn't believe that's -- or just about that because I think conceivable that a state may -- a state may have an administrative agency, the purpose of accepting the cases that should be allowed to be brought in the state court under the FELA, and I see no difficulty of that."
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,994.679,997.844,"Well, I think -- I'm not saying constitutionally, that could not be done."
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1049.277,1055.103,"What you're saying is, we've rendered about a half a dozen cases which we create its no man's land."
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,1056.788,1057.099,Yes.
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1057.099,1064.201,"-- in which we said, ""Never mind whether the Labor Board did anything or we'll do anything, you're out."""
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,1064.201,1064.685,Yes.
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1064.685,1067.859,And we know very well in both of those cases nothing happened.
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,1067.859,1067.933,But --
1956.280,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1067.933,1070.249,"And -- we'll, you don't have to have a law of covering everything, do you?"
1956.280,0,37740,peter_w_billings,,1070.249,1071.13,Exactly.
1956.280,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1096.823,1099.35,Attorney General Callister.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1099.35,1103.844,"Chief Justice, Honorable Court."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1415.761,1416.248,Why not?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1420.056,1432.59,"Well, there, Justice Black, it's admitted that there has not been one agreement entered into under Section 10 (a) because of its qualifying provisions."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1432.59,1434.737,What qualifying provisions?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1434.737,1441.456,The provisions to the effect that the state laws and the interpretations thereof must be consistent with the federal.
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1441.456,1452.636,"Well, I -- I understand that you -- I understand that you told us, the law is consistent and that -- what would be -- what would there be to prevent a session there?"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1452.636,1461.511,"Utah's law, as I pointed out Justice Black, is consistent -- somewhat consistent in -- in relation to this particular case before."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1475.778,1483.642,"In this case, the -- the Act is -- Utah has acted, as I understand it, altogether consistently with the --"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1483.642,1484.351,That is correct.
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1484.351,1489.473,"So that here, it's quite different to the other cases I would suppose."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1502.294,1503.945,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1528.133,1529.09,That's the dispute here.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1529.09,1530.31,"That's right, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1530.31,1546.993,"Mr. Attorney General, may I ask if your -- your consideration to this problem if they decide qualification to what you've said, I wish -- my regret, the Government isn't here as argue what they have said in the brief."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1591.986,1593.038,"Well, that -- that --"
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1593.038,1599.919,(Voice Overlap) -- or maybe lacking in certain provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act of its comparisons.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1604.382,1606.024,"Yes, that's right, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1606.888,1607.808,I don't understand.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1611.377,1611.444,"No, your --"
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1611.444,1612.869,"Now, Mr. Attorney General --"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1612.869,1613.983,"Yes, sir."
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1613.983,1617.717,"Perhaps, I correctly -- did not understand you correctly."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1632.071,1633.494,"No, no, you misunderstood me."
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1633.494,1635.599,"Now, that has to be a formal session, does it not?"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1636.412,1649.268,"I say that's the position of my opponent that even though the Utah lack -- law is consistent, it cannot act or take jurisdiction without the formal agreement --"
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1649.268,1649.689,"Well, there's then in other (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1649.689,1650.502,-- between the session.
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1650.502,1653.194,I mean there isn't any doubt about it.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1668.114,1669.408,That's right.
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1669.408,1671.431,I should think that must be formalized in some way --
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1671.431,1672.631,"I would assume so, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1672.631,1674.349,-- because that's what we have in Bethlehem.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1674.506,1676.589,Right.
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1709.911,1712.635,They haven't gotten around to where they must but aren't there seven cases?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1727.469,1728.113,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1728.113,1737.192,"Now, this Court has held the mere potential authorization of issue enforcing rules, doesn't in this larger case however."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1737.192,1737.644,That's correct.
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1737.953,1739.951,That's your position here.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1739.951,1744.905,"I think this position is even stronger because here, the Board has declined absolutely."
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1750.223,1752.962,Can you always tell what the area is?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1752.962,1754.288,Under the Board's --
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1754.288,1754.764,Yes.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1754.764,1756.765,-- jurisdictional yardsticks?
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1762.181,1763.315,What do they give you?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1763.315,1764.17,[Laughs]
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1783.106,1787.295,But dollars -- but dollar -- dollar isn't the only guide?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1787.295,1790.182,"No, but it's a convenient yardstick."
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1790.182,1795.143,"Well, it would be if it were the only one but they -- there are other substantive yardsticks."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1795.143,1795.36,"Well, they --"
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1795.36,1802.953,"Kind of a business you are, leave that controversy here as to whether you come within the union as employer for instance?"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1802.953,1804.212,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1809.289,1823.976,"Stated another way, your position, isn't it, that Congress authorized States to exercise jurisdiction in these labor cases affecting commerce if a formal session was made?Congress did that."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1835.261,1837.316,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1837.562,1842.989,"And you rest -- and you rest that, I take it, or so you take that view."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1863.958,1865.865,"Well, I also -- pardon me, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1868.034,1869.124,Have you made those arguments?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1876.428,1892.28,"But further than that, I think by reading the language of Section 10 (a), you can also reach the conclusion that Congress didn't intend to prohibit the National Board from declining jurisdiction in such cases."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1951.353,1955.379,I presume Congress was aware of it because they were so aware of the Bethlehem case.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1955.379,1955.617,That's correct.
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1955.617,1959.405,They amended it to grant -- state jurisdiction that there was assessment.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1959.405,1961.87,"That's what I'm getting to, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1962.023,1963.727,But they didn't do the other?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,1963.727,1966.1,"Well, I don't think they had to."
1956.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2102.665,2112.58,"Do you consider, General, that the -- the report of the committee that was quoted by counsel is consistent with that?"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2112.58,2113.827,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2113.827,2114.522,In what way?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2115.24,2115.343,Well --
1956.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2115.343,2116.568,-- would you mind elaborating?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2116.568,2117.436,Yes.
1956.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2170.602,2174.91,"But when they once fix the limits, they're not borderline anymore, are they?"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2174.91,2178.334,"That's right, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2200.294,2205.353,Do you know whether the Board asked the Congress to change this or not or just going to the Court?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2205.353,2210.969,"I don't know that, Your Honor, whether they've asked for a change in this or not."
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2210.969,2215.377,"Well, we've been told that in 1954, it's practically in the case."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2215.377,2218.063,"Well, there have been several amendments proposed."
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2224.361,2231.308,"It just seems frequent to be more a popular, so that is amplified due to fighting this to the Congress."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2231.308,2232.614,[Laughs]
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2265.549,2271.967,This certainly is that Congress is awfully discreet about telling us what it intends to do.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2274.719,2275.216,"Well, I agree."
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2280.106,2280.429,Is it?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2280.429,2284.478,-- this proviso -- this proviso was adopted.
1956.280,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2292.144,2294.085,Can you tell us what they thought about the Bethlehem case?
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2302.802,2304.836,Correct.
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2304.836,2331.962,"Mr. Attorney General, does it strange that Congress should have made the consistency of the criteria and of the session and yet, also, contemplated that whether or not there was consistency, the Board might form out by declinations of large area of its responsibility?"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2331.962,2332.656,"No, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2344.998,2345.316,"Well, now --"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2345.316,2345.714,-- I'm sorry.
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2345.714,2346.197,-- let me see.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2358.01,2359.356,"That's right, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2359.616,2362.373,That's a very --
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2362.373,2371.073,-- but they have set up these yardsticks and have declined jurisdiction in these cases which fall outside the limits.
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2371.87,2375.174,Do you really know why does they decline jurisdiction in any of these cases?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2375.174,2377.138,"I think I do, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2387.401,2389.654,So then however inconsistent --
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2389.654,2389.813,That's right.
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2389.813,2393.228,"It left the statement, remedies."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2396.734,2397.91,That's correct.
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2398.011,2402.271,"Now, that case is formed out."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2402.271,2404.283,Yes.
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2404.283,2406.11,I have trouble getting over that.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2406.11,2408.351,"Well, I don't blame you."
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2445.983,2480.097,"Well, my difficulty with that is, if I understand it correctly, it is not unusual for at least the local regional officers to refuse to take a case, let's say, in the construction industry only because the particular employer or the particular controversy doesn't appeal relevant to other matters pending before that office, he -- like the kind of controversy that that office wants to give its time to investigate."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2492.277,2492.483,Like the --
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2492.483,2493.371,Am I wrong about that?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2493.371,2493.836,"No, no."
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2507.996,2511.742,And I looked -- I -- I'm also -- the state court's being able.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2511.742,2512.257,Fine.
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2512.257,2516.707,But the difficulty is whether this statute allows us to say that.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2516.707,2526.428,"Well, I think under -- I like to say, first of all, you have to determine whether or not the National Board can decline to exercises its jurisdiction."
1956.280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2556.235,2561.737,"Well, because the alternative may have to be that the Board has to act and may be mandamus to act."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2561.737,2575.991,"Well, there we come to another reason why I think that Congress didn't intend to apply to this -- Section 10 (a) to these situations because Congress certainly, we ask to be charged with the knowledge of what has been happening."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2586.194,2588.366,"If then, they always have it."
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2588.366,2590.915,"Well, I still think, however, it's an indication as I said --"
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2590.915,2596.028,"Sometimes, to the pressure against the appropriations which have something --"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2596.028,2596.714,That's right.
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2596.714,2598.192,[Laughs] -- as you know.
1956.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2598.192,2609.553,"General, you -- either you or counsel stated 90% of the businesses of the country were less than -- had less than 25 employees --"
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2609.553,2610.184,20 employees.
1956.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2610.184,2612.453,-- or something of that kind.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2624.725,2626.919,"I have not, Your Honor."
1956.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2632.53,2633.126,Yes.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2633.126,2635.081,-- kind of opened my eyes when I read but --
1956.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2635.081,2635.297,Yes.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2635.297,2640.766,"-- I think you could correlate pretty closely, I mean, the number of employees as to the volume of business done."
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2645.47,2650.136,Do you know whether the Board has asked for greater appropriations in order to try these cases?
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2650.136,2650.735,That I do not.
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2652.462,2653.869,You don't know whether they've asked for it.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2653.869,2658.637,I imagine being a typical board that they'll probably ask for a lot more than we get.
1956.280,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2658.637,2660.547,It would be a little surprising to get one.
1956.280,1,22030,e_r_callister,,2660.547,2664.635,"[Laughs] Well, Thank you."
1956.280,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2664.635,2666.885,"Thank you, General."
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2669.225,2669.56,I -- I hope --
1956.280,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2669.56,2670.616,-- anything further.
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2670.616,2671.527,"In the time I have, Your Honor --"
1956.280,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2671.527,2671.803,Yes.
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2671.803,2675.303,-- I wanted to refer to two questions.
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2706.707,2708.128,Could I trouble you of where you're reading from.
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2708.128,2710.215,From page 27 and 28 of my brief.
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2710.215,2711.119,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2711.119,2713.254,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2774.633,2776.506,"Is there any -- may I trouble you, Mr. Billings?"
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2776.506,2776.808,Yes.
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2776.808,2785.836,"Was there any particular reason where as the minority reports that was referred to the Allied case, (Inaudible)"
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2785.836,2786.823,That's the same as the Bethlehem case.
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2786.823,2787.597,Yes.
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2787.597,2787.764,I assume --
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2787.764,2788.36,-- it's the same.
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2789.983,2790.199,Yes.
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2790.199,2791.325,-- any reason to that?
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2791.325,2793.171,"Well, I assume, Your Honor, that they were --"
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2793.171,2797.094,(Inaudible) my mind at all.
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2797.094,2802.347,And I can't tell from reading the opinion of the Court in which it comes on the Bethlehem if there's any difference in the facts between this case --
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2802.347,2806.083,(Inaudible) consider by the Board as you know this is together with deciding to it and I --
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2806.083,2807.331,Yes.
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2815.794,2820.936,"And in that, is this the only explicit reference in the Bethlehem's decision?"
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2820.936,2825.702,"The only one I've been able to find in this committee reports, Your Honor, is -- is that reference --"
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2825.702,2826.423,That was terribly --
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2826.423,2827.326,-- in the minority report.
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2827.326,2830.328,I terribly say they were irrelevant about it at all.
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2830.328,2832.231,"Well that, I wanted to point that out."
1956.280,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2851.001,2866.346,"I must have misunderstood you because on page 26 or 27 of your brief, you cite the House Report which said they were taking action to meet the situation made possible by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation case."
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2866.346,2870.488,"I'm quoting there, Your Honor, from this Court's opinion in Algoma."
1956.280,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2870.488,2872.256,"You're -- you're quoting from the opinion, not from the (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2872.256,2873.068,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.280,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2876.56,2876.822,Yes.
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2876.822,2885.519,"Now, I'm not sure there whether the House Report expressly refers to Bethlehem or not, but this Court indicated I thought it did, I gather in the Algoma opinion."
1956.280,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2923.419,2925.048,So they joined you here?
1956.280,2,37740,peter_w_billings,,2925.048,2928.639,"They -- they joined me in the position to my construction of 10 (a), Your Honor."
1956.280,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2928.639,2928.687,Yes.
1956.280,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2928.687,2929.92,"You persuaded them, is that it?"
1956.280,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2929.92,2934.59,I don't know whether what persuaded them [Laughs] but at least they joined.
1956.280,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2964.853,2970.468,What are the -- what if the members of the Board (Inaudible) Murdock in the Breeding Transfer case --
1956.280,3,22030,e_r_callister,,2970.468,2971.762,Yes.
1956.280,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2971.762,2985.689,-- indicated a reason for this is not budgetary as you indicate in your brief that the feeling that these States should have greater authority in the -- in the briefs or rather from the Act.
1956.280,3,22030,e_r_callister,,2985.689,2991.968,"I say, Your Honor, in my brief that for budgetary reasons that that's what the Board majority at least said in its press release."
1956.280,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3013.418,3022.827,"Under the meaning, from the point of view of policy the desirable thing to have predominantly local -- incident of local industrial difficulty decided by the locality --"
1956.280,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3022.827,3024.817,The distribution between a federal state.
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3024.817,3027.208,I think that (Inaudible) anyone would quarrel with that.
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3038.578,3047.073,"When you -- when you emphasize that this came out on a press release, we don't need to imply the informality of the communication, it's what troubles me."
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3047.073,3047.254,I --
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3047.254,3060.665,"(Voice Overlap) difference if they had formal regulation act for hearing appropriate parties, say, the National Manufacturer, the National Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO and then from the -- would that make a difference to you?"
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3060.665,3069.56,I think that it might give a little more substance to the argument that this is pursuant to their powers to make rules and regulations.
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3072.025,3074.996,You say nothing or have made some and I may have missed it.
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3086.726,3087.765,"In my brief, no, Your Honor, I have not."
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3087.765,3091.896,(Voice Overlap) your position.
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3091.896,3092.274,I don't think --
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3092.274,3096.54,The question of their power might as relevant to problems of this --
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3096.54,3102.39,"Well, I think -- I don't think it need be in the -- in the decision of this case in the decision of what 10 (a) means."
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3141.224,3153.223,"No, but that the whole question whether they have -- this Court once having said what it decided in (Inaudible) construing the statute to be what it -- bound it to be."
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3163.8,3170.39,"Well, the only thing that troubles me with it, Your Honor, is the word “empowered” in 10 (a) instead of “directed”."
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3179.441,3185.135,"Well, the Court is merely empowered or directed as by lawsuits in statutes to be brought?"
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3185.135,3191.165,"Well, I -- I've had some trouble with that myself, Your Honor."
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3193.546,3198.542,"It's the question of ""shall have jurisdiction"" I think in the old ICC case."
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3204.477,3205.253,"Well, I -- as I say --"
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3205.253,3219.935,"That's the very -- the antecedent question, whether that's the duty and charged with the responsibility and whether they can and what kind of a legal showing that they have made and said in discretion with us, that there are so many cases."
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3224.841,3238.121,"Well, I -- I think that if you -- you got to the application of these yardsticks to a particular case, you might very well raise the question of whether they could reasonably refuse to hear you just because they like these yardsticks as a method of drawing a line."
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3246.582,3250.335,"Contested in the recent decision in the Court of Appeals, wasn't it?"
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3250.335,3251.039,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3251.039,3262.762,"Do you happen to know how many -- whether in District Courts, there have been -- how many cases do you know have come up or they would be the Court of Appeals initiative."
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3279.662,3281.037,I would guess there would be.
1956.280,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3283.858,3301.062,"Mr. Billings, do you suppose that -- that on account of the fact that you and your adversaries have agreed, both party are taking the same side, some of these complicated questions could be escaped as being removed."
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3301.062,3303.265,But you haven't agreed with the Utah Labor Relation.
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3303.265,3304.896,"No, I have not agreed with the Utah Board."
1956.280,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3304.896,3305.284,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.280,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3305.284,3305.873,I see.
1956.280,4,37740,peter_w_billings,,3310.613,3319.861,"Well, that's perfectly true, Your Honor, but I gather that -- and so far as the facts of this particular case is concerned, they haven't agreed that my client was any better fellow than he was six months ago."
1956.280,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3319.861,3320.521,I see.
