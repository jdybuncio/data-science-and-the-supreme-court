1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,73.607,"We will hear arguments next in 1119, Orr against Orr."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,77.659,80.695,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,171.058,180.342,Would you say that there was something in the nature of role casting and stereotyping in Kahn against Shevin?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,180.342,184.393,"Kahn v. Shevin, sir is a - - I am going to in a moment."
1978.77-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.337,233.167,"Well, this particular provision of Alabama's law was certainly designed to prefer women, was it not?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,233.167,237.654,It was designed to prefer women sir because there is no statute which prefers men at all.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.93,247.198,"Well, now the real reason is that court ordered your client to pay alimony?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,247.198,248.263,Based on an Alabama's statute.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,248.263,258.613,"Yes, but there wouldn't have been an order to the alimony unless the court under the circumstances of this case thought that such an order was appropriate."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,258.613,267.023,"That is true if the statute would have held to be constitutional without the statute, so alimony could not even be questioned in the state of Alabama."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,267.023,269.969,Did your client ask for alimony in the divorce proceedings?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,269.969,271.374,He would have had there been a statute.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,271.374,271.828,Did he?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,271.828,274.406,"No sir, no sir he did not Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,274.406,276.239,And he didn't protest it?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,276.239,276.536,Sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,276.536,277.922,He didn't protest this alimony?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,277.922,284.561,He was not allowed to Your Honor at that time because the statute did not allow him to even request alimony.
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,284.561,285.497,But he didn't?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,285.497,285.93,"No sir, he didn't."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,285.93,288.399,"He didn't sign a piece of paper saying, now did he?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,288.399,289.539,"No sir, he did not."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,289.539,301.951,"Why -- the question on my mind and perhaps you can satisfy, that didn't seem to bother the Court of your state as why this is a case of controversy if your client didn't ask for alimony?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,301.951,313.738,The Appellate Courts of Alabama said if the appeal was timely filed when we questioned the judgments that were being -- trying to be obtained by the appellee wife against Mr. Orr.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,322.119,337.269,"But your claim is that, as I understand it that this law of your state is unconstitutional because it authorizes a court to award alimony only to a wife at the expense of a husband?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,337.269,340.313,"That's right sir, that is – it's only gender line strictly on sex --"
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,340.313,356.162,"Right and but such there could be a law, preferably constitutional law in your submission that authorized a court to order alimony to either party in a divorce."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,363.113,365.651,"That is correct, the lower court ordered --"
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,365.651,381.936,"I don't see how this controversy arises unless or until there should be a case in which the divorcing husband asks for alimony from the wife and the court of your state said, no I'd like to give it, it should be given in this case, but I can't under the statute."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,381.936,382.88,"Alright Your Honor, let me see if I --"
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.88,385.762,Nor does your case as approaching that --
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,385.762,388.016,"Well, let's look at it this way Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,403.224,405.442,Generally the husband is of the male sex.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,405.442,410.779,"Yes sir, and consequently also Your Honor the scales are tilted in favor of the woman immediately."
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,415.076,422.487,"Well, let's accept that, but in this case, in this particular case, what is that, that your client was deprived of?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,422.487,431.387,"My client was deprived because of the alimony statute, was suffering financial burden based solely on the unconstitutional statute Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,431.387,448.855,"Did he say to the Court, I want $500 a month because the statute which we have had here is an unconstitutional statute and you must give me the same treatment that you give to the wives?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,448.855,454.112,"He did so in a subsequent hearing Your Honor, which is attached and made a part of the appendix of the record."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,474.811,481.772,Is there any payer of alimony in Alabama today who wouldn't have the same result if you win your case now?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,481.772,489.727,"Would you repeat the first part of that, I am sorry."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,489.727,498.734,"Could every man who've been divorced and has paid alimony in Alabama today, would he have any readdress?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,498.734,510.729,"He could file what was called a petition to modify Your Honor in Alabama based on the change of the law if this Court held the Alabama statute unconstitutional, but this would be hailed again Your Honor on a case-by-case basis."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,510.729,518.371,"And if this is a man who never litigated this point any place, and he just comes in and say, I want my money back."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,518.371,521.091,"No sir, he litigated it Your Honor in the --"
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,521.091,524.406,"He never raised this point, you didn't."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,524.406,525.817,"In the Court of Lee County, yes Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,525.817,536.741,"Your case said that anybody who had not litigated this point can come in on a contemporaries and win, isn't it what your case is?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,536.741,538.26,"No sir, not exactly Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,549.523,555.629,May I ask you another question relating to your pros pose (ph) standing here.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,559.945,572.473,"Yes my client, he signed an agreement which the court of Alabama says by its law sir, that it goes into be sure that the woman, not the man but that the woman is protected to sustain the case in Alabama."
1978.77-1119,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,586.917,592.221,Did you make any record at that time as to what he would have done had it not been for the statute?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,592.221,598.849,"It was raised in the first time that my representation of Mr. Orr Your Honor, which was at a contempt proceeding before the Circuit Court."
1978.77-1119,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,598.849,605.14,"At the time he signed the agreement, he made no reservation whatever?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,605.14,606.616,No sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,606.616,613.392,"And I ask you now, why isn't he bound by his agreement?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,613.392,616.57,"Because of the wordings of our statute, Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,616.57,630.447,"The agreement does not say, I hereby agree to pay alimony to my wife only because the statute of Alabama does not allow alimony to be paid to the husband; it is just a flatter agreement."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,630.447,646.31,"Yes sir, but it is an agreement that is incorporated into a final decree which is looked at by the Court and the lower court at that point in time looks to see what Alabama pay should require that the woman is protected, nothing mentioned about the man."
1978.77-1119,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,646.31,661.012,"Right, but he undoubtedly gained something or perceived that he was gaining something from entering into that agreement, normally one does not agree to something without some consideration flowing to him or her."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,661.012,665.644,"In divorce proceedings Your Honor, in Alabama there are three parties to every agreement."
1978.77-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,696.975,698.075,Mr. Capell.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,698.075,699.039,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist --"
1978.77-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.039,704.676,What are we to take it from the procedural history in the Appellate Courts in Alabama in this case?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,717.186,719.609,That's the Court of Civil Appeals did Your Honor.
1978.77-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.116,726.91,"Right, and then you petitioned the Supreme Court of Alabama for certiorari?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,726.91,727.633,"That is correct, sir."
1978.77-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.633,741.528,"And the majority of the Supreme Court of Alabama simply did not write an opinion, it simply held that the petition for a writ of certiorari was quashed as improvidently granted."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,741.528,742.077,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,742.077,750.131,Now do we have any opinion of the highest Court of the State of Alabama as to the constitutionality of the statute?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,750.131,767.85,"Yes sir, if you are following that statement of that being quashed, if you look at Justice Almon's statement, which is a concurring opinion with the majority, you will see that it states and I am quoting in essence that any statute which favors women against men is constitutional."
1978.77-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,767.85,775.011,"But I take it he concurred specially because the majority did not agree with it, that is what the experience we usually have here?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,775.011,775.611,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,775.611,803.727,And the majority are simply silent and I am wondering in view of our long established rule that one must raise the constitutional issue at the very first point in any state proceeding and must renew it throughout that if Justice Powell's question to you does not suggest that perhaps the Supreme of Alabama thought the Alabama Appellate Court was wrong in passing on the constitutionality of the issue?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,808.818,821.223,"I would like to respectfully state that opinion would not be the reason Your Honor, I would like to maintain before this Court that Mr. Orr does have a standing based on the facts of the Alabama statutes as we have specified."
1978.77-1119,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,821.223,823.699,I am not talking about standing Mr. Capell.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,839.92,844.811,Yes sir and I have no answer for you to that question Your Honor.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,852.452,853.436,Excuse me Mr. --
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,853.436,854.468,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.468,859.879,"-- Capell, I am sorry to interrupt up you again, but just so I understand."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,891.126,894.661,"In my opinion in this instant that issue, that answer is correct sir."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,894.661,900.896,Because of course that is quite alien to the tradition and practice and rule here in this Court.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,900.896,907.721,That is correct sir and I do not have a -- I would be happy to brief that point and submit a subsequent brief to you on that point Your Honor.
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,907.721,914.595,Why doesn't the posture of the case the same as though they had denied review in the first instance?
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,914.595,929.697,"Well, my question -- Justice Almon concurring in the quashing of the writ as improvidently granted says, I concur in affirming the Court of Civil Appeals, so does that mean that it was affirmed?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,929.697,939.848,It meant that the finding of the alimony statute of a constitutional by the Court of Appeals that they are affirming the statute of Alabama concerning to alimony statute sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.848,945.152,"Well, they are affirming a judgment of the Court to which the writ of certiorari is directed?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,945.152,946.619,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.619,950.591,Are they affirming it or they simply dismissing it or quashing it?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,950.591,951.688,"Well, quashing means dismissing."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,951.688,957.372,And what is – you are a Alabama lawyer and you could presumably tell us about the practices in your state?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,957.372,960.63,"Right, quashing does mean to dismiss in my opinion, however --"
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,960.63,961.721,Rather than affirm?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,961.721,967.55,"Yes sir, but however, Justice Almon said and he had a concurring that he does affirm, he would affirm --"
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,967.55,969.507,He says he concurs in affirming.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,969.507,970.7,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,970.7,972.56,Not that he would -- not that he individually would affirm?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,972.56,977.991,And I do not know Your Honor if that's slightly opined or what of that issue.
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,977.991,984.553,"But he cannot bind the other members of the Court by any characterization that he puts on in a single opinion, can he?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,984.553,989.01,"No sir, Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1144.985,1148.098,Let's get back to the present day.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1159.762,1160.563,Alright sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1175.474,1179.105,10-A.
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1179.105,1181.414,"The Opinion by Judge Holmes, is that what you are --?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1181.414,1183.487,"Yes sir, that is it Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1183.487,1188.049,"This is the order of 15-A, that's the order on 15-A."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1188.049,1190.104,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1190.104,1192.265,"I see, thank you."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1192.265,1194.523,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.256,1318.722,"Mr. Capell, before you sit down --"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1318.722,1320.44,Yes Justice.
1978.77-1119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.44,1334.334,"-- is there any case that is inconsistent with your opponent's theory that discrimination against men is permissible if it's economic discrimination, that's the heart of their whole argument?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1334.334,1341.391,"Yes, its own economics and I think we have to differentiate sir again between Khan with Goldfarb and Wiesenfeld."
1978.77-1119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1349.083,1357.097,"Well, why can't one argue that both of those cases were discriminations – well, let's see, those discriminations against men or women as you view them?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1357.097,1361.088,"Well, I view them as the discrimination against men."
1978.77-1119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.088,1371.299,"Well, there is an argument that the female wage earner was the victim of the discrimination, because she got less for her Social Security Taxes."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1375.859,1382.849,"No, if you cast the case of Orr in a standpoint of economic considerations only where you have a gender type role casting."
1978.77-1119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.849,1385.015,Yeah.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1385.015,1390.079,So my answer would be determination of how you look at Goldfarb and how you look at Wiesenfeld.
1978.77-1119,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1390.079,1391.664,Whether they are discrimination against men or women?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1391.664,1393.594,"Yes, sir."
1978.77-1119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1395.313,1399.881,"Can I ask a question, if you should prevail here what happens?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1399.881,1401.765,It goes back to Alabama Your Honor.
1978.77-1119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1401.765,1402.54,And then what?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1402.54,1421.358,"Alabama will look at this case on a sex-neutral basis, looking at need not sex, looking at the ability to pay; looking at understanding of where both men and women come into Court on an equal basis, where there is no tilt, where there is no favoritism because of sex and that --"
1978.77-1119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1421.358,1430.151,What if your Alabama Court says that the result of this litigation is that no alimony is permissible in --
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1430.151,1432.142,Two things would happen very quickly Your Honor.
1978.77-1119,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1449.066,1453.41,"So that even if you prevail here, you still may ultimately lose depending on --"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1453.41,1465.665,"Yes sir, depending on what we call losing and what we call winning Your Honor because I feel that when Mr. Orr came into the lower Court, he came in with not a chance to bargain, to place himself on an equal footing when this is over."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1469.597,1474.215,"You are suggesting that in every divorce in Alabama, the husband is ordered to pay alimony?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1474.215,1475.861,"No sir, quietly the contrary Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1475.861,1476.704,That's what I thought.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1476.704,1478.833,"And yet in many, many cases, there are."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1478.833,1490.411,Are you suggesting that your client was entitled had the Alabama statute authorized and allowed it that your client was entitled alimony in this case?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1490.411,1496.032,"Whether he was entitled to it or not, we wanted the right to ask Your Honor so that we could go in and quote for the right to obtain."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1496.032,1503.291,You certainly have said we don't under the circumstances of this case my client shouldn't pay alimony at all.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1503.291,1503.624,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1503.624,1504.864,You just told me that.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1504.864,1505.005,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1505.005,1506.697,And you said that.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1512.582,1513.595,That's correct sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1517.774,1519.723,The circumstances of that particular case?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1519.723,1525.277,"Yes sir, and there are many men that who fit under that category who should be receiving and who are not sir, because of their sex."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1525.277,1527.22,"Well, is your client one of them?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1527.22,1530.105,My client would have asked and as a result of asking in my opinion.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1530.105,1533.402,"But why, he didn't even say, he didn't owe any alimony himself?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1533.402,1533.789,Because --
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1533.789,1535.8,Let alone ask for any from his wife?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1535.8,1537.79,Right because he weren't allowed to by Alabama law Your Honor.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1537.79,1548.309,"Well, you are certainly permitted as you just told me to say you didn't under the circumstances of this case owe the divorced wife any alimony at all, but you didn't do that."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1548.309,1558.696,"No sir, I did not do that because of the fact that is the matter that the state should take up again on a sex-neutral basis Your Honor, not on the basis of whether Mr. Orr is a man?"
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1558.696,1574.246,"Whatever sex-neutral or whatever, you never took the position that you did not owe alimony under the circumstances of this case until this constitutional attack on the statute itself."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1581.423,1582.254,"No sir, we did not."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1582.254,1586.412,"As you tell me, it was wholly permissible in Alabama for you to do?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1586.412,1590.244,It was wholly permissible in Alabama for us to raise the constitutional issue.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.244,1593.033,"No, no."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1597.517,1597.949,"Yeah, based on --"
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.949,1609.253,And this court decree was based upon the circumstances of this case in which the court founded under the circumstance of this case your client should pay his divorced wife alimony.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1609.253,1611.174,"Yes sir, relying on this state statute."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1611.174,1613.539,"Well, relying on the circumstances of this case."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1618.149,1619.127,Not in every case.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1619.127,1619.355,No.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1619.355,1627.472,"But it does, but it strictly related to man thing not women paying sir."
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.472,1631.198,Wasn't the divorce Court relying on a settlement agreement here?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1631.198,1632.674,"Yes sir, it wherein the state is the third party."
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.674,1643.279,"[Voice Overlap] as Mr. Justice Powell pointed out, the court didn't have to make any decision except to pass on the settlement agreement, did he?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1643.279,1654.116,"That's why and under the state statute Mr. Chief Justice, they being the third-party involved in each divorce suit, don't look to the fairness of the award as they should which is our contention."
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1658.742,1682.104,"Well, there are several others who were driving at, -- trying to drive that; wasn't the time for him to raise any constitutional question at the negotiation stage in which he would refuse to agree to pay anything and then he might be ordered to pay it and then he would challenge the validity of that order on the grounds that you are now trying to raise here and that the way of constitutional question?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1682.104,1692.272,"Yes sir, you are right Your Honor and but in addition to that Mr. Orr as the Alabama Appellate Court stated timely filed his objection to the constitutionality of that statute."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1695.664,1696.742,And the (Inaudible) proceed.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1696.742,1699.471,"Yes sir, yes Your Honor."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1699.471,1717.559,"But under the existing Alabama law, you have told me that a divorcing husband is entirely free to make the point that he doesn't -- he shouldn't be ordered to pay his wife anything by way of alimony and you never even went that far."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1717.559,1728.624,"There would be no hearing on that Your Honor because the courts are not allowed to even decide that or to sit on it, they have even reversed a lower court which allowed a man to stay in the home which state in joint tenancy."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1728.624,1729.102,But that is.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1729.102,1730.61,Because of the fact that --
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1730.61,1735.303,How many Alabama divorces do you would suppose there are where there is no alimony award at all?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1735.303,1736.466,"Probably, no alimony of any form --"
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1736.466,1738.01,Can't put a percentage on it?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1738.01,1747.325,"No sir, I would say Your Honor respectfully request to say to you that probably 25% of all Alabama cases there is not some form of alimony, be it alimony in gross."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.325,1747.766,But there is not any --
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1747.766,1749.146,[Voice Overlap]
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1749.146,1751.432,-- and that's perfectly permissible under Alabama law?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1751.432,1753.468,"Yes sir, looking at the ability of the man to pay."
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.468,1760.384,"Right and the need of the woman, including her age and the circumstances of the misconduct alleged and so on."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1760.384,1760.809,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1760.809,1770.04,"We all know that but you didn't even take that position, let alone that you are entitled to alimony from the wife?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1770.04,1770.434,No sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.973,1817.439,"Well, Mr. Capell, yeah suppose the Court of Appeals in responding to your claim had ruled that is as it did on the constitute -- but then said even if you are wrong on this nevertheless the statute would still -- we would still interrupt the statute is requiring alimony based on need as to either person and in this case, it is already been determined in the divorce court in effect that the wife was needy and that the husband could pay it and the husband doesn't challenge that here so we are just not going to change the, we are just going to rule against him here."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1821.553,1822.047,They would have been saying --
1978.77-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.047,1823.468,Would you be here then?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1823.468,1827.115,"Would I be here, yes sir, I would be here for the sole purpose --"
1978.77-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1827.115,1828.27,Why would you?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1828.27,1842.457,"As in Dale v. Dale, in the Maine case, the situation is such that Mr. Orr standing to come into Court at initial time to ask for fairness and equality under the law the guarantees the Fourteenth Amendment."
1978.77-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.688,1845.575,Let me ask you this.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1857.95,1862.613,Only upon where the Judge abuses his discretion.
1978.77-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.613,1867.454,"Suppose the husband is ordered to pay alimony and he appeals, has he ever won?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1867.454,1868.209,Has he ever won?
1978.77-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.209,1870.332,Has he ever won in an Alabama Court?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1870.332,1873.603,"Sure, on the discretionary abuse by the lower Court."
1978.77-1119,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.603,1896.078,"On whatever ground, on whatever ground, but so that the Alabama Court of Appeals if it had expressly said that there is already outstanding a Court order for the payment of alimony and it has never been challenged."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1900.295,1903.929,"We established it strictly on the constitutional basis, yes sir."
1978.77-1119,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1903.929,1912.166,"Mr. Capell, if you prevail and the Court should hold that the Alabama Statute is invalid."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1919.009,1919.749,No sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1919.749,1920.281,Why?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1920.281,1923.901,Because Alabama takes each case sir on a case-by-case.
1978.77-1119,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1923.901,1936.888,"But the statute under which the decree was issued is held to be unconstitutional in this case, why wouldn't every one of those cases be analogous to your case?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1936.888,1960.609,"They would be, they would give rise to the case being brought back before if the man wanted to make the claim saying that this alimony based in max on my case was unconstitutional like wise, but the court would have a sex-neutral statute which I would hope this Court would look at it and adhere by and therefore they could go and listen, otherwise it would not automatically terminate each and every award of alimony prior to the case of Orr v. Orr."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1961.186,1969.751,"Of all of the alimony cases that were handed down the same day this when was handed down, could they all file?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1969.751,1971.476,"I can't, Your Honor sir, I can't?"
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1971.476,1972.485,Why not?
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1972.485,1973.12,I can't answer that.
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1973.12,1973.433,Why could.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1973.433,1975.445,I will say they could file probably.
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1975.445,1976.96,"If you could, they could."
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1976.96,1977.566,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.566,1979.061,"And no magic, did you?"
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1979.061,1980.288,"No sir, there sure is not."
1978.77-1119,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1980.288,1984.161,Alright.
1978.77-1119,0,29716,john_l_capell_iii,,1984.161,1985.122,Thank you.
1978.77-1119,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1985.122,1986.356,"Very well, Mr. Capell."
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,1993.811,1994.808,Mr. Chief Justice --
1978.77-1119,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.808,2000.789,You might tell us some early points whether you think there is a case here at all?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2000.789,2025.067,"No Your Honor, I do not understand the questions by the Court to Mr. Capell to be -- if he did not ask for alimony himself, that is Mr. Orr, why would he be able to challenge the constitutionality of a law which doesn't give him a right to ask for alimony."
1978.77-1119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.28,2028.909,You don't make that point in your brief at all?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2028.909,2032.422,"No sir, I do not, I have not argue that point up to --"
1978.77-1119,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2032.422,2036.045,And he doesn't need to deny the wife's need?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2036.045,2037.244,"No sir, he does not."
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.244,2040.194,"Mr. Horsley, let me test that proposition."
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2067.829,2070.808,"Excuse me Your Honor, the statute said that the black."
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.808,2073.072,Alimony may be awarded against blacks only.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2073.072,2074.275,Oh.
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.275,2084.889,And the alimony was awarded against the black who did not ask for alimony against the other person in the lawsuit would the black person of standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2084.889,2090.127,I don't suppose that the standing question would be any different from this case.
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2090.127,2095.567,I don't think it would either and what's your answer?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2095.567,2099.233,I am sorry I am not certain that I exactly understand the question.
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.233,2105.314,The question is if instead of a discrimination between men and women it's where discrimination between blacks and whites.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2125.697,2128.958,"That's what I am saying, no sir I don't think that he would any more than Mr. Orr has standing."
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.958,2133.452,"Right, because and why not."
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2133.452,2139.165,Because he hasn't lost anything by it since he wasn't asking for alimony.
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2139.165,2140.209,I see.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2154.595,2170.937,"It is my understanding that to raise the constitutional issue, you should have suffered the discrimination that you are claiming is inherent in the statute and if you haven't suffered the discrimination, then it is not up to you to raise the constitutional question."
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2170.937,2178.477,How else could once suffer the discrimination by being ordered to do what the statute authorizes as against just the members of that class?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2181.845,2182.43,Well.
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.43,2189.369,The burden has been imposed upon him that's authorized only against members of the class of which he is a member?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2189.369,2206.19,"Mr. Orr would have suffered discrimination if he had requested alimony and then denied it because he is saying the imperfection in the statute is that it doesn't give him a right to ask for alimony, but since he has asked for none, he has lost nothing."
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.19,2208.947,Okay.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2208.947,2242.204,"As I understand this Court's decisions since 1971 in cases involving gender classification statutes, it is the law that statutes granting an economic preference to women are constitutional and this is so because the Court had recognized that in this country there has been a long history of economic discrimination against women and statutes designed to compensate for that discrimination deny or violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution."
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.979,2317.324,"What is there in this regular suit, Mrs. Lillian Orr is dependent on anybody?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2317.324,2323.151,"The judgment of the lower Court, the Circuit Court of Lee County Alabama."
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2323.151,2326.54,"Says that, says that she is dependent?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2326.54,2328.254,I think that's the inference of the trial.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2328.254,2330.55,"No, I ask where did it say it?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2330.55,2332.221,It is not written down so far as I know.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2332.221,2333.507,It's not in this record.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2333.507,2334.117,No sir.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2334.117,2337.88,But how can you argue it?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2337.88,2345.821,"Under the Alabama alimony law, in the cases in Alabama construing it, the trial judge takes in, is to take in --"
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.821,2351.635,"That would apply to a woman who has an independent income of $80 million, right?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2351.635,2351.944,What I am saying --
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.944,2354.223,"Right, right?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2354.223,2355.316,Would it apply to?
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2355.316,2355.83,Yeah.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2355.83,2358.908,Yes but the Court would have the discretion that to give her alimony.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.908,2360.559,Yes it would.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2360.559,2360.812,Yes.
1978.77-1119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2360.812,2365.602,But presumably a Court wouldn't order her husband to pay her alimony.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2365.602,2366.279,"That was not pointed, yes sir."
1978.77-1119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2366.279,2368.615,She herself had an income of $80 million?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2368.615,2369.778,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.778,2373.025,And where does that case?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2373.025,2373.828,Where is --
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2373.828,2378.636,The only case you've got is Mr. Justice Stewart is talking about so far?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2378.636,2379.491,The -- all of the --
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.491,2383.563,You have any – thought beside that in the Alabama courts?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2383.563,2385.822,I do not have the cases in hand Your Honor --
1978.77-1119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2385.822,2391.251,"In an Alabama divorce, does the husband always required to pay alimony?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2391.251,2391.969,No sir.
1978.77-1119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2391.969,2398.253,And upon what does the decision to order him to pay alimony depend?
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2398.253,2401.431,"The decision depends on the needs of the wife, the needs of the husband --"
1978.77-1119,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2401.431,2403.741,The needs of the wife and among other things.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2403.741,2405.621,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.621,2412.413,"But it is true, is it not that there are cases in which the wife is not needy but nevertheless receives alimony?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2412.413,2419.086,That is possible under the Alabama alimony law that could perhaps be an abuse discretion subject to reversal.
1978.77-1119,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.086,2431.046,"But the causes could be perfectly properly ordered if you had a wealthy wife and an extremely wealthy husband, you might still find that, that it's appropriate to have some alimony, would you not?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2431.046,2431.628,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2431.628,2433.721,The court is real court.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2433.721,2434.256,Yes sir.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.256,2447.102,"It is the wife of a broken marriage who need financial assistance for whom the alimony statutes of Alabama were designed, I don't say one word about married at all."
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2447.102,2447.396,One word that.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2447.396,2452.096,"She had a broken marriage, this will entitle her to it?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2452.096,2455.368,I think it said that she was in financial need.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.368,2459.456,[Inaudible] from the Georgia Supreme Court.
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2459.456,2460.581,Oh from Georgia.
1978.77-1119,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2460.581,2461.995,"Well, you adopted it?"
1978.77-1119,1,44913,w_f_horsley,,2461.995,2463.139,Yes sir.
