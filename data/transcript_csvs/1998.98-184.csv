1998.98-184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,62.951,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-184, Wyoming v. Sandra Houghton."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,65.613,66.564,"Rehurek, Your Honor."
1998.98-184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,66.564,67.045,Rehurek.
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,68.725,71.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,134.109,145.615,"Am I right that in... in Ross the reason that... the source, if you will, of the probable cause was... was information about... I guess it was the driver of the car, one person anyway?"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,145.615,146.757,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,146.757,149.188,"So, Ross did not have the issue in it that we have here."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,149.188,155.763,"That's true, neither Ross nor Carroll nor Acevedo nor other cases from this Court on the automobile exception."
1998.98-184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.828,186.233,"Well, Ross was an effort to get... get over, in effect, Sanders and Chadwick and some of those cases that just parsed the thing down to a fare-thee-well, wasn't it?"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,186.233,196.008,"It absolutely was, Mr. Chief Justice, and it was also a way to allow officers to know what the extent of their legal authority was."
1998.98-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,200.702,225.707,"If this passenger, when she was told to exit the vehicle by the police, clutched her bag with her, then is that the dividing line that... could the police, not having suspicion relating to her, but relating to the driver who had the syringe in his pocket... could the police say that was in the vehicle, therefore I can search it?"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,225.707,232.542,"Justice Ginsburg, there's two responses to that."
1998.98-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,263.863,265.985,Could... could he then go on to search the person?
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,265.985,268.836,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.98-184,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,278.483,285.997,"If DiRe is a given, if it's the law that you can't search the person, then why is that we can search the purse?"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,285.997,296.225,"Your Honor, I think there's a dividing line here that... that's probably based more on actual practice and common sense than anything else."
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.919,340.173,"Well, do you take the position that probable cause extends to every container in the car?"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,340.173,350.552,"Only, Justice O'Connor, with one qualification, and that is that the container has to be capable of holding the object of the search."
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.975,379.82,"How... how would your test extend in fixed... a fixed premises, a building, as opposed to a car?"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,379.82,386.082,I think the nature of a search of the person is going to be the same either--
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.082,386.963,Not search of a person.
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,388.335,389.975,"--Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,410.821,415.663,--And if there is no warrant but there's probable cause to believe contraband is present?
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,415.663,416.963,On a premises?
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,416.963,417.504,Yes.
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,417.504,419.006,He must get a warrant.
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.006,421.587,I'm having--
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,439.139,442.471,"I would not personally characterize it that way, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,463.244,465.145,Could I ask you this question?
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,498.927,505.863,"Well, that's a Rakas sort of situation by and large, but if that passenger was not the owner of that property--"
1998.98-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,505.863,506.753,He's not.
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,506.753,507.354,--Okay.
1998.98-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.719,545.348,"So the... so the... the passenger would not have standing to challenge the search of the entire car, but the right to search the entire car would include a right to search and invade the passenger's privacy interest in her own purse."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,548.89,557.045,"Well, your hypothetical is premised on him actually doing something he had no legal authority to do."
1998.98-184,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,557.045,567.033,"Well, see, I'm trying to identify what the... how you... how you cabin the various interests in privacy which both determine whether there's a violation on the one hand, and also where there's standing on the other."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,579.481,589.446,"Well, the reason for the invasion, of course, is... and this won't always be the case, but the reason for the invasion is that the officer had probable cause for the entire vehicle."
1998.98-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.446,592.268,But Mr.... do I misunderstand you +/?
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,599.213,600.125,Yes.
1998.98-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.125,601.916,--if there were no probable cause for the whole car.
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,602.386,603.017,Certainly.
1998.98-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.017,607.178,"So, to the extent she has a personal interest involved, she can challenge."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,607.178,608.179,"Certainly, certainly."
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,608.179,618.426,"In trying to decide how broad... broadly Ross should be read, I'm thinking of... of a possible distinction, and I'd like you to comment on it."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,740.174,746.769,"Because, Justice Souter, you need to take the perspective of the officer involved, first of all."
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,777.71,789.307,"Well, that's right, but if that reasoning is going to be carried, I suppose, to its conclusion, then the officer ought to be able to search the persons of the passengers, which DiRe tells us he may not do."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,789.307,795.502,"But I think the Fourth Amendment draws a distinct line on search of the person, and DiRe--"
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,795.502,796.751,Why?
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,801.426,804.788,--The standard isn't just probable cause for the search of a person.
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,811.043,816.205,"Well, are you saying that there need be no particularity requirement when you're searching something other than a person?"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,816.205,817.245,--Yes.
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,819.007,820.537,What's... what's your authority for that?
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,820.537,822.169,"--Well, I think Ross says that."
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,822.169,835.988,"Well, but Ross... Ross was not... yes, but the question is should... should Ross be read to cover my second situation when, in fact, the facts in Ross go no further than the first situation?"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,835.988,841.851,"It's true the facts go no further than that, Justice Souter, but the rule announced in Ross--"
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,841.851,842.782,"Oh, broad language."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,870.519,878.326,"--Your Honor, it's not just the fact that the officer knows a particular individual in that car has drugs."
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,888.0,888.481,In the pocket.
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,904.613,907.445,"--Well, of course, DiRe really isn't involved in this case, but--"
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,907.445,910.517,"Well, it will be if we accept your reasoning I think--"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,910.517,911.278,--Well--
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,911.278,915.37,"--because there will be an implication, I think, that... that would... would tend to undercut it."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,915.37,935.011,"--Well, I'm not trying to say that the search of the person can occur without individualized probable cause, but I am saying that when a container is located in a place where there is generalized probable cause to search, then that container is subject to search unlike a person."
1998.98-184,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,935.011,948.542,"One of the problems with the line you draw is... is that this particular item, a lady's purse, contains things that many gentlemen carry in their... in their pockets."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,963.841,966.783,"I recognize that situation, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,978.792,981.333,Are you sure that a search of a purse is not a search of a person?
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,997.072,1011.913,I think the search of a purse that's being held by somebody is not the equivalent of a search of the purse in the way the search of perhaps the woman's coat that is being worn at that time would be.
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1035.928,1040.191,"Well, what are the alternatives for the officer in a situation like this?"
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,1050.617,1051.909,I believe he could--
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1051.909,1052.47,--authorized--
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,1052.47,1053.679,"--I believe he could, Justice--"
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1053.679,1054.63,--for law enforcement officers?
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,1054.63,1056.39,"--I believe he could, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-184,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1056.39,1069.491,And then what would he have to do if we were not to adopt your view here and he wanted to search the purse and there was no particularized suspicion with regard to this woman's purse?
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,1071.251,1088.541,"Well, the search warrant apparently wouldn't cover it either because under Ross, the scope of the automobile search is going to be the same as the scope of the search pursuant to a warrant, and neither one would cover, if respondent's rule was adopted."
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1111.028,1114.61,I presume then the same reasoning would extend to a wallet in a man's pocket.
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,1129.29,1141.328,"Your Honor, I would draw this rather thin but I think distinct line at that point and say pulling an item out of your pocket is going to be a functional equivalent of a search of the person."
1998.98-184,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1141.328,1143.869,"If she had her purse in her pocket, it would be a different question."
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,1143.869,1144.779,I believe it would.
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1144.779,1147.262,But not if she was just holding the handle of the purse.
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,1147.262,1147.84,That's correct.
1998.98-184,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1149.332,1150.512,It is a little thin.
1998.98-184,0,38282,paul_s_rehurek,,1151.954,1154.656,"If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal."
1998.98-184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.656,1155.397,"Very well, Mr. Rehurek."
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1157.347,1168.016,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1198.424,1203.667,We're probing why this rule doesn't extend to the search of a passenger in the car.
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1221.869,1227.204,Certainly the logic of our position would tend to extend to a search of the passenger as well.
1998.98-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1228.634,1229.475,Is DiRe wrong then?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1229.475,1230.555,--Pardon me?
1998.98-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1230.555,1231.796,Is DiRe wrong then?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1231.796,1241.333,We would conclude that the rationale of DiRe may be incorrect to the extent that it suggests that there's no probable cause to believe that there's contraband on the passenger.
1998.98-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1254.621,1262.517,But the standard to justify than search is the same whether we're talking about a search of the person or... or a search of a receptacle.
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1264.447,1277.796,"That's correct, but the Fourth Amendment also incorporates the concept of what is a reasonable search and one might be able to say that what's reasonable in the context of property is not reasonable in the context of a personal search."
1998.98-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1277.796,1285.763,"So, probable cause... to search the person, you're saying perhaps we would have to say there would be probable... required probable cause plus something more."
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1285.763,1294.708,Perhaps one could say that there needs to be somewhat more individualized suspicion directed at the person in order to conduct a personal search.
1998.98-184,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1294.708,1295.777,I'm not sure why that is.
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1305.634,1307.805,Perhaps.
1998.98-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.915,1339.425,What is the basic rule?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1377.632,1379.832,No.
1998.98-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1380.774,1381.283,You cannot?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1381.283,1382.554,--search the person under DiRe.
1998.98-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1384.385,1385.287,Even if you really have probable cause.
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1385.287,1386.766,--Pardon me?
1998.98-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1386.766,1396.363,Even if you really have probable cause to believe that there is a pound of heroin in the passenger's pocket because there's nowhere else it could possibly be and you know it's there.
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1396.363,1396.994,"Oh, if you believe--"
1998.98-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1396.994,1399.495,"Even under those circumstances, you cannot search the passenger?"
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1400.156,1400.536,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.439,1406.992,"Look, I'm saying you know for sure there's heroin in the car."
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1426.422,1426.863,Yes.
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1426.863,1427.294,All right?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1427.294,1431.576,"In that circumstance, you would have individualized probable cause presumably."
1998.98-184,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1431.576,1433.459,"I don't know what this means, individualized."
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1444.846,1453.551,The model code of pre-arraignment procedure adopted by the American Law Institute would suggest that you can.
1998.98-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.515,1462.757,"In that hypothetical, you could arrest him."
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1462.757,1463.626,--you can search them.
1998.98-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1467.8,1470.672,Why is it inconsistent with DiRe?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1499.68,1502.933,"Well, there... there certainly is a lot of logic to that position."
1998.98-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1504.395,1505.494,Which is good for starters.
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1540.467,1543.619,--They may not always be the same concept.
1998.98-184,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1555.496,1558.889,"Yes, but you have an exigent circumstances exception, don't you?"
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1580.314,1592.322,"Probably so, yes, Your Honor, depending on the degree to which one has suspicion focused on the individual at the point that you conduct the arrest or the search."
1998.98-184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.322,1593.811,Do we have to decide all this stuff today?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1593.811,1596.014,"No, Your Honor."
1998.98-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1611.863,1615.717,"Well, would you say that... the same question I... I asked the first counsel."
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1624.393,1636.27,"No, we wouldn't, just as when the police are executing a search of a residence, somebody couldn't walk out with a box containing the contraband and be allowed to walk away free."
1998.98-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1642.374,1646.656,What is your answer to the warrant to search a house and a woman is in the house with her purse.
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1649.43,1649.939,--Yes.
1998.98-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.939,1650.48,You can.
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1650.48,1651.01,Yes.
1998.98-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.01,1652.372,Has any court held that?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1652.372,1659.104,"Yes, the D.C. Circuit, among others, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin Supreme Courts have reasonably--"
1998.98-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.104,1659.835,Are there any contrary holdings?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1659.835,1668.611,--Other courts have adopted a somewhat different standard that looks at the relationship between the owner of the purse and the residence.
1998.98-184,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1679.187,1686.193,"And did they more or less correlate it to the kind of person who would have standing to object to the... the search of the whole house, the overnight guest on the one hand and a transient on the other?"
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1686.193,1687.745,"No, that distinction hasn't been drawn."
1998.98-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1722.898,1724.217,Why is it so hard to apply?
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1734.664,1741.588,"Well, for one thing, Justice Ginsburg, the police shouldn't have to accept a person's word that a particular purse is hers."
1998.98-184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1743.971,1750.233,"Well, when they... let's... I don't... the... as I understood the Wyoming Supreme Court, they said they... the police found what was it?"
1998.98-184,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1764.045,1766.856,"--Could I answer the question, Your Honor?"
1998.98-184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.367,1786.027,"Thank you, Ms. McDowell."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,1788.558,1799.637,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.495,1850.71,"Well, Ms. Domonkos, the Wyoming Supreme Court certainly did not follow the language in Ross here, did it, in our Ross decision?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,1850.71,1852.823,It did follow the language in Ross.
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.823,1858.706,I... I thought Ross said probable cause extends to any container in the car.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,1858.706,1863.178,The... the scope of the Ross holding was that--
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.178,1864.289,I didn't say--
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,1864.289,1864.95,--The scope of the search.
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.95,1865.769,"--Yes, go... go ahead."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,1866.891,1875.065,The scope of the search is that where... wherever the officer has probable cause to believe that contraband may be concealed.
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1879.27,1883.311,"Well, but didn't it say... it extended to any container in the automobile?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,1883.311,1884.352,--Yes.
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.054,1904.285,"And the reason it introduced a bright line rule was because lawyers and courts have been hopelessly confused by some of our earlier decisions which parsed this thing to a fare-thee-well: Chadwick, about whether the trunk was in the car and who saw it when; Sanders, the same thing."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,1915.662,1921.085,Ross... the bright line rule in Ross was... was that all containers could be searched.
1998.98-184,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1938.408,1942.97,Unless the suspect had immediate access to that object before the search.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,1944.022,1944.92,That's another exception--
1998.98-184,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1944.92,1948.002,"Well, so that it's not as straightforward even as you've just stated it."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,1948.002,1950.624,--But it's still in compliance with this Court's holdings.
1998.98-184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1986.779,2003.899,"Would the case have come out differently if the prosecutor hadn't made a point of saying, now, we kept our eye on that car and we... we know that there was no opportunity to just slip this into her purse, so she's responsible?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2003.899,2027.527,"Yes, it's possible the outcome would have been different, but since we have evidence in this case that says, from the officer who testified, that the car was under surveillance the entire time and there was no chance for David Young to slip any evidence into Sandra Houghton's purse, there was no reason to believe that his possession crime would be... evidence of this crime would be in her purse."
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2027.527,2029.447,That isn't actually what they said.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2072.164,2088.735,This Court has already rejected a similar argument in Sibron v. New York where they said that the mere association with a drug addict... and this was a person... or a case where the person was associating with these drug addicts for approximately 8 hours throughout a day.
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.679,2111.22,Didn't she give a false name to the officers?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2111.22,2115.293,"Yes, she did, but the officer didn't know this until he did breach--"
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.293,2123.348,Doesn't... doesn't that suggest that the idea of identifying who's who in a car is... is not going to be all that straightforward?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2132.364,2139.461,"--Yes, she could make a false statement, but in this case we have an officer who made the determination."
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.979,2154.438,Suppose he did.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2156.35,2157.78,--I'm sorry.
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.78,2163.944,"Suppose after reading Sorrano and so forth, I thought, well, to me anyway, he does have probable cause to search the purse."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2175.893,2179.185,"Yes, if he had probable cause to search the purse, then--"
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.185,2180.707,Then that's it.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2180.707,2186.5,--Then he had probable cause to search the purse and the actions of the officer would have been in compliance with this Court's--
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2186.5,2190.581,"But if... if he had probable cause to search her, he couldn't do it, according to the Government."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2190.581,2196.435,"--No, I believe if he had probable cause to search her, he would have had probable cause to search her purse, all effects."
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.435,2201.33,But he couldn't have searched her without arresting her or something?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2222.472,2245.857,"Yes, Your Honor, if the facts are the same as in this case where you have a male driver, two female passengers, and there's no reason to believe that he has secreted something within the purse because the indication there at that point is that the purse does not belong to David Young."
1998.98-184,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2248.759,2254.335,"And, of course, if that's the rule that we make, then probably the best place for this man to put it would be in the purse."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2254.335,2264.9,"--It is possible that that is the way that he could have done it, but there would have to be some reason to believe that he did before this... before he would be allowed to--"
1998.98-184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2264.9,2270.997,It's unlikely that a man who is driving around with a syringe sticking out of his pocket is going to be conscious of hiding things.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2272.596,2274.226,--Yes.
1998.98-184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2276.5,2281.813,The question was maybe he transferred it before the lights were on the vehicle.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2286.455,2287.797,Yes.
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2298.913,2304.557,Suppose I wanted the simplest rule on the ground that this a borderline case.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2316.645,2327.401,"The... the rule would be that where there is only one person within a vehicle, if you have probable cause to search the vehicle, you may search all containers within the vehicle."
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2336.857,2346.344,"That would go for trunks, large cardboard boxes, valises, chicken coups, whatever the... the passenger says, oh, this all belongs to me."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2350.588,2354.96,"Yes, because there would be no probable cause, and this Court has required probable cause."
1998.98-184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2354.96,2356.74,"Well, are you saying that the passenger's say-so is enough?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2373.552,2379.196,There has to be objective criteria that indicates that it belongs to the passenger.
1998.98-184,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2389.001,2396.547,"So, the presumption is that a container in the car belongs to the driver unless there is affirmative evidence to show the contrary."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2397.449,2398.2,That's correct.
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2410.649,2415.033,"Well, that... that kind of discriminates in favor of rich people in a way, doesn't it?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2424.198,2429.201,--I'm just saying there's objective criteria to look for and that could be one of them.
1998.98-184,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2429.201,2432.393,"Even I have initials on my briefcase, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2439.68,2442.719,"In most instances, not."
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2442.719,2444.542,"Well, what instances would it be?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2446.613,2454.429,In instances like in this case where we have the belief of the officer that it did not belong to the driver.
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.012,2466.244,"Well, if you've got a male driver and two female passengers, I suppose you'd think the purse didn't belong to the driver."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2466.244,2467.035,That's correct.
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.035,2467.466,Yes.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2467.466,2476.713,"And so that, with claiming ownership from Sandra Houghton, is enough to... to say, okay, this item does not belong to the driver."
1998.98-184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2485.869,2497.476,"The... suppose this police officer, instead of just saying, is this your purse, he said, is this your purse?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2503.41,2505.05,"Yes, it is."
1998.98-184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2505.05,2508.773,And... and the answer is often yes.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2508.773,2517.028,"And if there is a yes answer that he can search it, then he has consent to search, and there would be no... no problem with the validity of the search."
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2517.028,2520.261,She left the bag too.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2541.615,2549.749,"No, Your Honor, and the reason for that is because there's no indication that this was a voluntary leaving the bag in the car."
1998.98-184,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2591.076,2597.15,"Well, I had thought it was a fairly straightforward application of Ross, but you don't agree with that."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2597.15,2598.552,"--No, I do agree with that."
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2606.567,2616.425,"Well, but I think it's you who are wanting to carve... carve out the exception from the language of Ross which says that any container in the car can be searched when there's probable cause."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2625.891,2643.152,"Your Honor, I would disagree because of the fact that just like you said with the Ross holding, probable cause is required, and in this holding, the Wyoming Supreme Court said there was no probable cause to believe the evidence was going to be found in her personal effects."
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2643.152,2650.636,"Well, but that's the inquiry that was superseded under Ross."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2668.457,2680.616,"Ross did not have any passengers, so we really... we don't really know what would have happened had Ross had a passenger, but the fact remains that Ross requires probable cause to search."
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.487,2708.835,One of the problems with the Ross opinion is it also said the search of the car should be coextensive with the search that would be authorized if they had a warrant with probable cause.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2724.564,2725.705,That is correct.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2725.705,2726.256,Yes.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2726.256,2730.327,And we have to take a look at what would have happened if this officer had sought a warrant.
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.527,2762.07,"Well, the question isn't whether the warrant would be issued."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2777.04,2778.611,--And that... that is true.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2778.611,2779.372,Yes.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2779.372,2790.728,"I guess we can look to Ybarra, which is the same thing that the Wyoming Supreme Court did, and they said, here is a warrant that was issued, but there was no reason to believe that Ybarra was involved with criminal activity."
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2793.52,2795.83,"But that... that was... that was a search of a person, was it not?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2796.682,2798.412,"--Yes, it was a search of a person."
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2798.412,2802.536,And it was... it had nothing to do with an automobile.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2802.536,2803.768,"No, it did not."
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.797,2828.933,"Of course, the bright... bright line rule in Ross didn't... didn't really last all that long because it was changed in Acevedo."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2831.414,2833.374,Yes.
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2838.68,2840.57,Why isn't that true here... the purse?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2869.488,2872.71,And that is the second part of the notice test.
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2877.783,2879.306,And is it not... but... I see.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2880.765,2881.496,I'm sorry.
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2882.167,2888.783,--Why was there not reason to believe that it might have been secreted in the purse?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2888.783,2895.317,The officer said he kept the vehicle under surveillance from the time that he observed the speeding and the taillight.
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2903.021,2908.674,"Well, but would he necessarily see a movement while he was following the thing?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2913.497,2915.38,He testified he saw no movement.
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2915.38,2918.332,But what about putting it there before he saw?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2924.647,2928.166,"Just that he associated with drug addicts, and that's all that you would have at that point."
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.952,2938.475,This just doesn't quite conform to common sense in... in my view.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2977.789,2982.313,--The other thing too is that we have no indication that Sandra Houghton did know about the syringe.
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2987.517,2990.477,"Well, but couldn't he have grabbed her purse perhaps without her knowledge?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,2990.477,2992.628,"It is possible that it could have happened, yes."
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2996.031,2999.554,"Well, why did he need to have a... any more reason to believe?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3010.75,3025.162,"Absent any actual knowledge that this happened, it is just a presumption that it could have happened, and since the owner is the one that is protected, we have to look at how we are going to protect Sandra Houghton."
1998.98-184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.755,3034.887,"She turned out... there were drugs in her purse, were there not?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3034.887,3035.588,--That is correct.
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.549,3054.709,"But they were her drugs not his, weren't they?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3056.532,3060.475,"Always possible, yes."
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3060.475,3061.945,Is that... is that the case?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3065.027,3068.199,She actually disclaimed ownership of--
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3068.199,3069.409,She said they weren't mine.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3069.409,3072.831,"--Yes, of some of the drugs that were within her purse, but she did claim ownership of some."
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.831,3073.422,"Yes, but the jury didn't believe that."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3077.105,3077.976,"Yes, she did."

1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3087.122,3088.272,That is correct.
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.338,3098.86,--Did they search her purse?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3101.81,3102.521,That is correct.
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.521,3104.882,And... and she... her... was her purse searched too?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3104.882,3109.867,I'm not aware it if it was or whether she even had a purse.
1998.98-184,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.867,3117.461,"The record doesn't tell us because you would think if he was going to put them on... in the purse, he'd put them in the woman next to him rather than the one over by the door."
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3117.461,3118.933,That is correct.
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3118.933,3126.096,"What happened in respect... there was something in... there's some reference to her trying to give the impression it wasn't her purse, isn't there?"
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3126.928,3127.308,No.
1998.98-184,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3185.415,3186.978,Can I ask you one other detail?
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3193.549,3196.951,We are objecting to the search of the... of the purse.
1998.98-184,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3201.536,3207.83,But only from the point when they knew that it was hers and not Young's.
1998.98-184,2,20727,donna_d_domonkos,,3207.83,3209.01,That is correct.
