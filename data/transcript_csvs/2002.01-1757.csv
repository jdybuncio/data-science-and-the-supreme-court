2002.01-1757,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.665,"We'll hear argument next in No. 01-1757, Marion Reynolds Stogner v. California."
2002.01-1757,0,40085,roberto_najera,,61.252,64.888,Thank you.
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1614.353,1621.34,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.642,1651.237,"Before you go through the four categories, might I just ask this general question?"
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1662.838,1666.574,"No, Your Honor, it would not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause."
2002.01-1757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.574,1666.772,And why not?
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1666.772,1677.049,"Because what we're looking at with those four categories is what the law was in effect at the time the crime was committed, whether or not it was an innocent act that was later criminalized."
2002.01-1757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.259,1692.891,I'm sorry.
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1697.707,1698.052,No.
2002.01-1757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.097,1700.496,"Oh, it would be treated the same."
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1700.496,1700.921,Yes.
2002.01-1757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1700.921,1711.472,"And what about a general amnesty for, say, illegal aliens coming into the country and then Congress passes a statute saying we will forgive the crime and you cannot be prosecuted?"
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1713.152,1719.126,"With an amnesty, I don't... I believe it would be the same with the ex post facto."
2002.01-1757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1728.7,1731.422,"Well, why would those issues be different in that situation than in this situation?"
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1731.422,1738.143,"I believe that they actually would be very similar, but it would depend."
2002.01-1757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.355,1741.598,No.
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1743.026,1743.274,--An unconditional?
2002.01-1757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1743.274,1746.621,Just like a pardon but a legislative decision.
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1746.621,1754.332,"Then what you would look to would be due process there, which you also can look to with an ex post facto change."
2002.01-1757,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1754.332,1756.118,Then why can't we look to due process in this case?
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1756.118,1758.744,I don't think that you look to substantive due process.
2002.01-1757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1769.804,1772.414,But that would be the same for the pardon and the amnesty.
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1772.414,1774.883,"Yes, I believe it would be, Your Honor."
2002.01-1757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1774.883,1776.642,And another preliminary question.
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1787.257,1788.402,Yes.
2002.01-1757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1788.402,1793.927,Doesn't... it could be... it could be pickpocketing and... and the argument would be the same.
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1793.927,1796.224,Without violating the Ex Post Facto Clause--
2002.01-1757,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1796.224,1796.492,Yes.
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1796.492,1804.303,--yes. And the Ex Post Facto Clause has been interpreted in terms of the four Calder categories.
2002.01-1757,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1882.35,1884.755,May I ask you before you get to four?
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1933.658,1944.63,"I believe when you're talking about increasing the punishment, what... what the... the cases have looked at is the punishment that exists at the time of the crime."
2002.01-1757,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1953.645,1957.585,But... but that isn't exactly the term that at least that... that Calder used.
2002.01-1757,1,30608,janet_gaard,,1993.494,2005.539,"--The second Calder category, if we look back at the historical basis for that, comes from the creation of a new punishment that wasn't in effect at the time."
2002.01-1757,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2570.628,2582.756,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2591.513,2594.797,"Mr. Gornstein, may I interrupt you to ask the same question I did of your co-counsel?"
2002.01-1757,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2599.016,2603.517,"Insofar as we're talking about the Ex Post Facto Clause, correct, yes."
2002.01-1757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.517,2605.296,What other clause might apply other than--
2002.01-1757,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2605.296,2608.908,"Well, the... the legislature could not undo a... an executive pardon--"
2002.01-1757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.908,2609.804,--Why not?
2002.01-1757,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2609.804,2610.364,--under this Court's decisions.
2002.01-1757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.887,2623.322,What... what provision of the Constitution prevents the legislature from authorizing the... the prosecution of someone who has been pardoned?
2002.01-1757,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2623.322,2627.733,The provision of the Constitution that grants the President the power to pardon.
2002.01-1757,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2627.733,2629.696,The legislative amnesty.
2002.01-1757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2629.696,2632.138,And... and what's the difference with an amnesty too?
2002.01-1757,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2634.173,2637.452,Can I... let me... let me do the pardon first.
2002.01-1757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.452,2637.777,Sure.
2002.01-1757,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2637.777,2638.79,And then I'll move to the amnesty.
2002.01-1757,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2653.704,2654.369,Does the word final appear in the Pardon Clause?
2002.01-1757,2,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2655.807,2655.807,"It is not, but that's how the Court interpreted the Pardon Clause in, I think it's Ex parte Garland, but I'm not sure of the decision."
2002.01-1757,3,40085,roberto_najera,,3506.343,3507.641,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.01-1757,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3675.247,3676.753,"Thank you, Mr. Najera."
