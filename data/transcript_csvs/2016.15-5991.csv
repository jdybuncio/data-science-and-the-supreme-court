2016.15-5991,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.619,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15991, Shaw v. United States. Ms. Bell."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,10.619,27.125,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Clause (1) of the Federal Bank Fraud Statute premises culpability on intent to defraud a financial institution, and this case concerns what that element entails."
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,62.05,63.774,I'm sorry.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,100.005,110.515,"Your Honor, the statute turns on intent, and were the government to prove the defendant's intent to deprive of you of your possessory right, and that would be sufficient."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,123.53,130.425,"So if you're insured and the -- or at least the defendant believes he's insured, it isn't theft?"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,130.425,137.06,If the defendant believes that the bank is insured and therefore that another party will bear the loss?
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,137.06,146.025,"Even Kardashian's thief, if there is one, believes that all that jewelry is insured. Indeed over insured."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,148.045,152.08,"Well, so it would depend on the language of the statute."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,152.08,153.62,"No, it says defraud."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,185.67,190.03,It would depend on whether the statute in that case required the intent to defraud --
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,190.03,192.445,What the statute says is defraud.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,192.445,193.07,Defraud.
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,207.165,208.84,I'm not asking you to repeat it.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,236.06,236.62,Right.
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,236.9,239.31,"Now, my question is: There's the statute."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,247.025,247.825,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,306.19,327.46,"You get -- you get mired in some very abstract concepts of property rights. Yes, someone is insured, but here if they keep getting their property stolen, their insurance rates go up. Here, okay, it wasn't that if you -- correct, it wasn't the bank's own property, but it's somebody else's property that they use in making loans."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,361.395,362.53,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,396.0,419.93,"Well, is that making -- is that ignorance of the law being the defense because the law -- he thinks the bank -- the bank doesn't have any property interest at all, but in fact the bank has the property interest as either a bailee or bailor or -- I forget which one it is -- and the bank has the property interest because it actually uses the money in its own effect, but he's wrong about that legal question of property."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,422.935,425.29,"Your Honor, it wouldn't be ignorance of the law."
2016.15-5991,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.76,461.73,"You mentioned the sub 2. Do you recognize, do you concede that Shaw could have been charged and convicted under the obtaining property owned by or under the custody or control of a financial institution if the -- if the government had charged that instead of defrauding a financial institution, could Shaw have been found guilty?"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,461.73,462.86,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,489.0,495.975,"Well, design here, the intent here is to harm whoever has a lawful possessory interest."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,495.975,504.23,"Your Honor, the intent required under clause (1) -- and that's quite clear because it specifies the bank -- is to harm the bank in its property right."
2016.15-5991,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,504.23,505.605,But it has a possessory interest --
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,505.605,507.56,And -- and certainty if the --
2016.15-5991,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,507.56,509.67,And that possessory interest is harmed.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,512.755,521.62,"It -- it -- in fact it may be harmed, although in this case, of course this is an example where the banks never suffered any loss, and there was no dispute on that point."
2016.15-5991,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,523.74,527.375,But it was -- was it not a harm to the possessory interest?
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,527.375,528.26,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,537.26,557.065,"So, Ms. Bell, I guess -- I guess what Justice Kennedy is suggesting and maybe I'm confused about the same thing, it now seems to me that there's no difference between your view and the government's view. So, Mr. Yang, I'm putting you on notice that this is a question to you too, because both of you are saying, look, there needs to be an intent to deceive the bank."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,557.065,557.46,Correct.
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,557.46,571.425,"And there needs to be an intent to deprive the bank of some form of property interest, but with the recognition that property interests includes possessory interests, as well as more classic ownership interests."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,573.18,573.78,"Correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,573.78,579.25,"I'm going to think, and Mr. Yang you'll tell me, that Mr. Yang would agree with that too."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,581.84,582.44,"Correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,582.44,611.35,"Then it's just -- Mr. Yang would say, well, look, a bank has a possessory interest in assets that are part of its depositor's account, and so, you know, that's -- whether you target the depositor's account or you target something else, you're still manifesting the same intent to deprive the bank of a property including possessory interest."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,611.35,612.0,Right.
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,624.3,625.3,That seems right to me.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,640.355,640.62,Yes.
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,640.62,648.385,But it seems to me that the understanding of the law is now you are in perfect harmony.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,648.385,651.44,"It -- it -- it may be the case, but let me explain."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,666.435,675.765,"What it says in the instructions is, ""Intent to deceive, cheat, or deprive a financial institution of something of value."""
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,675.765,676.75,"Correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,677.12,678.255,So what's the problem?
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,678.255,684.81,"That would -- because it's worded in a disjunctive, in other words, or, it permits a conviction on the basis --"
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,684.81,688.44,"So the ""or"" goes between ""to deceive, cheat, or deprive."""
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,688.44,689.0,Correct.
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,689.46,695.6,"But what you have to cheat, deceive, or deprive them of, is something of value."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,695.6,696.55,"Correct, Your Honor --"
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,696.55,698.875,And a possessory interest is something of value.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,700.65,702.19,"Your Honor, two things."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,718.235,721.775,"In other words, you think it means ""deceive, cheat, or deprive""?"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,721.775,722.59,"Correct, your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,722.59,723.5,But not of anything.
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,727.74,727.96,I think it --
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,727.96,731.14,-- someone intends a financial institution of value.
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,732.04,732.19,But it --
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.19,732.38,Okay.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,734.67,735.43,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.01,740.45,"What page? Do you have it here, by chance, what page you made that particular argument?"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,740.45,741.12,"Sure, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,758.41,765.455,My colleague Justice Alito has written extensively on this issue of intent versus knowledge.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,765.455,766.11,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,766.11,766.83,All right.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,769.575,770.19,Yes.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,770.19,770.715,All right.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,774.08,774.84,Certainly.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,775.235,775.68,All right.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,787.52,787.85,Okay.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,788.08,790.125,So nothing of value has been taken.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,797.33,798.115,Yes.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,798.115,803.33,"And you can deprive someone of property without deceiving or cheating them. You can rob them, right?"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,803.33,804.03,Correct.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,804.03,805.0,All right.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,820.015,824.11,"Your Honor, the cheat, I think, is synonymous with the concept of --"
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,824.11,824.84,Of defrauding.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,824.84,827.19,"-- of -- of -- well, defrauding. Your Honor is correct."
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,827.19,829.33,You -- you defraud someone by deception.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,829.33,832.69,Deception in order to cause them to bear the property loss --
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,832.69,835.645,That's why you say it's two different elements.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,835.645,836.89,They're two -- no.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,846.98,850.41,"So far, I perfectly understand your point."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,850.41,850.72,Thank you.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,851.03,880.925,"That the defraud element has two prongs to it; deception, for the lack of -- deception is one prong and deprivation is the other. You're taking the money by -- or the possessory interest by deception. And you're saying that by using the disjunctive, the ""or,"" the jury could have convicted merely for deceiving the bank, but didn't find that they deceived ""and"" deprived the bank of a possessory interest, correct?"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,880.925,883.44,"That's exactly right, Your Honor. That's exactly right."
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,883.44,888.795,"Now, Justice Breyer has asked the operative question."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,888.795,889.56,Yes.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,889.56,907.255,"And -- and it's what confused me throughout, both in the discussions below and here. At first, I thought this case was only about reading your brief about whether the deprivation had to be of something the bank owned."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,907.255,908.12,Yes.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,908.12,912.19,As opposed to had a possessory interest in.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,923.085,941.83,"Your Honor, we don't see that as a different formulation, and let me explain why, cause I certainly understand the confusion. The -- the standard is that comes from this Court's fraud precedent, the mail and wire fraud precedent that everybody agrees is the operative body of law is the intent to wrong the bank in its property rights."
2016.15-5991,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,942.715,943.92,In its what?
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,943.92,946.185,In its property rights.
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,948.76,951.6,Which you -- which you now include can include possessory interests.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,951.6,951.95,Correctly.
2016.15-5991,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,967.06,967.16,No.
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,968.28,968.34,No.
2016.15-5991,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,968.34,972.11,That's not what it means. And maybe something more is required.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,980.915,982.71,"Well, let me explain how I mean it."
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1021.26,1022.705,Most of them don't care.
2016.15-5991,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1022.705,1035.84,"You want us to write an opinion -- you want us to write an opinion and say it's perfectly lawful under this statute, section (1), to knowingly deprive someone of a possessory interest by deception?"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1035.84,1037.38,"Well, Your Honor, I think --"
2016.15-5991,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.38,1038.805,You want us to write that?
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1038.805,1040.2,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1047.39,1052.82,Intend to deprive someone by deception of a possessory interest is proper.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1056.75,1063.585,The intent to deceive the bank and deprive the bank of a possessory interest would suffice.
2016.15-5991,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1066.84,1070.53,Your point is you have to have the intent to the hurt the -- the bank --
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1070.53,1072.23,"Exactly, Your -- exactly, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1072.23,1072.915,-- not the customer.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1072.915,1074.11,That is exactly right.
2016.15-5991,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1074.11,1085.21,"So if you -- if the customer will end up bearing the loss, then you say one doesn't apply. What does one cover, in your view, other than check hiding?"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1085.21,1085.98,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1099.01,1111.635,"By watching the movies, most -- I'd be afraid, in this case, that we're going to write something of five pages that nobody's going to understand, with the simple thing, Jessie James goes up to the bank, says, your money or your life."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1161.965,1162.86,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1173.19,1199.745,"Well, my question is, why hasn't Jessie James or his brother committed a crime -- the brother, probably, because he's lied and says Jessie James is on the way, and whether the money behind the desk was put there, to everyone's knowledge, by the depositors, or whether the money happens to have been there for 50 years by the bank -- put in by the bank's founder, makes no difference to this statute."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1203.83,1266.81,"So that case where there's some ambiguity, and this gets back to Your Honor's question, Justice Ginsburg, that case would be best charged under clause (2), which covers schemes that intend to victimize either the customer or the bank provided the requisite means of a false statement. So whenever there's any ambiguity in terms of what as a practical matter does this cover, clause (2) will cover the customer scheme in Loughrin -- I'm sorry, the altered-check scheme in Loughrin, and it will cover the deposit scheme here. It will cover Your Honor's hypothetical, provided the intent's also to deceive and it's not just plain, let's say, bank larceny which is covered under another statute and focuses on the effect of the conduct. And clause (1) then is reserved for other cases like check kiting, which was a major, major impetus for this statute's enactment, and Congress knew at the time, based on this Court's 1982 decision in Williams that check kiting was not going to be covered under clause (2)"
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1279.275,1280.36,All right.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1299.24,1299.985,Yes.
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1299.985,1330.715,"-- and we say you don't have to prove the bank is going to lose anything of value, that it's going to be reimbursed by insurance or that ultimately the customer is going to receive -- bear the loss, so long as you have defrauded the bank, some deception to the bank, and deprived it of some possessory interest, whether it bears the loss or not, if that's how we rule, do you lose this case?"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1330.715,1335.33,"No, Your Honor, because it comes down to the requisite intent and purpose."
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1335.33,1337.205,We're disagreeing with you.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1340.1,1341.35,"Yes, I understand."
2016.15-5991,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1341.49,1341.95,All right.
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1342.44,1347.655,"Ms. Bell, I think your answer is, no, Your Honor, because the instructions don't reflect your understanding of the law."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1347.655,1355.79,We certainly win on that basis. So reversal is required because the intent to defraud means more than just --
2016.15-5991,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1355.79,1356.76,I'm not saying it does.
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1363.26,1363.42,Right.
2016.15-5991,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1381.51,1401.375,"But if the Court disagrees with you about that, if the Court thinks that someone doesn't require that you intend to cause the bank financial harm, only that you intend to deprive the bank of something of value, if that's -- by deception --"
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1401.375,1402.375,Yes.
2016.15-5991,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1402.375,1404.77,-- should the Ninth Circuit be affirmed?
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1404.77,1405.32,"No, but --"
2016.15-5991,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1405.32,1410.54,Should we reject your theory that you have to intend to cause the bank a financial loss?
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1410.54,1429.31,"No, Your Honor, and let me be clear because I understand that it is confusing with the different theories, but our -- those two formulations that Your Honor articulated are one in the same in our view. In other words, the intent to wrong a bank in its property rights is the second component of defraud, but what does that mean in practice? That's not nonsensical for a jury."
2016.15-5991,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1433.65,1434.81,That's not what it means.
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1434.81,1449.935,"You have a lot of cases, and I think the model penal code started it, where you have the word ""intent"" in a statute normally, not always, but normally it covers both purpose and knowledge."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1468.91,1469.425,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1469.425,1473.95,"So intent includes, unless there's some contrary which you could argue, to the both."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1508.125,1508.57,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1508.57,1518.22,"It's not saying intends to cheat or deceive somebody, and then a separate thing, or deprive the financial institution of value."
2016.15-5991,0,62748,koren_l_bell,,1537.1,1560.33,"Yes, Your Honor, and I'll answer that, and then if I may reserve the remainder of my time. That -- the problem with that instruction is that it allows for a conviction on the basis of a scheme to deceive the bank alone. Now even if Your Honor disagrees with me, as it seems that you might, that problem is compounded by the intent to defraud instruction, which plainly it does not include the something of value reference."
2016.15-5991,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.74,1635.945,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1635.945,1647.98,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The intent required in this bank fraud scheme -- case is an intent to deceive the bank for the purpose of depriving it of something of value."
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1647.98,1665.635,"Well, all right. Sorry to stop you so early on, but I did not understand that to be the argument in your brief. I'm looking at the heading C on page 36. Section 1344(1) requires proof of an intent to deceive a bank, not to cause it monetary loss."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1689.6,1696.78,"I'm sorry that the -- the heading was a little incomplete, but I think the rest of our brief, when you take it in context --"
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1696.78,1697.39,What's missing?
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1697.39,1700.36,"Well, not just the heading, but analysis in that part C as well."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1704.51,1705.2,What we were trying to --
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1705.2,1714.46,"If you really mean an intent to deceive is not enough, that you need something about to deprive the bank of its property interest."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1714.46,1714.76,Yes.
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1729.645,1733.945,What does the -- do they have to have the intent to deprive the bank of property?
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1733.945,1739.885,"Well, when you're designing -- when you're -- there's only one schemer here, right, so the scheme is his scheme."
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1743.9,1744.0,Okay.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1747.92,1748.71,"No, no, no, of course --"
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1748.71,1751.84,"Well, not of course, since that's what you said."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1751.84,1753.88,My apologies.
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1761.68,1761.77,Okay.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1761.77,1768.49,"-- between intent to harm from the intent to deceive, and we used some words that may have lead to confusion."
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1769.26,1786.695,"Well, then if that's the case, then it all comes down to the instruction, deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of something of value. Because you -- as I understand your position as clarified, you do have to have the intent to deprive a financial institution of something of value."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1786.695,1787.115,Right.
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1787.115,1787.615,Okay.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1797.695,1804.88,"I think there's actually a deeper disagreement here, and I'm happy to talk about the jury instructions, and the jury instructions, of course, have to be read as a whole."
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1846.265,1864.05,"Yes, so it seems to me, Mr. Yang, that the real disagreement that you have is that Ms. Bell wants to equate and intends to deprive a bank of a property interest with an intent to have a bank suffer a pecuniary loss in the end."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1881.465,1881.925,Okay.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1881.925,1896.52,Go back to the Chief Justice's question about how these instructions reflect that there needs to be an intent to deprive the bank of a posessory interest in property.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1896.52,1901.65,"I will go to those instructions, and I'm kind of happy to discuss them, but I don't think that's the end of the matter."
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1909.1,1910.435,I thought I was giving you them.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1910.435,1910.96,"No, no."
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1912.8,1914.68,But could we talk about the instruction? I know --
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1914.68,1914.85,Yeah.
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1915.64,1917.78,-- that's the -- that's the last part of your argument.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1919.58,1920.43,Not at all.
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.57,1933.71,"Well, we know there's a big picture in the world, but we want to know about the instructions first."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1933.71,1934.22,The instructions --
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1934.22,1937.695,"The enduring consequence to Mr. Shaw is a little bit different, so --"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1937.695,1938.835,Undoubtedly.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1950.24,1952.03,"Say, Mr. Yang, the instructions."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1952.03,1958.82,So on the instructions -- this is at pages 17 through 19 of the joint appendix.
2016.15-5991,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2025.375,2029.47,Don't forget instruction 21.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2030.27,2031.17,Well --
2016.15-5991,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2031.17,2034.39,An intent to defraud is an intent to deceive or cheat.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2034.39,2034.745,Right.
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.59,2090.41,"Well, but you've kind of -- instruction, you do read it in context, but if I read instruction 18 in the context of 21, it kind of highlights that you have deceive or cheat separate from the deprivation of something of value. So linguistically, you have to say that what they meant in the instructions was somebody who intends to deceive a financial institution of something of value."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2092.28,2097.78,"It's not great, but it's not -- but it's not unacceptable here because --"
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.78,2100.95,"It's okay once you put in the word ""material"" --"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2100.95,2101.35,I think --
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.35,2103.51,-- which is what you have in instruction 17.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2103.51,2104.44,I think that's --
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2104.44,2112.115,It says you have to execute a scheme or defraud a financial -- to defraud a financial institution as to a material fact.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2114.16,2114.28,"No, no."
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2114.81,2137.03,"The deceive was separate. You would have to deceive the financial institution as to a material fact, which is defined in instruction 19 as one that has a natural tendency to influence a financial institution to part with money or property. So what you took away in instruction 21, you gave back in instruction 19."
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2138.43,2144.49,"And so in 18, sales deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of something of value."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2149.35,2151.44,I don't think that's correct.
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2187.0,2196.51,"Not if they -- not if they -- not if they read instruction 21, which talks -- has nothing to do with -- it just says intent to deceive or cheat, nothing of something of value."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2208.87,2209.16,But I think --
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2209.16,2212.22,-- Because it makes no sense to say deceive of something of value.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2212.22,2221.52,"It doesn't even parse under Petitioner's reading because I think Petitioner at least thinks that you have to deceive, cheat or deprive the financial institution -- like, deceive the financial institution."
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2221.52,2221.99,They're kind of right.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2249.69,2251.62,"No, I think actually you could read --"
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2251.62,2258.945,"It's to deceive a bank alone, cheat a bank alone, or deprive a bank of something of value."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2264.744,2270.485,"I don't see how you can read -- you might say just ""deceive"" in the abstract."
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2270.485,2272.51,"No, it's got to be that you're deceiving somebody."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2272.51,2281.63,"Well, but if you're deceiving the bank, if a financial institution, which follows, connects to deceive, then so does ""of something of value."""
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2281.63,2283.82,"Well, I don't think so because that would make no sense."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2290.935,2296.63,I understand that it's a slightly -- there is a slight grammatical issue with this language.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2296.63,2298.2,"Well, I think it's more than grammatical."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2300.19,2305.57,"I think when you read it in context, right, you have to take this -- this is the definition of scheme to defraud."
2016.15-5991,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2342.22,2374.72,Why has -- why has the government forgotten when it's at trial that simplifying things for juries is always the best thing? Do you really think that any juror reading this would parse it with the care that you are? Why can't you just say something like a scheme to defraud a bank is a scheme to -- what was the three words? -- to deceive or cheat the money and to -- to cheat the bank of some interest in money or property?
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2374.72,2379.225,I completely agree that simplicity is the -- is preferable.
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2419.66,2429.95,"Well, what is the -- what do we cite for that? Is there something in our cases that say that the instructions had to be read in the context of what the jury heard or something like that?"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2429.95,2431.02,I think the --
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2431.02,2434.57,"I mean, we'd say close enough for government work."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2434.57,2454.41,"I don't think we've quite said that, but I -- it's in pages 44 or 45 of our brief, which is the general proposition that you just have to -- that bank fraud -- excuse me -- that -- jury -- this is 46 -- jury instructions must be viewed in the context of the overall charge."
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2464.02,2466.14,It's just not the instruction.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2481.41,2484.75,"Again, I think this may be a problem with some brevity."
2016.15-5991,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2517.19,2534.595,"Just tell us: Why didn't -- why didn't the government charge under (2), which your colleague has agreed fits this case, that if he had been charged under (2) and convicted, that would be fine?"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2534.595,2538.575,"Because under (2), you need to actually prove a misrepresentation."
2016.15-5991,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.575,2540.37,Because under (2) you have to prove --
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2540.37,2544.33,You have to prove a false statement or false misrepresentation.
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.36,2677.19,So what's the right words?
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2677.19,2678.74,The right words?
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.74,2681.62,"For the -- I mean, there -- there are many situations."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2701.965,2703.49,"No, no."
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2704.9,2705.33,"Yeah, yeah."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2707.495,2715.99,"So in bank fraud, the intent required -- and remember, there's more than just intent. As a fact we do have to prove there was a property interest to the bank."
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2717.29,2721.225,"There was, but it was a property interest in the bank."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2728.28,2734.27,So the only intent required is the intent to deceive the financial institution in order to obtain something of value.
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2735.14,2742.325,"In order to obtain something of value, so that it could be of value and belong only to the customer?"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2742.325,2745.01,That -- that complicates things I think in the --
2016.15-5991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2745.01,2745.16,Yes.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2747.56,2749.845,There's no more required for intent.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2750.72,2759.29,"I quoted you it was, that it's an -- it's an intent to deprive the bank of a property, including a possessory interest."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2759.29,2760.44,No.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2769.17,2769.51,Yes.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2774.26,2775.315,Right.
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2802.11,2807.815,"What does he have to know about? Does he have to know that the bank is involved? I mean, what does he have to know about the bank?"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2807.815,2810.12,He has to know that he --
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2810.12,2814.85,"That the bank is likely involved? I mean, this is pretty easy because he sent a check, but --"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2814.85,2819.66,"Well, no, I think what's required is -- and let me take a step back."
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2839.81,2839.9,Okay.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2844.32,2847.215,It didn't have to know its status as a bank under the statute.
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2887.95,2891.19,It has to know that a financial institution is involved?
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2891.19,2892.745,It doesn't have to --
2016.15-5991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2892.745,2893.48,"I mean, that's Section 1."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2893.48,2900.42,It doesn't have -- it has to -- it doesn't have to have any knowledge about whether the entity that it's depriving of property qualifies as a financial institution.
2016.15-5991,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2942.34,2952.745,"And can you clarify for us, what is in the overlap area? What is covered only by (1) and what is covered only by (2)?"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2952.745,2961.19,"They are, of course, cover almost -- they are almost coterminous, but there are things that are outside of (1), and there are things that are outside of (2)"
2016.15-5991,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2983.34,2984.42,(2) covers what?
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2984.42,2992.28,(2) -- clause (2) is broader than (1) because it covers schemes to deceive the custodian of bank property.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3068.91,3073.285,"Mr. Yang, you referred to us, money in a security deposit."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3075.195,3075.51,Yes.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3075.51,3086.955,"-- if -- if somebody went in and said, I'd like to see the security deposit boxes, and -- and made a false statement to the bank about his entitlement to see the security deposit boxes and took the money out?"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3086.955,3087.54,Yes.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3087.54,3094.315,"Doesn't -- you know, the bank still has a possessory interest in that, even though it doesn't use that money in the same way; is that correct?"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3094.315,3095.06,Correct.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3095.06,3097.215,Let me give you another example.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3116.26,3116.36,Uh-huh.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3116.36,3118.235,-- and that's a misrepresentation.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3118.235,3118.6,Uh-huh.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3118.6,3121.655,But I give him the computer.
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3121.655,3122.28,Uh-huh.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3122.28,3131.04,"Do I -- have I had a possessory interest in that computer just because somebody said, why don't you take a look, you know -- you know -- keep -- keep your eye on this?"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3131.04,3134.6,Gratuitous bailee is what they would be.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3142.64,3142.95,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3143.61,3145.01,But -- but --
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3145.01,3161.87,"What you're essentially saying is that anything I can think of, any hypothetical I can think of which involves my hanging on to something for somebody else, that I have a possessory interest in that sufficient to satisfy this scheme."
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3161.87,3161.98,Yeah.
2016.15-5991,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3185.94,3195.4,"I mean, that suggests to me that as long as the person knows that the money is being -- is in the bank somehow, it just shouldn't matter, because anything counts as a possessory interest, right?"
2016.15-5991,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,3195.4,3197.34,It shouldn't -- it shouldn't matter at all.
2016.15-5991,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3266.735,3272.379,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Bell, you have three minutes remaining."
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3272.379,3285.495,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. To get back to Justice Breyer's question about where in the record was this disputed, that -- that is at pages 646 to 647."
2016.15-5991,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3301.78,3304.55,"Counselor, assume I agree with you --"
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3304.55,3305.2,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3305.2,3315.64,"-- that there were parts of your argument, both below and here in your brief, that suggested the instructional error."
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3321.875,3322.47,Yes.
2016.15-5991,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3322.47,3329.2,It took a lot of teasing out. Does -- how does that affect what we do.
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3329.2,3329.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3329.92,3335.165,"That -- that you weren't clear in the instruction, don't you forfeit that argument?"
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3335.165,3336.26,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3340.06,3342.48,I -- I know what your two claims are.
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3342.48,3342.88,Okay.
2016.15-5991,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3342.88,3344.97,The question is if I disagree --
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3344.97,3345.575,Yes.
2016.15-5991,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3345.575,3356.145,"-- with your basic premise that you need to prove pecuniary loss to the bank -- I know you want to win that, but please accept my hypothetical."
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3381.685,3387.615,"It's -- it's still an error, Your Honor, because it permitted a conviction on the basis of the mere intent to deceive the bank."
2016.15-5991,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3392.89,3407.71,"How about if I find that what you -- that you didn't articulate your argument clearly enough to the court below, or to us? Where does that put you? Have you forfeited? Do you waive? Have you done something?"
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3407.71,3408.56,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-5991,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3493.775,3494.58,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-5991,2,62748,koren_l_bell,,3494.58,3495.05,Thank you.
2016.15-5991,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3495.05,0.0,Case is submitted.
