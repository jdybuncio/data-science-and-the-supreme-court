1990.89-1895,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.779,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1895, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Solimino."
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,54.307,56.828,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1895,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,261.071,274.07,"Mr. Siegel, do you take the position that Congress has to speak expressly to the issue of preclusion in order to overcome any common law presumption about it?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,274.07,280.984,"It is our position that Congress must in some specific manner, yes, state that preclusion should not apply."
1990.89-1895,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.086,290.601,"Have our cases ever said that, or have we just found for a variety of reasons that there may not be preclusion or there is?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,290.601,295.794,--You are correct that the rule was done by the Court depending on each specific statute.
1990.89-1895,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.704,314.216,"But you don't think there is any rule that specific in this area, do you?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,314.216,315.568,--There is--
1990.89-1895,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.568,322.21,You would have us apply the same kind of presumption we did in Aramco?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,322.21,323.382,--Yes.
1990.89-1895,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.358,336.262,Do we owe any deference to the EEOC on this point?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,336.262,344.037,I believe under the ADEA deference should not be accorded to the EEOC because of the specific language of the ADEA.
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.716,393.657,"Excuse me, before you go on--"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,393.657,394.228,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.228,399.071,--You... it's your position that the EEOC has no authority to make findings in this area?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,399.071,403.175,"The statute provides no finding, no basis for the EEOC to make findings."
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,403.175,436.577,"And yet you say one of the indications that we should, we should find a requirement to exceed to the state ruling here, one of the indications is that there was not in this case, as there was in the Title VII case, a specific provision requiring the EEOC in making its findings to give substantial weight to state determinations?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,437.466,437.907,Yes.
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.907,439.289,You rely on the absence of that here.
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,439.289,443.43,"I believe the absence of it, as the Eighth Circuit said in Stillians, is very significant--"
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.43,451.507,"But you now tell us that there is no reason for such a provision to exist here, because on your view the EEOC has no authority to make findings anyway."
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,453.668,473.159,"--I may not be following your question, but I believe that the ADEA's lack of any basis for limiting or providing a maximum states no congressional intent to limit the state's agency's effect, just as there was no limit to the effect in the 1983 claim."
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,473.159,473.68,Wait.
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,487.419,487.94,Yes.
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,487.94,494.724,Now under Title VII the EEOC must make factual findings.
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,494.724,495.646,That's correct.
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.646,500.339,"But here it's not supposed to make findings, factual findings, according to you."
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,500.339,501.12,That also is correct.
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.018,506.532,"If it's not supposed to make factual findings, why would you expect to see the same kind of provision you had in Title VII?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,506.532,507.892,The Congress--
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.892,508.894,You would not expect to find it.
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,508.894,516.967,"--I would certainly not expect to find it, nor is there any other language in the ADEA which would limit application of administrative preclusion."
1990.89-1895,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.595,646.472,"Mr. Siegel, what case is it of ours that you rely on for the proposition that there is a presumption in favor of preclusion for an unreviewed administrative finding?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,646.472,652.248,--The Utah Mining and Elliott speak about a rule of preclusion that has been applied.
1990.89-1895,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.248,656.921,"Well, but Elliott doesn't say anything about a presumption in favor."
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,672.341,681.587,"I may have overstated it, but the Court in Utah Mining and in Elliott has gone forward in the absence of congressional language to the contrary to apply a rule of preclusion."
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.578,896.257,"Mr. Siegel, under this statute what weight is to be given to any EEOC proceedings that have occurred on the same, on the same case?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,896.257,904.302,"--Since the statute does not even provide for EEOC proceedings, I believe that no preclusive effect should be given to an EEOC proceeding."
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.302,906.833,Isn't there a provision that says that?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,909.976,917.33,"Well, 7(d)(2) refers to the powers of the agency and speaks about persuasion, conciliation, and mediation."
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.554,938.154,"Well, why would Congress set up a system in which the court, the court would review anything done by the EEOC de novo, but would not review anything done by the states?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,938.154,939.634,The back--
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.634,940.455,That would seem very strange.
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,940.455,940.976,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,997.771,1003.705,"In practice the EEOC has, despite the lack of any authority, been conducting proceedings in these?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1003.705,1017.777,"--The EEOC has conducted proceedings in the nature of factfinding as they might under Title VII, and they have even engrafted onto it the substantial weight clause after the jurisdiction was given to the EEOC in 1978 in the reorganization."
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.777,1019.958,And what have the courts done with those proceedings?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1020.458,1025.31,"The EEOC's proceedings have never been held to bar any Federal action, to my knowledge."
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1029.615,1031.875,And you say that's not surprising because they shouldn't have been conducted anyway?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1033.766,1034.686,"Yes, sir, that's our position."
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.686,1037.178,--why you would treat the Federal ones different from the state ones?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1037.178,1037.679,Yes.
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1296.516,1306.885,"You say the only purpose you, the only reason you can't go ahead immediately is on the chance that there will be a mediation that's successful?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1312.458,1315.661,The 60-day period?
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.661,1316.152,Right.
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1316.152,1318.964,"The 60-day period, as I interpret it, is exactly that."
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1347.501,1353.786,What would happen if you didn't file suit immediately after the 60 days?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1367.033,1370.766,Under 14(b) you would absolutely have the right to do that.
1990.89-1895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.658,1377.17,"It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, does it?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1377.17,1396.422,"Well, it does in the fact that you have utilized the state proceedings for investigation, you have considered the possibility of conciliation, you have avoided a multiplicity of lawsuits because the state proceeding was cut off at some point before a judgment in that sense, and no probable cause judgment, and you then moved forward."
1990.89-1895,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.916,1488.462,"Well, does the state tribunal pass on the claim under the Federal statute, or just on the similar claim under the state statute?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1488.462,1491.915,The state does not rule upon the ADEA action.
1990.89-1895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1512.329,1514.619,Can an ADEA action be brought in a state court?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1514.619,1515.46,Yes.
1990.89-1895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.254,1526.667,"Would it be, do you think, permissible for the state court to give preclusive findings to the state administrative agency?"
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1526.667,1536.444,"We believe that it would be just as appropriate for the state court to do so as it would be for the Federal court, because it would regardless be under the ADEA."
1990.89-1895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1536.444,1538.065,I am sure that would be your position.
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1538.065,1544.779,If there are no further questions.
1990.89-1895,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.779,1547.541,Do you wish to reserve the remainder of your time?
1990.89-1895,0,38297,paul_j_siegel,,1547.541,1548.553,"Yes, I do."
1990.89-1895,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.553,1549.594,Very well.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1552.158,1560.052,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.407,1650.57,I think his explanation for that is the that the only thing that Congress expects you to be waiting for is mediation.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1665.29,1688.338,"--The point that the petitioner made in his brief was that the only kind of cases in which there would be a quick termination would be those in which the state agency abandoned the processing for some reason or the grievant just looking around decided that his case is not worth pursuing in this forum and he took some kind of voluntary dismissal, assuming the state procedures allowed that."
1990.89-1895,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.4,1720.197,"May I ask you on that point also; to what extent is it realistic to assume there would be hearings, other than, you know, just a brief negotiation, within the 60-day period?"
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1725.29,1726.9,"--No, there wouldn't be a hearing, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1895,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.681,1747.533,--But you don't contend there's a likelihood that there would be actual factual determinations made within the 60-day period?
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1747.533,1748.264,Yes.
1990.89-1895,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.264,1748.795,Oh.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1748.795,1749.506,"Yes, I do."
1990.89-1895,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.492,1774.551,And make findings of fact explaining it.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1775.222,1776.153,"Well, make a finding that this is no case."
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.346,1829.339,"--Excuse me, what's the purpose of this EEOC filing?"
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1833.449,1851.812,"--It would be, in my opinion, superfluous, because if the state finding is preclusive, walking across the street to the Federal building and filing with the EEOC would serve no purpose, because the only purpose in having the EEOC charge filing is to get the visa, if you will, to go to Federal court."
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.539,1864.511,--What do you assert the purpose of the EEOC filing is?
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1864.511,1873.146,My... the purpose that I assert is it gives the EEOC concurrent screening responsibility in the 60 days.
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.18,1879.101,Do you agree with that?
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1881.812,1882.192,"--Yes, sir, I do."
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.192,1882.633,--under this law?
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1882.633,1883.074,"Yes, I do."
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.074,1884.344,"They've been doing it, though?"
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1884.344,1894.989,"I understand the practice has been in certain cases to give the, if the case warrants it there may be an informal type of proceeding."
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.786,1905.347,Um hum.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1905.347,1915.555,"My point is that is a worthwhile trip to the EEOC, but the EEOC at the end of that trip doesn't issue factfindings."
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.588,1989.373,"Well, yeah, I mean, bad is bad, but worse is worse."
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2015.862,2016.479,Because--
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.479,2019.47,"And I lost fair and square, but I want to start with a fresh new slate."
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2020.973,2030.059,"--My point, Justice Scalia, is that the statute contemplates, I mean, this, your point is valid, but the statute contemplates instant judicial supersedure."
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.694,2040.515,That gives them enough.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2057.635,2058.166,Okay.
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.777,2106.709,That's a good response.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2106.709,2107.839,"Thank you, sir."
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.205,2208.405,"Excuse me, before you go on."
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2217.731,2218.162,--He gets almost two bites.
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.004,2223.264,He doesn't want to practice the presentation.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2240.526,2241.367,"Well, I'm not--"
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.367,2246.9,But what your position permits is that he tries to win in the state court.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2257.819,2260.19,"--Well, I understand your point."
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.117,2506.502,All this would only happen in that category of cases where the state acts within the 60 days.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2506.502,2512.906,"Or longer if the grievant, feeling comfortable but not having a good idea, goes--"
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.906,2515.438,But after the 60 days it's entirely within his control.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2519.041,2520.08,--After 60.
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.08,2520.812,Right.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2520.812,2521.241,Yes.
1990.89-1895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.241,2522.842,On the sixtieth day he can cut out.
1990.89-1895,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,2527.636,2537.621,"If the state agency tells him on day 62, we think we can work out something with you, hold your lawyer's Federal court complaint in abeyance, don't rush down to that courthouse."
1990.89-1895,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.534,2604.586,"--Thank you, Mr. Flamm."
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2606.637,2617.275,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1895,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.917,2655.48,"There has to be a background rule, Ms. Wax, doesn't there?"
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2669.138,2674.592,"Your Honor, we don't deny that there's some kind of background rule, whether we call it a presumption or not."
1990.89-1895,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2682.388,2682.736,All right.
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2682.736,2684.759,--that a court shall not be bound.
1990.89-1895,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.759,2699.057,"But you acknowledge that if the statute gives no indication either way, but it seems entirely neutral about it, the normal rule would be that we accept the findings of the agency?"
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2699.057,2701.359,We would generally go along with that.
1990.89-1895,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.024,2830.844,Excuse me.
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2839.059,2840.461,"--Right, that could happen."
1990.89-1895,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.461,2842.28,And he comes into Federal court for more relief?
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2842.28,2843.401,Absolutely.
1990.89-1895,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.363,2845.502,So it wouldn't be pointless.
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,2845.502,2860.673,"--Well, we're not saying that every case in which there is a termination before 60 days either in favor of the complainant or against the complainant would make a subsequent civil action pointless."
1990.89-1895,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3004.356,3011.892,"Ms. Wax, what authority does the EEOC have to make findings or to act?"
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3011.892,3032.626,"The age act does not explicitly provide authority for the EEOC to make findings in so many words, and it differs from Title VII in that Title VII, the sections of Title VII that govern the EEOC's role do speak of a probable cause determination or no probable cause determination."
1990.89-1895,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3078.655,3085.981,"But its, its findings are not binding on a subsequent Federal court?"
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3085.981,3090.382,"This Court has never so held, but the lower courts... under the age act."
1990.89-1895,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.634,3156.386,"Ms. Wax, can I ask you a question?"
1990.89-1895,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3164.712,3166.683,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1895,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3205.989,3207.759,"Thank you, Ms. Wax."
1990.89-1895,3,38297,paul_j_siegel,,3212.683,3220.167,"I believe that our argument covered the points raised, but there was one question with respect to, as it was termed, the background rule."
