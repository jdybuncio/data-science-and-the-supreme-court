1974.73-1966,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.974,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1966 and 1971, Aberdeen and Rockfish Railroad against the Students and United States against Students."
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,58.371,61.853,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,104.572,109.232,"Mr. Horsky, are you going to cover the jurisdiction of this Court as well as of the District Court?"
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,109.232,115.521,I had hoped that I could rely on our briefs for that but I'll be glad to comment on it if you like.
1974.73-1966,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,372.902,373.933,The order of the court?
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,373.933,375.307,The order of the court below.
1974.73-1966,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,375.307,376.5,You said you are on the Commission.
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,376.5,378.598,"I'm sorry, the order of the court below."
1974.73-1966,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,378.598,379.969,It's phrased in terms in setting aside (Voice Overlap).
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,379.969,382.576,Setting aside rather than enjoining.
1974.73-1966,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.145,415.109,Did I misunderstand you did you say you didn't think the arguments were meritorious?
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,415.109,417.546,I thought they were not meritorious.
1974.73-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.929,430.39,Your position is basically the revisers didn't intend any change and then I take --
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,430.39,432.51,"Well, quickly."
1974.73-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,579.798,585.923,What if one wanted to challenge the Commission's determination that the railroads in fact needed more revenue?
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,585.923,591.11,That would be open if the Commission had relied on it in its determination.
1974.73-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.733,631.897,"So, that wouldn't be an occasion for reviewing a general rate?"
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,631.897,632.894,I should think no.
1974.73-1966,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.671,817.286,"But of course the Arrow depended on a particular provision of statutory law, didn't it?"
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,820.97,829.14,"Well, I think that's a distinction really that's -- I don't think that's quite true Your Honor."
1974.73-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.262,889.337,How long do you say was the decision in some 40 years ago by --
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,889.337,890.445,1935 has been followed --
1974.73-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,890.445,892.359,Judge Chesnut (Voice Overlap)?
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,892.359,893.47,-- followed consistently.
1974.73-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.049,899.771,"(Voice Overlap) going to be my question, to follow consistently with no dissents from it?"
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,899.771,900.65,That's right.
1974.73-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.546,947.542,To all summary actions of the Court?
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,947.542,948.714,All summary actions.
1974.73-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.714,951.179,And this is -- are all three in the 1969 terms?
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,951.179,953.687,All three of the 1969 term.
1974.73-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.649,959.03,"Electronic was opposed, is that affirmance?"
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,959.03,959.858,That was an affirmance.
1974.73-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.858,960.568,Simply affirmance?
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,960.568,963.154,"Yes, some unanimous affirmance."
1974.73-1966,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.154,965.509,Yes.
1974.73-1966,0,19194,charles_a_horsky,,965.509,978.034,Let me talk about the Electronic Industries case because I think you don't need to reach really the Algoma rule in this case because I think the Electronic Industries case applies here.
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1354.3,1357.538,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.989,1502.362,You said at page 13 you said of the Brown of --
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1502.362,1509.314,13 of the appendix.
1974.73-1966,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1524.683,1527.355,"Unless, to look at the bottom numbers."
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1527.355,1530.919,Yes.
1974.73-1966,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1530.919,1532.726,"On page 13, at footnote."
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1534.82,1547.177,The footnote describes in that and defines what is meant by recyclables and then lists for a number and by description of various classifications of commodities.
1974.73-1966,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.485,1584.351,I see these commodities.
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1592.33,1593.236,"No, they're noils."
1974.73-1966,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1593.236,1594.06,Noils?
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1594.06,1595.006,They are noils.
1974.73-1966,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1595.006,1596.009,And the rovings?
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1596.009,1597.841,The rovings are basically --
1974.73-1966,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.841,1599.762,And the collets?
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1599.762,1605.658,Collets that's a glass scrap and noils are glass are basically fibers.
1974.73-1966,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1605.658,1607.827,These are (Inaudible) which I have never heard in my life.
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1607.827,1608.148,Yes.
1974.73-1966,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1952.177,1954.971,"I'm sorry, what page again?"
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1954.971,1958.909,Page -- at the bottom of page 10 to 11 Mr. Justice Brennan.
1974.73-1966,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1958.909,1960.445,Thank you.
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,1960.445,1965.287,"The Commission said, and I'll read right up to the beginning of that quotation."
1974.73-1966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2032.063,2040.571,(Voice Overlap) you lost me at least as to what you were reading from when you added the omitted parts on page 10.
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,2040.571,2042.166,"I'm reading from – Yes, sir."
1974.73-1966,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2443.21,2451.409,The assumption is that the existing rate structure is satisfactory and the only question is whether you want -- need to increase it across the board?
1974.73-1966,1,38517,randolph,,2451.409,2453.895,"In the general revenue proceeding, that's correct."
1974.73-1966,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2626.911,2630.34,Thank you Mr. Randolph.
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,2632.218,2636.426,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1966,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2803.077,2809.543,If the case identical to this had been here in 1947 would you say we had no jurisdiction over it?
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,2809.543,2813.129,I was just about to answer Your Honor's question.
1974.73-1966,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.52,2990.156,"Well, you say a statute that's been dead for 27 years, are you arguing then that the revisers in 1948 intended to change?"
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,2990.156,2996.14,"Well, I'm arguing certainly that they took out the language on which the appellants relied for jurisdiction in this case."
1974.73-1966,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2996.14,3000.772,"Well, but then you argue that the revisers did intend to change?"
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3000.772,3015.253,"Well, I'm arguing Your Honor that jurisdiction in this Court it seems to me is a matter that's governed by statutes and it's governed by currently existing statutes and the rule for many years has been one of strict construction of jurisdictional statutes."
1974.73-1966,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3049.002,3067.552,"Well, it's one thing I think for this Court to say something like that but I think quite another to say that Congress when it adopted a revision of the entire judicial code and to one section was put on somewhat different form intended the substantive change."
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3067.552,3083.755,"Well, the case on this that cited to us Your Honor is the Ryder case which goes back to 1884 and the proposition which -- for which Ryder has cited is that in this kind of revision that Congress has not intended to make changes."
1974.73-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3106.161,3120.222,What is the efficiency in this order of the three-judge court “vacated” the orders of the Commission “ordered” the Commission to conduct “further proceedings?”
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3124.971,3128.833,I think that as Your Honor read that order it's in two parts.
1974.73-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.282,3145.791,"Well, they've ordered the Commissioner to conduct further proceeding."
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3145.791,3146.717,"All right, fine."
1974.73-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.717,3149.155,Yes.
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3149.155,3151.775,I think that we have to look those parts one by one.
1974.73-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.068,3271.463,Well then what about the word “ordered?”
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3271.463,3273.372,"Well, I think --"
1974.73-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.372,3276.531,"I think that's sort of an injunctive, isn't it?"
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3276.531,3293.663,"Well, I think for that, we would rely on the Taylor versus Board of Education case, Judge Friendly's opinion in that in which he said that not every order that has words of command is an injunction; just as not every order that has words of prohibition is an injunction on that side either."
1974.73-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3308.729,3310.162,Do you think injunction was sought?
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3310.162,3310.4,Pardon me?
1974.73-1966,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3310.4,3314.681,53 means only that would satisfy Rule 55 affirmance?
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3314.681,3327.37,"Well, injunction under 1253 is the word to be construed very narrowly as Your Honor will recall from cases like Mitchell versus Donovan and Gunn versus University Committee to End the War."
1974.73-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3392.633,3397.66,You mentioned that before but do you think inflation has anything to do with that?
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3397.66,3398.832,I'm sure it does Your Honor.
1974.73-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3400.32,3408.467,Not very surprising but you have this rate increase unrelated to any thing that's happened in the environmental.
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3408.467,3411.491,I did not intend to express surprise that they had these.
1974.73-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3417.314,3435.365,"You haven't mentioned or did I missed it, the Wichita case here where this as I recall it we remanded, we were dealing with the case where the District Court remanded to the Commission."
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3436.961,3438.254,Uh-huh!
1974.73-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3438.254,3441.582,What do you have to say about the Wichita holding?
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3441.582,3444.027,"Well, I would treat Wichita along with all --"
1974.73-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3444.027,3445.645,In terms of our jurisdiction.
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3445.645,3447.442,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1966,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3718.166,3719.9,You're basically -- for a moment.
1974.73-1966,2,31042,john_f_hellegers,,3721.78,3732.8,It's in the 1 Your Honor label supplemental brief and it would be at 9 (a) and following pages appendix D.
1974.73-1966,3,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,4428.471,4432.554,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1966,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4673.096,4676.748,We'll resume there after lunch and I think your five minutes is consumed Mr. Merrigan.
1974.73-1966,3,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,4691.957,4696.05,"Mr. Chief Justice, I understand I have one short minute left."
1974.73-1966,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4696.05,4697.71,"Well, that's what you've been told."
1974.73-1966,3,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,4698.65,4701.019,Thank you very much Your Honor.
1974.73-1966,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4800.766,4802.43,Just a moment Mr. Merrigan.
1974.73-1966,3,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,4810.947,4811.58,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1966,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4836.541,4840.747,"But if there's, assume there've been no violation of NEPA by the railroads --"
1974.73-1966,3,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,4840.747,4841.049,"Well, --"
1974.73-1966,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4841.049,4842.674,-- because they're not subject to it.
1974.73-1966,3,22768,edward_l_merrigan,,4842.674,4855.443,NEPA readdress to the federal agency the Commission Your Honor and the Commission has its statutory duty under the Interstate Commerce Act and of course under NEPA too to perform its function under NEPA in this action.
1974.73-1966,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4883.643,4884.314,Mr. Butler.
1974.73-1966,4,21983,e_bruce_butler,,4884.314,4887.604,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1966,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4902.603,4915.273,Could you represent by a statement on what you understand to be the role of the Court in this area with respect to the subject matter you just spoke of?
1974.73-1966,4,21983,e_bruce_butler,,4915.273,4938.495,We would suggest that the court -- the lower court has an obligation to look first at whether there has been procedural compliance with these specific statutory requirements of NEPA namely whether the Commission in this case has filed an impact statement discussing the points outline in the statute.
1974.73-1966,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4938.495,4943.874,Assume procedurally the Commission has complied beyond that what does this Court is suppose to do?
1974.73-1966,4,21983,e_bruce_butler,,4943.874,4949.645,"Well, I think that that's the real question here what -- where does procedure end and substance begin."
