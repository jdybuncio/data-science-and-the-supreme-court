2002.01-1435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.736,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-1435, Clackamas Gastroenterology Association versus Deborah Wells."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,43.967,47.145,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,61.634,70.922,What... what is the common law rule on respondeat superior for an ordinary corporation vis a vis a director?
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,75.63,82.689,"In an ordinary corporation, the common law rule is that the employee is like a servant."
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,82.689,83.97,"Well, if... if that's so--"
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,83.97,85.539,"--Well, what is your answer?"
2002.01-1435,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,85.539,86.365,I didn't hear you.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,87.325,87.768,I'm sorry.
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,87.768,90.635,"Your answer was yes, was... he is an employee?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,90.635,90.99,Yes.
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,90.99,91.649,Okay.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,101.021,103.129,Because Darden doesn't apply here.
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.705,106.555,"Well, you didn't even cite Darden, I don't think."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,106.555,107.337,--I believe I did.
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.337,108.246,Did you?
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,108.246,108.823,Yes.
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.823,112.621,I would think Darden would be the first place we'd look.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,112.621,116.708,"Well, the difference between this case and Darden is significant."
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.85,124.067,Yes.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,124.067,125.214,--or an employee.
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.214,125.624,Yes.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,125.624,127.482,That's not a choice here.
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.482,133.509,"No, but the decision has to be made on whether these people are employees."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,133.509,133.964,That's right.
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,133.964,142.237,"And Darden says, well, we're going to look to the common law, so what makes you think we'd do something else in this situation?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,142.237,154.231,Because there are frankly not much common law that gives us guidance on how to decide whether a director-shareholder in a professional corporation is an employee or not.
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,228.719,229.256,It may be clumsy--
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.256,243.729,--But this was a case where it was very important to the shareholders in this corporation that they be labeled employees for ERISA purposes.
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.962,262.1,That's how they qualified under ERISA.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,264.535,279.024,"Yes, Your Honor, except that I think that the... the tax purposes were more under the general tax laws, not under ERISA, because they could establish an ERISA plan and deduct the expenses."
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.024,283.854,"But didn't they... in order to be covered, didn't they have to be employees?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,283.854,284.325,Yes.
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,284.325,285.34,Yes.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,285.34,285.877,And... and just--
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.877,291.45,"And they wouldn't... on your theory, they're not... so they are employees for that purpose?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,291.45,299.724,"--Well, they're treated as employees for that purpose, but they should not be treated as employees for purposes of the ADA."
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,332.318,346.807,"But the... am I wrong in thinking that the... the whole thing was set up the way it was, instead of as a partnership, for the reason that these people needed to be characterized as employees for retirement plan purposes?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,346.807,347.633,Yes.
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.633,354.32,And are they not also employees for Worker's Compensation purposes?
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,354.32,356.799,"Under Oregon law, they can opt out of Worker's Compensation."
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,356.799,358.907,But they'd have to opt out.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,360.515,360.925,Yes.
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,360.925,363.691,They start out as being... do they get salaries?
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,363.691,369.653,"They get salaries plus a bonus, which is the division of their profits."
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.653,372.979,But they get salaries.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,384.785,386.81,That's true.
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,400.063,424.333,"Why should it, because I'm still stuck with the language of Darden, which reads as a general rule, when Congress has used the term, employee, without defining it, we have concluded that Congress intended to describe the conventional master-servant relationship as understood by common law agency doctrine, and it says, that rule stood as an independent authority for the copyright decision."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,432.346,432.839,--That's our view.
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,432.839,433.461,--as sufficient?
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,433.461,434.287,That's our view.
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,434.287,443.575,"All right, so you're asking us to depart from Darden and to make an exception from the Darden rule for the... this particular act."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,443.575,444.69,For this--
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,444.69,445.433,Is that right?
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,445.433,447.169,"--For this particular circumstance, that's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,447.169,458.808,"Well, when you say circumstance, there's a word in an act, so you're saying that the word, employee, in this title of the ADA does not bear the common law definition?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,458.808,462.317,"Well, I think the common law definition is one thing to look at."
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,462.994,469.953,"No, no, I'm asking... they said in Darden that's the end of it, and you say... I want to be just clear about it."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,474.495,475.61,"--Yes, that's what we're saying."
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,475.61,476.147,"All right, and so--"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,476.147,476.724,Common law is not the end of it.
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,476.724,477.346,--Okay.
2002.01-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.376,492.289,Would... would you say that the EEOC guidelines and writings and treatises on the differences between professional corporations and other corporations might themselves be part of what we call the common law?
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,521.184,538.979,"No, there isn't much in the common law, because a professional corporation is not a product of the common law, nor is a limited liability partnership, nor a limited liability company, and all three of those organizations are virtually functionally identical once they're up and running."
2002.01-1435,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,539.927,559.634,"Well, and as... as courts begin to write about these things in the area of subchapter S status, tax status and so forth, there is an emerging decisional law, at least, that's... that's evolving, I take it, and you might say that has some common law attributes."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,562.795,577.284,"--Attributes, yes, but not that focus on this particular question, and that is whether a shareholder-director in a professional corporation should be considered an employee for purposes of defining who--"
2002.01-1435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,577.284,600.773,"Who... Darden also says, a couple of pages after the quote that Justice Breyer... since the common law test contains no shorthand formula or magic phrase that can be applied to find the answer, all of the incidents of the relationship must be assessed and weighed with no one factor being decisive, which suggests a more fluid test, certainly, than the other language."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,600.773,603.002,"--And a more fluid test would be certainly more flexible, because--"
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,603.002,604.488,But that's exactly my point.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,625.832,628.266,"--Well, that's... I... I understood your question to be--"
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,628.266,630.662,"No, my question was to try to get the framework."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,650.368,658.442,"--Well, under an ordinary corporation, I think your... your question would be yes, but under a professional corporation, it's different."
2002.01-1435,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,687.42,690.848,"Oh, but isn't there a huge difference, that they've got limited liability?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,695.799,696.337,"No, the--"
2002.01-1435,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.337,698.278,"Whereas in partnership, the individuals are liable?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,698.278,714.83,"--In the partnership, individuals are liable, but in a professional corporation, in a limited liability partnership, in a limited liability company, the... for professionals, those limited liabilities are all the same, and they're not as good as a general corporation, or an ordinary corporation."
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.346,744.634,"Am I wrong in thinking that the... that the individual liability is not across the board, but it's only for malpractice-type claims?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,744.634,746.863,"That's right, it's for malpractice-type claims, and I think--"
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.863,747.196,So--
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,747.196,748.228,--that's pretty much true not just in--
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,748.228,753.716,"--But other claims against the clinic, it... they... they would have limited liability?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,753.716,764.696,"--Yes, they do, and that's true for all three of those emerging types of entities, professional corporations, limited liability partnerships, and limited liability companies."
2002.01-1435,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.696,775.925,"Well, maybe there isn't... there isn't any settled law, is there, that a limited liability partnership would not be treated the same way that this entity is... is treated?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,775.925,797.556,"Well, for example, as a partner in a partnership, limited liability partnership, I have exactly the same limits on my liability as the doctors in this clinic, and I am not an employee, I'm a partner, and the only difference between my status and the status of these doctors is the form of the business, and that's really just a label."
2002.01-1435,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.556,801.476,"Well, you say you're not an employee, but isn't that the question we have to decide?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,801.476,808.414,"Well, every court that's addressed the issue of whether partners are employees, including this Court--"
2002.01-1435,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.414,813.615,"Well, you wouldn't suggest that every partner... no partner is ever an employee."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,820.218,829.384,"--I'm sure there are some who would say that, but I think that what the courts need to do is look at the individual, not just at a label, and look beyond the label to find out, as the EEOC standards--"
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,829.384,832.123,"Well, we don't have a partnership here."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,835.095,835.095,--Yes.
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,835.095,835.921,--do we not?
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,835.921,836.681,That's correct.
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,836.681,838.012,That's what we're talking about.
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,839.87,847.55,But I'm saying that a... a limited liability partnership and a professional corporation should be treated alike for purposes of the EEOC.
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.665,850.484,But then we're away from--
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,850.484,850.977,--Pardon me?
2002.01-1435,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.977,864.435,"--I thought you had a very good case in your brief, and then I read Darden, and I realized the reason I was thinking it, I was out of date and thinking that Hearst was still good law."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,883.959,893.785,"And I'm... if I may, the... the problem with Darden is, it's examining a different relationship than we have in this case."
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,922.038,939.749,"Well, maybe the price that has to be paid for professionals to set up a professional corporation is to be subject to the ADA, and the anti-discrimination law of title VII, and so forth, because these people are going to be counted."
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,941.357,942.183,--Well--
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,942.183,946.519,"Is that all bad, that they have to be subject to these provisions?"
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,946.519,948.665,"--The reason that it's bad... yes, it is all bad."
2002.01-1435,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,948.665,948.932,Why?
2002.01-1435,0,42095,steven_w_seymour,,948.932,969.987,"And the reason is that we should treat similarly situated businesses the same, and there are a... a class of partner-like or proprietor-like individuals, and there is a class of employee-like individuals, and just because... let's say it starts out as a general partnership."
2002.01-1435,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.993,997.313,"Very well, Mr. Seymour."
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,999.066,1009.284,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it... may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1435,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1031.825,1049.453,"Well, do you say that the EEOC has adopted standards that differ from the common law, and has by regulation or otherwise determined that we should apply its test to this question?"
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1049.453,1053.624,"I guess largely, yes."
2002.01-1435,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1082.352,1093.748,"And do you agree with the petitioner's attorney that if you look to the common law test, these people would be employees?"
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1093.748,1097.379,--If you look to the Restatement as the measure of the common law--
2002.01-1435,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1097.379,1097.834,Yes.
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1097.834,1106.667,"--then generally speaking, a... a director who didn't employ service... perform services would not have been an employee, but a director who performed services would be."
2002.01-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1119.753,1123.718,Do we owe deference to the EEOC standard?
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1123.718,1136.267,"The... the Court should give weight to the... the EEOC's test because it reflects its accumulated and longstanding experience in administering the act, but we're not asking for Chevron deference here."
2002.01-1435,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1136.267,1139.982,Didn't the Court say the EEOC doesn't get such deference?
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1143.159,1147.246,"It... it did say that, that it... it doesn't get Chevron deference."
2002.01-1435,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1170.94,1172.676,But it would be kind of a Skidmore deference.
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1172.676,1174.988,"It would be a Skidmore deference, that's correct."
2002.01-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1175.77,1197.689,"I hate to be a bore on this, but will you please write the two sentences for me where I have to say either that, we apply the common law test, and in this instance, the common law test comes out in your favor, or we have to say, we don't apply the common law test because the EE... this statute is different."
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1205.657,1206.733,"--Neither of those two, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-1435,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1206.733,1207.681,"Neither, all right."
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1209.555,1213.83,"I... let me get to Darden, because I think that's the focus of your questions."
2002.01-1435,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1360.458,1363.718,May I ask you a question about the application of your test?
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1366.402,1367.312,"--Yes, we do."
2002.01-1435,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.312,1381.801,"--to answer the question whether these individuals operate independently and manage and control the business on the one hand, or are subject to the organization's control on the other, and I ask you, is it not possible that the same individual could meet both halves of that test?"
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1381.801,1382.544,No.
2002.01-1435,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.544,1388.172,"Some of his duties, he'd be manager, and some others he'd have to respond to what the group told him to do?"
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1388.172,1391.665,"Well, it... it's possible that's true, but what the EEOC's guidance--"
2002.01-1435,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.665,1393.357,What do you do if you find such a case?
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1393.357,1394.061,--You make--
2002.01-1435,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.061,1396.701,"With respect to surgery, he takes orders from the directors."
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1400.21,1434.967,"--What... what we have here under the EEOC's guidance is, ultimately you make an overall judgment that's either-or, based on all the considerations in the guidance, and they are at page 9 of our brief, so that, just as in the partnership context, you look at all of these factors, and just as you would in an independent contractor status kind of situation, you look at all the relevant factors, and then you make an overall judgment about, essentially does this person function as a proprietor of the business, or is he functioning as an employee of the business overall."
2002.01-1435,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1434.967,1449.828,"Why isn't it simpler just to say, well, they picked a corporate form with their eyes open because it was important for them to be labeled employees, at least for retirement purposes, so they have to take the bitter with the sweet."
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1474.598,1515.587,"The... the approach that the EEOC has taken is to... is a functional approach that tries to treat all people alike, and to look to the real functional relationship between the individual and the employee, and the fact that somebody may have chosen to do something for tax consequences, or chose to do something for purposes of limiting individual liability, really doesn't have anything to do with whether he is the sort of person who should receive protection under the nondiscrimination laws, and this is ultimately what we are determining here, are these shareholder-directors people who are employees and therefore receive protection under the nondiscrimination laws, because it's only those people who are the--"
2002.01-1435,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1515.587,1526.732,"Well, I thought we were looking to see if some other, lower employee was covered, not these directors, and that turns on whether you count them as employees--"
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1526.732,1526.898,--That's--
2002.01-1435,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1526.898,1527.104,--or not.
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1527.104,1527.847,--That's correct.
2002.01-1435,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1527.847,1533.974,We're not looking to see if they themselves are covered under the ADA in this case.
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1533.974,1573.794,"But in order to answer the question you have in front of you, which is, is this a small business and does this employee get protection, you first have to answer the question of, are these shareholder-directors employees who get protection under the law, so that is the inevitable product of having to decide the small business exemption, is that you have to decide, these are people who get protection under the laws, and it... it's just not the case that the policies that underlie decisions about incorporation having to do with tax consequences and individual liability have anything to do with whether these are the kind of people who should receive protection under the nondiscrimination laws."
2002.01-1435,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1573.794,1591.088,"Well, I just thought Congress was more concerned with not making really small businesses covered by these acts, that we weren't focused on whether these professional shareholders should be covered, but whether this was the kind of small business that shouldn't be covered at all."
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1591.088,1593.317,"Well... I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-1435,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1593.317,1594.31,Is that right?
2002.01-1435,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1594.31,1614.577,"I... what Congress did in the small business exemption is to link the exemption to the number of people who receive protection under the laws, and that makes sense, because it means that at most, when the small business exemption applies, at most, 14 individuals will be excluded who otherwise would have had protection."
2002.01-1435,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.577,1616.146,"Thank you, Mr. Gornstein."
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1619.944,1622.833,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1435,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.496,1648.801,"What kind of a legal issue was it there, Mr. Crispin?"
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1650.325,1676.703,"That was a RICO question, and the question was whether or not the two parts of the... the RICO enterprise on the one hand and the... the other aspect of the RICO question existed with both the individual sole shareholder and director of the corporation as being separate and distinct from the corporation itself, and in that case the Court said, you cannot collapse the two."
2002.01-1435,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1698.251,1711.959,"Well, the... the reason we said it was that we couldn't find any basis in the statutory history or the text that... that gave us a clue that Congress, in effect, wanted to ignore something which is such hornbook law."
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1797.53,1809.13,"Justice Souter, the individuals that are subject to discrimination in this particular case are not only the lower-level employees as this case presents."
2002.01-1435,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1829.398,1833.734,"So you're saying, even on the premise of their argument, it does not exclude any one of the four."
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1833.734,1834.849,--That's correct.
2002.01-1435,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1834.849,1849.997,"I suppose if one of the four had a 51 percent, a truly indefeasibly controlling interest, you'd concede that, but short of that, which apparently is not the case here, you say, even if I take their premises, they lose."
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1849.997,1859.824,"That's right, Your Honor, I... although I... let me comment that I'm not sure I would concede the 51 percent, all... I would concede it for your hypothetical."
2002.01-1435,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1859.824,1860.938,"Yes, right."
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1860.938,1866.178,But our position is that the employing enterprise is the determining factor.
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.178,1885.869,"How... how does the EEOC treat an ordinary corporation that, let's say, has 12 regular employees and then three directors, the cousin, the father, the son, or whatever, of the owner, so there... so it's as... if you count the three... and it's a perfectly ordinary corporation."
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1890.826,1899.167,"As I read their position, I... I believe that they, under the new guidance, would count those directors under their balancing test."
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1905.687,1907.257,"So remember, these three are just cousins."
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1913.777,1915.18,"Well, in that case, Your Honor--"
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.18,1916.089,Do they count them or not?
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1916.089,1918.153,"--In that case, Your Honor, they would not be counted."
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.153,1919.062,They don't count?
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1919.062,1920.177,"They don't count, because they're not performing services--"
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.177,1920.92,All right.
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1929.01,1930.951,--I'm not sure what the answer would be.
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1935.038,1944.492,"Well, they're there once a year for an hour, and during that time they spill some water, somebody slips... I mean, a corporation, I guess, would be liable, or... or not?"
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1944.492,1948.002,"--On their acts, if they are performing services--"
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1948.002,1948.085,Yes.
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1948.085,1951.39,--for the corporation for compensation they would at... for that hour--
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.39,1951.8,"Yes, for that hour."
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1951.8,1952.793,--be considered employees.
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.793,1953.619,Right.
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1953.619,1959.974,"Now, of course, under the ADA we're looking at numbers of employees over 20 weeks within a calendar year."
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1959.974,1961.089,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, right."
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1961.089,1976.115,"But again, the idea, as this Court recognized in Walters versus Metro Educational, was that the determinations under the employment discrimination statutes should be subject to ready and easy determination."
2002.01-1435,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1991.636,1996.383,"Well, don't we have to give some weight to the EEOC view?"
2002.01-1435,2,18566,craig_a_crispin,,1998.862,2000.227,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.01-1435,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.972,2005.427,Why?
2002.01-1435,3,42095,steven_w_seymour,,2996.087,2806.734,Thank you.
2002.01-1435,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2997.323,2999.347,"Thank you, Mr. Seymour."
