1975.75-260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.912,We will hear arguments next in 75-260 McDonald against Santa Fe.
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,56.096,59.87,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1975.75-260,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.329,346.952,"This complaint could not even -- could not conceivably or even arguably have been made -- had been lodged, could it, if all three employees had been of the same race and then two were discharged?"
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,346.952,352.437,"Well, the gravamen of racial disparity would not be present so, if their were disparate --"
1975.75-260,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.437,354.459,Conceivably have been --
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,354.459,360.836,"I have thought about a lot and I do not believe that it could have been, no sir."
1975.75-260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,573.853,596.907,"Your point of view is this something like prisoners who are all in the same prison, but people of one race complaining that they were habitually given sentences twice as long as the other on the count of race, where there is no argument about the fact that they belong in confinement, but they have received disparate treatment?"
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,596.907,602.142,"Well, not precisely, but it is analogous."
1975.75-260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,621.118,626.249,I think that the guilt of the innocents from your point of view does not enter into this at all?
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,626.249,627.743,That would be correct.
1975.75-260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,627.743,630.835,Your people?
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,630.835,639.321,"Was that prevalent any question as to whether they were enumerating circumstances as to the Negro, yes or no?"
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,639.321,641.719,"It was -- well, no."
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,653.141,656.767,"Well, you fire the ring leader and you do not fire the other?"
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,656.767,662.471,"Well, in this particular instance, it was a dismissal under Rule 12 (b) (6), there was never any testimony taken."
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,662.471,663.935,I am talking about your pleading.
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,672.359,679.019,That is the gravamen of the complaint and race was not advanced as a reason for the discharge.
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,767.472,771.356,Equally culpable because I do not know if that that means.
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,787.974,790.339,I can answer that question for you Mr. Justice Marshall.
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,808.88,810.054,Let me try again.
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,810.054,811.876,Yes sir.
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,811.876,830.229,"In a hypothetical case, one man is charged with stealing $1.75 from the company and the other man is guilty of stealing a million and half dollars from the company, are they equally culpable of stealing?"
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,830.229,836.584,"That -- if well, yes."
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.584,838.825,How could they be?
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,838.825,849.56,It would be a matter of the mind -- of what was in the mind the person discharging them and whether race was a factor in the decision not to discharge.
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,849.56,855.324,"As to whether or not, you do not need a little more than culpable?"
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,855.324,856.141,"Well, it never became --"
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,856.141,857.537,I mean you could have alleged more?
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,857.537,858.111,I understand.
1975.75-260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,925.413,926.209,I am a little puzzled.
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,960.915,966.438,"Mr. Chief Justice, he was addressing it to counsel, I assumed for both sides."
1975.75-260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,978.502,999.583,"Clearly statements that he is proceeding on an assumption that they were equally culpable and by implication, at least quite clear implication that there are no extenuating circumstances for one or the other would appear to make the briefing, the lack of adequate briefing irrelevant?"
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,999.583,1020.913,"I would think so and it would be -- it would make the prima facieness of our case until such time as, Mr. Justice Marshall, the company came forward and showed that there might be differences that one person, that the black man had stolen $1.24 and the white petitioners had stolen a million dollars worth of goods."
1975.75-260,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.475,1115.76,You suppose that legislation was enacted by virtue of Congressâ€™ power under the Thirteenth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment?
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,1115.76,1136.336,"It was under the power of the Thirteenth Amendment, but re-codified subsequent, two years subsequent to the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment and must reflect their thinking of the quality guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to remain constitutional, to give it an all black construction makes it fly in the face in my opinion."
1975.75-260,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1136.336,1144.948,(Voice Overlap) Fifteenth Amendment was concerned of course with the elimination of slavery and all of its badges and white people were not a slave in this country?
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,1144.948,1160.756,"Well, and also the protection of the abolitionist who were suffering at the hands of their anti-abolitionist white neighbors were directly spoken to and protected by the Thirteenth Amendment in its history."
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1160.756,1165.567,It was readopted after the Fourteenth Amendment out of an abundance of caution?
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,1165.567,1168.552,That it would be misconstrued.
1975.75-260,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1168.552,1173.782,"They were relying on the Fourteenth Amendment the second time, it cannot just moved Fourteenth (Inaudible)?"
1975.75-260,0,27933,henry_m_rosenblum,,1173.782,1181.87,I could not agree more and to give it in all black construction flies in the face of Fourteenth Amendment.
1975.75-260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1222.821,1229.526,Very well Mr. Rosenblum.
1975.75-260,1,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,1231.787,1234.976,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1692.186,1693.321,Mr. Niebank.
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1693.321,1699.298,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.647,1818.836,"Mr. Niebank, is that a fair reading if they allege in words, the defendant imposed the more severe disciplinary sanction against them because of their race?"
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1822.628,1833.574,"Well, Mr. Justice that is a conclusion, but you do not know, they do not allege sir that Jackson, the black man was equally culpable and I do not think --"
1975.75-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.574,1844.842,"Even if they were not precisely equally culpable, would in not still state a cause of action at least under classic terms, if they allege that race was a factor in the decision and they do allege that?"
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1844.842,1854.249,"They allege that, but they do not -- the case as been presented is that they were equally culpable and that (Voice Overlap)"
1975.75-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1854.249,1865.814,"That is essential ingredient of a cause of action that they really like, I say is equal culpability an essential ingredient to the cause of action or is it merely enough to allege that race was a factor in the discharge decision?"
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1865.814,1867.965,"Well, the way the case has been presented --"
1975.75-260,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.965,1870.648,"I understand that, but that does not answer my question."
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1870.648,1871.867,"Well, yes."
1975.75-260,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.046,1880.961,Did the District Judge read it that way?
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1880.961,1890.333,"He assumed that, as Your Honor was talking with Mr. Rosenblum, you read that portion of what he assumed for the sake of argument that they were equally culpable."
1975.75-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.213,1910.273,(Inaudible)
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1910.273,1911.207,I beg your pardon.
1975.75-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.207,1914.027,Are you defending the right (Inaudible)?
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1914.027,1915.524,Yes.
1975.75-260,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1918.446,1921.163,But not the -- you disown the reasoning?
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1921.163,1921.911,"No, I do not."
1975.75-260,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.821,1942.8,"Let me ask you a question Mr. Niebank, if I may, about the paragraph of the complaint that Justice Stevens just asked you about."
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1970.774,1978.246,"It is a certainly a decision affected by race and as I get to in a moment, we will would turn to it right now."
1975.75-260,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1980.738,1997.537,"I am looking at the paragraph that precedes the one that has been commented on, this is paragraph B on 38 which states that all three of these individuals were charged jointly and severally with the same offense."
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,1999.046,2001.52,I am sorry Mr. Justice --
1975.75-260,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2001.52,2019.674,"Look at B, page 38, 6B, on that September 26, plaintiffs along with one Negro employee, Charles Jackson were all charged jointly and severally --"
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2019.674,2021.342,But the unspoken conclusion --
1975.75-260,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2021.342,2022.027,-- with misappropriation?
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2022.027,2023.018,Excuse me.
1975.75-260,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2023.018,2024.182,Well.
1975.75-260,2,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2024.182,2030.876,"The unspoken conclusion is that there were all three found guilty and in a fact that is not alleged, but --"
1975.75-260,3,32435,j_stanley_pottinger,,2035.614,2042.181,But what I am suggesting is that absent that the complaint was properly dismissed.
1975.75-260,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.788,2054.672,"(Voice Overlap) You make that wash, you have got to say this does not allege a racial discriminatory motivation?"
1975.75-260,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2054.672,2064.697,Mr. Niebank (Inaudible) it certainly says that plaintiffâ€™s allege that they were discharged because of their race?
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2064.697,2067.203,"That is what they alleged, yes."
1975.75-260,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.272,2107.649,His reference there was to this complaint that you have been reading to?
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2107.649,2108.826,Yes Sir.
1975.75-260,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2108.826,2114.802,"Well, then we have to read the complaint and determine whether that is correct?"
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2114.802,2122.367,"Well, in view of the fact that the motion to dismiss this complaint was granted, I think it is incumbent on this Court to take a look at the complaint."
1975.75-260,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2122.367,2124.176,Most favorably (Voice Overlap).
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2124.176,2127.197,"Construed most favorably to the petitioners, correct."
1975.75-260,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2127.197,2136.122,What do you suggest as a hypothesis that they needed to allege here to survive the motion which is not alleged?
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2136.122,2149.638,"Well, I believe they should have or should be required to allege that they were equally culpable and this is an order to sustain the conclusion that there was desperate disciplinary treatment."
1975.75-260,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2155.269,2166.216,"But surely can you not read this complaint fairly as stating they engaged in a giant enterprise as Mr. Justice Powell has just pointed out, that they all did the same thing (Voice Overlap) in detail."
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2166.216,2174.462,"Well, the fact (Voice Overlap) the point that came up before was that they were charged jointly with this theft."
1975.75-260,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2174.462,2177.053,"Well, only in the allegation stages here?"
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2177.053,2186.911,"Well I know, but that is the point at which they have got to file a complaint which states a cause of action and the courts below found that they did not and I think properly so."
1975.75-260,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2186.911,2190.713,"(Inaudible) are pleading under the Federal Rules, Mr. Niebank, not under Cheddies (ph) rules?"
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2190.713,2201.724,"That is correct Mr. Justice, but still given notice to pleading we are entitled I believe to a more specificity than they have here."
1975.75-260,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2233.112,2234.152,Full answer?
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2234.152,2234.482,I beg your pardon.
1975.75-260,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2234.482,2236.261,You filed a full answer?
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2236.261,2236.964,I am sorry I could not --
1975.75-260,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.964,2238.883,You filed a full answer?
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2238.883,2240.262,"Yes sir, we did."
1975.75-260,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.262,2245.097,"In the answer you did not voluntary any fact that one of them was guilty and another was not, did you?"
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2245.097,2259.195,"Now in the answer to the complaint, no we said that we denied that Jackson was even charged like we denied that Laird was discharged for his participation in the theft."
1975.75-260,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2266.832,2267.705,(Inaudible) is it not?
1975.75-260,4,19707,c_george_niebank_jr,,2270.5,2283.334,Except that they were still required in the District Court to state a claim upon which relief could be granted in their complaint even though we had filed the answer.
1975.75-260,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2552.261,2554.88,Very well Mr. Niebank.
1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,2556.52,2588.631,"If the Court please, both lower courts assumed that the two people -- the three people who were guilty of theft and he had gone into various allegations in pretrial hearings and it was before the District Court that the theft concerned 60 cases of anti-freeze then in transit in the possession of a common carrier, that is a crime under state law of felony and it is also a crime under Federal Law."
1975.75-260,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.582,2762.43,"What would you say if an employer found his business falling off, he did not have any â€“ he was not presented â€“ he did not â€“ he was not organized and he is going to have to cut down 10 employees and he discharged 10 white employees and they brought a suit alleging that they were discharged because of their race?"
1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,2762.43,2766.064,It would seem to me that they have an ideal cause of action.
1975.75-260,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2777.017,2778.794,What about 1981?
1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,2778.794,2780.196,That was what I was going to get to.
1975.75-260,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.634,2792.99,"So you agree that both Titles, at least Title VII protects the whites as well as the black?"
1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,2792.99,2793.31,Right.
1975.75-260,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2798.556,2805.326,"And if the black were the plaintiff here making the same allegations as the white person is making here, you would be arguing the same way?"
1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,2805.326,2807.176,Certainly.
1975.75-260,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.541,2857.64,(Inaudible) Are you going to 1981?
1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,2857.64,2859.915,Right now.
1975.75-260,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2957.899,2961.327,"Mr. Dixie, can I test that proposition with you sir?"
1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,2979.071,2980.426,"Yes, I think all persons --"
1975.75-260,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.426,2981.786,Even though he was white?
1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,2981.786,2982.938,"All persons, yes."
1975.75-260,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.195,2987.37,So it would be conceivable for a white person to have a cause of action?
1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,2987.37,3022.26,"I think that is right and the statute even covers white aliens because alien which is a disability that Congress wanted to overcome, but the ultimate thing we must get to in this case if we are going to be true to what that reconstruction Congress enacted is the adoption of a yardstick of white citizens' rights whatever they are and the granting of those rights to all citizens and that is the place where the statute does not fit the case and vice versa."
1975.75-260,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3022.26,3031.989,"If you decide that white citizens generally have a certain right and then a certain white citizen is denied it, why does he not have a cause of action?"

1975.75-260,5,18831,chris_dixie,,3245.371,3250.461,"No, that is not my position because there are lots of white people as we speak."
