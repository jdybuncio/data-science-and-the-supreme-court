1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,"Number 19, Mastro Plastics Corporation et al. versus National Labor Relations Board."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,34.915,52.667,"If the Court please, this case is here on petition of -- for certiorari for the examination of two questions decided in the first instance by the National Labor Relations Board and affirmed on appeal by the Second Circuit."
1955.19,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,465.365,469.83,You have missed that there were unfair labor practices that's found by the Board.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,469.83,471.758,We are in no position to contest that at this level.
1955.19,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,471.758,475.373,"And, the Board further found that that caused the strike."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,478.518,483.183,"Let me distinguish on your use of the word ""caused""."
1955.19,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,483.183,483.634,"Well, I presume --"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,483.634,491.327,I will admit that the employees struck in response to the unfair labor practices.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,494.46,497.68,What did the Court find?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,497.68,500.489,The Court's findings paralleled the Board precisely.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,500.489,501.034,I beg your pardon?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,501.034,503.698,They -- paralleled the Boards precisely.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,503.698,505.798,"Well, what did the Board find?"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,505.798,512.774,The Board found that -- its terminology was that the unfair labor practice is caused.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,512.774,519.381,"But if you admit the other findings, why do you say you can't challenge the other finding on this level?"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,521.669,527.642,"Well, there is a distinction between the scientific notion, of course, in the sense in which the Board used it."
1955.19,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,549.378,555.798,"For your purposes and our purposes, the picture you are making is irrelevant."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,555.798,560.167,"It will not be, I think, Your Honor, as we proceed with the argument."
1955.19,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,568.945,572.529,That goes on the question of --
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,572.529,573.376,"Well, the Board draws a conclusion --"
1955.19,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,573.376,574.136,Suppose --
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,574.136,575.103,Let me anticipate it.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,633.577,639.978,What is the absolute scientific meaning of “cause” in that connection?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,639.978,667.947,"I would say that, in this precise connection, if there were such a connection between the asserted cause and the asserted result that one inevitably flowed from the other, the connection would be scientific, but they are voluntary intervening acts of parties not under the control of the petitioner."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,899.346,902.518,Did the employees ever seek reinstatement?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,902.518,912.831,"Oh yes, they made a bid for reinstatement but not until March of the succeeding year."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1191.191,1220.157,"Before you get -- before you get to that, may I ask, under your interpretation of this Section that you've just read, 8 -- 8 (4)(d), is there any penalty on the employer comparable to the loss-of-status that -- that runs to the employee in the event he breaches his contract during that period and leaves the employees in peril?"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1220.157,1220.786,There is not.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1270.014,1277.558,What happens to the employee who is fired during this period for union activity?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1277.558,1281.644,He loses his remedy before the Board.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1281.745,1281.845,No.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1287.561,1288.056,He doesn't --
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1288.056,1288.271,-- this strike.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1288.271,1289.401,-- participate in the strike.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1294.61,1295.257,"No, but I mean, what --"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1295.257,1295.667,He might have been reinstated.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1295.667,1299.075,What remedy -- what remedy does that man have?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1315.974,1316.728,Oh yes.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1316.728,1316.811,What is his --
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1316.811,1317.378,Oh yes.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1317.378,1317.457,What is his --
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1317.457,1320.049,He has the full panoply of Board remedies.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1320.371,1322.148,What's his remedy then?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1322.148,1327.147,He can go in and file a charge and procure reinstatement with back-pay.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1327.147,1328.115,Before the Board?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1328.115,1329.044,Before the Board.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1329.044,1332.382,How long would that take him normally?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1332.382,1338.014,Mr. Manoli would be a better expert on that than I.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1349.541,1351.22,Does it ever take less?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,1351.22,1357.503,"It has never taken less than months, to my knowledge, except in the case of informal adjustments."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2762.597,2771.189,"Mr. Fitzpatrick, to take the law in that same spirit that you have -- have just annunciated it."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2806.522,2807.958,It would have its choice.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2816.169,2816.661,Well --
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2816.661,2823.193,"-- the -- your statement -- Your Honor's statement, of course with the facts of this case, the unfair labor practices or the both of them because they brought them in --"
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2823.193,2824.149,"Well, you mean that --"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2824.149,2825.5,-- after the service of the notice.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2825.5,2830.03,-- you mean that it must forfeit status if they -- if they do strike.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2830.03,2831.123,That's right.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2836.196,2854.908,"But I understood you to say that -- that, before the Union gave notice, it could either, without subjecting itself to forfeiture of status of employees, strike or it could go to the Board."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2854.908,2855.498,"Oh no, sir."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2856.011,2856.155,But I --
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2856.155,2857.042,-- misunderstood me then.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2857.042,2861.734,"But I understood you to say that, after it had give a notice, it could only do the one."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2864.303,2865.823,Oh I -- I see what you mean.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2871.401,2871.854,Yes.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2871.854,2874.206,-- an unfair labor practice strike --
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2874.206,2874.956,Yes.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2874.956,2877.225,-- may be remedied by the Board.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2877.225,2878.077,Yes.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2878.077,2880.805,"And, it may also exist as a strike."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2881.592,2882.561,Yes.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2882.561,2888.114,"-- the Union has the full panoply of war material, shall we say."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2888.114,2889.814,"Yes, it has two lawful choices."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2889.814,2890.919,It has two lawful choices --
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2890.919,2891.348,Yes.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2891.348,2893.161,-- prior to the service of the notice.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2893.161,2894.603,"Now, my point is this."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2939.935,2943.4,"Well, it -- it has -- it still has its election."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2949.072,2949.302,"Well, I said --"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2949.302,2950.077,-- to --
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2950.077,2952.642,"-- two lawful choices, as it had before."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2954.115,2956.936,"Yes -- no, its choice now becomes restricted."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2956.936,2957.071,Does it have a strike --
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2957.071,2959.007,It cannot do both.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2960.261,2961.34,Yes.
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2961.34,2964.668,"-- only to the Board, if it wishes to resort to the Board."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2969.667,2976.741,"Does that sound like a fair and equitable interpretation to give, unless you have to?"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,2976.741,2982.041,Let us -- let me make this observation in answer to that.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3056.745,3064.363,"Well, don't you think we might divine a little broader purpose of Congress and say the purpose was industrial peace?"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,3064.363,3068.703,"That is so, sir, but this is a specific application of it."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3068.703,3080.089,"Well, do you -- do you think it -- it means for industrial peace to tie the hands of one party and let the other party do what it -- what it wishes to the destruction of the other party?"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,3083.889,3095.339,I think -- I think that Congress had a bit more confidence in the Board than Your Honor's question implies.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3095.339,3116.546,"You're talking about these things were all on a temporal basis and -- and there is a -- a time factor, is there not, and a very serious one in a -- in an employee or -- or a union or an employer going before the -- the Labor Relations Board for unfair labor practices?"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,3116.546,3138.354,"That is right, sir, but this Court has, only within the last term and I think on two occasions, rather than one, rejected a rather well founded argument that was brought up based upon jurisdiction acquired as a result of the procedural delays of some other body."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3269.885,3280.513,How can the -- how can a union continue to bargain if the employer takes -- takes all of his members away from him by Unfair Practices Act while he's sitting at the table?
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,3280.513,3281.32,Let me remind --
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3281.32,3281.861,As long --
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,3281.861,3290.299,"-- Your Honor that a union, as such, has no rights under this Act."
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3304.578,3307.659,"He has rights as a bargaining agent, doesn't he?"
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,3307.659,3315.579,They are completely derivative and dependent upon their existence.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3380.304,3382.364,"Yes -- yes, you have five minutes more."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,3382.364,3387.447,"Well, I'm not going to be able to cover the -- I'd -- I'd sooner hold that --"
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3387.447,3388.633,"No, that -- that's all right."
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,3388.886,3389.507,I can't --
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3389.507,3389.653,You can certainly --
1955.19,0,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,3389.653,3391.78,-- possibly cover the contract points in five minutes.
1955.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3391.78,3392.624,"Well, you may do that."
1955.19,1,21293,dominick_l_manoli,,3406.409,3410.744,May it please the Court.
1955.19,2,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,6286.037,6293.767,I can't add very much to what Mr. Manoli said in answer to Mr. Justice Black's question.
1955.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6345.351,6352.041,"I understand you to say that, first, it's here as the bill was reported out by the committee --"
1955.19,2,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,6352.041,6352.406,As it was report --
1955.19,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6352.406,6355.778,-- or as the bill was offered in the Senate?
1955.19,2,17620,bernard_h_fitzpatrick,,6355.969,6364.21,It was offered in the Senate by -- it was a committee bill as originally offered in the Senate.
