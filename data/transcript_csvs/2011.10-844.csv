2011.10-844,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.353,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-844, Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories v. Novo Nordisk."
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,9.807,12.183,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,60.678,70.361,"Is it first -- is it first approved, the drug itself -- they're not claiming that, because that -- that patent has expired, hasn't it?"
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,70.361,81.59,"--That patent has long expired, and they also had a patent using -- for the use of the drug to treat diabetes through any method, and that patent has long expired."
2011.10-844,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,103.268,110.158,Suppose I said your brief does not cite a Supreme Court decision.
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,111.437,123.79,"I believe that -- that -- if -- it depends on the context of the sentence, but I think that would be a correct statement if I understand the way you are asking the question."
2011.10-844,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,147.017,153.876,"Well, we have hundreds and hundreds, probably thousands of opinions, and you didn't cite -- there were many of them that you didn't cite."
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,156.778,158.278,"--That's true, that's true."
2011.10-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.184,214.474,"But -- but the context here, one would expect it to say, if it meant what you say it meant, a -- did not claim a use asserted by the generic."
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,214.474,216.443,Justice Scalia -- you're--
2011.10-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.443,222.394,"But not just ""did not claim a use"" and we have to fill in, that is"
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,226.017,234.779,"--Justice Scalia, I am not quibbling with the fact that this could -- the statute could have been written more elegantly."
2011.10-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,239.653,243.65,It's not a matter of elegance.
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,258.218,260.266,If -- and look at the context.
2011.10-844,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,282.505,298.481,"As I understand your argument, you satisfy the -- the ground for seeking deletion or correction was satisfied even before Novo wrote the new use code that you claim is overly broad."
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,311.303,315.772,"--Well, I mean -- the truth is the patent -- yes -- the answer to that question is yes."
2011.10-844,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,317.039,322.943,"No, but that's another -- so there are two oddities in the way you read the statute."
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,346.573,352.477,"I believe it does, because it the deletion talks about -- there's two remedies: remedy and the correction remedy."
2011.10-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.189,440.517,"Well, it's not much, but it's something."
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,462.599,469.864,I -- whether I do have alternative remedies doesn't answer the question about whether I have a remedy in -- for this particular counterclaim.
2011.10-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.864,475.768,"That's true, but if -- but if you have alternative remedies, I am not terribly shocked by the fact that you don't have a remedy under this statute."
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,475.768,479.859,I don't have any good remedies under this statute.
2011.10-844,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,522.512,534.991,"Suppose you didn't file the -- suppose the counterclaim provision wasn't available, and Novo -- you filed a paragraph IV certification and Novo sues you for infringement."
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,546.267,547.125,I could not.
2011.10-844,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,547.125,548.342,Why -- why is that?
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,548.342,553.404,Because there's two paths that are available under the FDA to get -- for a generic to get approval.
2011.10-844,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,614.738,621.921,"Mr. Hurst, would -- would you agree that Congress did not contemplate this situation?"
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,639.477,643.022,"I wouldn't agree, because look at the timing."
2011.10-844,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,685.585,699.31,But what about the fact that the FDA and not the patent holders were drafting the use code at the time this legislation passed?
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,699.31,703.296,"--Justice Ginsburg, that is incorrect; your timing is incorrect."
2011.10-844,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,718.914,719.819,So you are suggesting that--
2011.10-844,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.819,726.627,"When the FDA was writing the codes, was it writing about the scope of the patent?"
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,728.909,729.863,It was writing about the scope of the patent.
2011.10-844,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,738.263,745.309,"We can ask the government, but why did it think that it lacked the expertise, because it didn't want to opine under the patent laws?"
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,745.309,753.478,--I think the short answer is yes; the FDA has always done their very best to not get anywhere near the patents.
2011.10-844,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,766.175,777.094,"Would it suffice in the description just to give a cross-reference to the patent, to say the use of this drug as described in patent claim number 43?"
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,777.094,784.136,"It -- it would not be sufficient, because the way -- the whole purpose of the use code is to administer section (viii)."
2011.10-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,795.616,796.131,Counsel--
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,796.131,806.11,"But if I could get back to a question, Justice Scalia, that you asked about the -- whether correcting typos in patent numbers is a real role for the correction remedy."
2011.10-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,869.945,870.413,--Counsel--
2011.10-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.413,875.206,So it -- it's -- it's -- the issue is not whether Congress enacted it only for that.
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,882.221,882.627,But--
2011.10-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.627,885.173,"I mean, it's a very small detail, you know -- ""correct""."
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,897.198,897.947,--You have--
2011.10-844,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.947,898.711,It's conceivable.
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,898.711,900.427,--You have to give it some meaning.
2011.10-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,911.033,912.718,--Counsel--
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,912.718,914.282,There is no role -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,914.282,914.765,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,915.592,917.87,There is no role whatsoever.
2011.10-844,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,936.111,937.721,I will wait for your rebuttal.
2011.10-844,0,30681,james_f_hurst,,937.721,938.408,Thank you.
2011.10-844,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,939.862,940.767,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,949.295,951.202,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-844,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,993.262,996.386,"Mr. Horwich, do we -- do we know what FDA's position is in this case?"
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1000.243,1000.961,--We -- yes.
2011.10-844,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1012.612,1013.005,"Well, Mr. Horwich, what does that mean exactly, that you represent?"
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1023.686,1029.013,"Well, the names on the brief I think should not be a guide to the deference question."
2011.10-844,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1067.934,1069.607,Just one more question on how this works.
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1082.881,1089.269,"Well, the statute -- well, let me start with the basic that the statute envisions that there will be carve-outs."
2011.10-844,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1146.292,1153.915,"If the patent holder -- if the patent holder writes a use code that is ridiculously, totally, unreasonably broad, is there anything that FDA can do about that?"
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1153.915,1169.642,"--Well, I think the problem, Justice Alito, is that from FDA's point of view it's a very slippery slope, because as soon as FDA starts undertaking criticism of a use code its effective -- the only basis for criticizing it is looking at the patent."
2011.10-844,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1191.6,1198.413,"Well, what about after -- what about after there has been litigation and a court has decided that a use code that was written in a particular case was totally unreasonable?"
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1210.095,1219.793,"Well, I think the -- I think the only posture in which a court would actually look at a use code and evaluate it is under the counterclaim."
2011.10-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1230.099,1233.617,What about an APA action against the FDA for relying on the use code?
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1237.24,1251.263,"Well, it seems to me that that challenge would fail because <FDA> [= FDA] has made a reasonable construction of the statute, that its role its role is ministerial, it does not engage in substantive evaluation of patents because the statute doesn't envision that."
2011.10-844,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.615,1278.614,So how do you describe what the FDA does?
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1279.3,1286.172,So what FDA does do is it accepts the submission from the brand describing its -- describing its use code.
2011.10-844,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1293.327,1307.443,"And it's your understanding that you require companies to state the scope of the patent in the use code, or might you think it's perfectly permissible for a company to write its use code in terms of indications?"
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1307.443,1311.694,It's certainly possible in a particular case that the indications would be appropriate.
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1319.578,1320.596,But you said that--
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1320.596,1321.08,--what needs to be carved out.
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1321.08,1322.078,"--Except, counsel--"
2011.10-844,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1322.078,1322.939,"So that -- I'm sorry, go ahead."
2011.10-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1322.939,1325.155,Justice Sotomayor.
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1325.155,1330.138,--Except the FDA tells parties not to rely on the orange code.
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1330.138,1331.152,It--
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1331.152,1333.933,It tells them what controls is the patent.
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1333.933,1338.307,"--Well, that is true that FDA said that the parties should look at the patent."
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1343.475,1343.789,Could I ask you--
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1343.789,1344.288,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1344.288,1346.663,--just on a practical basis.
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1361.376,1370.12,"The label -- I can't speak to what the labeling in the application is right now, because it's confidential."
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1370.12,1370.326,But let's assume that's--
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1370.326,1372.151,"But if we assume for the sake of argument that it's the same, yes."
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1372.151,1386.224,"--Now, it claims that when the paragraph IV -- the paragraph IV action is started and it's sued for infringement, that it's automatically going to lose--"
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1386.224,1387.991,"Well, that's right, and in fact--"
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1387.991,1388.615,--because--
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1388.615,1390.315,"--In fact, Caraco has stipulated to that."
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1392.019,1394.284,--Could you explain to me -- could you explain to me why?
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1402.809,1411.731,--It would be inducement of infringement to sell a product with labeling that suggests that the product be used for a patented method of use.
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1411.731,1412.136,Okay.
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1435.207,1453.605,"The counterclaim is designed precisely to get out of the quandary, because what it says is the paragraph IV litigation here, the choice between infringement and noninfringement, is a false choice, because if the counterclaim prevails and the use code changes the paragraph IV litigation is going to go away because Caraco is going to want to go proceed through section (viii)."
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1458.553,1466.068,Let's assume that Caraco puts in a label like the one it wants to use under claim 4.
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1469.098,1469.644,Yes.
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1472.066,1475.064,It will not even ask for a response from Novo?
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1475.064,1485.527,FDA will not permit -- does not permit -- will not approve the application where theirs is carve-out combined with section -- with paragraph IV.
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1485.527,1489.117,But is that before -- without an infringement action by Novo?
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1489.117,1494.07,I'm not sure of the timing.
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1503.551,1524.792,"If you tell me the FDA doesn't want to get involved in construing the patent, why is it kicking out the claim for, claim for, claim until Novo does a suit on whether or not the generic is infringing or not--"
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1524.792,1525.107,--I--
2011.10-844,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1525.107,1525.794,--and let that issue be decided below?
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1525.794,1537.02,"--From FDA's point of view, it's not a sufficient application if there's carveout labeling presented with a paragraph IV certification."
2011.10-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1551.561,1553.624,Finish your statement.
2011.10-844,1,17700,benjamin_j_horwich,,1553.624,1553.89,--Thank you.
2011.10-844,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1566.434,1567.12,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1576.069,1578.424,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-844,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1608.166,1609.102,I'm sorry.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1610.038,1611.68,"Page 522, Your Honor."
2011.10-844,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.68,1612.039,Thanks.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1612.039,1613.665,"U275,"
2011.10-844,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1711.078,1721.993,But the alternative is that the FDA is going to have to hire an awful lot of patent lawyers to review the use codes and their correspondence to the actual patents.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1721.993,1722.886,"There are several alternatives, Your Honor."
2011.10-844,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1754.606,1756.778,"Well, that's the way agency action gets challenged when it's substantive action."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1762.135,1767.804,"Your Honor, they have chosen to make it a ministerial act, which is not a negative, by the way."
2011.10-844,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1808.991,1811.959,What odds would you put--
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1811.959,1813.207,I'm sorry?
2011.10-844,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1813.207,1826.169,--What odds would you put as a betting lawyer on them winning a challenge to the FDA policy decisions of what its capable of doing and not doing?
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1826.169,1833.699,"Your Honor, there have been about a dozen APA challenges to various aspects of this administration in the DC Circuit over the past ten years."
2011.10-844,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1856.222,1859.174,What you described sounded very much like this case.

2011.10-844,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1903.059,1910.511,"Can I bring you back for a minute, please, to the statute, and if you -- it's in page 3 of the blue brief."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,1926.457,1926.94,"Yes, Your Honor."

2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2036.692,2041.922,"Justice Breyer, your question conflated as Caraco often does, the use and the indication."
2011.10-844,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2066.286,2076.78,"In other words, you are saying that the -- this -- a method for improving glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellites is not the patent information."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2076.78,2079.389,"Your Honor, that is the indication that--"
2011.10-844,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.389,2080.531,"I know, but are saying it is patent information?"
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2080.531,2087.698,--It is not patent information submitted under (b) or (c) of section 505 which is the statutory language.
2011.10-844,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2092.432,2098.836,Was not the regulation issued under this statutory section?
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2098.836,2099.226,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-844,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2132.461,2133.604,"Can you give us of a cite of that, please?"
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2133.604,2137.102,"--I'm sorry, the 2007 rulemaking is--"
2011.10-844,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.102,2144.971,You don't have to do it now.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2147.455,2150.75,"--You Honor, it is cited in our brief and my colleague will hand up to you momentarily."
2011.10-844,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.75,2153.202,"Oh, it's cited in principal brief?"
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2153.202,2156.061,"In the red brief, Your Honor."
2011.10-844,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.061,2156.763,Yeah.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2163.06,2163.652,Justice Breyer--
2011.10-844,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.652,2164.526,I don't really care.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2164.526,2170.025,--To further answer your question--
2011.10-844,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.025,2170.415,I do.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2175.18,2178.584,"--Justice Breyer, there is another point on the structure of the statute."
2011.10-844,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2195.798,2197.436,"You know, I know that argument, right?"
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2197.436,2197.748,--So--
2011.10-844,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2197.748,2198.875,You don't need that argument.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2213.51,2214.727,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-844,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2217.116,2222.458,"Mr. Perry, in your view, patent information is just the patent number and the expiration date, and that's all?"
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2222.458,2225.317,"--The patent information submitted under (b) and (c) of section 505, correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-844,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2225.317,2229.517,Is that just the patent number and the expiration date?
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2229.517,2229.814,That's right.
2011.10-844,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2239.59,2248.15,"Well, why would anybody have created this counterclaim to fix the patent number and the expiration date when that can be done by way of the defense to a patent claim?"
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2248.15,2253.086,"Your Honor, it's important to remember the counterclaim is only a delisting provision."
2011.10-844,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2271.64,2272.342,--What was fixed?
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2275.875,2278.452,--The counterclaim addressed the problem of improper listing that was addressed in the FTC report.
2011.10-844,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.115,2301.393,What do you mean by the problem of improper listing?
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2301.393,2325.664,"Your Honor, what the FTC report explained was that certain branded companies near the expiration of the listed patent would come in and file a second patent in the Orange Book, even though it was not properly listed, it didn't fit within section 505(b) in the listing requirements, solely for the purpose of getting a second 30-month stay, essentially to box out the generic companies; And that that was an anticompetitive action."
2011.10-844,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2339.082,2342.782,"So your argument, Mr. Perry, is not just that the word ""correct"" does no work."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2346.483,2347.063,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-844,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2380.877,2381.625,I'm still not following it.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2385.361,2389.935,"Your Honor, the usual case is it's not listed because it doesn't fit."
2011.10-844,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2411.507,2417.018,"The brand manufacturer has an overwhelming incentive to list the correct patent, doesn't it?"
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2417.018,2417.894,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-844,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2417.894,2427.421,So why would we give a procedure to an adversary to fix the number when the brand manufacturer is going to fix it as soon as its alerted to the problem?
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2427.421,2434.105,"Because, Your Honor, if the generic raises a counterclaim and if it's delisted, the generic gets no more 180-day marketing exclusivity stay at the end of the ANDA process."
2011.10-844,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.08,2465.402,"I can't imagine that that would really come to -- I mean, if it's a transposition of numbers, that there would have to be a proceeding to get it changed."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2470.355,2474.227,"Your Honor, the transposition is not the problem."
2011.10-844,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2522.927,2537.063,"Counsel, let's assume, because I now take from your earlier conversation with Justice Breyer that you're saying the use code here is absolutely right, because the only use that we claimed was the combination use of the drug, your drug with the metformin."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2549.167,2551.402,That -- the indication is correct.
2011.10-844,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2551.402,2569.113,"What this means practically I believe is that when your patent expires no generic can come in with a use that's different than yours because they're going to be boxed out by this indication, this overbroad indication."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2585.383,2601.238,"Your Honor, that argument was made to the FDA by the generic industry in the 1994 rulemaking, the first time this issue came up, and they said: You should not allow use codes to be based on indications; you should instead require a description of the patented method-of-use."
2011.10-844,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2629.641,2634.688,"Yeah, but what it also says is this, and that's what I want to go back to this literal statutory argument."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2716.437,2720.621,"--First, the regulation is not an interpretation of 505(b)."
2011.10-844,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2812.139,2829.851,"Now, the government -- now, the government, which is representing all the government agencies, whether the FDA signs it or not, tells us that that language, that (b) and (c) language about patent information as interpreted by the regs does cover this stuff."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2833.021,2833.863,Your Honor--
2011.10-844,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2833.863,2845.36,"--and -- when I'm talking about patent information among (b) and (c), we have the government telling us that that covers this, and why don't I just stop right there and say thank goodness I am out of this case -- and I'm not out of it--"
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2845.36,2876.158,"--I think -- I think I can do no better than refer the Court again to the 2007 rulemaking -- Justice Scalia, 72 Federal Register page 21268 -- which the United States does not address and which Caraco does not address, in which FDA addressed your point, Justice Breyer, and explained that this information -- while useful, and we have never challenged FDA's authority to require the information, but it is not an interpretation of that language patent information -- this quote (c) is--"
2011.10-844,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2876.158,2886.106,"And even if it were, as I believe the government acknowledged, this is not a situation in which we owe deference to the FDA."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2888.89,2889.795,--Correct.
2011.10-844,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2889.795,2896.696,And we -- we don't decide whether we have authority to decide cases on the basis of what the agency thinks.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2896.696,2897.745,It is certainly--
2011.10-844,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2897.745,2909.818,What is the parade of horribles that you imagine if we were to read the counterclaim provision in the way your adversary is promoting and the government is promoting?
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2931.059,2936.448,"--Your Honor, first, the counterclaim has no work to do for use codes."
2011.10-844,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2938.008,2954.097,"I -- I'm asking you to accept that we are to -- as an assumption only, don't -- it's not intended to be a -- a ruling -- to assume that we read the counterclaim in the way your adversaries want us to."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,2957.143,2962.029,"--Your Honor, it is going to add complexity, expense and so forth."
2011.10-844,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2983.487,2986.361,"But, Mr. Perry, there are also horribles on the other side, of course."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3055.414,3057.726,"Justice Kagan, this statute was a political compromise."
2011.10-844,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3088.368,3096.334,"Mr. Perry, can I ask you, on that core question: we have a patent on a drug alone."
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3125.363,3125.601,--No.
2011.10-844,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3205.038,3206.552,Come back to Justice Kagan's question.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3223.498,3230.915,"--In this case, Justice Alito, there were two points: first, FDA rejected Caraco's administrative challenge to the use code."
2011.10-844,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3283.098,3286.268,But -- but here's what we know about Congress's intent.
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3312.82,3313.475,--Your Honor--
2011.10-844,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3313.475,3318.411,--so why should we think that the Congress that really cared about the result in Mylan does not care about this?
2011.10-844,2,36483,mark_a_perry,,3318.411,3320.958,"--Mylan, in the response gives the generic a one-shot remedy, and you are out of it altogether."
2011.10-844,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3379.575,3381.119,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-844,3,30681,james_f_hurst,,3383.058,3384.352,Thank you.
2011.10-844,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3469.689,3477.094,And what do you say about the -- the section cited by -- by your colleague?
2011.10-844,3,30681,james_f_hurst,,3477.094,3480.499,--We address -- he's citing something the FDA said in 2007.
2011.10-844,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3639.169,3641.403,Going back to the question that I had.
2011.10-844,3,30681,james_f_hurst,,3642.198,3644.651,Sure.
2011.10-844,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3644.651,3653.773,"--As I read the record, in April of '08, the <FDA> [= FDA] rejected your section viii application."
2011.10-844,3,30681,james_f_hurst,,3653.773,3654.147,Yes.
2011.10-844,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3654.147,3655.052,All right?
2011.10-844,3,30681,james_f_hurst,,3663.545,3663.908,The question is did we--
2011.10-844,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3663.908,3671.029,"Did you -- you submitted what the FDA requested for your claim 4, the amended label?"
2011.10-844,3,30681,james_f_hurst,,3671.029,3672.811,"--Yes, we did."
2011.10-844,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3679.916,3680.368,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-844,3,30681,james_f_hurst,,3680.368,3682.197,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2011.10-844,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3682.197,3682.728,The case is submitted.
