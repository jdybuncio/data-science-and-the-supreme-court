2005.05-83,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,3.702,We'll hear argument first today in Washington v. Recuenco.
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,5.904,12.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,107.851,110.887,"On... on that point, I have... I have one question."
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,144.707,145.541,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,145.541,148.243,"Yes, because I couldn't find it in the sentencing proceeding."
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,148.243,157.265,"In the... in a subsequent or nearly subsequent breath, the prosecutor then asked for the enhancement, the 36-month enhancement, that applies for firearms."
2005.05-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,218.386,221.921,It does sound as if he thinks there was... the prosecutor thought there was no error.
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,224.456,225.14,--That's right.
2005.05-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.19,258.26,"Was deadly weapon still an enhancement at that point, or was deadly weapon part of the definition of a new crime?"
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,258.26,261.712,"--Deadly weapon was still called an enhancement, Your Honor, under the statute."
2005.05-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,310.11,316.431,I thought the deadly weapon... the definition of deadly weapon... that that could include a revolver or a pistol.
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,337.01,343.164,A firearm includes pistols and revolvers because a firearm is something... anything from which a projectile is fired.
2005.05-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,343.164,352.186,But... but didn't the deadly weapon... definition of deadly weapon include firearms?
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,352.186,353.32,--That's the way it was defined to the jury in this case.
2005.05-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,372.715,373.182,Wasn't--
2005.05-83,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,373.182,385.289,But with a 1... 1-year enhancement or... I thought that that could apply in a case where the deadly weapon was a gun.
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,385.289,387.307,No.
2005.05-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,409.055,418.661,"--Well, would it be either proper or required by the Washington trial court to tell the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the charge is assault?"
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,451.315,455.6,"--We believe that's exactly what the court did in this case, Your Honor, by... by instructing the jury that deadly weapon is firearm."
2005.05-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,457.719,458.135,"No, no."
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,476.43,479.048,"--Well, there... there are two parts to the answer."
2005.05-83,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,507.131,509.65,"Well, then you're saying the instruction here was proper."
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,509.65,513.518,"--I'm saying that the instructions that went to the jury, correct, were... were proper."
2005.05-83,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.704,543.887,Could you... could you clarify one thing for me?
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,551.976,564.8,"That portion of the Washington law, Your Honor, isn't... isn't crystal clear, but what I can say is that that's not in this case because trial counsel at... at trial on more than one occasion specifically said it was irrelevant to this case."
2005.05-83,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,569.002,576.089,"But is... just again, I'm not trying to find out the answer to what happened here, but just as a matter of what the law provides."
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,585.361,586.245,"--In that circumstance, yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-83,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.245,588.063,It could be.
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,588.063,600.621,"But... but obviously, as counsel... on page JA 31 and at JA 38, counsel very specifically said the State tries to say that a nonworking firearm can also be the basis for this offense, and certainly it can be."
2005.05-83,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,640.21,646.264,Would you explain again why it was irrelevant whether the gun was operable or not?
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,646.264,659.255,"Operability, Your Honor, is... is... there were a series of cases that... that arose in Washington having to do with... with a gun that was basically a real gun, but that there was technically wrong with it."
2005.05-83,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,670.129,671.045,"But to be a real gun, it has to be operable."
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,671.045,680.501,"Well, that's what the... what the cases have said is that it only has to be ready... could be made ready to... to fire in a short amount of time, yes."
2005.05-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,689.673,698.779,"--Now, did you have to prove that because, as... as I have assumed, the charge included the statement that he had used a handgun?"
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,699.429,699.829,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-83,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,699.829,701.481,Okay.
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,701.481,707.551,"The charging document said the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon, which establishes the general category, and then, to wit, a handgun."
2005.05-83,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,716.24,722.31,But all that the jury found was deadly weapon because that's all they were asked to find.
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,722.31,722.944,That's right.
2005.05-83,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.573,752.429,"Well, you... you could... it could be argued that it not only didn't encompass the firearm finding, but it excluded the firearm finding."
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,767.271,777.21,"I think, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, if you imagine a situation, as Justice Kennedy was posing, where the jury was presented with two options and they were going to choose one or the other, you might be able to make that argument."
2005.05-83,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,801.092,806.146,Is the jury given a copy of the information?
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,806.146,809.764,"They are ordinarily read a copy of the information, Your Honor, at the start of the case."
2005.05-83,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,868.817,873.638,Why was deadly weapon put in by the prosecutor at all?
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,885.761,886.228,--Correct.
2005.05-83,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,886.228,887.228,"--to wit, a handgun."
2005.05-83,0,33623,james_m_whisman,,904.522,911.343,"And... and I think to answer that question, Your Honor, again we have to step back to the year 2000 and... pre Apprendi, et cetera."
2005.05-83,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,961.192,961.492,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,972.666,973.816,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-83,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1058.855,1059.872,"Ms. Millett, can I ask you this one question?"
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1075.364,1082.101,"--No, I don't... I don't think that's true, Justice Stevens, that there will be times... I don't think this is one of those cases, but there will be--"
2005.05-83,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1082.101,1091.873,"But there might be a rare case, but in about 95 percent of the cases, wouldn't it be true that the fact the judge made the finding is pretty good evidence that the jury would have made the same finding?"
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1091.873,1098.877,--I think it will depend on whether the evidence was disputed before the judge in a... in a... in the Federal system would have been sentencing hearing.
2005.05-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.895,1101.228,"The judge doesn't have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt, does he?"
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1101.228,1101.461,--Exactly.
2005.05-83,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1176.606,1207.911,"What... what do we do about the problem that is raised by... by counsel on the other side, that Washington law is such... or at least at the time the briefs were written, Washington law is such, as they understand it, that the... that the issue could never properly have been submitted to the jury, and... and therefore, if... if Washington courts are going to follow Washington law, in every case in which a firearm is an issue, the case is going to be handled exactly like this?"
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1241.564,1242.397,"No, it's not, Justice Souter."
2005.05-83,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1267.446,1267.779,So you're... I'm sorry.
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1273.85,1288.525,"I think that's right, but even if it weren't, if... if you had some State that decided not to fix its law, in light of Apprendi and Blakely, I expect that what would happen is defendants would bring sort of... there would be a facial constitutionality problem with any attempt to prosecute under that."
2005.05-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.808,1317.878,I don't understand what... what you meant by a facial unconstitutional... facially unconstitutional problem.
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1325.032,1328.65,I can't imagine the Federal court would intervene in an ongoing State proceeding.
2005.05-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.65,1328.767,Neither can I.
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1328.767,1335.004,But State courts are perfectly capable of... of applying and we assume that they would apply and adhere to constitutional law from this Court.
2005.05-83,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1335.004,1338.539,"So that... that's not really an adequate answer, that it would facially unconstitutional."
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1338.539,1344.86,"Well, my understanding was that the Washington law... Washington legislature didn't amend its law to say that this could be submitted to a jury."
2005.05-83,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1350.43,1350.88,A motion in limine kind of--
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1350.88,1351.164,--Right.
2005.05-83,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1361.353,1372.743,"The assumption of the hypothetical is, I take it, that the Washington State judges would deliberately violate our holding of a matter of constitutional law in imposing the enhancement."
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1372.743,1378.231,"They would, and I think that's not a fair assumption and it's certainly not the way to decide whether harmless error analysis should apply."
2005.05-83,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1387.17,1399.977,Do you agree in this case that the court did have the obligation to submit a special verdict form indicating that the defendant... asking whether the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon?
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1399.977,1402.262,"Yes, that's required by Washington law."
2005.05-83,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1402.596,1403.879,No. As a matter... a constitutional matter.
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1403.879,1405.145,--That--
2005.05-83,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1405.145,1412.735,"Suppose the... suppose the judge didn't ask about deadly weapon at all, just... just asked whether there's an assault."
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1412.735,1416.853,"--Well, the... it's assault in the second degree which requires... itself requires use of a deadly weapon."
2005.05-83,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1422.007,1426.375,But you... so... so there had to be an instruction that there was an assault in the second degree?
2005.05-83,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1426.375,1439.433,"There had... there had to be a deadly weapon to have assault in the second degree, and then... and I may not get all the nuances of Washington law, but then the jury had to have the sentencing enhancement, had to make a separate finding that the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time."
2005.05-83,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1579.273,1579.539,"Thank you, Ms. Millett."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1587.794,1590.58,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.121,1641.696,"How could it be lesser included when, as we've heard, firearm does... I'm sorry... deadly weapon does not include firearm?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1654.687,1684.106,"Under Washington law... it's important to understand that under Washington law, a handgun is... is a deadly weapon per se, but that handgun is only a firearm if the State establishes the additional fact that it has the capacity to fire, which is... which is why the statute, the deadly weapon statute, and the definition of deadly weapon in... in the statutory provision specifically includes handgun, revolvers, and other guns."
2005.05-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.106,1686.058,But if it has the capacity--
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.058,1687.224,But the statute does say deadly weapon other than a firearm.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1687.224,1692.128,The definition statue of... of deadly weapon doesn't.
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1692.278,1693.145,But the enhancement section does.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1693.145,1698.632,--It's a separate provision on the enhancement... or excuse me... as to the length of the enhancement that would be imposed does.
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.632,1701.901,"Well, do you think in this case you'd be entitled to a lesser included offense instruction as a matter of law?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1701.901,1706.887,"I believe that as a matter of Washington law, the answer would be yes."
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1716.659,1719.528,"Well, was there any evidence that it didn't have the capacity to fire?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1719.528,1722.647,"There was no evidence, I think, to suggest that it did."
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1722.647,1725.932,You're not entitled to... you're not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction for which there's no evidence.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1725.932,1739.691,"Under Washington law, a defendant gets a lesser included instruction so long as the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to him, would support the fact that the lesser was... was included."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1755.384,1772.329,"No, but there... there is evidence from which the jury could find that it was a real gun, and in the absence of any indication to the contrary, that is competent evidence for the jury to use in concluding that it would function like a real gun."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1798.813,1808.419,"As a matter of Washington law and as of the fact that this is, indeed, an element of a greater offense, there is a requirement on the State to come forward with additional proof of the capacity to fire."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1808.419,1809.069,What's... what's your authority?
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1819.476,1820.076,There is not.
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1823.361,1826.48,And what exactly in the language is it that you hang your hat on?
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1826.48,1832.55,The fact that the deadly weapon enhancement can apply specifically to a handgun regardless of the manner in which it's used.
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1846.976,1847.343,No... no question.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1872.425,1882.464,"Again, if we compare the definition of a deadly weapon under Washington law with the definition of a firearm under Washington law, a handgun is by definition a deadly weapon."
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1885.399,1890.637,"Counsel, you asked for an instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1896.04,1900.008,It would seem that the... the same definition of firearm would apply.
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1900.008,1905.146,So you ask for an instruction assuming that the firearm at issue in this case was operable.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1905.146,1906.062,No.
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1926.976,1933.463,"But if the firearm were not operable, you would not have been entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1933.713,1948.389,"--If the firearm... if looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, he may not have been entitled under the... the factual prong that... that the Washington courts use on lesser and greater offenses."
2005.05-83,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1948.389,1963.232,"Let's say a new case comes up tomorrow and the person is charged in an information with assault in the second degree, and it's clearly alleged in the information that a firearm was used."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1977.908,1990.216,"I think that if the parties litigate the question of whether or not it was an assault with... with a firearm, as opposed to litigate the offense of assault with a deadly weapon, and then there's merely an omission from the elements, I think that's a different case."
2005.05-83,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1990.732,1993.418,"Well, it's a different... is it a materially different case?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1993.418,1995.62,--I think it's a materially--
2005.05-83,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1995.62,1996.67,"Is it just like Neder, or is it different from Neder?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,1996.67,2001.689,"--I think that scenario would be closer to Neder, but I think that's a different scenario than what we have here."
2005.05-83,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.847,2022.936,"Take Justice Alito's case, and nobody litigated it because nobody doubted that it was a loaded gun."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2025.555,2035.577,"--In that scenario, if the evidence is overwhelming as... as perhaps it was in Neder, one might assume that the error is uncontroverted."
2005.05-83,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.577,2036.093,All right.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2044.849,2054.621,--Because I think unlike Neder this case involves a jury... or excuse me... the... a... the wrong entity has determined the defendant's guilt not on the crime at issue--
2005.05-83,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2054.621,2064.911,"Yes, I quite... I quite agree with you that there is the difference that in the Alito case as amended, it all happened before the jury got its verdict."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2075.801,2084.641,--Because in a scenario where the jury has been properly instructed and has returned a complete verdict--
2005.05-83,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2084.641,2084.841,"No, no."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2119.814,2123.616,--I think that scenario is closer to Neder than it is to this case.
2005.05-83,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2123.616,2137.526,"And I want to know why that matters because the only thing I've tried to create the hypothetical to matter is the one thing happens before the jury goes out, and the other happens after."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2138.226,2158.189,"I think it matters because in a scenario like this, as opposed to either Neder or... or the hypothetical, the only offense that has ever been litigated to the parties... or by the parties to the jury was the lesser offense."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2176.651,2176.884,No.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2210.521,2215.509,"Because, again, I go back to Washington law."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2222.263,2227.983,"Well, a... a firearm, as I understand it, is defined to include a pistol or a revolver."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2228.383,2230.269,--It is.
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2230.269,2230.385,All right.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2240.241,2245.895,"That may be, but as a matter of Washington law, that's not the case."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2249.93,2274.295,"Yes, but you're asking for a... you're asking for a Federal constitutional ruling, and right now, if I understand you correctly, you're arguing that you ought to win because if you don't win, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, we would be condoning a verdict for an offense that was never charged."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2306.95,2316.389,"If, in fact, the allegation of handgun is sufficient to bring it in the context of Neder, then there... there was no error at all."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2342.456,2343.439,And that's because it... it didn't go to the jury.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2343.439,2346.741,"That's because the judge, as opposed the jury--"
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2346.741,2348.477,Yes.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2348.477,2351.929,--decided Mr. Recuenco's guilt on a greater offense.
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2351.929,2352.062,Right.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2352.062,2366.272,"So... so as a matter of Washington law, Mr. Recuenco's jury was properly charged and properly returned a verdict on the only offense litigated and that was the lesser offense of assault two with a deadly weapon."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2366.272,2376.21,"Well, when you say it's not litigated, do you mean simply that nobody, none of the witnesses, none of the counsel in argument, disputed that a handgun was there?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2382.114,2396.974,"What I mean by saying it wasn't litigated is that it was the understanding of the parties at trial that the firearm element was not at issue because that had not been charged, that that was not the charge in front of the jury."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2396.974,2399.926,And... and what do you... what do you base that statement on?
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2418.22,2421.939,"Again, I could point to the... the prosecutor's response in the motion to vacate."
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2452.608,2464.299,"Counsel, what your trial counsel said was that the... I'm quoting from the joint appendix, page 30... the allegation and the basis on which this case was tried was under the theory of firearm."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2470.286,2480.459,--I think it's... it would be equally inconsistent with the State's current position if we look at JA 35 where the prosecutor's response was we didn't need that instruction because firearm was not an element of the crime.
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2480.459,2500.139,"Do you think it would have been error in this case based on the evidence presented and the way the... the case was argued... would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury that if they found that there was a firearm involved, they should make a... they could make a... a finding on that?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2500.139,2512.78,"Well, it's interesting because post Recuenco, after the Washington Supreme Court's ruling in this case, yes, that would be an error because after the Washington Supreme Court's decision in this case, what they said is that--"
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2512.78,2527.206,"But as a constitutional matter, would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury in this case, based on this evidence, that they could return a verdict that a firearm was used as part of the assault?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2527.206,2530.758,"--As a matter of constitutional error, no, I don't believe it would have been."
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2537.228,2544.298,Ms. Millett tells us that that only applies on remand under... under the Hughes case.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2544.298,2561.593,"Under Washington law, when a court... as I think is common under Federal law, whenever a court interprets a statute, determines what it means, that is what the statute has always mean... means, and... and that is what that statute will mean in the future until such time as the legislature amends it."
2005.05-83,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.622,2613.978,"Mr. Link, will you just... maybe I... I should know this, but the information charges an assault in the second degree using a deadly weapon."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2622.984,2629.738,"Well, that's an interesting twist under Washington law because deadly weapon is... is actually two elements of assault two."
2005.05-83,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.95,2655.02,The firearm enhancement itself would not covert it from second degree to first degree.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2655.02,2656.806,--No.
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2699.383,2701.835,You say regardless of the strength of the evidence.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2702.385,2716.76,I think this Court's jurisprudence on... on questions of... of lenity and interpreting jury verdicts would allow a jury to return a verdict that... that isn't necessarily supported by the evidence.
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2717.344,2720.129,"Well, the question is whether or not it requires it."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2720.129,2731.104,"--I don't think this Court requires that the jury... but I think what... what I'm trying to say, I guess, is that it requires... not requires."
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2749.898,2752.367,"Well, doesn't... isn't that true in Neder as well?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2752.367,2759.021,I think in Neder... Neder is a different case and for a number of reasons.
2005.05-83,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2785.504,2790.825,"You keep saying a lesser offense and a greater offense, but under Washington law, there's just one offense."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2793.694,2797.662,It's assault in the second degree with the additional deadly weapon enhancement.
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2797.662,2815.273,"And if we accept... going back to our earlier exchange, if we accept the proposition that charging that he used a handgun was sufficient to charge a firearm, then the charge against him was assault in the second degree with the maximum enhancement for use of a firearm."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2815.273,2817.559,"Again, had--"
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2817.559,2827.431,"You... you and I may disagree on... on how to read... how to understand firearm, but if you read it the way I just suggested, then the charge was assault two with the maximum enhancement."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2829.2,2841.925,"--I think if the information and... and the instructions were read in that manner, the State was wrong to concede that there was Blakely error here at all because, if as a matter of law, a handgun is automatically a firearm, there would have been no Blakely violation at all."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2843.96,2856.184,"Well, I thought the... I thought the reason they conceded the Blakely violation was that in the instructions to the jury, the instruction only went to deadly weapon and the instruction did not specifically refer to firearm."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2865.373,2871.194,I'm not sure I can answer right... I believe the instruction mentioned handgun.
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2871.877,2873.479,All right.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2876.931,2877.614,"--No, it did not."
2005.05-83,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2877.614,2878.864,That's... that's why they conceded a Blakely error.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2878.864,2886.47,"But again, if... if under Washington law, a handgun were automatically a firearm, the instruction wasn't erroneous at all."
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2886.47,2887.653,"Well, but the special verdict form still was."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2887.653,2892.54,But the instructions for use of the special verdict form would not have been.
2005.05-83,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2943.739,2948.793,May I just clarify one other thing?
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2951.662,2955.547,Capacity to fire does not mean per se operability.
2005.05-83,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2960.868,2963.97,An unloaded gun could be a firearm.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2963.97,2969.124,--An... an unloaded gun could be a firearm so long as it has the capacity to fire.
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2969.124,2983.966,"In the charging document, where it says that he was armed with a deadly weapon, to wit, a handgun, and then it cites the Washington statutes, those citations include the 3-year enhancement provision?"
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2983.966,2987.751,The... the citation to what is now--
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2987.751,2993.905,It cites RCW 9.994A.125 and 9.94A.310.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,2997.023,3000.225,--.310 is... is the definition of deadly weapon.
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3003.677,3005.963,9.94A.125.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,3005.963,3012.45,"--That includes both the firearm... the additional time for firearm enhancement, as well as the time for the deadly weapon enhancement."
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3012.45,3013.017,So it includes the 3 years.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,3013.017,3015.934,"It... it cites both, depending on what subsection it's citing."
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3020.972,3021.488,But it does include it.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,3021.488,3024.09,"It is in that... that statute, yes."
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3024.09,3029.411,And do you know if the information went to the jury in this case?
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,3029.411,3039.617,"As is consistent with Washington law, it's read to the jury at... at the outset, but it... it would be inconsistent, I think, with practice in Washington to have actually submitted the... the information to the jury."
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3094.687,3103.626,"Well, the other way of looking at it is it's based on trying to understand what the jury meant when it said deadly weapon when the only evidence of a deadly weapon they were presented was a firearm."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,3103.626,3133.229,"It assumes, I think, that... that the... it assumes the correctness of the judge's... of the trial court's assessment of the facts rather than simply accept the... the jury's verdict for what it was because, again, as a matter of Washington law, Mr. Recuenco could be found guilty of assault two with a deadly weapon even if he used what appeared to be a handgun, absent some proof of capacity."
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3154.142,3160.563,"And in Neder, even if the jury had been asked to rule on materiality, it could have decided not to rule according to the evidence."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,3164.181,3173.121,"--But... but, again, in Neder, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the offense that was litigated to it and based on the parties' understanding of what offense was at issue."
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3286.543,3291.531,"Well, I... I take it Washington wouldn't have the option... suppose that you prevail."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,3297.268,3312.711,"As it exists now and based on the Washington Supreme Court's decision in Hughes and Recuenco, those individuals sentenced before the Washington legislature amended the act would simply be entitled to have their cases remanded back for entry of a conviction based on the jury's verdict."
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3312.711,3321.567,"What I'm saying, you don't concede, do you, that Washington would have the option to retry him to try to obtain the 3-year enhancement."
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,3321.567,3321.933,I... I certainly don't.
2005.05-83,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3321.933,3322.767,I wouldn't think so.
2005.05-83,2,25663,gregory_c_link,,3322.767,3329.754,"And both as a matter of double jeopardy and as a matter of Washington law, I don't think that... that would... could occur."
2005.05-83,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3350.334,3352.536,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-83,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3355.738,3367.712,"Mr. Whisman, can I... can I ask you a hypothetical which I think puts in starker form what the... what your colleague here says this case involves?"
2005.05-83,3,33623,james_m_whisman,,3459.056,3462.341,I think the key difference is the charging part of your hypothetical.
2005.05-83,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3489.091,3497.347,"Well, suppose under Justice Scalia's hypothetical, aggravated murder is... is in the charging documents, but the judge doesn't say aggravated murder when he submits it to the jury."
2005.05-83,3,33623,james_m_whisman,,3497.347,3500.299,"--Then I think that is susceptible to harmless error analysis, Your Honor."
2005.05-83,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3508.904,3515.308,"But then we'd have Justice Scalia's case if this information left out the words, to wit, a handgun."
2005.05-83,3,33623,james_m_whisman,,3515.308,3520.796,"You would be closer to Justice Scalia's case, Justice Stevens, yes."
2005.05-83,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3533.704,3538.591,And those are the sort of considerations that can be taken into account under harmless error analysis.
2005.05-83,3,33623,james_m_whisman,,3544.495,3547.196,They can be a component of the harmless error analysis.
2005.05-83,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3598.462,3598.462,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-83,3,33623,james_m_whisman,,3598.462,3598.462,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.05-83,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3598.462,3602.462,The case is submitted.
