1956.426,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,17.09,"Number 426, Jesse Blackburn, Petitioner, versus the State of Alabama."
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,18.186,20.354,"Yes, sir."
1956.426,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,802.064,804.2,Did the jury pass on that issue?
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,804.2,810.98,The jury passed on the question of whether he was insane at the time the offense was committed.
1956.426,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,851.829,858.793,He -- he was then directly considered by the appropriate bodies under the Alabama law?
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,858.793,860.336,"Yes, sir."
1956.426,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,936.33,940.25,"Mr. Hobbs, I probably missed it."
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,946.5,946.615,"Yes, sir."
1956.426,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,946.615,948.923,"-- on the trial, what period?"
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,948.923,952.359,"Oh, better than four years, merely five years."
1956.426,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,952.359,954.714,He didn't come to trial for five years after the confession?
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,954.714,956.089,"That's correct, sir, because --"
1956.426,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,956.089,957.302,"I -- yes, I understand."
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,957.302,957.518,In that --
1956.426,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,957.518,963.065,"But at the trial -- at the trial the claim of insanity was -- was stressed, held first."
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,963.065,963.821,I beg your pardon?
1956.426,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,963.821,976.807,"Was the -- was it claimed at the trial that he was insane, not when he made the -- when he gave the so-called confession, but at the trial, was he -- was it claimed that he was too insane at the time to stand trial?"
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,976.807,977.309,"No, sir."
1956.426,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,977.309,978.583,Okay.
1956.426,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,978.583,991.018,"Mr. Hobbs, at the hearing before the judge on the issue of inadmissibility of the confessions by reason of insanity when taken, what testimony was it?"
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,991.018,1000.259,"There was the testimony of the three doctors, their depositions, the members of sanity commission and --"
1956.426,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1000.259,1003.522,They are the ones who made the finding that he was in fact insane --
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,1003.522,1004.44,"Yes, sir."
1956.426,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1004.44,1005.404,-- when the question was taken?
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,1005.404,1005.964,"Yes, sir."
1956.426,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1026.285,1028.699,"Now, what testimony was, therefore, that reputes that?"
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,1028.699,1029.381,"Yes, sir."
1956.426,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1054.956,1060.223,"Now, under your practice did the judge then have to make a finding of fact?"
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,1060.223,1066.045,"The Supreme Court of Alabama says that at that point, the judge must pronounce whether the confession was voluntary."
1956.426,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1066.045,1075.574,"Well, on the issue inadmissible by reason of insanity at the time, does the judge make a finding of fact?"
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,1075.574,1077.095,You mean at the time of the confession?
1956.426,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1077.095,1082.154,"Yes, when it's offered, does he say that I find as a fact he was sane when it was taken or something?"
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,1082.154,1086.78,I don't know whether -- whether it could be classified as finding of fact that he was sane.
1956.426,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1122.501,1125.137,"Well, this is not important and I'm just curious."
1956.426,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,1128.705,1137.405,"I'm -- I'm pretty sure that's correct, Judge Hill."
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,2703.886,2711.261,Honorable Chief Justice and if the Court please.
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3262.506,3266.746,"Mr. Gish, was -- was Dr. Richards the third doctor?"
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,3267.619,3268.211,Yes.
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3268.211,3274.964,-- the doctor that the State relied on for his deposition?
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,3274.964,3275.621,Yes --
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3275.621,3275.868,That's the one --
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,3275.868,3285.435,"You -- you -- right now, I believe that all three depositions were instituted by the defendant."
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3285.435,3286.634,"Oh, I --"
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,3286.634,3292.826,And available for cross-interrogatories by the States.
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3292.826,3293.371,Yes.
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,3293.371,3301.022,"But when they came to trial, the defendant didn't see fit to introduce in evidence --"
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3301.022,3301.772,I see.
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,3301.772,3306.017,-- decisions of Dr. Richards.
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3332.46,3333.174,Yes.
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,3444.056,3448.097,"It would seem so, Your Honor, from that answer."
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3988.622,3989.82,234 (Voice Overlap) --
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,3989.82,3991.31,Yes.
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4377.887,4382.523,"Mr. Gish, may I ask you this question."
1956.426,1,37920,paul_t_gish_jr,,4392.007,4408.645,I would have to answer substantially like Mr. Hobbs did by stating that the trial judge submitted it in his instructions to the jury.
1956.426,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5221.953,5225.227,"Mr. Hobbs, do you have rebuttal?"
1956.426,2,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,5225.227,5226.467,Thank you.
1956.426,2,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,5281.499,5288.217,"The only judicial determination that ever was made was made for the trial court, the trial court and the jury."
1956.426,2,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,5288.217,5288.463,Yes.
1956.426,2,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,5288.463,5289.389,They're the only be one.
1956.426,2,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,5289.389,5292.506,That's the only time he's ever been found sane.
1956.426,2,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,5292.506,5298.603,"And that's only -- only judicial (Inaudible) there was, there's no judicial determination because (Inaudible)"
1956.426,2,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,5298.603,5307.611,I suppose -- I don't know that there was a finding of the sanity commission whether there'd be an adjudication or not.
