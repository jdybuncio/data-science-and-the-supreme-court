1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1004.754,1006.576,Not to my knowledge Justice Brennan.
1961.493,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1048.685,1056.891,"What was the basis -- that was the basis below that there was no employee relationship, there's been no finding in this case?"
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1056.891,1058.071,There has been such a finding.
1961.493,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1058.071,1059.974,And that there was no employee relationship.
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1059.974,1061.07,That's correct sir.
1961.493,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1061.07,1067.956,"And on that premise, the Government still insists that believe by way of injunction is not available."

1961.493,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1071.094,1108.5,"-- I understood that the respondents said they were taken by surprise in this matter that they -- that the administrative practice was contrary to this regulation that you mentioned and that they -- they had never been required to pay this tax until after their -- after the antitrust suit against the -- against the seamen and as if wondering why that was the practice since 1940 that they only knew about it, at that late date."
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1108.5,1121.006,"Mr. Chief Justice, I -- it's -- it is conceivable -- quite conceivable to me that this taxpayer as a matter of fact hadn't thought he owed the tax or had -- it hadn't occurred to him that he owed tax."
1961.493,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1145.444,1169.096,"Well, I -- I -- I thought also that the position of the parties is reversed in this case that in the antitrust case, I understood that they claim they were employees and therefore they were not violating antitrust and the Government contended that they were -- that they were not and now the situation is exactly reversed."
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1169.096,1179.612,"Mr. Chief Justice, in the antitrust case, the -- the defendant was a -- a -- really an -- an association of --"
1961.493,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1179.612,1179.724,Yes.
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1179.724,1181.084,-- of fisherman sort of the labor union.
1961.493,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1181.084,1181.765,Yes.
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1181.765,1192.476,And they asserted a defense that the antitrust action couldn't lie because of the Norris-LaGuardia provisions or because there was a -- because it was a labor dispute.
1961.493,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1529.341,1534.123,"What was the legislative history show since that decision, the Margarine decision?"
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1534.123,1535.327,The --
1961.493,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1535.327,1539.069,Have the reports throw any light upon it?
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1539.069,1539.666,No sir and --
1961.493,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1539.666,1542.093,I noticed that the wording isn't quite the same (Voice Overlap) --
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1542.093,1548.503,The -- the wording -- the changes in the wording don't -- don't mean anything to us.
1961.493,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1548.503,1549.581,"No, very irrelevant to this problem."
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1549.581,1550.069,Yes sir.
1961.493,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1550.069,1552.58,But they came in since the --
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1552.58,1553.527,No sudden changes.
1961.493,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1553.527,1553.539,Yes.
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1553.539,1566.854,"But the Congress is certainly -- if you wanted to say it, you could -- if -- if you could say that the Congress has embraced the -- the Nut Margarine rule by reenacting the Internal Revenue Code over these years."
1961.493,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1588.126,1610.447,"Mr. Oberdorfer, before I forget it and because it isn't in your brief, I wonder if you would submit a short memorandum concerning this -- this regulation that you have mentioned, 387 and -- and also the administrative practice under it and counsel you may reply to it of course."
1961.493,0,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,1610.447,1615.629,Thank you Your Honor.
1961.493,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1615.629,1617.367,Mr. Morse.
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1617.367,1625.758,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1961.493,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1681.277,1684.529,"If we accept that fact, is that all there is to the case (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1684.529,1692.794,No sir that is not because I'll proceed to the next point and that is an equitable consideration which was considered by the Court in the Miller case.
1961.493,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1769.481,1770.397,As I understood --
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1770.397,1770.436,Sir?
1961.493,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1770.436,1778.477,"-- Mr. Oberdorfer have suggested that perhaps the Flora rule would not apply to this kind of facts, maybe something less than --"
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1778.477,1783.305,"Well, I say and we discuss in our brief this Flora case, this footnote."
1961.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1862.33,1863.985,Didn't he initiate (Inaudible).
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1863.985,1864.811,"No, sir."
1961.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1864.811,1867.173,I thought you did a moment ago.
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1867.173,1871.018,"Sir, I'm speaking -- I thought you -- of the trial as it proceeded."
1961.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1880.324,1887.711,And do you take what Mr. Oberdorfer said a few minutes ago as the indication at least that you could pay a quarter and --
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1887.711,1893.675,"Well, I take it sir that Mr. Oberdorfer and I recall his statement on that."
1961.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1910.434,1912.966,Is there a -- has the company paid any of the tax?
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1912.966,1913.443,Sir?
1961.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1913.443,1914.43,You haven't paid any of the tax?
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1914.43,1915.987,"No, sir, the tax has not been paid."
1961.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1917.32,1923.646,"You're in the same position when we started except the crew since that time, is that right?"
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,1923.646,1924.642,"That's right, sir."
1961.493,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2058.59,2059.891,You were not a party to the --
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,2059.891,2060.074,Sir?
1961.493,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2060.074,2060.853,-- antitrust suit?
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,2060.853,2061.965,"No, sir, that, we were not."
1961.493,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2063.9,2064.382,Yes.
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,2064.382,2074.013,"However, as I point out in our brief, the president of the respondent here was called as a witness to testify before the grand jury which ultimately indicted the union."
1961.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2074.013,2074.955,What year is that?
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,2074.955,2075.445,Sir?
1961.493,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2075.445,2077.176,What year is the antitrust?
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,2077.176,2082.175,"The antitrust case, as I recall, occurred about 1953."
1961.493,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2220.793,2227.824,There was the added factor in -- in the Nut Margarine case was there not?
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,2231.487,2235.151,"That is true, the Government had loss."
1961.493,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2613.211,2613.65,Mr. Morse.
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,2613.65,2615.111,Yes sir.
1961.493,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2615.111,2645.009,Wouldn't it be a rather late restriction on 7421 (a) that -- that any taxpayer could go into Court to merely claim that this tax was illegally assessed and that it would bankrupt him if he had -- had to pay it and then be entitled to a preliminary injunction to prevent the commissioner from collecting it?
1961.493,1,25733,george_e_morse,,2645.009,2654.399,"I think it -- I agree with the Court that it would and it has been attempted many times and in some cases, particularly social security case -- cases."
1961.493,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2732.341,2734.517,Very well.
1961.493,2,34918,louis_f_oberdorfer,,2736.221,2739.516,I have nothing more Your Honor unless there are questions.
