2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.357,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1680, City News and Novelty, Inc. v. the City of Waukesha."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,10.098,13.18,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,40.018,40.358,Mr. Olson--
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,40.358,40.929,Yes.
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,40.929,43.52,--is this a speech licensing scheme?
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,43.52,50.155,It is a speech licensing scheme because it requires a license to operate an adult book store.
2000.99-1680,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,50.155,64.664,"But it's different than Freedman, in the sense that Freedman was expressly designed to permit or not permit speech based solely on its content."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,64.664,65.815,You're correct.
2000.99-1680,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,65.815,69.268,And it seems to me this is not that at all.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,76.153,98.72,"You're right that the Waukesha ordinance doesn't permit licensing decisions on its face to be made on the basis of content, but the Court I believe has recognized in City of Lakewood and in FW/PBS that licensing decisions that are not expressly content based can still be used for covert content based censorship."
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,98.72,111.736,"Are you claiming that any of the reasons that were given... this is a case of a license that was in existence, and it was... it's a nonrenewal case, right?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,111.736,112.197,Yes.
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,112.197,121.014,"And the nonrenewal was based on violation, alleged violation of the terms of the license."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,130.419,132.253,Not in this case.
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,147.333,162.941,"I suppose a book store, or a newspaper has to... they're in a building, and I guess they can't have holes in the floors and unsafe electricity and maybe they wouldn't be able to run a business if they did."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,171.398,180.404,"Oh, all of those laws of general application that don't act as prior restraints targeted at speech can be enforced."
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,180.404,186.369,How are the violations here targeted at speech?
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,197.188,207.393,"They're targeted at speech in the sense that they're tied to the license, and they're tied to the permission to continue your ongoing speech."
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,207.393,218.141,"Well, so you have a book store, and it says you can have a license to sell a book store, open your book store provided there isn't electricity running all over the floor and electrocuting people."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,218.141,219.241,Those--
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,219.241,223.014,Is that then subject to some special test because it's a book store?
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,223.014,232.35,"--If the requirement to have the electricity only applies to book stores, yes, it would be subject to the Freedman guarantees."
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.935,262.892,"How do you get that from Freedman, because Freedman, the status quo was no speech."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,280.674,281.135,That's--
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.135,290.859,"--So you're asking for, the continued speech is the status quo, as distinguished from Freedman, where no speech was the status quo."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,290.859,292.041,--That's absolutely correct.
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,331.066,338.171,"That was another Freedman type case, wasn't it, where the performance could not go on under the existence."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,338.171,361.196,"It was a new speech case, that's correct, but I believe the Court found that the status quo was altered to the applicant's detriment because the show in the presentation of Hair in Southeastern Promotions had to be postponed and they lost their date for the presentation."
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,379.699,382.601,Do you really... is that really your principle?
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,414.261,423.347,"--We believe that's what Southeastern Promotions requires, and we believe that's the only way to prevent injury from lack of prompt judicial review."
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,423.347,425.871,But then if that's the case it's nothing to do with the promptness of judicial review.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,432.036,467.509,"It's right that that's the rule we're urging the Court to find in Southeastern Promotions and FW/PBS and apply in this case, but it's wrong to say that it has nothing to do with the promptness of judicial review, I think, because the question on which the Court granted certiorari is does the licensing ordinance have to contain language to prevent injury from want of prompt judicial review, and the only way to prevent injury from want of prompt judicial review when you're enacting city licensing ordinance is to maintain the status quo, guarantee the status quo--"
2000.99-1680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.509,468.901,But that can be done by the court.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,510.047,513.86,"--Justice Scalia, it's not sufficient for five reasons."
2000.99-1680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.927,526.499,"Not if it's constitutionally required, as you tell us."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,537.495,541.278,"--Well, that really depends on what this Court says in this case."
2000.99-1680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.853,569.438,It would also mean that you've brought this case before you have any reason to believe you've been harmed.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,569.438,573.121,No.
2000.99-1680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.121,576.861,"I mean, why should we pronounce that advisory opinion?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,587.46,601.271,"I don't think that a stay order, the possibility of a stay order in the circuit court is an adequate substitute for Freedman safeguards, including maintenance of the status quo as written into the ordinance."
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.271,605.683,"Well, the supreme court of Wisconsin held... was it the supreme court, or the court of appeals?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,605.683,606.354,Court of appeals.
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,606.354,612.167,"The court of appeals held that what you're asking for was not required here, didn't it?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,612.167,629.929,"The court of appeals believed that the status quo would be maintained through the administrative proceedings automatically, and the court of appeals held that it wasn't necessary to maintain the status quo through the termination of judicial proceedings."
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,629.929,637.124,"So under that holding, if you went into the Circuit Court of Waukesha County you might get a stay and you might not."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,637.124,646.551,"Well, we wouldn't have much of a claim on a stay today except by making the arguments from Freedman and Southeastern Promotions that we're making here today."
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,646.551,653.844,"Well, couldn't you argue that the administrative determination by the city was arbitrary or capricious?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,658.787,659.719,We could.
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.147,679.213,"Your position basically is, even though your claim substantively has no merit, you're still entitled to an automatic stay."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,679.213,701.246,"I don't even get to whether we're entitled to an automatic stay in my thinking, because I don't think that the possibility of a stay being imposed in a discretionary manner in the circuit court is sufficient to satisfy Southeastern Promotions, Freedman, FW/PBS."
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,701.246,706.789,It is sufficient if they decide your case... if the circuit... you have some claim on the merits.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,710.432,712.743,Or some provision is unconstitutional.
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.743,717.397,"Yes, all right, you say this, we have a claim on the merits, and you say, judge, decide it."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,730.426,735.109,"In an as applied challenge that would be correct, but this is a facial challenge."
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,735.109,737.41,"No, but I'm not saying about this case."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,744.244,746.067,"If that were always true, then--"
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,746.067,747.377,"No problem, all right."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,747.377,749.268,--the court wouldn't have to worry about a specific guarantee--
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.268,766.071,"Fine, then why aren't you better off, not worse off, if the court decides a stay before you have to shut down, for after all, a court will give you the stay as long as there's a reasonable probability of success, but the court will allow you to stay open on the merits only if you're right."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,766.071,774.065,--Getting that stay does require us to show a reasonable probability of success on the merits.
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,774.065,779.578,"But to win, you have to win, so you're easier... it's easier for you to get the stay than it is to win."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,779.578,783.561,"Not... not really, in terms of timing especially."
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,794.979,817.164,"This case has an air of unreality to it, because in fact your client did get a stay until the end of the judicial road without making a showing of probability of success on the merits and, in fact, the entire case has been now adjudicated on the merits, is that not so?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,817.164,820.376,"That's correct, and we have no as applied challenge here."
2000.99-1680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.467,829.761,"But isn't it also have an air of unreality because your client is not in business any more and doesn't intend to go back into business, as I understand the proceedings."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,829.761,842.869,"Our client is still just barely in business operating as a nonadult store, and intending to close even that operation within a matter of days, but as we pointed out in our brief--"
2000.99-1680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.869,843.54,Why isn't the case moot?
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,843.54,857.441,"--The case isn't moot because there's a disability from licensure that flows from having violated the ordinance by operating without a license, which I told them they were entitled to do under Shuttlesworth, because--"
2000.99-1680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.441,862.103,"But there's a disability for licensure for a business he has no intention of engaging in, as I understand it."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,862.103,878.652,"--Well, there's no showing that they intend to engage in this business, or that they have not applied for a new license and they don't have an application pending now, but they haven't foresworn any intention to apply for a license at some other location in the future."
2000.99-1680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.652,884.726,I have the impression... I may be unfair to you... that you may be representing interests other than the named party to the case here.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,884.726,899.558,"Not... my client has a real, concrete interest in having a facially valid, constitutional ordinance on the book in Waukesha."
2000.99-1680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.98,907.892,Sufficient interest to finance extensive litigation in the United States Supreme Court.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,911.084,911.665,--Yes.
2000.99-1680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.046,961.157,"That disability has nothing... I mean, that disability has something to do with a defect in the system that might have produced a merits decision that was contrary to the facts, or contrary to the law, but I don't see how that disability has anything to do with the question of timing that you're now bringing before us."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,997.141,1001.485,"Justice Scalia, they do in the following sense."
2000.99-1680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.037,1028.492,But you're not saying that the whole judicial review mechanism is invalid in the sense that it has produced an unjust or incorrect substantive decision.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1065.237,1073.775,"My client was allowed to continue, but my client was entitled to have that guaranteed on the face of the ordinance, and we contend that the--"
2000.99-1680,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.775,1074.244,Well--
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1074.244,1094.578,"--There is a... there was a... I forgot what the title of the case was, but a decision of this Court explaining that if you were entitled to something as a matter of constitutional right, due process, like notice, it doesn't matter that the notice provision isn't in the law itself, as long as the court insists on it."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1100.613,1101.521,--That's right.
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.287,1132.723,"Well, do you have... all we know is in your case you were allowed to remain in operation until the end of the line."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1137.064,1145.702,"--Well, as far as I know, this is the only establishment ever to be licensed in Waukesha as an adult book store."
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.981,1166.583,"So you're saying in another case someone else might suffer the violation of a constitutional right, but certainly that has not been your experience, and I don't know why we shouldn't assume that other cases would proceed in this same pattern and not in some other pattern."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1166.583,1177.212,--The Court has held in more than one case that license applicants are entitled more to the hope of the grace... to more than the hope of the grace of the Government.
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.358,1210.404,"Mr. Olson, does the fact that you're making a facial constitutional challenge here in your view make any difference on the question of mootness or ripeness?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1210.404,1211.736,"--Yes, I think it does."
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1250.181,1251.874,"Maybe, is it standing?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1258.636,1258.977,Yes.
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1258.977,1262.79,"And as far as your client is concerned, X never happened to him."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1262.79,1263.331,Correct.
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.331,1268.544,"As far as your client was concerned, it's now been determined that he violated the statute on the merits."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1268.544,1268.954,Correct.
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.954,1274.467,"And your client says, I'm out of business anyway, I've made an agreement not to try to get back into it."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1282.702,1285.364,Well--
2000.99-1680,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1285.364,1286.796,You've looked into this more thoroughly.
2000.99-1680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.796,1288.529,Can I add one fact before you answer Justice Breyer?
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1288.529,1288.719,--Sure.
2000.99-1680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.719,1308.02,"Generally the purpose of the facial challenge is to protect third parties who may not be before the court, but here, is it not a fact that the third parties are largely, maybe not entirely protected by the amendment to the ordinance, from the very danger that you're seeking... the very principle you're seeking to vindicate?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1308.02,1312.043,The third parties are protected from a couple of the original problems.
2000.99-1680,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1333.579,1341.984,"But those third parties will be in exactly the position that your client has been in during the course of this litigation, isn't that correct?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1391.015,1391.365,I--
2000.99-1680,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1391.365,1401.262,So I'm wondering whether you're really in a situation in which our cases recognize your right to raise a third party right where you're in the same boat with them.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1401.262,1408.458,--I think your cases prevent you from assuming that we are in the same boat with them.
2000.99-1680,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1416.612,1419.875,"Well, why aren't you in the same boat with them?"
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1419.875,1420.366,--Because--
2000.99-1680,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1420.366,1423.237,You say our cases prevent me from making that assumption.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1424.128,1430.843,--We got the grace of the Government and a special dispensation to be allowed to remain open.
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1436.439,1461.734,"There's also, usually a champion comes forward and says, other people are going to be chilled, but in this case not only aren't others chilled from getting into this business, but you're being edged out not because of any ordinance, but because a bigger player has taken over and there's not... and has squeezed you out of the market."
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1461.734,1463.874,--Maybe not totally out of the market.
2000.99-1680,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1467.278,1471.341,But they are perfectly adequate champion of themselves.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1492.586,1524.216,"Setting that particular organization aside and looking at future operations that might be deciding whether or not to locate in Waukesha, I don't think it's beyond the stretch of the imagination to suggest that they might decide to go elsewhere if this Court decides that Waukesha's ordinance is just fine and you can be nonrenewed administratively for popcorn on the floor, and you have to close until you get a judicial decision on the merits that that's an unconstitutional criterion."
2000.99-1680,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1524.216,1527.859,Maybe we have been misconstruing your argument.
2000.99-1680,0,32246,jeff_s_olson,,1557.779,1568.625,"We do contend that, and we do contend that at least on remand the nonrenewal order will have to be vacated because it was issued pursuant to an unconstitutional licensing scheme."
2000.99-1680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.148,1573.039,"Very well, Mr. Olson."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1574.812,1585.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1680,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1660.188,1730.333,"Well, if we accept your statement of the question, I think it's perhaps an easier case than I believe they mean to bring, because I think part of their point is that even under a scheme which is justified on the secondary effects analysis, so it's not content based in the classic sense, even under that scheme, there is still going to be a content restriction on speech if this establishment is shut down, and that is true simply because the nature of the establishment is rather content specific, so you're going to have a content... you're going to have an effect which is correlated to content, so that's why I wonder if it's fair for you to say that the ordinance does not have the effect, in addition to not having the purpose of a content restriction, because I think they're saying it does have the effect of a content restriction, and that's why you ought to have some safeguards."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1730.333,1749.467,"In answering your question, Justice Souter, this Court said in the seminal cases, in the first and the plurality of American Mini Theatres, and in Renton, that these types of establishments, adult establishments do have a effect on the surrounding environments."
2000.99-1680,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1760.162,1760.623,No question.
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1760.623,1771.221,"--As long as your regulations are justified without regard to the content of what they sell, in this case what they sell or rent, that is content neutral."
2000.99-1680,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1771.632,1817.593,"It is content neutral for certain purposes, but he is saying that there ought to be some procedural safeguard that recognizes the fact that even these so called content neutral limitations based on secondary effects do have an effect on speech, and that effect is at least very closely correlated with content, and he's saying that for that reason, even though you can regulate it... that's not being contested, is it, as a broad proposition... even though you can regulate it, there ought to be some limits on your regulation because of the damage that you can do and do on a content basis, in effect."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1817.593,1820.387,--And I think that is clear.
2000.99-1680,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1861.103,1867.919,"But I think, and I don't want to cut you off, but I think what you're saying... and this may be fine, but I want to make sure I understand it."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1876.154,1879.336,I think what we're going to find here is certainly--
2000.99-1680,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1879.336,1880.704,But isn't that your position?
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1880.704,1885.358,--There will be what we consider an incidental burden on content.
2000.99-1680,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1929.187,1930.82,We accept that and he accepts that.
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1939.064,1939.794,And I--
2000.99-1680,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1939.794,1941.456,--and therefore why is it a burden?
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1949.93,1951.603,--We would agree with that.
2000.99-1680,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1962.539,1964.34,But do you agree that it's required?
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1964.34,1964.801,Absolutely.
2000.99-1680,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1964.801,1973.196,"Well then, what's the difference between an administrative delay, which you concede the Constitution prohibits, and a judicial delay?"
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,1973.196,1999.863,"The big difference is this, and I think there were six justices in FW/PBS v. Dallas that recognized the distinction between content based censorship schemes and the Freedman analysis, which was... required these safeguards to obviate the dangers of a censorship system, and those licensing ordinance that do not pass judgment on the content of any commutative material."
2000.99-1680,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1999.863,2016.386,"But what sense would it make for the Court to have strict rules about administrative expedition but not judicial, other than what Justice... the line of questions Justice Scalia was indicating, that there is authority to issue a stay?"
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2017.798,2036.031,"The reason is, is the requirement for a guarantee of a prompt judicial determination in Freedman is because the licensing scheme in Maryland was passing a determination on the content of what is obscenity."
2000.99-1680,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2081.159,2120.854,"Mr. Meitz, if some kind of provision for prompt administrative review is required in these license revocation cases, do you think this Court has ever decided whether the ensuing judicial review, whether it has to provide for a prompt decision or just prompt access to the courts, to courts having a power to maintain the status quo if the appropriate showing is made."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2120.854,2121.876,We believe that--
2000.99-1680,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2121.876,2129.643,Is there a difference between access and final decision and what do you think our cases hold in that--
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2129.643,2145.561,"--For matters involving censorship or content based situations, it's clear from Freedman and its progeny, Southeastern, that a prompt judicial, guarantee of a prompt judicial determination is necessary to minimize the risk, and the--"
2000.99-1680,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.561,2148.065,--You mean final determination?
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2148.065,2148.435,--Yes.
2000.99-1680,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2148.435,2150.125,As opposed to access?
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2150.125,2150.816,Yes.
2000.99-1680,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2178.505,2180.716,"Well, I'm not clear on what you think is necessary."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2191.264,2213.359,"Prompt access, Justice O'Connor, because we believe that the purpose, the reason for a prompt judicial determination to eliminate that discouraging effect on the individual film exhibitor to go into court and the expertise, which only the judiciary has, that is not applicable."
2000.99-1680,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2213.359,2215.282,But it seems to me it would go the other way around.
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2229.07,2234.405,Not with regard to matters that are not content based.
2000.99-1680,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2259.811,2262.693,I go back to my earlier question.
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2277.482,2293.755,"--The reason it would not be required, you have to look at the underlying rationale of Freedman and why Freedman required a prompt judicial determination, because of specifically what the Court said... filed like, the 37 photographs."
2000.99-1680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.27,2314.388,"Well, isn't there something, too, to the idea that when you get into court, you're dealing with a neutral tribunal, whereas perhaps the administrative tribunal might be thought not to be neutral."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2314.388,2323.164,"This is true, and I think as you pointed out earlier the deferential standard of review exists virtually in every State that I'm aware of."
2000.99-1680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2334.219,2345.927,"Mr. Meitz, would you be making this same argument if what was at issue here was not a statute directed at adult book stores but a statute directed at, let's say, radio stations?"
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2388.416,2391.168,If you're obviously not trying to--
2000.99-1680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.168,2393.038,I am worried--
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2393.038,2394.881,"--control the content, but if it's like you said--"
2000.99-1680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2394.881,2395.311,--That's right.
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2395.311,2403.807,"--rats, or whatever, I would say, absolutely, because if you... you have an interest in maintaining the sanitation and health of the community--"
2000.99-1680,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2403.807,2404.318,Yes.
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2404.318,2414.242,"--and if there happened to be a licensing scheme that allowed them to be shut down, I think the municipality would have a real substantial interest in controlling, and as part of its public--"
2000.99-1680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.242,2424.66,"A court would want to inquire into why only radio stations were prohibited from having rats in them, as opposed to every other kind of business, I suppose."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2424.66,2432.185,"--I would agree with that, but I think, again I bring the Court back to the seminal cases of American Mini Theatres and Renton."
2000.99-1680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.685,2450.016,Those cases just dealt with the location of the business.
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2453.83,2488.594,"--Renton and Mini Theatres was a licensing, albeit you're correct, Justice Stevens, it did involve the zoning, but I think there have been other cases since then, and I'll use... although not in the adult book scheme, but I will mention Ward v. Rock Against Racism, where there was a clear burden, or incidental burden placed upon speech from the standpoint of how loud the music could be in Central Park, and the interests of the municipality being, you know, the neighbors around Central Park had the right to quiet enjoyment--"
2000.99-1680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.594,2491.773,"But again, that didn't have anything to do with the timing of the decision, as I remember it, did it?"
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2491.773,2499.269,"--Well, the Court there analyzed that as intermediate scrutiny, time, place, and manner restriction."
2000.99-1680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2499.269,2507.424,"I'd just like to get quickly your... what's the procedural doctrine that... is... look, they're complaining about X."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2519.541,2521.883,I'm not sure if I understand the question.
2000.99-1680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2521.883,2524.186,"Well, you don't think they ought to be here making this argument."
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2526.768,2527.196,Yes.
2000.99-1680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2527.196,2528.448,--Remember what I just went through with him?
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2528.448,2528.749,Yes.
2000.99-1680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2528.749,2533.484,"I want to know, what's the procedural doctrine that says we can't get to the merits of this?"
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2533.484,2547.343,"I... the reason we brought this issue to the Court's attention, and for the very limited, unique situation, was the issue upon which you granted review, and that is whether you require a prompt judicial determination."
2000.99-1680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2558.618,2560.331,I just want the name of the doctrine.
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2565.113,2576.801,"--I would cite Asarco from the standpoint at least that you have to have some kind of likelihood of redress that's available from this Court, and it's very speculative at this point in time."
2000.99-1680,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2576.801,2580.134,--But you called it moot.
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2601.55,2614.588,"Only since the Court granted this petition for review, we felt it was our obligation to bring it to your attention because of the limited issue upon which you granted the review, not because we amended the ordinance."
2000.99-1680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2614.588,2619.121,"Well, is the... is this any more moot than Pap's and Erie was moot?"
2000.99-1680,1,19580,curt_meitz,,2619.121,2635.261,"I think it's distinguished from Pap's, because one, as the Court stated in Pap's, they were... this is clearly not an attempt by us... they arrived at a favorable decision from the lower court, number 1."
2000.99-1680,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2644.958,2648.911,"The difference seemed to me to be, in Pap's it's solely a question of mootness."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2792.196,2809.847,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1680,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2820.764,2824.647,"You mean access to review, as opposed to decision making?"
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2824.647,2825.308,Yes.
2000.99-1680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2841.928,2846.783,"Mr. Feldman, are those cases involving renewals, or initial issuance of licenses?"
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2846.783,2851.695,I think all of the... at least all of the court of appeals decisions I think were initial licenses.
2000.99-1680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.695,2855.378,Do you think the considerations are the same in the two situations?
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2855.378,2856.209,"Yes, I do."
2000.99-1680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2882.568,2891.214,"Of course, the status quo is entirely different, because in one case the status quo is that the First Amendment materials are being sold, and in the other they're not in... they're not being sold."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2891.214,2891.882,I think that's true.
2000.99-1680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.545,2896.066,Yes.
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2896.066,2912.268,"From the standpoint of the First Amendment, the Court's references in Freedman and the other cases to maintaining the status quo was... in the context of those cases what that meant is, there can be a period of time during which the expression doesn't occur, and I think that's the same principle that applies here."
2000.99-1680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2951.913,2960.741,So you think the availability of temporary relief on a substantial showing is a necessary component of the review?
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2960.741,2970.546,"It's not directly presented here, because that is available under this statute, but yes, I think it's probably... if you had a scheme... and they are unusual, but I think they may exist here and there."
2000.99-1680,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2979.391,2989.369,"Mr. Feldman, does the Government have a position on mootness, or whatever you want to call it, or the justiciability of this case at this time in its current posture?"
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2989.369,2996.685,"--I think it's our position that essentially for the reasons given by the petitioner, that, although it might be a close question, the case is probably not moot."
2000.99-1680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3000.479,3004.961,Why do these adult book store owners keep going out of business and not intending to get back in?
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3011.264,3014.066,I'm really not aware of the economics that lead to that.
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3014.066,3024.895,"But how does he have the right to raise the claims of people who are not here whom would be affected by this procedural provision, when he himself is not affected by it?"
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3024.895,3039.023,"I think that his... I think his basic claim is this, is this procedure that the city's put into effect, this licensing procedure, is unconstitutional, and therefore I don't really even need a license, or if I need a license, I ought to be able to get one immediately."
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3040.643,3043.846,He's saying the whole thing is unconstitutional because--
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3043.846,3044.046,--Right.
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3044.046,3051.121,"--it doesn't have sufficiently quick judicial review, which he himself wouldn't have been affected by."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3051.121,3056.235,"That's right, but I... the fact that in this particular case he wouldn't have been affected by it--"
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3056.235,3064.813,Can you think of another case where it was that distant and somebody was allowed to raise somebody's First Amendment rights when the other people were perfectly able to raise it themselves?
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3064.813,3083.643,"--Well, I think the FW/PBS case, for example, or in the Lakewood case, I think in a couple of those cases you've had people who say, that there are these... that there are First Amendment procedural safeguards that are required, and the party is able to go into court and say, his claim is that the scheme is unconstitutional."
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3085.205,3085.754,Even though it doesn't affect them at all.
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3087.637,3088.478,--They're not affected in this case.
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3095.071,3101.425,"--Well, if the theory is if he goes for renewal again and he's not going back into the business, it's a little far fetched, isn't it?"
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3101.425,3101.826,--Right.
2000.99-1680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3102.837,3113.205,"Well, I take it that the classic Thornhill doctrine, where I'm allowed to raise somebody else's rights, is because it's a content based statute, and this is not content based."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3113.205,3130.716,"That's right, and I think that's the crucial... this is not contents based, it's true, but although in the FW/PBS case, which was identical to this in terms of whether it was content based, the Court said the party could also raise these procedural interests, First Amendment interests, could make a challenge to the constitutionality of that scheme."
2000.99-1680,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3153.271,3159.595,"Can you explain to me why the administrator must act promptly, but the judiciary does not?"
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3159.595,3160.836,"Yes, I hope so."
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3208.278,3208.638,I thought--
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3208.638,3210.279,--is constitutionally protected.
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3210.279,3223.127,"--Am I wrong, I was thinking, look, normally where your courts are at stake a preliminary injunction is good enough, but that isn't good enough where it's the administrator, because the administrator might not be as fair."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3223.127,3226.971,I'm not sure I understand the question.
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3226.971,3233.365,"Well, the reason that you have to protect them more about... against the administrator than a judge is, you think, well, the judge will be fair."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3237.887,3239.209,That's correct.
2000.99-1680,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3239.209,3244.832,"But you have to be tougher than that on administrators, because they're already taken a side and they're not judicial and so forth."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3244.832,3245.172,That's correct.
2000.99-1680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3268.367,3269.809,"Excuse me, until it gets to the court?"
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3280.888,3281.429,--No.
2000.99-1680,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3306.424,3313.55,"Why wouldn't a stay by the judge, if the judge thought there was any question about it, why wouldn't that have sufficed in that context as well?"
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3313.55,3316.252,"--That would, but I think you could look at the Freedman decision--"
2000.99-1680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3316.252,3317.741,"Yes, but that would be changing the status quo."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3317.741,3318.862,--Excuse me.
2000.99-1680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3318.862,3320.102,That would be changing the status quo.
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3322.325,3330.651,"The stay, in my view, in our view those are really procedural due process issues and not First Amendment issues, but I think that would be sufficient."
2000.99-1680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3346.28,3352.664,"Yes, but the stay in the case involving an initial issue, a stay would be a mandate to grant the license, rather than a stay to maintain the status quo."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3352.664,3353.755,That's correct.
2000.99-1680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3353.755,3356.306,"So it's really not a stay, it's more of a mandamus."
2000.99-1680,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3356.306,3358.379,"That's correct, but I... that's correct."
2000.99-1680,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3412.145,3413.335,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2000.99-1680,3,32246,jeff_s_olson,,3415.835,3416.506,Thank you.
2000.99-1680,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3490.935,3517.823,"Then I don't understand why the proper answer isn't, because there is this danger, the court will look at it case by case and if, indeed, this is a situation where the administrator is abusing authority to disguise what is really content based regulation, the court can say in that situation, we put a freeze on it."
2000.99-1680,3,32246,jeff_s_olson,,3553.617,3558.562,"--On the face of the ordinance, those violations may or may not be very serious."
2000.99-1680,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3622.152,3622.152,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2000.99-1680,3,32246,jeff_s_olson,,3622.152,3622.152,Thank you.
2000.99-1680,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3622.152,3626.152,The case is submitted.
