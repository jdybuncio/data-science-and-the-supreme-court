1997.96-1569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-1569, Daniel Bogan v. Janet Scott-Harris."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,57.337,59.622,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,79.868,81.034,I can't hear you very well.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,82.82,84.186,"--Sorry, Your Honor."
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,101.931,113.089,"Are you going to at some point address the court of appeals' reason for address... for your losing, which I didn't hear in either of the first two points, because I thought the court of appeals accepted both of those points."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,113.089,123.445,"--Well, the court of appeals did accept that there is absolute immunity for actions that are taken in a legislative capacity, and we agree with the court of appeals' decision on that point, a decision that I add was endorsed by every circuit."
1997.96-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.999,155.166,"Well, I think we've read the facts."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,157.432,158.284,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
1997.96-1569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,171.026,185.35,"On that issue, would you tell me your view of what the status of the common law was at the time of the enactment of the statute and, secondly, what the general rule was in the courts of appeals before our decision in Tahoe?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,185.35,189.904,"--As to the first, I think the law, the common law was clearly settled in the 19th Century."
1997.96-1569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,289.436,291.103,"Was that true of the slander cases, too?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,291.103,291.886,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1997.96-1569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,291.886,293.405,"Was that true of the slander cases, too?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,293.405,304.946,"Well, I think that... we have searched also and have not found a single slander case against a member of a local legislative body for statements relating to their legislative actions."
1997.96-1569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.532,364.334,Precisely what was the act done here?
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,367.603,377.225,"Well, I think the acts that are at the center of respondent's case are proposing an ordinance, voting for the... supporting the ordinance at committee, voting for the ordinance, and then the mayor's act in signing the ordinance."
1997.96-1569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.225,378.827,And what did the ordinance provide?
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,378.827,383.565,The ordinance eliminated a Department of Health and Human Services of the City of Fall River.
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,383.565,400.407,"I thought that what... the particular action they're talking about is section 22 of the ordinance, which reads, by striking out the following in section 16-239 the words, Administrator of Health and Human Services--"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,400.407,400.707,Well--
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,400.707,413.015,"--right, and there's a jury finding, I take it, that those words that I've just quoted are in this ordinance because the defendant's stated reason was wrong."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,429.708,430.225,--That is--
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,430.225,433.31,"--are jury findings, right, so don't we have to take those as the facts?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,433.31,437.444,"--Yes, at this point, certainly, Justice Breyer we do not take issue with the jury's determination."
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,445.2,453.973,"Now, my... of course, my question would be... and I want you to continue with the Chief Justice's answer, but the question arising out of those facts for me is, why are those legislative acts?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,473.804,474.004,--Right.
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,505.773,506.475,Any other aspect?
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,522.985,523.368,Right.
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.731,556.372,"But the only legislative thing, whether we call it ultimately legislative or administrative, there was only one action, and that was to end the position of head of HHS, no other legislation."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,556.372,557.038,--That's right.
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,666.256,683.802,"Before you get to policy, the scope of this absolute immunity, is it the same as speech or debate immunity for Members of Congress, or is it different for a State legislature, a regional lawmaking body, a municipal lawmaking body?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,692.224,694.593,"--I think, Your Honor, the nature of the immunity is the same."
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,717.589,722.743,Even for a county that has just a single commissioner who is both the executive and the legislat--
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,722.743,726.695,"Well, I think that that raises the difficult problem of application."
1997.96-1569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.513,791.553,"--May I interrupt you with just a... I know you want to get to Justice Breyer's question, but do your comments about local legislators have the same impact on the mayor?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,799.074,817.788,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that as the Court has said repeatedly, the question is not the branch in which the local official or a public official serves, or the, you know, the source of their salary, or their title, so in Butz v. Economu an executive official was entitled to judicial immunity because he exercised judicial functions."
1997.96-1569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.875,827.326,"Yes, but I'm not talking about when the mayor cast his vote, but when he signed the--"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,827.326,832.464,"--Well, and I think that what the mayor did here was clearly legislative in character."
1997.96-1569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,941.686,956.028,"--Well, the court of appeals used the term, administrate, but you describe the common law immunity as extending to everything except ministerial action, and I think the word administrative connotes a much broader exception than the term ministerial, doesn't it?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,956.028,956.695,"Well, absolutely."
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,983.913,1000.224,"But maybe what they had in mind is if the mayor just said, you're discharged, that would be, quote, administrative, that's not legislative, and so maybe the court of appeals is saying, well, that's a nice way to get around liability for administrative acts."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1004.842,1013.079,"--Well, a couple of points in response to that, Your Honor, which, I think that is a very important question that goes to the heart of respondent's argument."
1997.96-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.079,1040.146,You wouldn't care if it were the opposite.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1052.204,1053.104,"--I would say that, although I--"
1997.96-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.104,1063.309,"And you would say that if the mayor... if you accept the conclusion of Justice Ginsburg's question, this was a neat way around liability, you would say precisely--"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1063.309,1064.011,--Well--
1997.96-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.011,1068.129,"--it is, that that's simply the law, that you're not liable for legislative action."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1068.129,1070.812,"--As I say, there are a number of points to make in response to that."
1997.96-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1090.642,1093.41,What about the city itself being liable?
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1110.539,1116.276,"--Well, the city certainly can be liable for unconstitutional actions, and I think that that--"
1997.96-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1116.276,1121.162,"But the legislators enacting it are not personally liable, is your view."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1121.162,1121.514,--Absolutely.
1997.96-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1122.164,1125.199,Whether it's at the city level or the State level.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1125.199,1125.499,That's true.
1997.96-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1138.257,1139.959,But at the city level they can sue the city.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1139.959,1140.276,Precisely.
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1141.426,1148.996,"Oh, but you can't sue the city if on its face... I mean, what I'm thinking about is there are many different forms of local government."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1193.023,1193.84,"--Well, let me make--"
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.84,1194.958,"That's the end of those cases, right?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1194.958,1196.158,--a couple of points in response to that.
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1203.828,1206.947,"No, no, they'll do it by temporarily eliminating the position."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1212.082,1213.101,"--Well, I think that--"
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1213.101,1217.803,"Or are you going to look through that subterfuge which, after all, takes the same form."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1219.505,1224.207,"--Well, if... the question is, would such a thing be legislative in character."
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.909,1225.475,That's the question.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1225.475,1232.228,--What would happen if Congress passed... Congress passes laws all the time that are intended to and have the effect of affecting only one person.
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1238.548,1247.738,"Oh, no, but now, once you're down that track, once you admit an exception to the absolute rule of the form of legislation, then this looks like a pretty good case for that exception, doesn't it?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1247.738,1248.054,"--Well, but--"
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.054,1253.557,Because there are jury findings that this one person was really being dismissed in this way because of her speech.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1253.557,1255.557,--But I don't admit an exception for that.
1997.96-1569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.221,1276.84,That's why they put the Bill of Attainder Clause in the Constitution.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1276.84,1277.09,--Precisely.
1997.96-1569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.673,1286.113,"Then you're prepared to accept the way around all the cases that you can't discriminate on the basis of whatever, race, politics, or any other thing."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1286.113,1286.496,--Well--
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1286.496,1288.398,As long as it's run through the city council.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1288.398,1288.848,--So far as--
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1288.848,1290.515,"No matter how egregious, it's home free."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1290.515,1292.683,"--Well, two points, Your Honor."
1997.96-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1293.2,1295.134,"Well, I thought you told me it isn't home free."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1295.134,1295.734,--Exactly.
1997.96-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1295.734,1296.701,The city can be liable.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1296.701,1297.068,Exactly.
1997.96-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1297.068,1298.053,Of course it isn't home free.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1298.053,1298.47,But my--
1997.96-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1298.47,1303.005,But the individual legislators probably have a perfect defense.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1303.005,1305.624,"--My... that is precisely my point, stated better than I could do it."
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.624,1311.159,"But Mr. Rothfeld, you just told me that the... it's like the Speech or Debate Clause."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1332.941,1333.174,Well--
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1333.174,1337.876,"So I'm not comforted by your quick answer that yes, the city would be liable."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1342.328,1345.38,"--Well, I think... let me clarify my answer to you."
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1375.482,1377.934,But at least it is an open question.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1382.886,1393.61,"The second part of my answer to your question, Justice Ginsburg, is that there are many ways of proving legislative motive that do not require individual testimony by--"
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1393.61,1394.227,Give me an example.
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1402.715,1406.603,"--Well, I think in ways that respondent in this case did attempt to prove that."
1997.96-1569,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1431.949,1445.942,"Do you think that the... that Judge Sowerby was wrong when he said, ah, but that's not enough, there's nine people on that council, and you tell me that two of them, you've got circumstantial proof with respect to two of them, you can't prove a claim against the city on that basis?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1445.942,1474.795,"--Well, I think that the First Circuit suggested that the reason the case came out this way, perhaps, as to municipal liability is the manner in which it was litigated, that respondent made virtually no attempt to demonstrate by any means the motivations of these other members of the city council and, for example, one could imagine that a plaintiff in a case like this might try to show that there is an individual member of the council, like the chair of the Budget Committee, who is... as to whom everyone defers automatically, and that is essentially a de facto policymaker."
1997.96-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.795,1475.612,"You're not saying, I--"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1487.519,1488.352,Well--
1997.96-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.352,1500.993,"I'm not comforted by your assurance that you can sue the city, because I'm... you know, most of the arguments you make in defense of your clients here it seems to me are makable just as well with respect to the city."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1514.836,1521.656,"--Well, that, I think, Your Honor, goes to the substantive nature of the constitutional violation that's being alleged, and it doesn't turn on the nature of municipal liability."
1997.96-1569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.179,1538.702,"It also... but it's also limited by Monell, I take it, that perhaps an ordinance might be, but it would have to be a policy type of thing."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1538.702,1539.885,"--Well, that is certainly true."
1997.96-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1540.987,1549.141,"What you're saying, I take it, or tell me if I'm correct, is that there may well be a constitutional wrong here."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1555.128,1556.761,--That is correct.
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1556.761,1561.115,"But against the municipality, what bothers me... I don't know the answer to this."
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1586.647,1587.599,"Well, I think--"
1997.96-1569,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1587.599,1588.532,Or there's no liability?
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1589.282,1613.564,"--If I can give you a short answer and then sit down, I think that it would be a very dangerous thing for public officials if it were possible to look behind the form of the legislation and say, well, maybe on the face of it this does not in terms appear unconstitutional, but there were facts in their minds which render it unconstitutional and therefore legislative immunity goes by the boards until we are able to establish the nature of their motivation."
1997.96-1569,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.987,1621.587,"Well, what does Washington v. Davis require?"
1997.96-1569,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1624.539,1639.03,"--Well, I think that there are... as I suggest, there are means of getting at the motivation of the jurist... of the decisionmaking entity which do not require holding them liable, which is the only issue which is before the Court in this case."
1997.96-1569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.88,1644.48,"Very well, Mr. Rothfeld."
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1647.415,1650.783,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.129,1727.414,What does that prove?
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1727.414,1728.964,--That addresses two points.
1997.96-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.034,1741.236,"Well, are you saying the two are mutually exclusive, and what's your authority for saying that?"
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1741.236,1755.928,"I'm not saying that they're necessarily mutually exclusive, but if you apply the Court's functionality test, if you say, is the firing of one employee an administrative function or is that a legislative function--"
1997.96-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.928,1764.598,"And where does the Court's functionality test that you refer to, where does that come from?"
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1764.598,1770.252,"--For example, in the Virginia supreme court case, Virginia Supreme Court v. Consumers Union."
1997.96-1569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1792.598,1808.091,"Well, Mr. Schwartz, I used to serve in a State legislature, and I can remember in the State legislature, because of personal animosity sometimes a position would be eliminated by the legislators."
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1825.57,1831.723,"Well, I... under Tenney v. Brandhove, certainly they were."
1997.96-1569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1831.723,1833.389,"I thought so, too."
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1868.477,1870.163,"If it's viewed in that light, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1870.163,1870.679,Yes.
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1870.679,1878.268,--I suggest that if the mayor had eliminated the position it would have been legislative conduct.
1997.96-1569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.136,1882.836,I don't see why.
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1895.194,1900.33,"--Well, in actuality, Your Honor, the act that we're looking at here is not the act of the city council."
1997.96-1569,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1908.752,1910.585,And was he a member of it as well?
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1910.585,1919.858,"--No, he was not, so the question would be whether... what the jury found, the action of submitting an ordinance that would--"
1997.96-1569,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1919.858,1921.31,Isn't that part of the legislative process?
1997.96-1569,1,28003,harvey_a_schwartz,,1931.499,1931.932,--Yes.
1997.96-1569,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3385.282,3385.901,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1997.96-1569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3419.788,3422.49,"Or the President, if he proposed that legislation, which would be--"

1997.96-1569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3423.757,3424.626,--parallel.
1997.96-1569,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3424.626,3439.552,"Second, I think that the court of appeals and respondent acknowledge that if this facially neutral ordinance had been promulgated for proper reasons, for... purely for the purpose of saving money, it would, in fact, be legislative in character."
1997.96-1569,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3461.279,3465.85,"Of course, isn't that true in any case in which the constitutional violation has an element of motive in it?"
1997.96-1569,2,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3465.85,3472.67,"--Well, not if there's an absolute immunity rule for acts that are in the form of legislation, as we suggest."
1997.96-1569,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3531.875,3532.792,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
