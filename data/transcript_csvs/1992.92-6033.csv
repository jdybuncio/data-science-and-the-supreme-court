1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.597,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-6033, William McNeil v. the United States."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,56.648,59.479,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.956,193.307,Let me stop you there.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,204.093,207.626,--He believes or he believed that his claim was denied.
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.626,208.948,What is your position?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,211.97,224.269,"You look to... he believed that the combination of the January 24th letter and the February... I believe it's 9th letter, put together, were a denial of his claim."
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.269,226.579,Is that your position on his behalf?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,226.579,229.572,That is certainly a reasonable position.
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.991,232.543,"Well, is it your position on his behalf?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,232.543,235.175,--It's part of our... my position on his behalf.
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.431,254.707,"But if we go this far, because that's where we are chronologically, you say that the two letters, somehow combined, are a denial."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,258.329,258.971,That's correct.
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.732,263.744,"No, but by the time he filed suit in March."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,263.744,264.725,"That's correct, there were not--"
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.725,265.853,6 months had not elapsed.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,265.853,266.324,--That's correct.
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.324,269.997,So you would have to say somehow those two letters were a denial.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,269.997,272.228,That's... that was clearly what he believed.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,279.383,293.302,"But, we're... Mr. Shoenberger, we're talking really a question of law here, not what someone may have reasonably believed, unless the law makes what someone reasonably believed, rather than what actually was, relevant."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,293.302,294.895,"I agree, Your Honor."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.895,299.657,Then why do you keep mentioning your client's reasonable belief in something?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,305.651,319.9,"The statute on its text neither refers to reasonable belief... nor does the statute, we believe, in its text indicate the remedy that should occur should a premature filing, if this is deemed a premature filing... had been made."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,335.781,343.245,"Well, but if one were to read the text of 2675(a), which is one of the statutes with you,"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,365.36,370.223,"Well, what... we contest, of course, whether ""instituted"" means the same as commenced."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,370.223,371.315,Well--
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,371.315,383.293,"But he believed that he had his denial, and the statute is only clear if you look at the method it specifies for notifying the denial, which refers to certified or registered mail."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.373,402.894,--Well--
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,402.894,404.694,And so he had... he had a gap in knowledge.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.694,410.08,"--Well, was the letter which he received... was it certified or registered?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,410.08,418.155,"The record does not indicate whether either the January, 1989 letter or the February, 1989 letter were either registered or certified."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.155,420.596,Was this point raised by you in the district court?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,420.596,423.157,I did not represent him in the district court.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.157,426.049,Was it raised by whoever represented him in the district court?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,426.049,427.161,He represented himself prose.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.161,428.46,Was it raised by him?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,428.46,434.884,He did raise the argument that he had made a sufficient filing--
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,434.884,441.119,"I'm asking you a very specific question, Mr. Shoenberger, and I think it's capable of being answered yes or no."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,441.119,451.457,--I believe he did assert specifically that he had notice in March of 1989 in connection with these two letters that allowed him the right... a permission to sue.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.208,464.474,"Well, so he wasn't contending there, then, that the mailing he received was inadequate."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,464.474,466.227,--No.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.088,484.747,"Well then are you... are you here making a... I thought from what you remarked a moment ago that you are here making a point that because there was... there's no evidence the denial was sent by certified or regisetered mail, that that has some bearing on it."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,484.747,499.937,"In the August, 1989 filing that he made, in his letter requesting to commence the litigation, attached to that letter... that letter was the sum certain denial that was sent in July of 1989."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.322,504.722,Well--
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,504.722,506.082,"That is, the letter contained that particular language."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.082,516.389,--Do you make a point here of your claim that the denial from the agency was not sent by certified or registered mail?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,516.389,522.881,"That as far as we know, in August... in July of 1989 it was sent by certified mail, because that's what the letter says."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.881,528.656,"And am I right in thinking you make no point of failure to certify or register here, in your case here?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,528.656,535.43,"We certainly don't, because there's no evidence in the record... and the only evidence in the record would seem to suggest it was, but we don't know that as a fact."
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,624.119,629.272,"Well, now, you don't take the position, do you, that the August 7th letter is a complaint--"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,629.272,630.213,We--
1992.92-6033,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,630.213,631.264,--For an action?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,634.058,634.506,--No.
1992.92-6033,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,673.733,683.68,"Well, is there anything to indicate that the district court acted to grant this implied motion under 15... under rule 15(d)?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,683.68,692.576,There is no indication that the Federal district court ever saw this letter of August 7th and the attachments.
1992.92-6033,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,700.961,710.017,"Well, it's rather odd to rely, then, on an implied motion that the district court has not even seen, much less acted on--"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,710.017,712.438,But it was filed.
1992.92-6033,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,712.438,713.97,--To cure a defective pleading.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,713.97,715.881,But it was filed.
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.467,759.629,"Well, no, it doesn't say I am filing a case right now."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,770.035,776.619,"If the... if commencing means filed, if that's the statutory interpretation from 2675 that's correct."
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,776.619,778.001,"Yeah, but it says it ""can properly commence""."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,781.812,782.303,Right.
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.303,785.726,That means I am now able to commence my legal action.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,788.747,796.424,"Well, I think... I think his subjective intent may very well have been that he simply wanted the prior filing to start going forward."
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.56,814.703,"Well, I don't think it's too much to insist if you want one... one document to be accepted for another one, that he's saying I'm filing a complaint."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,833.628,835.247,"Well, I don't think you have to bend over backwards."
1992.92-6033,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,878.217,881.019,Was a copy of that letter served on or sent to the Government?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,881.019,882.759,I do not believe so.
1992.92-6033,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,904.233,915.951,"Well, but I mean it stretches... it stretches again the argument for the implied rule 15(d) motion to say that it's a... it's a motion for a supplemental pleading when it's not even served on the Government."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,915.951,923.505,"--In... this Court in decision... in Matthews v. Diaz, it was even more stretched than that."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.152,995.642,Do you cite Matthews against Diaz in your brief?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,995.642,996.423,"Yes, we do."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,996.423,998.575,"Oh, I didn't see it in the index."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,998.575,1000.766,I believe it's in the... it's in the supplemental.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1000.766,1003.219,In your reply brief.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1003.219,1004.028,"Yes, in the reply brief."
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.028,1015.435,"Mr. Shoenberger, you know I didn't really think we were going to get into whether... I didn't think we had taken the case to try to figure out whether this August 7 letter was a proper commencement of the suit or not."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1018.587,1025.172,We think it's a question that's a subsidiary question to the one that was presented in the petition for certiorari.
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1036.309,1039.181,"Well, what... which question being what?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1039.592,1056.352,"The question is whether or not the August... the August filing of 1989 was sufficient either as a complaint itself, as a stand-alone complaint with the attachments associated with it, or as a perfecting of the March filing, if this Court should determine that the March filing was perfected."
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.352,1057.023,"Well, what... that's fine."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1117.924,1118.983,I agree.
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.983,1122.856,"Well, can we talk about the legal issues that were the subject of the petition."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1122.856,1123.317,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-6033,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1164.133,1167.055,And you concede that as a jurisdictional requirement.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1167.055,1168.685,That exhaustion has to occur.
1992.92-6033,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1170.538,1171.059,And that it is jurisdictional.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1171.059,1174.899,--It's something that is certainly necessarily to occur.
1992.92-6033,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1184.666,1189.0,"Well, if it were jurisdictional the answer would be a rather neat answer, wouldn't it?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1189.0,1192.31,"--Well, Matthews v. Diaz, I think, gives a rather neat answer to that."
1992.92-6033,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1205.841,1208.383,So you lose nothing if we do treat is as jurisdictional.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1208.383,1208.983,--That's correct.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.003,1225.703,"Well, if your client had failed to file any sort of a paper in court in March, eventually his claim would have simply disappeared by virtue of the running of the... either the statute of limitations, wouldn't it?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1225.703,1227.643,"Yes, it would have."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.015,1247.358,"Again, yeah, why... why is this at all important in our disposition of the question presented, what he believed?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1247.358,1257.764,"Because the Federal Tort Claims Act proceedings, particularly now with the administrative proceedings, are proceedings that are frequently instituted by people proceeding prose."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.764,1262.108,Where in the statute does it talk about anybody's honest belief?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1262.108,1263.166,It does... it does not.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.388,1264.849,Then why do you raise it here?
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1264.849,1289.676,"Because the... this Court has in a number of cases, in particular in relationship to the... to Title VII in the Zipes case, and in the... a DEA case, indicated then... when petitioners proceed prose or can start processes prose, that it will not strictly construe the language in a way that prevents them from going forward."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.597,1340.308,"Well do you think ""institute""... well do you think ""instituted"" means something much different from commenced?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1340.308,1341.67,"We believe it does, Your Honor."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1354.566,1366.294,"Well, but the fact that you... you can't use one word for everything you can use the other word for doesn't mean that in the... in the area where they have common application the meaning may not be the same."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1366.294,1366.995,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1397.595,1401.209,"Is this definition of the word ""institute"" out of a dictionary?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1401.209,1405.97,"--We have both cited dictionary definitions of the word ""institute"", yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.97,1411.164,And it talks about a service or a filing.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1411.164,1412.396,"No, no."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1417.689,1418.31,Well--
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1418.31,1419.559,And statutes that Congress... I'm sorry.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.559,1425.422,"--Well, what statutory definition of ""institute"" are you talking about?"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1425.422,1428.645,"There is no statutory definition in this statute of the word ""institute""."
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1428.645,1436.271,"Well, I thought you were referring a moment ago to... that the word ""institute"" meant two stages or something like that."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1436.271,1452.07,"In a number of the examples cited by the solicitor general's office, which we discuss in the reply brief on page 8 and 9, the word ""institute"" is used, in these cases, in the same statutory sections along with the word ""commenced""."
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.349,1517.823,"Mr. Shoenberger, as I understand your position, it's that the failure to comply with 2675(a) should not automatically result in dismissal; that it should depend on how far the lawsuit has progressed."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1525.26,1535.065,We believe that the line that several circuits have drawn that substantial progress had not... has not occurred is a reasonable line to be drawn.
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.065,1536.377,Why--
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1536.377,1545.112,That speaks to the efforts that are involved in the progressing on behalf of the Government and the conservation of the Government's resources in terms of litigating these kinds of cases.
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1546.565,1550.185,"--If it hasn't gone... if it hasn't proceeded very far, you dismiss it."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1551.497,1555.517,It's certainly reasonable to dismiss it at that... it's reasonable... no.
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.86,1559.551,--I don't understand that.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1568.297,1588.099,"--Well, as a practical matter, if Congress was concerned with conserving the governmental resources, we think that purpose is disserved by letting a case go forward and be litigated perhaps months, or as in the Hallstrom case, years until the point happens to be raised."
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1612.826,1616.439,"But you say if the Government wants to... wait a minute, now."
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1623.192,1624.193,--If the Government makes that motion.
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.193,1624.654,Gee.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1624.654,1626.076,We believe that the Government has a--
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.076,1637.443,"Well, so the Government should really let all these suits go on as long as possible, waste as much judicial resources as possible, and only then when the judgment is about to come down, the Government gets up, Your Honor we move to dismiss for--"
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1637.443,1638.482,"--No, at some point--"
1992.92-6033,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.482,1640.214,--It doesn't seem to me to make a whole lot of sense.
1992.92-6033,0,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,1640.214,1642.064,--At some point there may be an estoppel that would apply.
1992.92-6033,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.272,1684.132,"Very well, Mr. Shoenberger."
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1685.353,1690.778,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-6033,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1764.496,1777.854,"Well, suppose that within the limitations period, a formal rule 15(d) motion is applied moving that the court construe the complaint that was previously filed as a newly filed complaint."
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1778.796,1780.996,"--We would have a problem with that, Your Honor."
1992.92-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.493,1816.239,"--I want to file a complaint now and please... this is within the limitations period, I assume?"
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1816.239,1816.7,--Yes.
1992.92-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.7,1825.616,And the complaint I want to file is the complaint I filed some months ago and paid the fee on.
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1825.616,1828.728,"We believe that would be insufficient, Your Honor."
1992.92-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.728,1829.459,Why?
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1829.459,1830.668,It's merely a formal matter.
1992.92-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.668,1838.735,It says please... there's a paper in your file that I want you to incorporate in my letter which says this is a complaint.
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1838.735,1848.94,"Well if as an administrative matter a district court wished to accept that complaint as a new action and if, further, as an administrative matter they retained the same number, I suppose nothing would bar that."
1992.92-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.556,1861.479,"But in any event, August was beyond the limitations period in this case."
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1861.479,1863.229,--August was not beyond the limitations period in this case.
1992.92-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.229,1863.6,It was not.
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1863.6,1864.08,It was within.
1992.92-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1864.08,1864.511,All right.
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1864.511,1870.085,"The administrative denial was on July 21st, 1989, the letter was sent August 7th, so it was within the required time."
1992.92-6033,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.995,1877.528,Why would it take a new filing fee?
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,1882.252,1890.267,"--Well, a plaintiff who files a case prematurely, Your Honor, has disserved the court, in effect, and used its resources when he wasn't entitled to."
1992.92-6033,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.236,2136.559,"Does that mean that at the time this man wrote his letter to the agency, the agency really didn't have any authority to settle?"
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,2136.559,2143.054,"Well, on... these facts are somewhat unusual, Justice Stevens, because the agency did not have notice that the lawsuit had been filed."
1992.92-6033,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.23,2201.912,"May I ask with regard to the issue before... you know, the particular legal issue... are the cases that go the other way from the Seventh Circuit and say that you can treat the case as being filed after there's a denial if there's been no substantial progress in the litigation, are they all prose cases?"
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,2201.912,2204.884,"I honestly don't know, Justice Stevens."
1992.92-6033,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2204.884,2205.275,I haven't read them.
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,2205.686,2206.116,I don't recall.
1992.92-6033,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.118,2214.661,"--Because those that... where there's a lawyer involved, it's kind of puzzling as to know why... you know, the statute is pretty plain."
1992.92-6033,1,45217,william_k_kelley,,2216.133,2216.564,The statute is plain.
1992.92-6033,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2310.504,2312.104,"--Thank you, Mr. Kelley."
1992.92-6033,2,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,2314.476,2315.687,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.92-6033,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.44,2359.556,"But he stated that he thought it was unnecessary for the court to decide, the majority to decide as it did, the question on which the circuits are split, didn't he?"
1992.92-6033,2,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,2359.556,2360.037,That's correct.
1992.92-6033,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2368.252,2371.554,It's a way for not having to reach the issue we granted cert to decide.
1992.92-6033,2,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,2371.554,2372.265,--That's right.
1992.92-6033,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.262,2390.497,"You mean whenever we grant certiorari, we don't know what issues we're going to have to decide--"
1992.92-6033,2,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,2390.497,2391.066,--No.
1992.92-6033,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.066,2393.038,--Even on behalf of the petitioner.
1992.92-6033,2,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,2393.038,2393.539,No.
1992.92-6033,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.539,2403.774,"I mean I can understand the person who's trying to sustain the judgment below coming in and saying, you know, this wasn't raised in the petition, but I'm entitled to my judgment on the basis of this other issue."
1992.92-6033,2,16904,allen_e_shoenberger,,2424.429,2425.731,"I agree, I agree."
1992.92-6033,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2437.56,2438.341,"Thank you, Mr. Shoenberger."
