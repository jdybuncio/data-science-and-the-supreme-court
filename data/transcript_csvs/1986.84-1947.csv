1986.84-1947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,We will hear arguments next in Cerbone against Conway.
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,79.516,82.327,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.84-1947,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,125.997,131.48,"This is the kind of a case that gets the legal profession in ill repute, isn't it?"
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,131.48,142.257,"Well, Justice Oakes' opinion below did take umbrage at I think some of my own actions in this case, and certainly my client's actions."
1986.84-1947,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,162.952,165.513,"Exactly, and it should have been settled long ago."
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,165.513,166.138,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.84-1947,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,166.138,171.465,How can people of this type afford the litigation to come up here on it?
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,171.465,176.791,"Well, the problem with that... the answer to that is not in the record."
1986.84-1947,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,399.732,404.417,How soon are you going to the point in this case?
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,404.417,405.494,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1986.84-1947,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,405.494,411.68,How soon are you going to get to the Constitutional point about a check that bounced?
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,411.68,417.568,"Well, I think... our point is that there is no Constitutional claim at all."
1986.84-1947,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,427.254,440.639,"On that point, the respondent tells us that under New York law the respondent's arrest is part of her malicious prosecution claim."
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,440.639,442.264,"Your Honor, I--"
1986.84-1947,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.264,455.353,"And under New York law, an arrest made without a warrant and lacking probable cause gives a cause of action for malicious prosecution in New York."
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,459.133,459.867,"--Well, no."
1986.84-1947,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,467.785,485.545,"Well, if you'd answer my question, apparently what the respondents tell us is that New York law would give a cause of action for malicious prosecution for the making of an arrest without a warrant and lacking in probable cause."
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,485.545,493.525,"--No, she's wrong to the extent that she's suggesting that she can recover damages for the false arrest as part of her malicious prosecution claim."
1986.84-1947,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,507.864,515.94,"Well, let's suppose that they're right, and that under New York law a false arrest claim is part of malicious prosecution."
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,524.622,538.679,"Well, if she were correct that it's not... that it's not... then that leads to the result that the court below was wrong in dismissing the claims of arrest and imprisonment as time barred."
1986.84-1947,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,580.412,582.709,Is New York law controlling?
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,582.709,585.098,"No, or the court below did not hold that."
1986.84-1947,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,617.384,618.587,"Well, may I just interrupt?"
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,622.336,625.288,"--Well, but the Second Circuit said they were out of the case, also."
1986.84-1947,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.288,627.319,"Well, but only on the State law cause of action."
1986.84-1947,0,35660,michael_f_close,,645.016,651.67,"No, because... for statute of limitations purposes, if you look at the statute of limitations ruling, which is at 822, I believe--"
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1634.775,1649.145,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1705.997,1724.084,"Let's assume that the only thing I think that your client suffered which I would accent as a deprivation of life, liberty or property, without due process, was the detention in the jail facility."
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1724.084,1724.725,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1724.725,1728.458,Why isn't that time barred?
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1728.458,1733.848,"Your Honor, we have two separate causes of action under New York law."
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.989,1735.411,I don't care about New York law.
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1736.443,1745.611,"--We're talking 1983, but we're using... as 1983 has done in the past, picking up the tort law as a model on which to model itself."
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.095,1748.079,But there's quite a difference.
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1760.981,1763.137,"--No, you cannot, you're correct on that, Your Honor."
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.378,1785.642,But I'm not talking about a malicious prosecution tort.
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1806.745,1808.697,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.182,1809.838,All right.
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1813.179,1817.912,"--That would not be time barred, because this was a continuing conspiracy, Your Honor."
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.642,1832.094,--1983 does not give a cause of action for a conspiracy.
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1843.622,1851.057,"However, this court has recognized in, say, Adickes v. Kress, the notion of a conspiratorial element as stating a cause of action."
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.057,1859.54,"You can use the existence of a conspiracy to attribute State action to private actors; for that purpose, we've used conspiracy."
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1880.344,1885.39,I had not seen this Court hold specifically that it is.
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.49,1913.627,"Is there a State tort of conspiracy, do you know, as a separate tort?"
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1913.627,1916.018,"I believe there is, Your Honor, but I'm not altogether certain."
1986.84-1947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.308,1984.866,"Well, Mr. Miller, do you think that where a person is not convicted, that speedy trial analysis really adds much to the basic concept of deprivation of liberty?"
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,1984.866,1986.397,"I believe it does, Your Honor."
1986.84-1947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2007.062,2017.558,"Well, but surely you could recover for however long or however short it is if you can show simply a deprivation of liberty without due process of law."
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,2017.558,2018.714,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.84-1947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.539,2040.689,Your opponent relies heavily on the Hudson v. Palmer and Parratt v. Taylor for the proposition that New York law provided adequate remedies for this detention.
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,2040.689,2043.781,"Yes, Your Honor, they do rely on that."
1986.84-1947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.027,2107.646,"But Parratt went on to say, I think... and I think Hudson v. Palmer reiterated it... that in some situations you had to look at the State remedy that was provided for the petitioner's claim to decide whether there had been any deprivation."
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,2107.646,2110.52,"Yes, you did, Your Honor."
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2148.756,2161.846,"Do you claim that there is some right, privilege or immunity at issue here other than the due process deprivation?"
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,2161.846,2170.358,Other than the speedy trial and the unbiased forum and the false... the bad arrest.
1986.84-1947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.682,2186.102,But these are all under the category of due process?
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,2186.102,2187.867,"No, they are not, Your Honor."
1986.84-1947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.255,2200.315,"Didn't you lose your great humiliation, ridicule and mental anguish in your catalog?"
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,2200.315,2203.705,"That, Your Honor, is the injury that she sustained."
1986.84-1947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.232,2218.044,Do you contend that her reputation is any part of the liberty that is protected?
1986.84-1947,1,25726,george_russel_miller,,2218.044,2218.402,I do not.
1986.84-1947,2,35660,michael_f_close,,3143.776,3153.757,"Answering Mr. Justice Scalia's question, there is no tort of conspiracy recognized by New York law."
1986.84-1947,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.652,3231.056,Isn't it correct that the judgment you're appealing is an order that has the effect of denying a motion to dismiss?
1986.84-1947,2,35660,michael_f_close,,3231.056,3231.853,Yes.
1986.84-1947,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.853,3234.633,So that the case is just ready to get started for trial?
1986.84-1947,2,35660,michael_f_close,,3234.633,3235.18,Yes.
1986.84-1947,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.18,3239.366,"So that's all that's at stake, is whether there's enough here to go to trial."
1986.84-1947,2,35660,michael_f_close,,3239.366,3255.376,"Yes, but the rationale of the decision below, in response to my argument that Paul v. Davis, Baker v. McCollan, and Gerstein v. Pugh, which said malicious prosecution is not a claim under 1983, the court below said, no, look, this is New York law."
1986.84-1947,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3312.839,3314.027,"Thank you, Mr. Close."
