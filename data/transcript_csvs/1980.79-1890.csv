1980.79-1890,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.891,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Andrus v. Alaska and the consolidated case.
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,14.76,18.378,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1890,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,326.495,333.099,"Mr. Claiborne, is there any attempt on the part of the Government to recover the money paid between 1964 and 1975?"
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,333.099,342.772,"Your Honor, the Government resisted the complaint of Kenai seeking to compel that action."
1980.79-1890,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,367.222,372.19,"If you're right, Alaska has about $50 million that it shouldn't have, doesn't it?"
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,372.19,373.992,"--That is so, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1890,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,383.748,397.321,"Have there been occasions, Mr. Claiborne, where the United States had this type of a claim in broad terms and took no action to enforce the claim?"
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,397.321,423.906,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, without being able to cite precedents, that one can find examples on both sides; that is, cases in which the United States for reasons of equity thought it improper to seek to redress the past; other instances in which it was thought right to recoup the money and redistribute it in accordance with what is now declared to be the correct rule."
1980.79-1890,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.906,436.696,"Well, Mr. Claiborne, both the question of Justice Stevens and the question of the Chief Justice suggest that the answer reached by the 9th Circuit is wrong in this case."
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,463.716,486.046,"I would not have thought so, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I own that two courts have held against our position and we cannot therefore say that it's absolutely clear cut that the Government's view as announced by the Comptroller General and as we urge here is the correct one."
1980.79-1890,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,716.56,733.922,"Mr. Claiborne, before you get into your analysis of the '64 statute, would you tell me what is the statutory authority for the Secretary to derive revenues from the sale of timber, hay, grass, and all these others, sand and gravel, the things other than minerals?"
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,739.074,796.11,"The authority as understood by the Department and indeed as recited in rulings of the Solicitor is that the so called Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act as originally enacted in 1935 does authorize the Secretary... and, indeed, the words are reasonably clear to that end... does authorize the Secretary to grant sales or dispositions, which in this context are understood to include leases, of those products... in the case of some of the products it's an outright sale, but in other instances it's leases... with respect to both refuges made up of acquired lands and those made up of public domain lands, without distinction."
1980.79-1890,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.11,803.33,If the Mineral Leasing Act did not apply would that statutory authority have authorized the making of the leases that are involved here?
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,803.33,831.099,"We suggest that that is a possible construction of the 1935 Act, even before its amendment, and indeed that was the ruling of the Acting Solicitor of the Department of the Interior in 1946, before the Acquired Lands Act had been passed, and therefore the only authority then available with respect to mineral leases on acquired lands."
1980.79-1890,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.824,903.78,"It isn't entirely mooted out, because isn't it normally true that the division of revenues would be computed according to a statute that also grants the authority to make the lease in the first place?"
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,915.237,928.33,"--Mr. Justice Stevens, it is certainly neater, if that's an appropriate word, if the same statute both gives the authority and governs the distribution of revenues."
1980.79-1890,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,955.497,969.471,"Mr. Claiborne, isn't there some real basis, though, for treating acquired lands and domain lands differently with respect to how much of a share of the royalty should go to a county?"
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,969.471,975.911,"Mr. Justice White, that may have been the thought, but as--"
1980.79-1890,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.911,978.513,"--Well, there would be a basis for doing it."
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,978.513,979.013,--There would.
1980.79-1890,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,979.013,982.131,"After all, acquired lands does reduce the county's tax base."
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,982.131,999.842,"But, considering the revenues from all other sources, all clearly divided under the Refuge Act, whether from acquired or from public domain lands, it is difficult to see why mineral revenues, that is, oil and gas revenues, should be segregated for different treatment."
1980.79-1890,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.72,1025.041,"Well, the '64 amendments were aimed at facilitating the acquisition of lands?"
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1025.041,1029.694,That was plainly the main purpose of the '64 amendment.
1980.79-1890,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.093,1071.454,"It doesn't... perhaps the county might be entitled to share more heavily with respect to acquired lands but how about the public domain lands, that they never were taxing anyway?"
1980.79-1890,0,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1071.454,1081.81,"Well, they do receive a share of all other revenues, and it's difficult to appreciate why they shouldn't receive a like share of mineral revenues."
1980.79-1890,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1097.756,1111.08,Mr. Cranston.
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1111.08,1113.281,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1890,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1156.775,1172.118,"Just by way of definition, to clarify it for me at least, when you speak of the term ""acquired lands"", are those always lands which have been on the tax rolls before they were acquired?"
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1172.118,1173.97,"Presumably so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1890,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1249.318,1254.372,Are you relating that to current rates of tax in that area?
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1254.372,1255.622,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I am."
1980.79-1890,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.134,1312.209,"But, Mr. Cranston, is that any different than the situation of any other western state that was admitted to the Union, where the Federal Government started out owning 70 or 80 percent of the land in the state?"
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1312.209,1334.207,"It could be, Justice Rehnquist, in that I believe it's unusual in all of the public domain to have development of that public domain, which adds to the services which the local government must provide."
1980.79-1890,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1398.398,1408.122,"But the county's tax base derives ultimately from the authority of the Alaska Legislature, does it not?"
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1408.122,1411.741,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1890,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1603.68,1611.169,You do concede that there is a general policy against implied appeal you not?
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1611.169,1634.032,"Certainly, Your Honor, and this Court has recognized that many times, but the exception to that policy against implied repeal is certainly pointed out most strongly by this case, where there is such a clear inconsistency between those statutes, and given that inconsistency, I believe that consistent with Sloan--"
1980.79-1890,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.032,1652.16,"Mr. Cranston, how do you explain the fact that apparently the change was drafted by the Department of Interior as a perfecting amendment, and yet they didn't apparently realize that the change meant what you now say it means, for at least ten years?"
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1652.16,1667.086,"--Certainly Interior in its early letters, when this Act came before Congress in 1962, added the word ""minerals"", and called it a perfecting amendment."
1980.79-1890,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1725.806,1732.694,"Well, is it not correct that your basic position is that it was much more than a perfecting amendment, it made a fundamental change?"
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1732.694,1744.934,It certainly made a change with respect to ultimately how the revenues were to be distributed.
1980.79-1890,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.687,1775.123,But the people who wrote the checks didn't think that.
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1775.123,1776.489,I don't... well--
1980.79-1890,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1776.489,1783.478,"And nobody complained for whenever it's... '55 or so, and if you want to add another ten years, then there's 20 years of construction of the Act."
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1783.478,1786.43,--Certainly the people who wrote the checks didn't follow the Act.
1980.79-1890,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1788.446,1790.848,"I mean, I'm talking about the period before 1964."
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1790.848,1792.5,--Okay.
1980.79-1890,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1825.921,1834.244,"This is not the first time that the Department of Interior has had a change in position from one period to another, is it?"
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1843.017,1855.007,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that's a difficult question for me to answer, but I... human nature being what it is, I assume that there may have been other instances where positions have changed."
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.292,1862.628,"--Well, Mr. Cranston, let me ask you one you probably, won't be hard for you to answer."
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1869.834,1875.754,"A borough, Justice White, is exactly the same as a county, say in Maryland or Virginia."
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.273,1879.506,"Well, is it a creature of the State?"
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1888.511,1898.853,"--A county, unlike... perhaps the unique thing about an Alaska borough is it is a self chosen local government."
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.486,1901.119,It's a home rule sort of thing?
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1901.119,1901.805,--into boroughs.
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.007,1907.173,Does it sort of have home rule authority?
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1907.173,1907.542,It may.
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.327,1911.877,"Well, let me ask you this."
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1928.153,1932.89,That is a question that may be difficult.
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.492,1956.422,"If the State is ultimately responsible, if it determined to take over, say, the financing of all the schools throughout the State and decided to take all the revenues from oil and gas leases into the State treasury and then redistribute them, would there be some barrier to that?"
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1956.422,1966.362,"--There's certainly, I think, under the Alaska Constitution, nothing that grants a constitutional right for the existence of a--"
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.362,1978.852,"So that, if the powers that be in Alaska want to change the result of this case, either way it went, I suppose, nothing we could do about it."
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1978.852,1983.989,"--That is conceivably possible, Your Honor, although I think that would be true in any other state as well as Alaska."
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.989,1996.814,I just wonder why we're having to settle a fight between the county and the State here when you could settle it yourself; the State Legislature could settle it.
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,1996.814,2006.037,"Again, I think the simple answer is that we have two inconsistent statutes and until that is done there is no other alternative."
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.037,2013.593,But the State Legislature could... it sounds like they control the distribution no matter what the federal law said.
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,2013.593,2015.544,I'm not willing to concede that--
1980.79-1890,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.544,2017.06,I wouldn't if I were you.
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,2017.06,2019.396,--the county has a right to the money under federal law.
1980.79-1890,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.316,2029.035,"Could I ask one more question, please, Mr. Cranston?"
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,2050.199,2061.239,Probably the borough would get considerably less than that which it would be entitled to under the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.
1980.79-1890,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.814,2074.316,About five percent--
1980.79-1890,1,18600,charles_k_cranston,,2074.316,2075.333,--Right.
1980.79-1890,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2088.507,2090.343,Mr. Koester.
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,2090.343,2092.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1890,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2517.898,2522.352,"The Kenai Moose Range was established in '41, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,2522.352,2522.752,Right.
1980.79-1890,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2632.57,2643.111,"Is this part of your argument directed to your submission that the word ""minerals"" in this statute does not include oil and gas?"
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,2643.111,2644.797,"Well, I think perhaps--"
1980.79-1890,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2644.797,2646.063,The argument is made in your brief.
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,2646.063,2648.249,--The argument is made in our brief.
1980.79-1890,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2680.45,2687.87,But you also have an argument that oil and gas are not within the plain meaning of the statute.
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,2687.87,2688.304,--Right.
1980.79-1890,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2692.841,2695.024,"And I was wondering if you're directing yourself to that argument now, or not?"
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,2695.024,2698.495,"--If this... no, I'm not, except in response to your question."
1980.79-1890,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2698.495,2699.362,Right.
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,2699.362,2725.645,"If this case is to turn on the plain meaning rule, then it must be resolved that Section 35 controls, because Section 35 and the Mineral Leasing Act in general speak specifically to oil and gas, whereas the word ""minerals"" in many cases is construed to include oil and gas, in some cases is construed not to include oil and gas, but in any event requires construction."
1980.79-1890,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3021.188,3028.192,"Well, the Secretary doesn't ordinarily turn to the Comptroller General for legal advice, does he?"
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3028.192,3029.025,I don't believe so.
1980.79-1890,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3151.754,3156.424,"I suppose Congress could change the formula now, too, couldn't it?"
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3156.424,3160.142,"I believe, if it is to be changed, that is, for Congress to do it--"
1980.79-1890,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.142,3162.678,"Oh, I know, they could do it; there would be no problem."
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3162.678,3182.991,"--Well, I think there still might be an argument here because, actually, this was one of the fundamental underpinnings which underlay the Statehood Act and while it may or may not rise to the level of a compact, and I don't believe that that issue really needs to be decided here, it is certainly an issue that that will be--"
1980.79-1890,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.991,3200.703,"Well, I would think, if you think it's a substantial question, your argument would be that the '64 amendments were unconstitutional, if construed to change the distribution."
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3200.703,3207.957,"--Well, I think it's sufficiently clear though, here, that Congress did not intend to change those--"
1980.79-1890,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3207.957,3208.673,"Well, what if it isn't?"
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3210.356,3212.925,"--Well, then, I think you should consider very carefully the fact--"
1980.79-1890,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3212.925,3214.408,"Well, you haven't raised that, have you, anywhere?"
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3214.408,3214.977,--Yes.
1980.79-1890,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.977,3227.401,Have you ever resisted the Government's case on the ground that Congress has no power to change the distribution of the revenues from reserved lands?
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3227.401,3229.336,In the lower courts we did.
1980.79-1890,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3229.336,3231.986,And you've mentioned in your brief here--
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3231.986,3233.388,And here we've mentioned--
1980.79-1890,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3233.388,3234.604,"--Today, the Alaska Statehood Act, under the quid pro quo."
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3234.604,3235.038,--Right.
1980.79-1890,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3276.498,3290.325,"Well, what about the distribution of the revenues from non oil and gas leases, or produce from reserved lands in these refuges or--"
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3290.325,3304.966,"Well, I think, as was mentioned, I believe in response to a question from Justice White, the authority for those sales of surface resources stems from the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act."
1980.79-1890,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3593.833,3597.035,"--Mr. Koester, may I ask one question?"
1980.79-1890,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,3630.939,3640.228,"The only things that I can recall are in fact sand and gravel, and those were explicitly mentioned in the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act."
1980.79-1890,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3725.149,3727.084,"Mr. Claiborne, you have about two minutes left."
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3727.084,3728.686,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1890,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3762.09,3765.709,That can't be entirely true because weren't there sand and gravel sales?
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3765.709,3780.385,"I take it the word ""mineral"" here is used as meaning mineral other than sand and gravel specified in the Wildlife Revenue Sharing Act, though I don't for a fact know that there was any such revenue even though it's specified."
1980.79-1890,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3780.385,3782.57,"You mean, that there was any sand and gravel revenue?"
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3782.57,3784.103,Indeed.
1980.79-1890,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3790.526,3799.213,"Well, I didn't suggest that they could change the distribution between the United States and Alaska."
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3799.213,3800.648,It would be enormous--
1980.79-1890,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3800.648,3802.417,I think it would be your interest.
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3802.417,3808.738,"--The enormous difference is it goes between the 90 percent and the 25 percent, whoever it goes to in Alaska."
1980.79-1890,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3821.811,3830.934,"Well, you wouldn't suggest that the Alaska Legislature would be disentitled if you won this case to take the 25 percent that would go to the county?"
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3830.934,3834.553,--I suppose the duty of the Secretary would be to pay to the county.
1980.79-1890,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3837.671,3839.857,You probably don't even have an opinion on that.
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3839.857,3843.142,--It would not be our concern; that is so.
1980.79-1890,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3846.946,3847.429,Yes.
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3847.429,3849.648,--whatever the county is then required to do.
1980.79-1890,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3878.398,3887.004,"Does the word ""mineral"" or does the addition of the word... would the addition of the word ""mineral"" have any meaning whatsoever if the State wins this case?"
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3887.004,3893.591,It would accomplish precisely nothing because it would simply confirm the formula already enacted by the Mineral Leasing Act--
1980.79-1890,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3893.591,3900.445,"Would it affect, would it add something, would it change the distribution of any other?"
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3900.445,3902.228,"--Nothing whatever, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1890,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3902.228,3903.43,Mineral besides oil and gas?
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3903.43,3909.784,"It would be entirely surplusage, unless it applies to reserved lands."
1980.79-1890,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3925.576,3934.499,"Well, so you answer yes, if there were gold and silver discovered, the word ""minerals"" would have some meaning besides oil and gas?"
1980.79-1890,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3934.499,3934.918,Yes.
1980.79-1890,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3951.378,3952.128,"Thank you, gentlemen."
