2011.11-94,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We will hear argument next in Case 11-94, Southern Union Co. v. The United States."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,7.37,9.689,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,55.051,57.837,Was that jury trial constitutionally required?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,57.837,61.99,"Yes, I believe the jury trial was constitutionally required, Justice Scalia."
2011.11-94,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,90.724,92.39,What have we said is the a standard for fines?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,92.39,93.39,I'm sorry?
2011.11-94,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.39,99.46,What have we said with reference to a jury trial when fines are involved?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,102.662,116.505,"Well, you haven't used the word -- I mean, the distinction is between a serious offense and a petty offense and the places where you have drawn the line to conclude that a fine was too small to be worried about was $10,000 in the Muniz case."
2011.11-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.567,144.756,"Well, you have to do that because you have to know whether -- whether to impanel a jury before the jury comes in or before the jury comes in with a penalty, right?"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,144.756,145.941,"--Right, absolutely."
2011.11-94,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,151.679,157.063,"Do we assume for purposes of this case that your client, a corporation, has a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial?"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,157.063,172.758,"--I think the language of the Sixth Amendment couldn't be clearer, that it says in all criminal prosecutions the -- the accused is entitled to a jury trial, and all -- and you know, Article III, section 2, says in all jury trial -- in criminal prosecutions there's a jury trial."
2011.11-94,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,183.364,187.935,"What are the peers of the Southern Union Company that would sit on the jury, other railroads?"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,187.935,193.588,"Well, that would have been -- we'd probably have had a different outcome if that had been the case."
2011.11-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,239.117,246.74,But it's not -- the jury didn't say that the defendant was in violation only 1 day.
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,271.672,272.874,Right.
2011.11-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.883,291.419,The most -- the most you must read out of it.
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,291.419,293.019,--The most you must read out of it.
2011.11-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.019,293.654,Yes.
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,299.108,300.741,"Right, they could have."
2011.11-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.741,301.791,You can't say that for sure.
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,305.345,305.845,Right.
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,377.608,383.945,"I didn't think -- I mean I was -- I tend to be in dissent in these cases, so I don't have the authoritative view."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,384.797,386.831,"--More so than I do, Your Honor."
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,386.831,387.214,--What?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,387.214,388.416,More so than I do.
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,388.416,389.416,"Well, but no."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,467.016,478.824,"I think the -- the problem with that analysis, Justice Breyer, is I don't think the history, first of all, is anywhere near as clear in this context as it was, for instance, in Ice in terms of who decided what."
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,494.102,494.468,"No, no."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,534.193,540.481,--Because it never was traditionally up to the judge to go beyond whatever the maximum sentence provided was.
2011.11-94,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,557.609,562.496,"Mr. Phillips, do you think that you could say that there was no going above the statutory maximum here?"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,591.599,611.577,"Well, Justice Kagan, I would have thought, if anything, our case would be a much easier one, because what you -- what you basically are saying is that the district judge on the basis of a non-reasonable doubt standard and without a jury is making a determination that there have been 761 violations of Federal law, and on that basis imposing a sentence."
2011.11-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,624.653,636.561,Was there an objection at trial to the charge on the ground that it didn't instruct the jury to find the number of days of violation?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,636.561,638.445,"The United States didn't object to that; no, Your Honor."
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,647.233,648.302,You have no inducement to--
2011.11-94,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,648.302,657.208,You have the context where the entire offense of the corporation was consistent with what the indictment said.
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,670.282,670.968,"--Well, Justice Kennedy--"
2011.11-94,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,670.968,675.336,I think there's -- that's just more a sense of background.
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,682.59,683.341,--Right.
2011.11-94,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,683.341,689.595,"But I -- like Justice Ginsburg, I was very surprised the government didn't allege -- didn't stress waiver here."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,691.178,695.13,"Well, the -- yeah, we didn't submit an instruction."
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,776.55,785.138,"--Mr. Phillips, can you deal with one policy argument that your adversary raised that gives me some pause?"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,797.73,798.147,Right.
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,798.147,821.079,"But in fraud cases, in securities cases, sometimes the identity of victims is not determined for months, till months after the conviction, and the amount of fine and/or restitution is set at sentencing."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,824.031,824.898,Well--
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,824.898,835.419,--because -- or all of those procedures that have been set up by Congress to sort of set the amount of loss and repayment?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,839.74,841.323,--I dont -- I don't think so.
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,855.917,861.154,"Well, isn't -- aren't fines indeterminate here by definition, going back to Justice Kagan's question?"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,872.294,874.378,"Well, because it is set by the number of days--"
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,874.378,874.928,"--Well, so, so--"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,874.928,876.746,--which requires a predicate finding of how many days.
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,876.746,880.298,--So how about when a fine is set by the value of the loss?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,885.269,894.558,"And the government will have to figure out what it, what it -- its best take as to the value of the loss, and it's going to have to prove that if that's going to be the basis on which -- the fine."
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,894.558,900.529,"My goodness, I think there's lots of statutes that say something like this, that within limits, there's a particular--"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,900.529,902.279,"Well, if it's within limits, that is fundamentally different."
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,902.279,903.445,"--Yes, leave that out because--"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,903.445,903.812,Right.
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.812,905.212,"--It says, the fine:"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,913.485,913.818,Right.
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.818,915.234,"Now, you are going to send that to the jury."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,960.43,960.713,Right.
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,970.487,976.391,"You know, I understand you could say: That's what the Constitution provides and if you jury can't handle it, well, too bad."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,984.997,989.715,"Right, but I, I would hope that the Court wouldn't -- wouldn't let the tail wag the dog in that particular context."
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.715,990.115,Is that a tail?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1000.49,1001.223,"Well, recognizing--"
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1001.223,1007.426,--Is that an irrelevant consideration when you are trying to figure out whether an ambiguous history requires the jury trial?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1007.426,1017.432,"--Well, the ambiguous -- the part of the history that is unambiguous is the importance of the jury as a bulwark against the Federal Government and against the judge."
2011.11-94,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1017.432,1031.126,"Well, in 1790, in fact in the first Judiciary Act and in the Crimes Act of 1790, Congress enacted statutes, criminal statutes that authorized a fine and left it entirely to the discretion of the court."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1032.478,1036.93,If it -- up to the maximum.
2011.11-94,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1036.93,1038.398,There was no maximum.
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1038.398,1042.767,"Well, then there -- then it's an indeterminate sentence and, of course, they are not unconstitutional."
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1044.2,1050.336,"Congress permitted in 1790 indeterminate sentences as well, with no statutory maximum."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1050.336,1051.036,--Right.
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1051.955,1052.722,So they did both--
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1052.722,1053.238,Right.
2011.11-94,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1053.238,1053.938,--With respect to fines--
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1053.938,1054.255,Right.
2011.11-94,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1067.215,1070.084,"So if it's totally up to the discretion of the judge, that's fine."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1081.408,1082.458,--Absolutely.
2011.11-94,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1082.458,1083.508,What sense does that make?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1083.508,1084.427,Because--
2011.11-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.427,1087.712,Isn't that precisely what Apprendi said?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1087.712,1089.462,"--Well, that was the easy answer."
2011.11-94,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.462,1089.997,Yes.
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1090.663,1096.484,"But more fundamentally, and it's demonstrated in a case just like this one--"
2011.11-94,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1096.484,1102.138,"That may be what Apprendi said, but is it consistent with the original meaning of the jury trial right in the Sixth Amendment?"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1104.371,1117.065,"--Because -- but these statutes don't speak to what Apprendi was talking about, which is, a situation where you set a maximum above which the judge is permitted to go."
2011.11-94,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1183.823,1188.958,"What do you make of this old case that the government cites, U.S. v. Tyler?"
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1205.236,1209.038,"Well, Tyler is in many ways kind of imponderable."
2011.11-94,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1242.861,1262.656,"If you were to prevail, I think it would be a rather simple matter for the parties to frame an instruction: We find the defendant guilty and that the pollutant was retained for x days, much as what they do in a drug case."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1271.696,1272.298,They could do it that way or--
2011.11-94,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1272.298,1274.531,Is that the way it often works?
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1274.531,1278.368,"--Well, I would have thought the actually the indictment in this case was probably adequate for these purposes because it said"
2011.11-94,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1283.503,1286.89,"Well, that's why I'm surprised the government waived it, and I thought that's what the evidence showed anyway."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1289.842,1290.809,"Right, Your Honor."
2011.11-94,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.759,1305.185,"How, in general -- I mean, in the individual case, very offer a trial doesn't come up because 90 percent or more of the time it's just a question of the plea bargain, and therefore the defendant doesn't -- this is an added weapon for him, Apprendi."
2011.11-94,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1327.048,1327.631,No.
2011.11-94,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1370.308,1371.224,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1373.51,1377.145,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1399.91,1404.529,"You agree, don't you, that the statement in Oregon v. Ice was pure dicta?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1404.529,1432.18,"The Court's statement in Ice that if a purely algebraic application of Apprendi were followed it would sweep in things such as fines and restitution was not necessary to the judgment, Mr. Chief Justice, but it was part of the Court's rationale in adopting a different take on the meaning of the Apprendi line of cases then had previously been espoused."
2011.11-94,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1432.964,1449.324,"Mr. Dreeben, I think the reference, it was a fleeting reference to fines and it could have meant that the judge has discretion to set fines up to the maximum in the statute."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1451.11,1454.228,"--That is true, Justice Ginsburg."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.67,1502.043,This was -- you're not arguing that this rule will apply only to fines against corporations?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1504.728,1506.263,"Correct, Justice Scalia."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.263,1514.35,"It's up to the judge to decide how many days or what the value was, and so forth, right?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1514.35,1515.618,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.618,1522.022,"So the right to trial by jury to have that very important fact found does not exist, even for individuals?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1522.022,1529.878,"Justice Scalia, the tradition with respect to monetary fines is different than the tradition that the Court analyzed in Apprendi."
2011.11-94,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1541.686,1563.266,"I'm not sure how you can fully make that argument, because I thought the history was set forth fairly clearly in Apprendi that the early history was that nothing was given to the jury with respect to imprisonment or fines because most if not all sentences were indeterminate."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1574.491,1586.132,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think what Apprendi relied on primarily was the linkage between charge and penalty in English law, which was for felonies death."
2011.11-94,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1636.314,1650.455,"So explain to me, other than your reliance on Ice, some sort of tradition, which, you know, we can debate whether you can draw any conclusion from tradition in any of these areas, whether it's imprisonment or fines."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1667.334,1675.94,"--It's difficult to do that, Justice Sotomayor, because the Court fashioned the Apprendi rule from history and it limited it based on history in Ice."
2011.11-94,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1681.01,1682.56,I thought it was fairly simple algorithm.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1702.857,1713.148,"--Yes, and that was the argument of the Ice dissenters, that Apprendi states a rule that knows no exceptions for history or the impact on the states."
2011.11-94,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1724.705,1737.863,"So outside of an imprisonment, there is no other penalty that Congress could fashion because it has no history that wouldn't be within the purview of the judge?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1737.863,1740.465,"Well, of course the death penalty in Ring v. Arizona."
2011.11-94,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1774.972,1780.524,"But, Mr. Dreeben, wasn't the core domain defined by whether it related to a specific statutory offense?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1796.083,1798.785,"Well, it is of course relevant, Justice Kagan."
2011.11-94,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1798.785,1800.553,How does it not determine this context.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1800.553,1813.377,"Because the Court went on several paragraphs later in its opinion to describe what it would mean to adopt a formulaic complication of Apprendi, treating it just as a rule divorced from history."
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1928.652,1931.121,"It's kind of odd though, isn't it, I mean."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1946.464,1947.316,Uh-huh.
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1947.316,1964.675,"And under your submission if you have, you know, say a defendant is subject to one year and then if a particular fact is found and he's subject to two years, a fine of 20 but then 40, the judge would be constitutionally prohibited from increasing the prison increasing the prison sentence but would be perfectly free to increase the fine--"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1964.675,1965.71,Probably--
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1965.71,1970.495,--probably in a situation where the fine might be a lot more serious than the -- the time in prison.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1970.495,1981.653,"--Well, probably, Mr. Chief Justice, such a statute would be construed to make that fact one for the jury, since it dictates imprisonment increases as well as fine increases."
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2012.489,2014.774,But he operated -- he operated in a reasonable way.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2037.473,2037.957,--We do--
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2037.957,2046.328,"--and to carry that through, the judge is constrained by reason in -- in a way that the jury is not, and that's sort of -- that's part of the protection the Sixth Amendment provided."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2046.328,2051.982,--This Court has never recognized jury nullification as a constitutionally protected right.
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2218.807,2224.611,"It's a very -- very simple matter for the government to ask for jury findings on the questions at issue in this case, right?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2224.611,2227.23,"We could have done it here, Mr. Chief Justice."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.352,2317.304,"Mr. Dreeben, let's talk about Tyler."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2323.29,2323.973,--Correct.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.973,2325.825,It's a one-page opinion.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2340.752,2345.371,"Well, I don't agree with -- that it's later been characterized that way."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2378.877,2381.16,"The jury did find it in Tyler there, didn't it?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2388.4,2398.256,Because the Court stated that the part of the verdict which is subject -- which we're discussing right now -- is to be regarded as surplusage.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.471,2425.941,"It did it as a matter of statutory construction, right?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2425.941,2449.973,"Again, I would readily concede, Justice Scalia, that the Sixth Amendment does not appear in the Court's decision in Tyler, but it's difficult for me to understand that a Court that included Chief Justice Marshall, Justice Story and other members who were well-familiar with how common law operated would have adopted an interpretation of a statute that was facially unconstitutional."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.012,2463.864,"You -- you don't think they believed in the Apprendi doctrine, either, right?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2463.864,2464.4,--No.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.063,2488.431,"Might have felt that they had argument, right?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2488.431,2497.037,"I think they felt they did not need it, because the matter was sufficiently obvious that all members of a court could agree with it."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.037,2503.025,What about all of the 19th Century cases cited by Justice Thomas's concurrence in Apprendi?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2510.612,2511.547,There are three of them.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2515.433,2516.133,"Massachusetts, right."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2516.133,2522.837,"And the Court in that case, its analysis I think is even briefer than the analysis we just discussed in Tyler."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2522.837,2524.705,"Was it an argued case, at least?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2524.705,2530.925,"Justice Scalia, I'd have to go back and look at the opinion to tell you whether it was an argued case."
2011.11-94,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2536.496,2540.298,What makes acceptable common law?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2562.314,2565.516,"I doubt that I would say that, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.11-94,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2578.239,2579.441,"That -- you see, that's my problem."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2579.441,2594.951,"And I don't disagree with you on that point, Justice Sotomayor; but I think that there is one fact that truly stands out about fines, and that is they were historically at common law products of judicial discretion."
2011.11-94,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2594.951,2596.668,But so was imprisonment.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2596.668,2598.253,Imprisonment was rare.
2011.11-94,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2603.224,2611.044,"Well, how many statutes had anything but indeterminate fine structures?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2611.044,2612.496,I -- I'm sorry.
2011.11-94,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2612.496,2619.833,How many statutes in the early common law had anything but indeterminate fine statutes?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2619.833,2620.566,A few did.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.391,2657.541,"If it's varied and complicated, why should we -- assuming that it's ambiguous, why should we adopt the strange rule that the jury has to find the fact if you go to jail for two weeks, but doesn't have to find the fact if the amount of fines multiplied by number of days or by anything else will -- will make a pauper of you?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2661.493,2663.445,"Well, the fact that there were--"
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.445,2668.349,Unless compelled to do -- to do so by a clear common law history?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2668.349,2674.487,"--Well, none of those statutes assigned to the role of finding fines to juries."
2011.11-94,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2703.756,2704.639,What about the other two?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2711.926,2712.462,--Yes.
2011.11-94,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.462,2715.064,--And one of them was a very brief opinion from Massachusetts.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2715.064,2715.414,Yes.
2011.11-94,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2715.414,2718.432,"Well, Massachusetts counts in its favor, but perhaps the brief opinion doesn't."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2721.384,2723.368,Another one of them is Massachusetts.
2011.11-94,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2723.368,2724.753,Both Massachusetts.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2725.97,2726.253,Right.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2822.249,2826.618,What if the judge disagreed with the jury about whether there was even a violation?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2826.618,2830.003,The jury's acquittal would end the criminal case.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.003,2830.355,"No, no, no, no."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2833.641,2836.343,"Well, in that case--"
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.343,2839.045,How does -- how does he pick the number of days?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2841.011,2848.401,--Unless the judge finds that the evidence is insufficient under Jackson v. Virginia he's bound by the jury.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2848.401,2851.518,"No, he finds, you know, they could have come out that way, but -- but they were wrong."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2851.518,2871.497,"Then I think that he would be bound by the day of violation, $50,000 limit, subject to another provision of Federal law, 3573 (c), which provides in the case of an organization that a felony exposes the defendant to a $500,000 fine."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2897.964,2899.466,That is the whole problem.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2901.368,2903.451,"It's only the whole problem, Justice--"
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.451,2909.189,The judge doesn't have to find that this defendant beyond a reasonable doubt committed the violation on so many days.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2910.307,2911.074,--The only--
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.074,2915.878,"The judge could simply say well, you know, all in all, probably they did it -- probably."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2918.311,2924.215,"--It's only a problem, Justice Scalia, if the Sixth Amendment protects a defendant's right to it."
2011.11-94,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2987.974,2989.524,What other rules do you think are different?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3001.299,3012.523,"--In the right to counsel area, the Court has held that for misdemeanors, if the defendant goes to prison he is entitled to counsel, if the defendant does not, he is not entitled to counsel."
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.182,3029.301,What if you call it a misdemeanor but -- but impose a very heavy fine?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3030.751,3034.119,It is still a misdemeanor because the primary indication.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3034.119,3034.953,And you don't have right to counsel.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3036.655,3050.046,"That -- that is, this Court's jurisprudence; this Court in Scott and Argersinger draw the line at actual imprisonment, recognizing that deprivations of liberty have a more serious criminal implication than financial penalties."
2011.11-94,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3050.646,3062.603,"And that makes it clear to you that there is no overlap between property and liberty, so that no matter how much of your property are taken, under what circumstances, it's just property, it's no liberty involved?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3062.603,3068.174,"--There is, of course, an important constitutional value in deprivations of property."
2011.11-94,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3107.315,3113.988,"But you want us to write as part of that decision that no matter how great the fine, liberty is not involved?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3113.988,3119.892,"Well, liberty in the sense of imprisonment is not involved."
2011.11-94,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3122.844,3126.813,Liberty in the sense of what the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth amendment say.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3126.813,3132.366,--I don't think a corporation could be deprived of liberty within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3138.103,3139.47,You're -- I'm sorry.
2011.11-94,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3139.47,3143.09,"I guess you don't need counsel on any suits against corporations, right?"
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3143.09,3146.376,"--Well, I don't think corporations can appear in court except through counsel."
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3147.859,3150.411,"Your argument isn't limited to corporations, though."
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3150.411,3154.815,"--No, this is a rule that is responsive to the history with respect to--"
2011.11-94,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3154.815,3156.798,Do you need any more than that?
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3176.478,3177.578,--May I answer?
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3177.578,3178.278,Sure.
2011.11-94,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3178.278,3181.965,"Justice Breyer, we're not asking the Court to reconsider its Apprendi line of cases."
2011.11-94,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3187.067,3187.903,"Thank you, Counsel."
2011.11-94,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3189.969,3192.355,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3292.854,3301.626,What about the amount of loss issue that Justice Breyer raised with -- very complicated to determine what the amount of the loss is.
2011.11-94,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3301.626,3302.192,Right.
2011.11-94,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3352.189,3360.279,"If -- if -- on the question of the value of goods or the amount of the loss, what would the standard be?"
2011.11-94,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3366.116,3369.301,"Yes, I think that is precisely what the jury would be asked to find."
2011.11-94,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3402.891,3414.163,"I may have just forgotten, but does your brief go through the status of what lower courts have decided with respect to fines and how they're dealing with them?"
2011.11-94,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3418.067,3427.506,"Well, we do -- I mean, we do make the -- we demonstrated two things: One, that the lower courts pretty consistently have rejected the First Circuit's approach--"
2011.11-94,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3427.506,3427.972,--Okay.
2011.11-94,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3427.972,3437.445,"--and then two, that the amicus brief then focused more in terms of fines being used on a regular basis in that period of time in those jurisdictions."
2011.11-94,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3441.516,3441.982,"Thank you, Counsel."
