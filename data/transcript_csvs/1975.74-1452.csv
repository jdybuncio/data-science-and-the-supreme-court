1975.74-1452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.021,"We will hear arguments first this morning, a number 74-1452, Hospital Building Company against the Trustees of Rex Hospital."
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,16.315,19.317,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,125.67,128.336,But it still compares to small hospital?
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,128.336,134.797,"Your Honor, there is no evidence in the record as to its size in comparison with other hospitals."
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,145.924,152.753,"You say, tripling the number of beds. If it had 2, it would want 6, that is still triple, would that be tripling?"
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,152.753,155.347,"That, I understand that Your Honor."
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,240.719,247.894,"Mr. Train, let me ask you, perhaps the record clearly discloses this."
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,250.852,251.406,That is correct.
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,251.406,253.519,Is it owned by a group of physicians at all?
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,253.519,264.88,"No, the record show that it is owned by Chartered Medical Corporation which is a regional group or chain if you will, of hospitals and nursing homes located in Macon, Georgia."
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,264.88,271.262,Is this restricted to specified physicians?
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,271.262,279.808,"Your Honor, again I emphasize, we are dealing solely with the complaint since the case was dismissed on a motion under 12 (b) (6)."
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,286.286,299.613,"Well, you were speaking of the three hospitals competing and then usually a profit hospital is restricted in its admission policies to patients of those physicians who own it."
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,299.613,300.24,Your Honor --
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,300.24,302.661,Whether your complaint shows this.
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,302.661,305.676,"Your Honor, physicians do not own this hospital."
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,570.926,577.045,"Mr. Train, somewhere you comment on the Oregon Medical Society cases as you go along--"
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,577.045,582.97,I would be pleased to comment on that case right now Your Honor in the Supreme Court opinion.
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,616.958,621.597,We have changed since 25 years -- since that case was decided?
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,621.597,645.906,"Well, I believe, I can state my place that I think they have, I do not believe that case is authority in support of the Fourth Circuits opinion here since as I say in that case, the Supreme Court in commenting on the interstate commerce involvement made it clear that it was not substantial."
1975.74-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.03,692.098,"Well, Mr. Justice Jackson wrote the Oregon Medical Society a decision too, did he not?"
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,692.098,697.789,"He did indeed Your Honor and as I have just said, I think that can be squarely rationalized with our position here."
1975.74-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,697.789,711.884,"Well, why would you not say in the Oregon Medical Society case if you are right that although admittedly they were not many interstate context, there were some and if interstate commerce feels the effect, it does not make any difference if the conspiracy charged is local?"
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,711.884,719.643,"Because our position is not, Your Honor that every conspiracy or every effect on interstate commerce is actionable."
1975.74-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.011,1475.419,What was the basis of Congress' exercise of its jurisdiction to adopt this pervasive regulation of the delivery of hospital services?
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1475.419,1477.747,Its power under the Commerce Clause Your Honor.
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1506.708,1514.344,"Mr. Train, for pure curiosity; are there many fore profit hospitals in the southeast? Do you know?"
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1514.344,1516.17,I think there are a fair number.
1975.74-1452,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1529.137,1532.693,Are they increasing in number or decreasing?
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1532.693,1543.498,"I believe they, in fairness I could say they are increasing a little bit but I believe it is probably also fair to say the economy has been such that nobody is doing much anything right now."
1975.74-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1543.498,1549.634,"When you talked about pervasive regulation of the health care, are you relying primarily on the Social Security Act provisions --"
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1549.634,1554.96,"We are not talking so much about health care as such although we are relying on Social Security, we are also --"
1975.74-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.96,1556.857,That does not depend on the Commerce Clause.
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1556.857,1562.593,"Excuse me, I mean, I do not mean to say the Commerce Clause."
1975.74-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.593,1564.163,I was asking you a moment ago --
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1564.163,1567.197,I was thinking of Fair Labor Standards Act.
1975.74-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1578.563,1580.283,All of those depend on the commerce --
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1580.283,1595.095,"It is the General Welfare Clause but again, we think the point is that the enactment of such laws under any source of power for the Congress demonstrates there is a strong federal interest in the provision of hospital services and --"
1975.74-1452,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1595.095,1595.968,You know what?
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1620.978,1625.404,"We certainly do not rely on that, for the argument we make."
1975.74-1452,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1629.606,1646.919,"I was wondering whether you, you think in view of the arguments you make that the Sherman Act has substantially the same coverage with respect to in commerce and effect on commerce that the Fair Labor Standards Act has."
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1659.632,1660.034,Your Honor--
1975.74-1452,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1660.034,1666.56,"Try to think of one Fair Labor Standards Act, window washers of an office building are for example."
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1666.56,1667.444,You say are?
1975.74-1452,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1667.444,1668.173,They are.
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1669.749,1709.602,"Your Honor, I think you would, I think our position is you would have to have an analysis of the market and see what sort of facts were being alleged with respect to a particular occupation, for example, with respect to window washers it seems to me that if you had a case involving a Sherman Act complaint respecting a conspiracy window washers just like you had complaints in which Courts have upheld with respect to employing plasterers and with respect to journeymen or rather wholesale plumbers, you would have to see whether there was a substantial effect on interstate commerce."
1975.74-1452,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1709.602,1710.198,They would be covered?
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1710.198,1711.757,Absolutely.
1975.74-1452,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1715.768,1723.421,"If you had a small town with three restaurants in it and two of them decided they were going to fix prices to put them out of business, they would clearly be covered--"
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1723.421,1724.876,"No, not necessarily clearly."
1975.74-1452,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1740.928,1751.616,"Let us assume that the restaurants in question, instead of purchasing $112,000.00 in interstate commerce, purchased $12,000.00."
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1751.616,1787.023,"As I recall that the lowest amount that I recall seeing with respect to quantitative, the quantitative aspect of purchases as the recent Seventh Circuit decision as to which certiorari was earlier denied the finest P. Ernst case where there were some statement that this contractor who had been, I believe indicted under the Sherman Act, had purchased some $10,000.00 or rather have received some $10,000.00 from HUD in connection with the building project."
1975.74-1452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1787.023,1793.169,"(Inaudible) and upon how large percentage the $12,000.00 was of the restaurants total purchases?"
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1793.169,1799.888,Of the restaurant's total purchases and also of the total purchases with respect to the market.
1975.74-1452,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1799.888,1802.787,Not only -- no bright land but no land at all.
1975.74-1452,0,33238,john_k_train_iii,,1802.787,1825.544,I believe that is certainly true in particularized case by case determination based on a pragmatic economic judgment and we believe that here the pragmatic judgment is the congress would have intended to protect a market from the elimination of one out of three competitors.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,1825.544,1829.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.167,1952.7,Suppose you know there is provision on the Robinson Patman act that exempts hospital or at least has a different provision with respect to the purchase of products by not for profit hospitals.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,1962.293,1970.479,"Your Honor, my first answer to that of course is number one, we are not dealing with the Robinson Patman Act but the Sherman Act and it is--"
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.479,1978.221,I realize that but I am suggesting Congress in enacting that must have made some assumption with respect to the transactions engaged in that hospital.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,1978.221,1999.048,"Your Honor, I would submit that and I have not checked the legislative history of that part of the Robinson Patman Act but I would submit and we do not contend here that hospitals could not conspire in such a way as to common in the Sherman Act and petitioner makes the argument here that this is a constitutional question."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.59,2037.546,The only one the drugs come from out-of-state but --
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2037.546,2062.433,"Or, or Your Honor if the hospital as is in most of these supreme Court cases, if the hospital conspires with the out of State drug company, such as to Frankfurt Distilleries case, such that you have a restraint on that interstate flow of goods, not a indirect restraint, a direct restraint and the Eight Circuit and the Bensinger case talked about the amount of money that was exact issue."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.049,2104.377,There must be an out of State conspirator
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2104.377,2104.824,Your Honor I do not think your perhaps --
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2106.903,2107.328,Excuse me.
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2107.328,2109.267,You do not have to have an out of State conspirator.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2109.267,2138.691,"No Your Honor, you do not need to have one but I think if you do not have one as in Goldfarb, this local activity being restrained must be an intrical and necessary part of this Interstate commerce and I submit ours is not that case and that is what I would like to get to now because these local activities such as the purchase of goods and drugs by Rex Hospital, the receipt of -- not by Rex Hospital by plaintiff and the receipt of a products used at the hospital."
1975.74-1452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2167.313,2170.622,(Inaudible) would it not?
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2170.622,2172.092,Yes it would be Your Honor.
1975.74-1452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2172.092,2173.599,It came in the interstate commerce did it not?
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2173.599,2175.807,"At one time, yes it did."
1975.74-1452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2177.388,2180.051,"The replacements come in interstate commerce, do they not?"
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2180.051,2181.304,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.205,2202.489,"But with respect to drugs, is it not more or less of a kind of continuous flow which would distinguish it from the initial purchase of a bed and then replacing it 15 years later or replacing a chair in the same way."
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2202.489,2204.394,"Certainly, it is a legislature."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.18,2296.918,"Mr. Bolze, is not that difference between the Oregon Medical case in this, that as a matter of fact, there was a finding of no adverse effect on interstate commerce."
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2296.918,2297.103,Exactly.
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.103,2308.369,Whereas here we have a complaint with no trial yet being held and there is an allegation of an adverse effect namely that there would be a lesser flow of goods and there would be if the hospitals were permitted to expand.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2308.369,2315.747,That is the allegation here Your Honor but we are taking that allegation as true that that restraint is not sufficient and I submit Your Honor--
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.747,2319.788,"I understand that, I just go in to the question of whether Oregon Medical controls."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.159,2335.004,The allegation that must be taking as true in the present posture of this case.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2335.004,2349.05,"Yes, but an adverse effect on a delay and expansion of a hospital by four months, by 91 beds and therefore there would be some delay in drugs coming in to that --"
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.05,2352.177,"That is the different, are you saying that adverse effect is not sufficient."
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2360.526,2370.44,"Yes, but I would say Your Honor on count three in Oregon Medical which one I am discussing, the first two counts the District Court found, there was no restraint or trait on the facts."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.795,2387.973,The reason it was not sufficient was that there was no evidence according to the findings of any adverse effect at all.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2387.973,2400.389,"The Supreme Court said that these flow of goods across State lines which would be restrain, was not sufficient, it was sporadic and incidental."
1975.74-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2403.797,2417.095,"What I do understood fully what you have in mind when you said that one of the patient goes to a hospital, the dominant, I think was the word you used, that dominant relationship is a personal one with doctors and nurses."
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2439.647,2440.624,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2462.694,2465.968,"It would usually involve financing, that was the link was it not?"
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2465.968,2484.254,"Yes Your Honor and 55% of the mortgages in that case came from DC in the Fairfax County which is substantial and this Court found that without that, the mortgagees said we will not grant the mortgage unless the title search is made on the title search of what was being price fixed."
1975.74-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2491.649,2514.926,"The dominant relationship in parallel that you were making or that I am making, the dominant relationship is still a very personal one between a client and lawyer to whether he is dealing with title search, whether without the connection with financing of the purchase."
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2521.705,2541.753,"If I put that much emphasis on the personal relationship, I am talking about the provision of hospital services which includes I mean the primary service you get in a hospital, I think it is a service provided the room, the nurses, the doctors, the use of that operating room."
1975.74-1452,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2683.019,2692.762,Would it make any difference if the payment were made by travelers on the rolling?
1975.74-1452,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2692.762,2695.471,Why you are putting an emphasis on Bluecross in North Carolina?
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2695.471,2702.546,"No, only because Bluecross in North Carolina is the intermediary for Medicare, if it was some other insurance company in North Caroline, I do not think it would make any difference."
1975.74-1452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.14,2719.532,What is that that some of us said in this Solicitor General's brief is just factually inaccurate?
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2719.532,2728.857,"Yes, the allegations in the complaint and both petitioner itself, it is -- they just make the Statement, they have these receipts of payments on Medicare and Bluecross but it so happens they do not come across State lines."
1975.74-1452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2728.857,2731.396,(Voice Overlap).
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2731.396,2737.403,They received some insurance payments in interstate but the vast majority did not.
1975.74-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2845.775,2852.362,The Madison's view was rejected by this Court in Butler against the United States in favor of Hamilton's view I think was not it?
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2852.362,2868.994,"I do not it was rejected on this question to the general welfare clause Your Honor, clearly you cannot expand and I think it is clear that this Court has never interpreted the grant of power under the commerce clause to congress as being as broad as their power of funding on a general welfare clause which is what is being argued here."
1975.74-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2868.994,2877.328,I thought you were saying that this general welfare clause is limited to the areas in which congress had an independent source of jurisdiction.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2877.328,2878.078,No Your Honor.
1975.74-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2891.743,2894.651,But it does give them the power to spend for any --
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2894.651,2895.096,Yes.
1975.74-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2895.096,2897.412,But it is not specifically limited --
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2897.412,2899.647,But not to control intrastate Commerce.
1975.74-1452,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2901.055,2905.174,We go back again to this business of Medicare payments.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2905.174,2906.374,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-1452,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2906.374,2917.427,I think the complaint alleges that a substantial number of persons hospitalized in Nevada area come from outside the State.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2929.974,2945.183,"Your Honor, first there is some allegation of, some treatment of patients from outside the State and this brief before the supreme Court petitioner apparently has dropped that as one of its arguments but be that is not may -- I am sure their hospital treats some patients from outside the State and they might received Medicare."
1975.74-1452,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2974.315,2977.346,"That is the argument but it is still in the complaint, is it not?"
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,2986.413,2987.752,"Yes Your Honor, still on the complaint."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.579,3099.361,"Well, if the dollar amount is irrelevant."
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3113.857,3115.685,You Honor your reconcile it.
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.231,3145.173,"There are two differences, one there are more hospitals and two, you close down instead of preventing expansion?"
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3145.173,3154.093,"Well, there is one third of very important, when those hospitals alleged and restrained, were in two State, Philadelphia and Denver or Pennsylvania and Denver."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.093,3157.59,"If were in one state, you would say the case would have been decided differently?"
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3157.59,3161.178,"No, Sir I do not say because we are a 100 hospitals involved."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.664,3163.781,Then you do not rely on two State points.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3170.84,3172.567,"Your Honor, I would not rely on all three."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3181.429,3191.532,"You know 100 hundred hospital, what effect on interstate commerce is relevant, other than purchases of supply across State line?"
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3191.532,3204.19,"Well, I think closing 100 hundred hospitals compared to a four month delay in the expansion of 91 bed hospital is just vastly different, as to its effect it could have on the commercial competition."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3204.19,3207.67,The difference is entirely in the dollar value of the two situations?
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3207.67,3213.487,I say you can look at the dollar value Your Honor to say whether or not it would have substantial effect on competition.
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3215.939,3219.454,It is not competition in the providing of hospital services --
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3219.454,3219.609,"No, That is correct."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3219.609,3222.953,Rather the completion in selling goods and services to hospital?
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3222.953,3225.194,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.194,3228.22,"You say there is a deminimous effect here, and there is a significant there."
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3228.829,3238.145,I say that the effect could be such as to cause a suppression in the commercial competition with those goods and services because there are so many coming in.
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.883,3242.353,I want to be sure I understand your theory.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3249.894,3255.823,"I contend there be some effect on the flow of goods, I contend there to be no effect on as far as restraining trade."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.823,3259.305,"Well, but the only effect in other cases is an effect on flow of goods."
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3272.436,3283.976,"No, I guess there is -- I feel the fact that the defendant there was operating in a two State market and it was confirmed with 100 hospitals."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.976,3284.964,We is this your position again?
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3284.964,3287.416,"Well, I do not think I am Your Honor with all do respect."
1975.74-1452,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3287.416,3290.213,Is it not critical that there were two State involve there.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3295.268,3299.428,"You Honor, I would submit that it is a question of degree in each case and I think there it was critical."
1975.74-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3507.968,3515.758,"If these cases are not from afar, and perhaps even below increases in lot of other areas I am not sure how important it is?"
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3515.758,3521.412,"That I do not know Your Honor, just because of that, there in fact, there are State statutes very similar to there."
1975.74-1452,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3611.126,3617.172,Your reference to Justice Black I think he dissented in the Oregon Medical case.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3617.172,3620.37,He may have Your Honor.
1975.74-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3622.367,3633.129,But ambiguously he did not indicate whether he thought the findings of fact were erroneous or whether he thought the evaluation of the legal aspects were erroneous.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3633.129,3641.905,"Yes Your Honor, but in concludes we do fear on these type of cases unless -- since no clear line and no clear rule can be laid down."
1975.74-1452,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3665.359,3667.636,Can we read Justice Black's opinion in the the --
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3667.636,3667.755,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1452,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3667.755,3671.563,-- in the Oregon case in full in two lines.
1975.74-1452,1,38863,ray_s_bolze,,3678.712,3688.857,"Yes, Your Honor I take it, as I said, I was quoting South East underwriters because it is a strong case for Sherman Act enforcement does have this Statement."
1975.74-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3696.537,3697.183,Thank you gentlemen.
