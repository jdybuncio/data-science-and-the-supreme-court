1972.71-858,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.519,We’ll hear arguments now in number 71-858 Ricci against the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and others.
1972.71-858,0,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,8.735,12.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.335,234.991,Let’s assume a rule of the exchange that it was authorized to issue and which was not disproved by the Secretary.
1972.71-858,0,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,242.773,252.549,"Well, I think if a rule would be a violation of the antitrust laws, I suppose that could be attacked here of course we’re not --"
1972.71-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.549,262.106,You wouldn’t say that -- you wouldn’t say that Congress intended that any rule that the Secretary didn’t disprove should be immune from antitrust attack?
1972.71-858,0,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,262.106,263.715,Absolutely not.
1972.71-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.019,272.06,But that’s the scheme under this Act.
1972.71-858,0,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,277.069,283.115,With regard to trading requirements and terms and conditions of contracts this is the case.
1972.71-858,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.443,290.937,"Well, let’s just assume, one of the rules about trading requirements otherwise would violate the antitrust laws?"
1972.71-858,0,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,292.495,294.584,"Yes, we would think that it is."
1972.71-858,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,882.746,884.502,Thank you Mr. Torshen.
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,885.826,890.578,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-858,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,957.708,965.173,Do you agree with your friend that the agency cannot give any monetary redress or not?
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,965.173,970.178,"I, number one, the Exchange if I may answer your question obliquely."
1972.71-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1077.721,1088.19,Would it be fair that the Commodities Exchange Commission could decide that with any way help this antitrust case.
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1088.19,1089.661,Thank you Justice Marshall.
1972.71-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1140.712,1149.427,"Let’s put in another way, suppose they rule with you on every point you say, does the antitrust violation go?"
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1149.427,1150.197,Is the antitrust violation --
1972.71-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.197,1153.298,Would that insulate?
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1153.298,1154.751,There would be justification.
1972.71-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1154.751,1158.325,Will it insulate you from an antitrust case?
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1158.325,1185.244,"In the event, the rule that I seek to apply here is that in the event the Exchange were proceeding in good faith in fulfillment of its congressionally mandated self-regulatory system and impose a limit on competition or even a per se what would normally be a per se antitrust violation, it would be justified and it would be immunized."
1972.71-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1203.339,1208.875,Is there anything in any of this that says specifically that this is in lieu of [Voice Overlap]?
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1208.875,1213.531,"No, there is -- there is no reference to the antitrust law as anywhere in the statute."
1972.71-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1213.531,1216.272,How could this possibly immunize you?
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1216.272,1219.574,There is no immunization by express grant.
1972.71-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1220.169,1224.78,So where is your primary jurisdiction if it doesn’t immunize you?
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1224.78,1233.124,"Well, Your Honor the system that has been established here and I might say that -- I want to ask you a question directly."
1972.71-858,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1324.899,1326.402,Or damages?
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1326.402,1337.146,"No damages, but you see in the Silver case, the court recognized that there was not this agency review."
1972.71-858,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1503.177,1504.299,"Now, to help me out --"
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1504.299,1504.415,Yes.
1972.71-858,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1504.415,1511.518,-- would you relate what you just been outlining to the issues of this case under the complaint.
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1511.518,1516.603,"In this instance, there is nothing more or less than a dispute over membership."
1972.71-858,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1566.36,1580.581,"Hypothetically, if you had a situation where there was a claim where the membership was in process of transfer by a forgery."
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1580.581,1580.962,Yes.
1972.71-858,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1580.962,1586.474,That would be under the disciplinary reach of the Commission from your point of view.
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1586.474,1586.714,Oh!
1972.71-858,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.36,1657.764,"You don’t want us to go any further in Silver, do you?"
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1657.764,1658.248,No!
1972.71-858,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.483,1675.67,Because Silver said -- Silver said that to the extent some rules are necessary to carry out the objective of the Act.
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,1678.205,1689.984,"Of course, that’s all I would suggest and is a matter of fact, I am -- I feel that Justice Stewart and his dissenting opinion in Silver which was referred to by colleague."
1972.71-858,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2141.224,2149.933,It had been in my understanding that the District Court disregarded those depositions and that therefore the Court of Appeals also did and took the allegations of the plaintiffs are true.
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2149.933,2162.922,"Your Honor, I am force to say that this particular District Court would have great difficulty understanding what the judge was doing, but I have cited to a transcript which indicates that he did take it into effect."
1972.71-858,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2185.185,2192.778,So I am not mistaken that in my understanding that the Court of Appeals at least understood that he did not take any consideration --
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2192.778,2199.105,The Court of Appeals -- the Court of Appeals read the same transcript and said he didn’t believe.
1972.71-858,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2202.713,2204.071,And it was a motion to dismiss so that --
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2204.071,2207.089,And it was a motion to dismiss and we have an attack for Court of Appeals decision.
1972.71-858,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2207.089,2216.896,"And therefore, even though you know you may be quite right if this is frivolous and wrong-headed lawsuit with no merit to it."
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2223.336,2237.657,"And if you take the allegations to the complainant as true, you’ll find that there is an indication that notice of the Exchange actions did occur, but there’s also the weaselly whistle expression that they didn’t get notice of the transfer to John Wright."
1972.71-858,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2250.982,2262.607,"Well let me post this way, do you deny that the allegations of the complaint just reading them state a colorable cause of action under antitrust laws?"
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2262.607,2284.547,"Yes, I do deny it because I feel that the allegations of the complaint are merely conclusory allegations in an attempt to get to a Federal Court instead of a state court where they may have been a commercial dispute between these two parties which could have been answered in the state court, but instead they added a few words of willful, conspiracy, and so on."
1972.71-858,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2302.816,2312.474,"Well, then as I understand it, do you think that Court of Appeals was wrong in holding that the complaint did allege cause of action under the antitrust laws."
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2312.474,2312.785,I think the Court of --
1972.71-858,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2312.785,2320.301,And that the – and that the District Court was and that Court of Appeals should simply have affirmed the dismissal by the District Court.
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2320.301,2330.569,"I think the Court of Appeal was wrong first in finding that the complaint stated the proper course of action and secondly, not finding that the matter was handled by the District Court as a motion summary judgment."
1972.71-858,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.569,2338.204,"Yes, but Mr. Freeman, let’s assume that -- let’s assume that we disagree with you on that. Do you think you’ve brought your case?"
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2338.204,2339.901,"No, no, I --"
1972.71-858,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.901,2349.482,"How do you suppose that if you think a complaint is true, it also states of the rules of exchange are violated?"
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2359.122,2360.204,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-858,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.204,2361.72,Which is different in Silver.
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2363.94,2376.228,"No place for Silver, a place here and I would -- I mean I think that the issue of primary jurisdiction should be decided by this Court rather than to throw this matter out as a frivolous complaint."
1972.71-858,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.47,2406.153,"Well of course, it really stated difficult but it also stated in violation of the exchange rule."
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2406.153,2406.866,That’s right.
1972.71-858,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.866,2409.9,And that the agency should deal with it first.
1972.71-858,1,34461,lee_a_freeman_jr,,2409.9,2435.701,"The agency should deal with that issue first, yes Your Honor, and I think in that way, a judicial time has saved the agency can -- there isn’t a proper accommodation between the two systems, the integrity of the regulatory system which is the Commodities Exchange Authority and the Commission and the Secretary is preserved and you’ll follow the dictates of the various decision that have recently been rendered."
1972.71-858,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2437.309,2440.174,Thank you Mr. Freeman.
1972.71-858,2,33272,jerome_h_torshen,,2442.365,2445.617,"No, I don’t think that a reply is necessary, Your Honor."
1972.71-858,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2445.617,2446.286,Thank you gentlemen.
