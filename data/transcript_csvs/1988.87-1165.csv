1988.87-1165,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.297,"We'll hear argument first this morning on No. 87-1165, California v. the United States."
1988.87-1165,0,31993,jerome_c_muys,,11.999,15.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1589.459,1600.786,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1165,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1668.551,1679.278,"Mr. Kneedler, do you think the position the government is taking now is consistent with the position that the government took in oral argument of the Arizona against California II in 1983?"
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1679.278,1680.42,"--Yes I, yes I do."
1988.87-1165,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1823.381,1825.594,You say a water right is a property right.
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1825.594,1827.615,"A water right, their water right is a property right."
1988.87-1165,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1849.158,1855.132,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, the government took a different position initially, didn't it, in the District Court?"
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1855.132,1855.783,Yes.
1988.87-1165,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1880.683,1881.181,"Well, what changed?"
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1886.304,1889.256,"--Well, a number of things, a number of things happened, a number of things led us to--"
1988.87-1165,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1889.256,1890.719,The government lost the case.
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1890.719,1892.818,"--No, well, that happened chronologically."
1988.87-1165,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1959.443,1962.145,"Well, where do you think this should proceed?"
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1964.576,1976.233,"--Well, our position in the past has been, and continues to be, that, that the boundary dispute, as Petitioners claim, and as we have said from the beginning, is an essential element of a water rights adjudication."
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.519,2011.477,"Well, yes, but your claim, your claim has been that the Secretary's ruling should be accepted as a final determination."
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2011.477,2013.767,That was our position in Arizona against California II.
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.233,2031.889,"So you, so you... if you prevail in this case, and the case cannot be adjudicated, you think Arizona against California has to be re-opened."
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2033.762,2036.962,--It's going to have to be re-opened anyway to incorporate the final determination.
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.755,2044.268,"But there won't be... if you win there won't be a final determination, any kind of a determination in this case."
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2044.268,2047.311,"--Yes, in the case in District Court, that's correct."
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.216,2057.419,And I suppose the United States would then petition this Court to re-open.
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2057.419,2068.825,"After we see the Court's opinion, we would obviously move to do that and consider that right away, because we do not have an interest in delaying the Court's resolution of this."
1988.87-1165,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2068.825,2073.139,"Well, if the government didn't petition to re-open, I suppose one of the states could."
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2073.139,2074.519,I think that's probably right.
1988.87-1165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.821,2114.566,"Let me ask at that point, Mr. Kneedler, you say that the water right is a property right, which certainly seems sensible."
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2119.138,2120.17,--Yes.
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.521,2154.451,"Yes, but that's for a whole river system."
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2154.451,2163.838,"Yes, and Congress determined that it would only waive the immunity of the United States to suit involving water rights when there was a general stream adjudication, and for very good reasons."
1988.87-1165,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2323.653,2329.026,Have you taken a position on the case or controversies suggestion of the Court of Appeals?
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2330.906,2331.667,In the Article 3?
1988.87-1165,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2373.955,2378.417,"Well, if the only basis for standing is water rights, this has to be a water rights suit."
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2378.818,2379.819,That's correct.
1988.87-1165,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.819,2382.451,You can't litigate a suit on the basis of something that doesn't represent your standing.
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2382.451,2383.831,That's right.
1988.87-1165,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.376,2391.627,So the Quiet Title Act is just out of it.
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2396.469,2398.071,--That's correct.
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2432.604,2442.03,"But the Quiet Title Act aside, the question is a relationship between the Administrative Procedure Act and the McCarran Act."
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2442.03,2443.22,--That's correct.
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.22,2448.035,Whether that McCarran Act is the statute that takes the case out of the APA.
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2448.035,2449.194,That's correct.
1988.87-1165,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.622,2530.809,And is the purport of that remark that the McCarran Act would authorize this determination in the confines of the original suit?
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2530.809,2548.971,"The McCarran Amendment itself would not apply to the original action, although the United States, having intervened, would allow the adjudication there, but the last provision, the last section of the McCarran Amendment says that nothing in that statute grants consent of the United States to be sued for adjudication of interstate water systems."
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.941,2558.925,"Mr. Kneedler, do we have in the record a piece of paper where you withdrew your sovereign immunity?"
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2562.208,2562.838,"No, no."
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.011,2570.313,--And then a piece of paper reasserting it?
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2570.313,2571.164,--Yes.
1988.87-1165,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.9,2583.963,But you never did assert that in the District Court?
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2583.963,2585.624,"We did not, no."
1988.87-1165,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.877,2603.595,"Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you in that connection, because you explained the reasons for the change of position, had you not changed your position, had let the case go to judgment, your position today would be that you could collaterally attack that judgment?"
1988.87-1165,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2603.595,2604.506,That's correct.
1988.87-1165,2,21718,dale_t_white,,2895.589,2901.563,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2974.32,2981.856,"I'm curious why, is it because you lost in the District Court that you want another shot at it?"
1988.87-1165,2,21718,dale_t_white,,2994.753,2997.404,"Well, there are a couple of responses to that."
1988.87-1165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.023,3176.871,Is the government's position as to the exact location of the boundaries different now than it was back in the 1960s?
1988.87-1165,2,21718,dale_t_white,,3176.871,3189.74,"The government has consistently taken the position that the, with respect to the hay and wood reserve boundary of Fort Mojave reservation, that it is 9,114 acres."
1988.87-1165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3196.315,3200.106,"Yes, well, the government lost that, before the Special Master."
1988.87-1165,2,21718,dale_t_white,,3200.106,3206.311,--Because Special Master Rifkin decided that the government survey that was inconsistent with its litigating position--
1988.87-1165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.311,3215.167,We decided then that... we didn't think it was necessary to decide the issue at that time.
1988.87-1165,2,21718,dale_t_white,,3215.167,3216.689,"--That's right, because--"
1988.87-1165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.689,3219.15,And then we did it again in 1983.
1988.87-1165,2,21718,dale_t_white,,3219.15,3223.893,"--Well, the Court decided in Arizona v. California I that it would not decide it."
1988.87-1165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3242.674,3252.081,"But as far as the actual amount of land involved, the government's position is the same, and the tribes' position is the same as it was in the 1960s?"
1988.87-1165,2,21718,dale_t_white,,3252.081,3255.123,For Fort Mojave reservation and for the Colorado River--
1988.87-1165,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3255.123,3259.165,"But there have been some new things come up from other reservations, haven't there?"
1988.87-1165,2,21718,dale_t_white,,3259.165,3263.128,--Only these three reservations are involved in these boundary issues.
1988.87-1165,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3457.929,3466.445,Are you saying that the titled Indian lands can't even come up collaterally in some other suit?
1988.87-1165,2,21718,dale_t_white,,3477.922,3486.528,"Those cases, I believe you're referring to the disestablishment cases, come up somewhat frequently, and the Court has had occasion to resolve those."
1988.87-1165,3,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3510.266,3512.106,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1165,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3571.074,3574.878,"But Dugan was before the enactment of Quiet Title Act, wasn't it?"
1988.87-1165,3,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3574.878,3575.656,Yes.
1988.87-1165,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3625.721,3632.604,"Well, maybe all we meant was that there are other ways to test water rights without suing the United States."
1988.87-1165,3,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3632.604,3633.526,Well--
1988.87-1165,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3633.526,3637.069,"I mean, we're just talking here about a preclusion of suit against the United States."
1988.87-1165,3,31993,jerome_c_muys,,3637.069,3653.528,"--Well, the Indian claims, though, in Arizona against San Carlos Apache, were claims brought in the federal district court against the United States and all other water users, because many times the United States has water rights on behalf of other federal agencies that are inconsistent with Indian claims."
1988.87-1165,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3705.584,3706.225,"Thank you, Mr. Muys."
