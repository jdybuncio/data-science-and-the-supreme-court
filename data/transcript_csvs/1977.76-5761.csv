1977.76-5761,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.475,"We will hear arguments next in 5761 Simpson v. The United States and 5796, the consolidated case."
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,40.433,43.561,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,180.083,189.149,"Well when you say the Blockburger test is not one where you compare the statute, but where you simply compare the evidence in each particular case?"
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,189.149,194.471,"No, I think the test is set down in Blockburger, is that you compare the statutes."
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.471,212.146,"Well, then I do not see how you can advance the proposition that you compare the weapon involved in each particular case because here clearly a dangerous weapon or a device includes other things than a firearm?"
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,212.146,220.339,"That is correct, but I do say that you have to look at the factual elements in Fifth Amendment of the statute."
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.594,244.361,"Well, then it is a case by case, exhibit by exhibit test so far as your concern?"
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,244.361,251.616,"I believe that, that interpretation can be used and should be used in a case where the facts do not really fit in either one of them."
1977.76-5761,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,251.616,262.369,"Well, your submission is as I understood it that whenever the weapon is a firearm then these charges are necessarily duplicities?"
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,262.369,265.1,"Yes, Your Honor, that is exactly my position."
1977.76-5761,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,265.1,269.716,"But if, that were a hand grenade?"
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,269.716,278.11,"Well, then I do not think you could prosecute under 924 (c) because that specifically has to be a firearm."
1977.76-5761,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,307.507,314.733,But it is only when the firearms involved that this question could ever arise because that is the only time that 924 (c) is involved?
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,314.733,315.901,That is correct.
1977.76-5761,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,315.901,317.379,"That is your point, is it not?"
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,317.379,318.822,That is exactly my point.
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.822,333.945,"My brother Stewart asked you a question a moment ago which I am sure he knew the meaning of it and which you doubtless know the meaning of it, which I think I did not understand the meaning of one of the words and that is that the indictment is necessarily duplicities this."
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,336.281,336.783,"Well, I think --"
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.783,339.55,If you know (Voice Overlap) I think may be I used the wrong word?
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,339.55,342.81,"Well, I think it is duplicities or multiplicities."
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.81,344.29,What does that mean?
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,344.29,349.316,That they are charging two distinct crimes out of the same offense.
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.316,355.362,"And what is the objection to that, Blockburger?"
1977.76-5761,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,355.362,358.78,"Well, in delinquency United States case is like that."
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,358.78,362.584,Any other objections?
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,362.584,376.313,"I think I stated it simply to the District Court and again in same scenario that they have charged the petitioners here with robbing a bank using a gun, and using a gun to rob a bank, and I think that is duplicitous."
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.948,431.401,"Where was that statement by Representative Poff made to constitute, do you know it was on the floor --?"
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,431.401,432.894,I believe its during the floor debates.
1977.76-5761,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.894,435.598,During the floor debate?
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,435.598,445.428,And there was as pointed out in Counsel for the Government's brief and abrupt cessation of talking about that amendment or that part of it.
1977.76-5761,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,448.846,462.987,Is there any kind of a weapon or any kind of a dangerous device that could be used in your view that would be sustainable with convictions under both Sections as you have here.
1977.76-5761,0,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,475.502,515.379,"Mr. Chief Justice I do not believe if there is. I believe that Congress provided the enhanced penalty under 2113 (d) if any sort of weapon, dangerous weapon or device was used and endangered anybody's life and I think that 924 (c) was enacted in response to the growing concern for the use of firearm specifically in committing crimes and I have to agree with Representative Poff's comments that it was not intended to be used in cases where there was already an enhanced punishment provided."
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,830.057,832.813,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.76-5761,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1061.698,1075.222,"Mr. Farr can I interrupt, supposing a man was indicted for violating 924 (c)(2) carrying a firearm, could he for the same transaction also be indicted for violating 924 (c)(1)?"
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1075.222,1080.514,That is the situation that came up in the Crew case Your Honor and the Fourth Circuit held he could not.
1977.76-5761,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1080.514,1082.696,"Well, would you think that decision is right?"
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1082.696,1094.233,"I think in terms of whether he could be indicted, it perhaps may not be right, but I think he could not properly be convicted and consecutively sentenced for both the violation of (c)(1) and (c)(2)."
1977.76-5761,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1096.929,1101.805,"But don't those two Sections have an element, the other does not?"
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1111.442,1120.875,"Well, I think that even if that were true that there is no evidence that Congress intended in fact to get at the situation where you are carrying one yourself and also --"
1977.76-5761,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1120.875,1129.701,"But what other than the lateral language of the statute, I mean, then you are not relying on the lateral language, what evidence is that the Congress intended to get a 2113 (d)?"
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1129.701,1139.807,"Well, I think we are not necessarily relying, we are not suggesting that you could rely only on the language of 924 (c) in order to support this."
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1193.462,1202.292,Is there any place to show how many bank robberies are made with non lethal weapons?
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1202.292,1204.089,I do not have any statistics on that.
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1204.089,1206.28,Have you ever heard of them?
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1206.28,1212.2,"Well, I think its possible to, you say non lethal weapons meaning not a firearm?"
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1212.2,1220.184,"Non lethal -- not those mentioned in this statute, pin it down?"
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1220.184,1221.7,In that by 924 (c).
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1232.215,1233.909,How does that cut the --
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1233.909,1234.51,Pardon me?
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1234.51,1236.505,Does that help or hurt you?
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1236.505,1240.494,"As far as I concerned it is, it does not necessarily make any difference, it seems to me that --"
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1240.494,1249.788,In fact the Congress meant to put an additional penalty on robberies that were normally going on?
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1249.788,1250.515,I think Congress meant --
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1250.515,1252.361,They could have just changed the statute?
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1252.361,1257.869,I think Congress meant to put an additional penalty on any crime that was committed with a firearm.
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1257.869,1263.98,"Well, then it seems to me that if they wanted to put it on the bank robbery, they could have raised it, could they not?"
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1263.98,1265.187,They could in fact have done that.
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1271.178,1272.857,In term of bank robbery?
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1272.857,1276.332,They could have done it with bank robbery and they could have done with any other offense.
1977.76-5761,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1323.564,1333.826,"Then I suggest that can he as “is not awkward,” this is more than an awkward result, this is 10 years of the man's life?"
1977.76-5761,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1333.826,1337.1,"Well, I am not suggesting that this is an awkward result Mr. Justice Marshall."
1977.76-5761,2,40755,robert_w_willmott_jr,,2723.0,2763.586,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to make one final comment in response to Mr. Justice Stewart's comments and I think that anytime a firearm is used to commit a bank robbery that you automatically have the conditions of 924 (c)(1) and 2113 (d) satisfied, but that anytime a weapon other than a firearm is used you cannot get a conviction under 924 (c)(1) and I would be most happy to make copies of the United States Department of Justice's letter wherein they have referred to United State's Attorney Bulletin 519, number 3, February 05, 1971, available to Mr. Farr."
1977.76-5761,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2763.586,2770.54,Make it available to your friend and he will see it to it that we get that and anything that may occur directly on it?
