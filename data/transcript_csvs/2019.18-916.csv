2019.18-916,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.72,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-916, Thryv Incorporated versus Click-To-Call Technologies. Mr. Charnes."
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,7.72,68.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text of the America Invents Act, the statutory history, the statute's policy goals, and this Court's decision in Cuozzo all confirm that Section 314(d) precludes judicial review of the director's time-barred determination under Section 315(b). Begin with the text of the statute. Congress drafted the appeal bar to apply to ""the determination whether to institute an inter partes review under this section."" Congress could have written Section 314(d) to review only the determination whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the petition -- petitioner would prevail, but Congress wrote the provision more broadly to apply to the institution decision as a whole. Further, Section 314 itself instructs the director to look beyond that section in making the institution determination in at least two ways."
2019.18-916,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,275.96,299.16,"Cuozzo had a part that, of course, responded to concerns that have been raised, I -- I think in the dissent, and says we -- our interpretation does not enable the agency to act outside its statutory limits, for example; such shenanigans may be properly reviewable and focused really on the narrow issue before it."
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,304.28,304.48,Right.
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,347.2,369.76,"But, Mr. Charnes, let's -- let's -- just to follow up on this, let's just hypothesize that someone has tried to undo this patent four times or maybe even more in a court of law, failed for various reasons every single time, and then comes to the director of patents, who has a political mission, perhaps, to kill patents, let's just say."
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,385.84,389.88,"Well, I think it would be -- it's correct that our submission is that's not reviewable."
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,391.24,392.72,You just disagree that it's a shenanigan?
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,392.72,405.32,"Well, I'm not sure exactly what the Court meant in a shenanigan. As we pointed out in our brief, shenanigan -- I think it was a good-faith application by the Board of the legal standard, and I think --"
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,405.32,407.0,I'm asking you in my hypothesis.
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,407.0,408.08,Yes.
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,408.08,409.04,All right.
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,418.28,418.68,But --
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,418.68,430.04,"Just hypothesize that, okay? In your circumstance, you're telling the Court there's no review of that decision, I believe, or maybe it's not a shenanigan even in your -- your view perhaps."
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,430.04,433.76,"Well, I think there is -- there is no review under -- under 314(d)."
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,441.72,445.96,How would it be if it's not -- if it's not reviewable under 314(b)?
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,445.96,450.04,"Well, mandamus is only available when there's no appellate review to begin with."
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,451.84,456.12,So we're going to just channel all these cases to mandamus? Is that -- is that the upshot of your position?
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,456.12,459.96,"No, because mandamus is a rare relief."
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,478.2,483.56,"If the institution decision is not reviewable at all, how would it be mandamus-able?"
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,483.56,487.4,"Well, if it's an egregious decision and where --"
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,487.4,490.12,So it's not reviewable unless it's egregious?
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,490.12,494.72,"Well, mandamus is only available in circumstances where there is no review."
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,520.84,521.8,Do you agree with those decisions?
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,521.8,522.8,Yes.
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,522.8,523.96,Okay.
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,531.92,537.84,"Well, I don't -- surely, we don't dispute that there is a presumption of judicial review."
2019.18-916,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,537.84,538.16,Okay.
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,550.64,552.68,"Well, in -- in general terms, yes."
2019.18-916,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.6,630.24,What do you -- what do you do with the sentence in this Court's SAS decision that says 314(d) precludes judicial review only of the Board's initial determination under 314(a) that there is a reasonable likelihood that the claims are unpatentable?
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,630.24,658.48,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we -- we think that that's not a complete description of Cuozzo, and the reason is because SAS Institute, the rationale for why there was judicial review was completely different. SAS held that Section 318 prohibited the agency's practice of only reviewing some of the challenged claims and not all of the challenged claims. Section 318 is a step two merits statute."
2019.18-916,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,658.8,676.48,"But it -- but just this sentence sounds like it's saying what 314(d) precludes, and it does say only a Board's initial -- initial determination under 314(a)."
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,676.48,678.96,I -- I agree that it sounds that way.
2019.18-916,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,682.68,687.56,So you -- you think that that was just a -- a wrong -- a wrong sentence?
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,687.56,688.88,I wouldn't say it was wrong.
2019.18-916,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,713.64,719.12,"I think you are saying it's wrong, to pick up on Justice Ginsburg's question, at least the use of the word ""only."""
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,719.12,723.2,I -- I think it's not a complete description.
2019.18-916,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,735.32,748.48,If we took it that -- sorry.
2019.18-916,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,748.48,751.08,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-916,0,63200,adam_h_charnes,,751.08,751.64,Thank you.
2019.18-916,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,751.64,753.64,Mr. Ellis.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,753.64,764.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress established inter partes review as a quick and efficient means for the PTO to revisit issued patents and to cancel unpatentable claims."
2019.18-916,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,825.68,826.92,I think you have --
2019.18-916,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,826.92,827.16,I want --
2019.18-916,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,827.16,827.72,Chief.
2019.18-916,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,827.72,838.8,"I want to pose for you the same question that Mr. Charnes was asked about the separation of powers. As I understand his answer, at least part of it is more or less that this is small potatoes."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,851.0,853.24,I -- I do largely agree with that view.
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,906.96,918.56,"But you're not going to get review, though, of the question of whether the director could institute that proceeding in the first place, are you, especially after -- I mean, as I understand it, this patent has been challenged four times before, unsuccessfully."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,918.56,918.8,Even --
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,918.8,922.36,"And, here, it was challenged successfully only because it was filed out of time."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,922.36,926.16,"Even -- well, I'm not sure that last part is -- is entirely true."
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,927.2,931.28,I thought the government had conceded that the -- that the institution of proceedings here was untimely?
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,931.28,932.12,That's right.
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,933.72,937.64,And that there's no review of that decision in this proceeding at all?
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,937.64,938.08,That's right.
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,963.44,963.84,Sure.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,968.56,969.76,"I -- I agree, yes."
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,970.04,973.8,And nobody will. And the patent has now been killed.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,977.2,980.04,What was open for review was that patentability analysis.
2019.18-916,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,989.04,1012.08,So how about a situation where it's only discovered during the proceeding that's been instituted that a privy of the Petitioner was served with a complaint alleging infringement in -- that would bar this action if it had been known at the time it was instituted.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1013.48,1014.4,"No, it's not."
2019.18-916,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1015.36,1016.52,Why?
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1016.52,1023.4,Because 315(b) determines -- speaks only and exclusively to the determination whether to institute inter partes review.
2019.18-916,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1023.88,1027.92,"No, it has -- it doesn't talk anything about whether to institute it."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1045.12,1049.84,"Well, with respect, Your Honor, it talks about barring of the institution of the action, and the only --"
2019.18-916,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1049.84,1054.04,"I don't see the word ""institution."" May not be -- you're right, may not be instituted."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1054.04,1054.64,Okay.
2019.18-916,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1066.56,1069.2,So if he learns during the proceeding.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1075.92,1092.8,"So he -- the Board at -- at that point does accept a motion to terminate inter partes review on the basis of newly discovered information. If the Board finds that 315(b) should have barred institution of review, it can then vacate its institution decision. But, importantly, what it does is vacate its institution decision."
2019.18-916,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1097.44,1098.08,Mr. Ellis --
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1098.08,1099.12,-- that is not reviewable.
2019.18-916,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1099.12,1103.0,-- I think you have a -- a -- a strong argument under Cuozzo.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1113.76,1120.72,"So I think, as far as reconciling the decision itself, I agree with my colleague that it just wasn't at issue in that case."
2019.18-916,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1129.92,1139.32,But why would it not be at issue? Why couldn't you characterize the issue in SAS whether it was proper to institute review of only some of the claims?
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1139.32,1141.44,"To be sure, that's the way the government did characterize it."
2019.18-916,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.76,1194.96,Look at --
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1194.96,1195.44,-- provision.
2019.18-916,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.44,1198.2,"-- look at Cuozzo, and look at SAS."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1324.92,1327.88,So I do think that this is a closely related decision.
2019.18-916,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1331.04,1337.68,"Yes, of course, it only speaks to institution, but you could have a statute that said anyone who's 6'2"" can't institute."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1343.12,1343.76,And so I --
2019.18-916,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.76,1350.2,So -- so the fact that it only speaks to institution isn't quite catching the point.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1360.76,1383.76,"So if that -- if what you're driving at is sort of what was happening -- discussed in the first case this morning, that questions of law should be able to be reviewed, I just think, unlike the provision at the first -- in the first case, there is no basis to draw that distinction. So, if you, at the end of the day, conclude it's just too difficult to figure out, as my -- as Respondent says, it's unworkable to figure out how close is close enough, then what I'd urge the Court to do is apply the provision as it's written."
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1383.76,1384.44,"Well, how about --"
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1384.44,1388.36,"If it's about the determination whether to institute inter partes review, then it's not reviewable."
2019.18-916,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1388.36,1389.0,Under this section.
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1389.0,1390.72,"Well, how about -- how about -- under this section, yes."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1419.2,1422.12,"So, as I -- as I mentioned before, this is not a statute of repose."
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1430.6,1435.16,"There are other proceedings, I accept that, okay, but there's always like state proceedings."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1438.76,1439.0,I --
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1439.0,1442.24,So there's always another proceeding available to -- to -- to -- there's always another way to skin the cat.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1442.24,1443.36,But this is the exact same thing.
2019.18-916,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1443.36,1447.44,But this is what Congress wrote in this cat for this cat.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1460.92,1463.8,"This -- maybe there -- there is a tradition, I agree."
2019.18-916,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1478.76,1481.04,"But ""under this chapter"" is used in the same provision."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1485.08,1486.36,I -- I don't think we need that.
2019.18-916,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1594.92,1596.96,Do you think it's ambiguous?
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1596.96,1598.24,"I don't think it's ambiguous, no."
2019.18-916,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1624.24,1639.36,But maybe one way to read Cuozzo -- and I take this to be the point of Justice Breyer's question -- is that it -- it goes beyond 314 but that it only goes to questions that are closely related to the reasonable likelihood determination.
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1651.92,1656.04,So I -- I -- I grant you that's one way to read that one particular passage.
2019.18-916,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1673.2,1674.08,But what about the --
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1674.08,1678.52,"-- that it was 312(a)(3) that was at issue there, not 314(a)."
2019.18-916,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1678.52,1689.56,"-- the -- in Cuozzo, it was a particularity requirement, and that was described as a minor statutory tech -- technicality."
2019.18-916,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1725.08,1727.16,"Briefly, Mr. Ellis."
2019.18-916,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1727.16,1728.76,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
2019.18-916,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1754.24,1759.72,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Geyser."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1759.72,1790.04,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I respectfully waive my two minutes but would otherwise start by underscoring the truly extraordinary nature of the top side argument. As we've heard today, as my friends read this statute, Congress delegated the judicial function to an administrative agency, gave that agency the unfettered discretion to say what the law is, and then instructed that no Article III court at any time at any level may review the agency's interpretation of the statutory limits on its own power."
2019.18-916,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1790.04,1794.92,"Well, if you're going to waive your two minutes, I'm not going to sit back. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-916,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1794.92,1802.92,"The -- the point's been made, and it's an important one, about the separation of powers."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1846.76,1849.08,"Well, the -- the ultimate question isn't being foreclosed."
2019.18-916,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1875.92,1878.6,"Well, but, I mean, I don't think it's what we were fighting over at Yorktown."
2019.18-916,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.32,1888.44,"-- as you said, the ultimate question, the ultimate issue that affects the property rights in a patent, it's going to be reached."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1891.28,1893.96,"Well, Congress viewed it otherwise, Your Honor."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1911.96,1919.72,"Well, it does, but you don't contest, right, that one -- if this Petitioner is thrown out, somebody else can bring another petition, right?"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1919.72,1926.8,"Oh, hypothetically, they -- they could, Your Honor, but you would need a hypothetical future party raising a hypothetical future petition."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1929.88,1931.92,"Well, but it wouldn't be rare to have such a party."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1957.52,1959.96,"Well, we -- first, we don't necessarily know that it is an invalid patent."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1960.72,1964.88,"Well, we know that the Board held that it was an invalid patent."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1964.88,1966.72,And it -- and it is reversed a quarter of the time.
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1980.2,2007.36,"Well, Congress also said that there's no judicial review of the decision whether to institute. And, presumably, Congress said that for exactly this reason, that once that decision is made and you go through the entire process and you get a merits determination, given that throwing it all out is just going to land you at square one doing the exact same thing, that it was, you know, a little bit silly to go back to square one."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2007.36,2011.88,"Your Honor, I -- I don't think that Congress thought that Section 315(b) was -- was insignificant."
2019.18-916,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2024.44,2052.2,"But, if we're -- if we're in doubt about, we think it's ambiguous, doesn't the nullification of the determination that this patent is no good, that's out there, that's what the Board thinks, that this should not have been patented, and we wipe that out, then you get another challenger and where the Board has already made the decision that the patent is no good."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2057.72,2067.88,"I -- I disagree, Your Honor, and for the reason that if the -- if the patent, in fact, is invalid, then it can be invalidated in a proper proceeding."
2019.18-916,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2094.84,2114.64,"Well, what is -- what is the -- the -- the analogy that floats around in my mind on this is that judges and agencies start down a road and then they say, oh, my God, I made a mistake. And -- and we give them lots of power in the law to call back what they did and correct the mistake."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2196.84,2198.84,"Well, this -- this is what I think, Justice Breyer."
2019.18-916,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.44,2223.0,"Well, that's true, of course, or could be true in many matters governing instances where judges or agencies call back something they did because they think they did it wrong."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2223.0,2224.6,Well --
2019.18-916,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.6,2226.76,Would that make it somehow more reviewable?
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2226.76,2231.92,"Well, I -- I think what makes it reviewable is the strong presumption favoring judicial review."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2244.44,2245.96,"Well, you're -- you're right, it is rare."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2268.28,2269.72,"Well, a -- a couple key points, Your Honor."
2019.18-916,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2293.12,2313.44,"Well, I don't want to interrupt the rest of your answer to Justice Kagan, but would it be possible for the director to institute inter partes review under some other section? Could the director say, I don't want to invoke 314, I want to institute inter partes review under some other provision of law? Can he do that?"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2313.44,2324.84,"Well, this is -- and there's an oddity with this statute, Justice Alito, in that there is not an express provision anywhere in Chapter 31 that expressly authorizes the director to institute review."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2345.68,2348.28,"But, Mr. Geyser, I think 314(a) does."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2370.48,2406.04,"I -- I almost agree, but there's a very important predicate step, and that's, in order to get to Section 314, you first have to clear the gateway prerequisites under 315, including 315(b). And as my friend from the government concedes in the reply brief, this is on page 6 of the government's reply, they concede that if the prerequisite under 315(b) is not met, the director has nothing else to do, which means that the director doesn't make any determination under Section 314. And you're right that Section 314(d) is linking the determination, under this section whether to institute, to that determination under (a), which is entitled to threshold consideration."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2417.6,2433.2,"But, if you're right, Mr. Geyser, what does this unappealability bar really amount to? When does it bar anything that anybody would want to raise as an argument? Because, if you are right, it's just limited to the substantive determination at the threshold stage."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2452.92,2457.84,"Your Honor, what -- what I'm saying is exactly what Congress did in Section 303(c) --"
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2457.84,2458.36,"Well, you're saying --"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2458.36,2459.28,-- and in 312(c).
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2459.28,2465.76,-- that Congress wrote that silliest provision that the bar on appeals applies only to something that nobody would raise --
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2465.76,2465.84,It --
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2465.84,2469.08,-- because it's been totally mooted out.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2469.08,2478.44,It's -- it's not silly because Congress has a good reason to make absolutely clear that people will not interrupt the inter partes review while it's going on with a disruptive interlocutory appeal.
2019.18-916,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2490.96,2494.32,Do you disagree with Justice Kagan that it does no work under your reading?
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2494.32,2494.52,No.
2019.18-916,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2499.0,2500.0,But does the clarifying do any work?
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2500.0,2501.44,The -- I think that --
2019.18-916,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2501.44,2505.6,In the real world? Which is what I took to be the -- her question.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2505.6,2514.68,This -- this is -- all I can say is that we know that Congress thought it was doing work because everyone agrees that is all that Congress did in 303(c) and 312(c).
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2534.68,2541.8,"I think Mr. Ellis would say, well, that's true, but those provisions were -- specifically said exactly that."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2554.2,2555.36,"I -- I don't think at all, Your Honor."
2019.18-916,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2576.68,2580.32,Can you give any real-world example of when the bar would do work?
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2580.32,2592.0,"The -- the bar would do work if a party came -- let's say that a petition says I think that this patent is invalid, as -- as obvious, in light of a certain prior art reference A."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2614.12,2629.52,"So you think that Congress wanted, in a case like that where the Patent Board has found a good reason why the patent is invalid, to go back and do the entire thing over again because its initial theory was not the one that it ended up with?"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2629.52,2637.2,"Well, what I think, Your Honor, is that Congress was not focused in a single-minded way on a single objective when they wrote this statute."
2019.18-916,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2673.04,2673.24,But --
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2673.24,2676.16,So I think Congress didn't look at this as some minor statutory technicality.
2019.18-916,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2676.16,2681.6,"Well, it -- it doesn't have to be characterized as minor just because it's not judicially reviewable."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2689.28,2696.8,"We -- we do presume that, but we also presume that -- that they're more likely to follow the law correctly when someone knows they're checking their homework."
2019.18-916,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2696.8,2698.72,"That's true in practice, I -- I grant you that --"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2698.72,2699.0,And --
2019.18-916,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2699.0,2704.36,-- but it's not that it does no work without judicial review. I'm just pushing a little bit on that point.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2704.36,2716.36,"Well, Your Honor, I fully agree that we -- we -- we have every belief that the agency will exercise the utmost good faith in adjudicating cases under this scheme, but what we do know from Mach Mining and from other cases of this Court --"
2019.18-916,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2716.36,2718.16,But that's a way -- sorry to interrupt.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2750.84,2764.16,"Well, I think -- I think what's wrong with it, again, is that you're removing any ordinary, traditional, normal function of judicial review to ensure that the agency's constructing the outer limits on its own power correctly. And, again, that's not a small thing --"
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2764.16,2764.64,"But, you know, you --"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2764.64,2765.04,-- I would submit.
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2765.04,2804.24,"-- you cited Mach Mining, but Mach Mining was very clear to say, again, we usually think that Congress wants the court to police a -- a -- a congressional statute, but sometimes Congress wants the agency to self-police because it doesn't think that the costs of judicial review, and there are some, are worth it, given the subject matter, given the fact that in this case there's going to be review of the principal question anyway, and, you know, in the end, this is not -- it's not unconstitutional if Congress wants to say that the decision to institute is not reviewable. And Congress appears to have said that."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2804.24,2808.56,"Well, they appear to say it with respect to something, but the question is as to what."
2019.18-916,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2820.24,2842.12,"But, under this section, the only section that deals with institution of inter partes review, any -- any institution of inter partes review would be under this section because there is no other section that deals with institution of inter partes review."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2842.12,2851.52,"Well, again, Your Honor, though, in order to even get to Section 314, you first have to clear the gateway prerequisites elsewhere in this chapter, including Section 315."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2870.96,2873.16,"Well, it's not a question of overturning."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,2887.88,2905.72,"Well, to be very clear, I -- I think that we win under Cuozzo as well, but I don't think that -- that the reasoning in that statement, which is a very plain statement in SAS, can be limited in that way. SAS was addressing the government's argument that 314(d) precluded any issue bearing on the institution decision."
2019.18-916,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3034.24,3034.84,Mr. Geyser --
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3034.84,3036.2,-- happening under 314.
2019.18-916,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3036.2,3081.76,"-- I -- I do have some sympathy for your argument that a petitioner should be given an avenue of judicial review on a legal question, like the timeliness of -- of the application, but some amici point out a potential problem under your view, which is, if the PTO agrees with you on the legal question and throws this complaint out, that the other side won't have an opportunity to challenge that because the only power to appeal is under 319, and 319 requires a full hearing for appealability. So what do we really -- one way or another, we're going to preclude judicial review, the argument goes."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3081.76,3082.52,Let me state --
2019.18-916,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3082.52,3084.04,Of a legal question.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3084.04,3085.76,Let me see if I can give you some comfort on that.
2019.18-916,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3108.48,3108.64,No --
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3108.64,3109.12,-- of time --
2019.18-916,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3109.12,3110.32,-- just this case.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3110.32,3110.6,Or -- or --
2019.18-916,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3110.6,3115.0,"It reads -- it reads it this way, and the other side says you're wrong --"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3115.0,3115.28,Okay.
2019.18-916,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3115.28,3117.16,"-- for all the reasons it earlier gave, okay?"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3117.16,3123.04,"So -- so our contention, again, is that 314(d) would not preclude review. The question is what is the affirmative power to review."
2019.18-916,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3189.36,3210.88,"So what's so terrible about reading the ""in this section"" to mean what it says, which is that where -- where the director -- where the director -- what is the exact word -- where the director decides to institute an inter partes review, under this section, that's it, you can't appeal that decision."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3217.08,3218.6,The -- the director could institute --
2019.18-916,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3218.6,3218.68,Yeah.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3218.68,3220.36,-- an ex parte reexamination.
2019.18-916,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3220.36,3230.0,"So -- so this then is basically a way, a little complicated way, but of the agency saying: Oh, my God, we made a mistake."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3266.08,3266.28,Well --
2019.18-916,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3266.28,3274.52,And that -- that -- that -- that leads you to pretty broad language about what's -- what's pretty broad category of what you can't review.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3274.52,3276.8,"Well, again, I don't think it is -- is so broad."
2019.18-916,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3294.36,3294.88,"Yeah, yeah."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3294.88,3300.68,"So the process looks absolutely nothing like inter partes review. It's not just that they can say, you know what, we made a mistake."
2019.18-916,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3302.64,3303.04,Right.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3303.04,3305.28,-- inter partes review and rewrite ex parte reexamination.
2019.18-916,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3307.4,3313.56,"Well, it's -- it's different, I'll give you that, but, I mean, it's focused on the same ultimate question."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3313.56,3328.4,"Well, sure, Your Honor, but -- but Congress decided in granting this new procedure that has a potent -- you know, a potent danger to patent rights that the -- the patent owners are entitled to significant safeguard and the main safeguard that they implemented are the ones in 315."
2019.18-916,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3328.4,3339.32,"Well, I guess the question, though, that -- that we're struggling with is, so what's the big deal? If you're stuck going to ex parte review anyway, why should we care? What's your answer to that?"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3339.32,3344.76,"Well, I -- I think you should care because inter partes review is a very different process than ex parte reexamination."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3345.88,3347.16,But somebody else can --
2019.18-916,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3347.16,3348.6,Spell that out. Spell that out.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3349.48,3356.4,"It's because, instead of having an opportunity for a single response, truncated discovery, you're in an adversarial proceeding."
2019.18-916,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3378.8,3379.0,Well --
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3379.0,3381.32,"But, if it's not with this Petitioner, it can be another petitioner."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3381.32,3382.52,And -- and if --
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3382.52,3389.76,"And, indeed, even when a petitioner drops out under this statute, the Board can keep the proceeding going without the petitioner."
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3395.76,3406.8,"Not at all, Your Honor. And I think the key is that if Congress thought that the Board -- that the Board can do whatever it wants, it would have mimicked the same language it had in 303 saying they have a sua sponte right to institute review."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3411.6,3416.04,You -- you don't deny that another petitioner can just step into the shoes of this Petitioner.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3416.04,3418.4,"If they file a timely petition, they can seek review."
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3419.64,3425.12,"And you don't deny that if a petitioner drops out for any reason, the Board can go on without any petitioner?"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3425.12,3428.04,Assuming that it was a properly filed petition in the first place.
2019.18-916,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3429.04,3431.92,It just doesn't seem as though this Petitioner makes all that much difference.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3431.92,3438.68,"Well, Congress felt otherwise in this heavily negotiated process that produced 315(b) as a fundamental safeguard for patents."
2019.18-916,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3438.68,3445.76,"But, again, why would it have made that judgment, I guess is the question? Why does it matter whether it's one petitioner or another petitioner?"
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3445.76,3450.04,"Well, because Congress felt that it was important in this adversarial scheme."
2019.18-916,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3450.04,3450.52,Why?
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3450.52,3471.88,"To -- to make sure that you don't have someone gaming the system, waiting out over a year or even in this case 10 years before they seek review, where you don't have repeated inter partes review petitions filed by multiple people trying to hold up the patent and prevent a legitimate litigation in an Article III court seeking recourse for infringement. There are lots of reasons that Congress would have had in mind."
2019.18-916,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3563.84,3564.28,Sure.
2019.18-916,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3564.28,3569.88,-- that would find Article III review cut off entirely based on language as indirect as this.
2019.18-916,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3569.88,3574.68,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Charnes."
2019.18-916,3,63200,adam_h_charnes,,3574.68,3575.12,Thank you.
2019.18-916,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3755.44,3756.44,"Thank you, counsel."
