1980.79-1213,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.639,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Minnick v. California Department of Corrections.
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,14.355,20.415,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1213,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,298.163,306.3,"Mr. Yank, may I ask you, this case involves only promotion or transfer, does not involve new hirings, does it?"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,306.3,308.144,"Absolutely wrong, Your Honor."
1980.79-1213,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.002,313.532,"Well, in the cases of Minnick and Darden?"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,313.532,316.922,They were promotional people.
1980.79-1213,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,316.922,319.717,And it's only their cases that we have?
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,319.717,330.18,"No, because in fact this action was brought on behalf, as a class action, of all people similarly situated by both Minnick, Darden, and by the Association."
1980.79-1213,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,354.109,366.526,"Well, now, as to Minnick and Darden, I note in the Court of Appeals opinion... this is at page A6... this statement:"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,408.196,411.351,"Standing, first of all, with regard to eligibility."
1980.79-1213,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,415.209,421.8,"Oh, it says here, it says here... are you quarreling with this statement by the Court of Appeal that neither had been eligible for promotion?"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,421.8,427.016,"They were not in the top three bands, and I do quarrel--"
1980.79-1213,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,427.016,428.173,I'm not asking that.
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,428.173,430.313,"--I do quarrel with the notion, ""eligible""."
1980.79-1213,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,430.313,433.998,"Well, are we to take this... this is what your state court said."
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,436.419,440.558,They were not reachable within the rule-of-three at the time.
1980.79-1213,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,533.333,538.737,"They had that standing even if they had no... were, in any event, not eligible for promotion?"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,538.737,541.267,--The trial court found that they--
1980.79-1213,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,541.267,542.751,I don't care what the trial court found.
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,547.421,554.605,"--As to any future promotions, I don't believe that the appellate court denies that they might be seeking future promotion."
1980.79-1213,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,568.459,597.775,"Well, Mr. Yank, you're not suggesting that for federal case or controversy purposes in this Court that we have jurisdiction to accord standing, or we ordinarily accord standing to an association qua an association simply because some of its unnamed members may have been injured by a particular act?"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,597.775,603.71,"Why, I am suggesting that this Court in the past has imbued, articulated precisely that rule."
1980.79-1213,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,662.718,664.577,How about NAACP v. Alabama?
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,666.014,667.169,I would think it is.
1980.79-1213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.169,674.057,"Perhaps you're right, Mr. Yank, but the Court of Appeal in California left open that question, didn't it, when it remanded the case?"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,683.069,687.254,"Well, I think the Court does know the facts."
1980.79-1213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.515,701.937,"Well, what are we to make of the last sentence?"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,705.528,708.761,"--Well, that says, if the case is to be retried."
1980.79-1213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,740.327,742.264,"No, but we have to decide a lawsuit."
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,744.606,745.059,That's correct.
1980.79-1213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,745.059,755.616,"We only have two individuals and an association, and the individuals have not been harmed according to what Mr. Justice Brennan read, and the association's standing is in doubt, based on the last sentence of the opinion."
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,755.616,764.347,"Well, again, I think that it's a matter for this Court to determine whether, under your standards, there is indeed a justiciable issue here."
1980.79-1213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.347,769.644,"Even if it's justiciable in a federal sense, would it necessarily be justiciable in the state courts?"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,770.799,774.547,"I think again, it's clear under the California case--"
1980.79-1213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.547,775.516,"We have to decide that though, don't we?"
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,779.607,781.903,--I don't--
1980.79-1213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.903,784.886,It's rather unusual for us to decide that kind of state law issue.
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,784.886,788.885,"--No, again, we're here under the 14th Amendment."
1980.79-1213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.289,800.958,"Well, but if you don't rely on a state court, you can never get here, and they've said, we don't know whether you belong in a state court."
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,800.958,809.159,"--Well, that is what the Court of Appeal said without briefing, but I do think that the cases, the California cases that we cited--"
1980.79-1213,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.159,814.016,"Well, but, assuming you're right, we have to decide that question of California law under your view of the case."
1980.79-1213,0,40846,ronald_yank,,814.016,818.811,"--Could be, but it does not require any remand, because the facts concerning the standing are there."
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,1766.289,1769.975,Thank you.
1980.79-1213,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1967.505,1969.333,What does Weber have to do with this case?
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,1976.44,1997.556,"--Well, Your Honor, I think there is... I think it's probably an issue not to be reached, but there is potentially a question of whether Title VII would prohibit the plan which has been adopted by the Department, and I submit, Your Honor, that the ruling in Weber is applicable and the plan--"
1980.79-1213,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1997.556,1997.915,Why?
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2002.555,2010.427,"--Well, Your Honor, I submit we have an additional question in this case not present in Weber and that is whether the plan is permissible under the Equal Protection Clause."
1980.79-1213,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2010.427,2010.786,Right.
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2011.536,2012.582,"That issue is here, Your Honor."
1980.79-1213,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2014.191,2016.44,So what does Weber have to do with this case?
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2016.44,2026.109,--I think Weber has to do with the case only to the extent that the petitioners are also relying upon Title VII for their claim--
1980.79-1213,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2026.109,2030.997,But you claim they can't because the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction of Title VII actions.
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2031.387,2038.915,"--We assert that, and then we assert that if in fact we are incorrect in that respect, that the program is permissible under Title VII."
1980.79-1213,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2038.915,2039.415,All right.
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2047.974,2048.521,We then come to the Equal Protection Clause; absolutely.
1980.79-1213,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.521,2049.114,All right.
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2049.114,2055.269,"We're not suggesting that we don't have that ultimately here, if the case is a final judgment and properly before the Court."
1980.79-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.269,2188.979,"Well, I take it the response of your colleague to that argument is that there's nothing that can happen in the state court proceedings, if there are further proceedings, that can overcome the judgment that there has been a compelling state interest shown that would override any claims of discrimination."
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2188.979,2193.274,"Justice White, that is where I part from my colleague."
1980.79-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.274,2194.134,"And you have to depart from him, don't you?"
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2197.399,2201.505,"Well, if in fact there was nothing further that could be done, then you would have a final--"
1980.79-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.505,2206.253,"But if there's nothing further to be done on that particular issue, there would be finality."
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2206.253,2215.843,"--If I may, let me attempt to define the issues which I think are resolved and those which remain to be considered."
1980.79-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.843,2220.686,"When will you get around to answering my question, rather than stating what you want to state now?"
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2220.686,2223.575,"Well, Your Honor, I believe, if I understand your question--"
1980.79-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.575,2226.121,"If you don't, I'd like to make it clear."
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2248.94,2250.674,"--It is not so, Your Honor."
1980.79-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.938,2254.391,All right.
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2256.843,2260.077,"--If it were so, you'd have a final judgment."
1980.79-1213,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.077,2260.608,All right.
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2260.608,2263.919,"But it is not so, and let me address myself to why that is the case."
1980.79-1213,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.72,2300.078,What question of law do you say was decided by the Court of Appeal?
1980.79-1213,1,41871,stuart_r_pollak,,2300.078,2331.081,"The question of law, Justice Rehnquist, that I say was resolved, is that the correctional objectives of the Department of Corrections constitute a compelling state interest in that a compelling state interest can justify constitutionally and under Title VII employment practices which are race-conscious, if they are properly limited to accomplish that objective."
1980.79-1213,2,40846,ronald_yank,,3645.456,3646.206,Okay.
1980.79-1213,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3672.93,3675.398,"Any time a plus factor is involved, there's discrimination."
1980.79-1213,2,40846,ronald_yank,,3677.241,3679.224,"--Well, the fact that it's literally put people over the top."
1980.79-1213,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3679.224,3683.816,"Well, that's always going to happen when you use it as a plus factor."
1980.79-1213,2,40846,ronald_yank,,3683.816,3684.191,Okay.
1980.79-1213,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3723.237,3731.688,"Mr. Yank, you're entitled to win on the evidence you offered, and you also contend you're entitled to win on the findings that the trial court made, is that right?"
1980.79-1213,2,40846,ronald_yank,,3731.688,3732.031,Yes.
1980.79-1213,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3732.031,3732.656,Okay.
1980.79-1213,2,40846,ronald_yank,,3733.577,3734.921,When they say that--
1980.79-1213,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3734.921,3737.059,"Well, just yes or no."
1980.79-1213,2,40846,ronald_yank,,3737.059,3739.231,--Yes.
1980.79-1213,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3739.231,3740.697,"Thank you, gentlemen."
