1964.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,51.049,"Number 42 Mortimer Singer, Petitioner versus United States."
1964.42,0,41234,sidney_dorfman,,52.85,57.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, May, it please the Court."
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2070.995,2074.089,May it please the Court.
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2251.163,2254.207,"Is that, have you gotten authority for that?"
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2254.207,2265.992,"Yes it's in our brief Your Honor, page 23."
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2278.092,2281.52,"Now one citation here is of a dissenting opinion, I notice on page 12."
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2281.52,2283.512,"Well, the Colby case."
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.244,2543.248,"If a defendant waives the whole works of the Bill of Rights, and says, “I plead guilty”, can't he insist then that there be no trial at all, does the government then have a right to put on witnesses and all these things?"
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2543.248,2545.008,The rules provide that the Court --
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2545.008,2545.898,"He says, “I plead guilty”."
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2549.505,2552.613,"No, the rules don't so provide Your Honor."
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.62,2593.915,That was not --
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2593.915,2595.61,That he doesn't think it would be in the interest of justice.
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2595.61,2596.385,Not knowingly and intelligently made.
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2596.745,2598.348,I'm not talking about knowingly intelligently.
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2654.347,2663.9,"Now, that's true under for example the so called Lindbergh Act, where bodily harm has been inflicted on the victim, allegedly --"
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2663.9,2665.359,Only the jury can assess --
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2665.359,2668.54,"And is the effect of that, that the defendant cannot plead guilty?"
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2668.54,2669.323,That's right.
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2669.323,2670.147,Is it?
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2670.147,2681.899,"I think so, I don't think its ever been determined, because I don't think the government has ever where its taken a plea of guilty decided that it wanted to ask for the death penalty."
1964.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2714.988,2725.218,"Are any of the states though that violate the state Constitution to accept the plea of guilty in a murder case, and the jury fixes the verdict, a penalty?"
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2725.218,2730.938,"Well, there are number of states, Your Honor, which do not permit the waiver of a jury trial at all."
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2744.379,2747.31,"Well, Justice Black asked you about pleading guilty in other states."
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2747.31,2747.834,Yes.
1964.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2760.409,2778.053,"But what they provide is, I think, at least it's the way it was in my state and I've tried a number of them, where you plead guilty in a capital case, you must have the jury produce enough facts so that the jury can determine the facts of the case."
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2778.053,2783.35,"Yes, that's so in Colorado and it is true in Washington."
1964.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2783.35,2794.693,The jury is not even bound to by certain powers to accept the recommendation of the prosecutor as to life instead of death and still live up to the jury.
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2796.878,2798.28,"That's right, that's true in Washington."
1964.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2798.28,2803.892,"That's the practice, but you do accept -- they do accept the plea of guilty under the practice I'm talking about."
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2803.892,2804.222,Yes.
1964.42,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2804.222,2817.905,"I was wondering if there are any states that have held that you cannot waive -- you cannot plead guilty and thereby in the trial, to say that, that ends the case, that, that violates the Constitution."
1964.42,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2817.905,2820.654,New Jersey is one of those who have capital indictment.
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2829.041,2838.894,"Well, I think that the -- I didn't go into that aspect but there are a number states -- capital cases aren't treated separately in many states."
1964.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2879.047,2882.707,Nobody was trying to waive any of the jury in the Beacon case.
1964.42,1,36528,miss_beatrice_rosenberg,,2882.707,2898.081,"Oh, which is the statement, but it was an indication of the fact that the right to waive doesn't stem from the Constitution."
