2015.14-8349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.51,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-8349, Foster v. Chatman. Mr. Bright."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,7.51,19.51,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The prosecutors in this case came to court on the morning of jury selection determined to strike all the black prospective jurors."
2015.14-8349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,19.51,28.96,"Mr. Bright, maybe you could address first the -- the question we raised on Friday with respect to which court certiorari should be directed to."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,28.96,33.64,"Yes, Your Honor. We filed this petition originally certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia."
2015.14-8349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,90.51,100.23,"Do you think that affects the scope of our review? In other words, are we addressing just whether there's arguable merit to the claim or are we addressing the claim on its own merits?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,100.23,112.7,"Well, I -- I think what this Court has done in -- in all these cases is apply Yist v. Nunnemaker to look through to the last reasoned decision, and that would be the decision of the habeas corpus court."
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.72,127.08,I really don't understand that.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,168.63,170.82,"Well, that's what happened in R.J. Reynolds."
2015.14-8349,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,201.72,213.45,"But -- but you're saying in that case or in other cases? And if so, which other cases that, in that situation, we, nonetheless, addressed the reasoning of the intermediate court? Is that what you're saying?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,213.45,226.625,"You -- you did in Sears v. Upton, a case out of Georgia, 561 U.S. 945 in 2010. That was certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia, but it came up on exactly the same posture of our -- our case."
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.625,258.575,"Is there an argument that the petition for certiorari could go to the trial court? I mean, our statute says that it goes to the highest court in which review could have -- could have been had, I think is the -- the statutory phrase, in which sounds like the Georgia Supreme Court. On the other hand, as Justice Scalia said, they haven't really directed their attention to the issues before us. I -- I -- I'm not sure to me that it's an option to -- to go to the superior -- to the Georgia trial court."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,258.575,259.16,"Well, let --"
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.16,260.915,Or -- or is that incorrect?
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,260.915,283.49,"Well, what this Court has said, both in the R.J. Reynolds case and then that was followed in Grady v. North Carolina last year -- 2015 case, this year, in which, once again, there was an intermediate court decision denied by the -- the North Carolina Supreme Court. I mean, I can remember all the way back to 1960."
2015.14-8349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.63,306.27,You're putting together two rules that you say we've established.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,317.79,317.945,Right.
2015.14-8349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.945,331.86,"-- the Supreme Court has said just ""denied,"" nothing more than ""denied,"" we look back to the last reasoned decision. Those are both decisions of this Court, and that's what you're relying on."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,331.86,334.53,"Well, and -- and they're not mutually exclusive."
2015.14-8349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,365.41,385.504,"What if the State supreme court wrote a very short opinion and said, We're not going to determine whether there was, in fact -- the only issue we're going to determine is whether there's any arguable merit to this? And then you say that the whole issue of whether it was a correct application in Batson is -- is the issue that we have to decide?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,385.504,391.12,"I -- I -- I think in R.J. Reynolds, I think that's this Court's law, yes."
2015.14-8349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,391.12,448.825,"Could I ask you another -- a question about another preliminary issue before you get to the -- the -- the underlying question in the case? The Superior Court said, on page 175 of the Joint Appendix, that the issue of the Batson violation was not reviewable based on the doctrine of res judicata. And then it later said, and this is 192 of the Joint Appendix, that it will review the Batson claim as to whether Petitioner has shown any change in the facts sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar. Now, if you put those two together, you could argue that the superior court decided only a question of State law, namely, whether the situation here was such that there could be review of the Batson claim. What is your response to that?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,448.825,450.78,"Well, the State doesn't argue that."
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.575,478.71,"Well, but is it question of Federal or State law as to whether or not the Petitioner has shown a change in facts sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar? The one -- the page 192 language that Justice Alito quoted, is that -- is that a State law question or --"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,478.71,480.98,That's a State law question. And here --
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,480.98,481.22,Well --
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,481.22,483.16,"-- the Court decided it, but I -- I point out, Justice --"
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,483.16,487.45,"Well, if it's a State law question and they resolved it against you, what do you have to -- then what do you have to argue?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,487.45,487.66,"No, no, no."
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,487.66,489.47,I think you have to say it's a Federal question.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,489.47,489.78,No.
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.43,529.7,Explain to me why deciding the Federal issue was essential to its deciding the State res judicata issue.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,529.7,546.48,"Because it -- it -- it framed the question as being that it would look at the Ake v. -- excuse me -- they would look at the Batson v. Kentucky claim and that, if there was merit to that claim, then the court would grant the writ on it."
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,550.65,557.41,There -- you think it was saying whether there's res judicata or not depends on whether the new claim has any merit?
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,557.41,559.46,I think -- I think it's exactly --
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.46,563.765,"That's a very strange application of res judicata, it seems to me."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,563.765,564.28,Well --
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.28,569.93,I thought it was whether there -- there were changed facts sufficient enough.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,569.93,575.555,"Well, the Georgia law is that you can bring an issue that's been litigated already before direct appeal."
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.555,576.04,Right.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,576.61,578.37,"In habeas, if there are --"
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.37,584.005,"Even -- even -- right. Even if it would, you know, produce a different result, right?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,584.005,584.36,Right.
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,587.365,599.15,"Mr. Bright, did the court, in your judgment, do de novo review? Didn't it say that it did -- basically, it was going to do step three of the Batson charge -- challenge?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,599.15,600.94,"Yes, that's exactly what the court said, yes."
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,600.94,602.41,So that's a ruling on the merits.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,602.41,606.43,I think -- I think the court said the Batson claim is without merit.
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,609.46,614.21,"Well, it -- I think it said after -- after redoing --"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,614.21,616.56,After considering these other facts.
2015.14-8349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,624.705,635.655,"The court said that it would reach step three again on the basis of the new evidence presented, and so they did it all over."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,646.09,646.67,No.
2015.14-8349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,665.9,690.57,"Well, I don't want to belabor the point too much, but you -- are you arguing that Georgia res judicata law is this: If someone comes up with any new fact, the -- the -- the thinnest new fact, that is sufficient to wipe out the res judicata bar and allow the court to get to the merits of the claim? Is that your argument? That's your understanding of Georgia res judicata law?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,690.57,697.295,That's not my understanding. My understanding is the evidence has to be sufficient enough that the court does what it did in this case and rule on the merits of the issue.
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,702.72,707.4,"And we really want you to get to the merits, but why is that -- in conjunction with --"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,707.4,707.97,We will.
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,707.97,712.685,"-- with Justice Scalia's question, why is that an issue of Federal law?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,712.685,724.06,"Because the court decided the Batson issue to decide the underlying State law issue. And I think Ake is pretty clear on this, and I commend it to the Court's attention."
2015.14-8349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,733.66,734.4,"Thanks, counsel."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,736.29,736.5,Okay.
2015.14-8349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,754.02,773.94,"The prosecutors said the reason for concentrating on the black jurors was that you had informed them you would present a Batson challenge, and therefore, it was necessary for them to see if there was a race-neutral ground for disqualifying that case."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,773.94,774.11,Right.
2015.14-8349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,903.61,904.52,"Counsel, at this --"
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,904.52,904.88,Mr. Bright --
2015.14-8349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,904.88,911.16,"-- at the time, Mr. Lanier said they weren't striking the -- the jurors because of race."
2015.14-8349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,916.63,921.475,-- African-Americans were -- who were struck were -- were women.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,927.56,933.115,"Well, he -- he did accept women, though, as -- as well."
2015.14-8349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,935.5,943.01,The Court had not yet held that Batson applies to --
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,943.01,969.425,"The Court had not held in JEB that Batson applied to women, but the Court did say in JEB that, of course, it could be used as a pretext, women, for striking on the basis of race. In this case, the prosecutor struck three white jurors, and then he struck the three black jurors, women, the three black women and the three white women. The final --"
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.425,972.91,"Mr. -- Mr. Bright, Mr. Lanier --"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,972.91,973.36,Yes.
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,973.36,996.35,"-- answered yes when he asked -- when during the -- during the trial when he was asked whether he had done -- I don't know if it -- oh, no, it was on the motion for a new trial hearing -- whether he had done the same extensive background check on all the jurors, white and black. Did you find any evidence of that extensive black background search?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,996.35,996.69,No.
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1015.93,1024.125,So -- so your -- your understanding of that statement was that all -- he had only done an extensive search on the blacks on the list?
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1024.125,1034.6,"Well, it's clear, Mr. Lundy had prepared a -- a list, notes in which he talked about just the black jurors in -- in the case."
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1040.545,1057.09,"During the trial, did defense counsel, when he made his initial Batson challenge -- not in the papers, but at trial -- did he again say that this was part and parcel of the prosecutor's pattern?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1057.09,1060.34,"He didn't say that, but I point this interesting thing out."
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1079.47,1086.06,I was just surprised that we didn't hear about this preparation for a Batson hearing until --
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1086.06,1086.24,Well --
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1086.24,1087.215,-- the habeas.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1087.215,1092.24,The -- the defense lawyers at trial did move for the prosecution's notes.
2015.14-8349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.68,1138.02,"The prosecutors said that you -- they said, we never -- we never wrote or authorized or relied on those notes."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1144.62,1148.68,"No, but all the prosecutor talked about were the color-highlighted notes."
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1306.65,1308.135,Mr. Bright --
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1308.135,1308.91,And --
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1308.91,1323.45,-- I have found some circuit courts who have a rule on appeal or on habeas which is if they can find one legitimate reason for striking a juror --
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1323.45,1324.005,Yes.
2015.14-8349,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1324.005,1327.76,-- that's enough to defeat a Batson challenge.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1335.785,1341.165,"Well, it can't -- I -- I would suggest it -- it can't possibly be."
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1423.6,1426.7,"Well, in -- in response to Justice Sotomayor's question --"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1426.7,1426.96,Right.
2015.14-8349,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1426.96,1439.91,"-- if the prosecutor argues a laundry list of reasons for striking the black juror and some of those are reasonable and some are implausible, how should the Court approach the Batson analysis?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1439.91,1442.835,I think the Court looks at which reasons are pretextual.
2015.14-8349,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1466.85,1504.015,"Don't you think this is -- this is a case-by-case thing? Suppose there's one reason that's a killer reason? Like this -- this individual has numerous prior felony convictions, all right? And then the prosecutor says in addition, and this -- this person didn't -- he looked down at the floor in answering the questions and didn't seem to pause and didn't seem to understand some of the questions. So under a circumstance like that, couldn't the Court say, well, the one -- there's one reason here that would -- that is clearly a justification for a peremptory strike? We don't have to determine whether there's evidence that the person was looking down at the floor."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1504.015,1509.72,"Well, of course, Batson says, and the subsequent cases say, you look at all relevant circumstances."
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1524.88,1530.705,A lot of those smoking guns were in the original decisions by -- by the Georgia courts.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1551.275,1551.71,"Well, when the --"
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.71,1552.85,-- that the Georgia courts decided?
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1552.85,1569.78,"When the -- when the new smoking gun tells you that the prosecutor misrepresented facts and gave reasons that were absolutely false, demonstrably false reasons, and those are not clear before, but you have that now, I mean, Batson turns on the feasibility of the reasons."
2015.14-8349,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.3,1589.845,"Yes, but all -- all I'm saying -- and you seem to be agreeing -- is that it is not the overall Batson judgment that's before us but rather the judgment that the -- that the new evidence did not suffice to create a Batson violation where none existed before."
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1589.845,1590.1,No.
2015.14-8349,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1627.45,1640.925,"Are you saying in answer to Justice Scalia that when you had the notes, those notes cast doubt on some of the prosecutor's justifications in the first round?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1640.925,1654.42,"They -- they do that, and -- and they show misrepresentations to the court, and they show an overarching goal of separating out the African-American citizens, treating them differently and then putting them on this list of ""Definite NOs."""
2015.14-8349,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1654.42,1660.345,"And Mr. Bright, just to make sure I understand, all the notes in the prosecutor's files were new; is that right?"
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1660.345,1661.26,New.
2015.14-8349,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1662.07,1662.46,Yes.
2015.14-8349,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1662.58,1668.96,And there were three people: It just involved the two prosecutors and the investigator who put those together. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
2015.14-8349,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1668.96,1677.995,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Burton."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1677.995,1689.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I believe there are two important factors in this case when reviewing the entirety of the evidence. One is Petitioner bears the burden of establishing clear --"
2015.14-8349,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1689.62,1693.87,I -- I'll ask you as well to address the certiorari question first.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1693.87,1698.965,"And -- and respectfully, I disagree with Petitioner's counsel on this issue."
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1722.7,1725.44,"Well, the problem is I don't think this is discretionary review."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1734.665,1741.955,"Yes, Your Honor, and that is -- that's a pretty hot-button issue I know right now in the State Federal courts in Georgia."
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1764.48,1770.32,And has the Georgia Supreme Court ever -- ever said anything one way or the other as to whether it's discretionary or not?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1770.32,1781.51,"In two of their cases, Reed v. Hopper, which is 219 S.E.2d 409, and Smith v. Nichols, which is 270 S.E.2d 550, 1999."
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1789.065,1790.77,Could you give me the -- the Reed v. -- what?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1790.77,1791.605,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.345,1805.34,Are certified questions available in Georgia? Could -- could we certify a question to the Georgia Supreme Court?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1805.34,1807.135,"I -- I believe you can, Your Honor."
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.135,1811.795,You did -- we -- I -- I -- we looked at -- I looked at the statute.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1827.365,1828.67,"Well, the -- in State habeas --"
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.67,1829.655,Do they state that?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1829.655,1832.37,"Well, in the State habeas, I think it's 9-14-52 --"
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.37,1832.655,Yes.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1832.655,1839.83,-- the statute takes State habeas cases out of other appellate review and makes that just discretionary.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1841.03,1848.41,"Well, wait, wait, wait. Then I've been looking at the wrong place. You heard your brother here say -- he quoted some words."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1853.61,1854.24,"Well, it's --"
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1854.24,1859.3,And the Georgia statute said -- I just can't find it in my book here.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1871.275,1872.29,"Well, there is --"
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.29,1873.38,"Does it ring a bell, what I'm saying?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1873.38,1874.44,It -- it does ring a bell.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.44,1875.45,Or what are the exact words?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1875.45,1877.235,I -- I -- I do not know the exact words.
2015.14-8349,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1878.14,1884.315,The exact words are that a certificate of probable cause will be issued when there is arguable merit.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.315,1884.99,Yes.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1885.77,1888.5,But I believe that's Rule 36 of the Georgia Supreme Court.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.5,1888.7,Right.
2015.14-8349,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1889.31,1891.64,I think it's 9-14-52.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1894.82,1895.27,Okay.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1896.59,1898.59,I -- I believe the statute would trump it.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1898.59,1906.135,Does the word that he -- that the Chief Justice just read from Georgia law govern this case? The answer is yes or no.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1906.135,1908.03,"I -- no, I believe it's discretionary."
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1908.03,1909.205,They do not govern this case.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1909.205,1909.8,I believe the State --
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1909.8,1909.89,Okay.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1916.84,1919.42,I believe it's -- and -- and correct.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1932.495,1932.74,Okay.
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.92,1956.18,"Well, I -- I suppose that -- that -- that a court could have a discretionary view but could provide by rule that, in the exercise of our discretion, we will grant any of these unless it's patently wrong. Could -- couldn't -- and -- is -- maybe that's what's happened here."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1973.95,1977.12,I think the -- I think the taking of the case does remain discretionary.
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1982.81,1983.34,"Well, why would we --"
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.34,1988.835,You've -- you've just decided that you will uniformly exercise your discretion in a certain way.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,1988.835,1989.715,Correct.
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.715,1990.085,Yes.
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1990.085,1992.8,But -- but I -- maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2005.285,2007.09,That is -- that is my understanding.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2015.155,2015.83,I'm sorry.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2019.825,2024.91,The State habeas process is different than the regular appeal process.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2024.91,2025.675,That's correct.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2025.675,2031.435,"On the regular appeal process, they look at each case -- each case with discretion."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2031.435,2037.1,"On a direct appeal process, it -- it -- and certainly a capital case, it is mandatory review."
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2037.1,2038.105,Okay.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2049.79,2057.515,I -- if I may rephrase: I think the rule says that they will take a case if it has arguable merit.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2058.71,2059.51,In the positive.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2059.51,2059.92,"Right, right."
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2059.92,2070.69,"So what would lend us to believe that they didn't look at the merits and say there was no arguable merit? That they just said, we're too busy."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2074.48,2078.73,I would never -- I would never say they were too busy to take the case.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2078.73,2079.12,I'm sorry.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2079.35,2089.955,"But -- I said I would never say they were too -- that that would be the reason. But I think they would say, we've looked at this case -- because they do have the records before them -- and we don't see arguable merit to take this case up."
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2089.955,2092.52,So that is a decision on the merits.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2094.86,2101.3,I think it is a fine -- there is no arguable merit to the application that there has been error below.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2101.3,2101.76,Okay.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2101.76,2104.105,If that makes it any clearer.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2104.105,2105.545,Now it's clear.
2015.14-8349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.545,2109.915,"And in your view, cert should have been granted to the Georgia Supreme Court?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2109.915,2121.33,"I believe in my -- I believe it should have been granted to the State habeas court because of that discretionary review and because I believe that this Court has said, in Michigan v. Long, that if it's --"
2015.14-8349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2121.33,2121.95,All right.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2121.95,2124.82,"-- if it's unclear, it comes from the State habeas court."
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2124.82,2126.8,Can I just ask one more quick question about this.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2126.8,2127.035,Sure.
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2127.035,2134.0,"You -- you made reference -- this is an issue that's being litigated in the Georgia courts, is that right, in the Eleventh Circuit?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2134.0,2134.5,That is correct.
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2134.5,2135.685,This precise issue?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2135.685,2136.66,This -- this issue.
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2136.66,2139.0,Thank you.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2139.0,2141.2,To --
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.2,2143.605,What -- what issue is that?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2143.605,2146.01,The -- (Laughter.)
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.01,2150.96,Is it -- is it the issue of which court the certiorari should be directed to?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2150.96,2152.18,"Well, I -- I -- it's -- it's --"
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.18,2155.28,The issue of what? What is the issue that is being litigated?
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2155.28,2162.89,"Well, I'll -- I'll -- am I right that the issue that is being litigated is whether the Supreme Court review, in cases like this, is discretionary or not discretionary?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2162.89,2163.69,That is correct.
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.69,2164.0,All right.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2164.0,2166.46,"And in those cases, obviously, it's coming up from Federal court."
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2175.18,2180.26,And this question is in both the Georgia Supreme Court and in the Eleventh Circuit?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2180.26,2182.39,It is -- it is currently in the Eleventh Circuit.
2015.14-8349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2194.73,2201.33,Do you think this would be an appropriate case for us to exercise our discretion to certify the question to the Supreme Court?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2201.33,2206.44,We would certainly like an answer from the Georgia Supreme Court on that issue.
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2213.92,2220.11,There's a statute that permits the -- the Georgia Supreme Court to accept certified questions.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2231.975,2233.27,"I do not, Your Honor."
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.12,2251.07,"What -- what if we hold in this case that it is not discretionary review, and then, in these cases that are pending, the Georgia Supreme Court says it is discretionary review? Who wins? (Laughter.)"
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.07,2254.655,Is it ultimately a question for us or for the Georgia Supreme Court?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2254.655,2260.715,"I think it's ultimately a question for the Georgia Supreme Court as to what -- what their law is, what the State law is."
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2260.715,2262.195,Why?
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2262.195,2265.825,Me too. Can I -- can I go to the merits? Is that -- is that all right?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2265.825,2266.73,Sure.
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2266.73,2268.09,Okay.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2309.435,2310.82,I don't think it is.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.22,2342.95,What is the reasonable explanation?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2342.95,2349.77,"The reasonable explanation in this case is, four months prior to trial, as was previously argued, Batson had just come out."
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.04,2383.6,"In other words, the argument you're making here --"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2383.6,2384.76,Exactly.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2384.76,2397.615,-- is that -- is that the reason he highlighted all the black jurors in green and thus said black -- what about the black jurors and did all these different things was because he was preparing a defense in case of a Batson challenge.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2397.615,2398.34,Correct.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.34,2398.7,All right.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2405.01,2406.7,And it was not -- JUSTICE BREYER? It's been several years. Yes or no?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2406.7,2407.06,And it was not.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2407.53,2414.21,"It was not. So if that had been his real reason, isn't it a little surprising that he never thought of it -- (Laughter.)"
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2414.21,2418.78,-- or didn't tell anybody until you raise this argument in your main brief?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2418.78,2424.945,And -- and I -- I would -- I would say that's on State habeas counsel.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.32,2432.51,All right.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2475.45,2478.22,"Well, in this case -- and again, I think this is --"
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2478.22,2479.405,One may be valid.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2479.405,2482.64,"Correct, and the other ones also may be --"
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2482.64,2482.96,Which one?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2482.96,2487.02,"Well, they all may be valid, but they all may not be as strong as -- as the -- as the first one."
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.66,2489.98,"Well, wait."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2518.48,2522.07,I think because you have to look at the time period this was done.
2015.14-8349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2540.26,2541.44,But he's simply wrong.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2552.03,2554.67,And that's -- that's Mr. Lundy. That's the investigator.
2015.14-8349,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.67,2561.32,"So it -- it -- it -- well, but that seems to me to undercut the argument, well, they're just feeling their way and so forth."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2568.81,2575.33,"Well, first let me say, I think that's why there was a laundry list because he was just espousing every reason he had."
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2582.765,2585.6,Who was responsible for the definite no list?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2585.6,2595.68,"The definite no list, nobody -- the only person that was asked about that was Mr. Lundy, who was deposed and said he could not identify who wrote that list."
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2596.44,2598.995,There are only three possible choices.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2598.995,2599.78,We -- right.
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2601.29,2603.84,And it -- and it exists -- the paper exists.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2605.24,2605.86,Correct.
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2612.7,2616.19,But there were five African-American jurors --
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2616.19,2616.73,Correct.
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2616.73,2624.57,"-- on the definite -- well, one of them was Garrett -- this -- as was pointed out."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2631.135,2632.04,Correct.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2632.39,2645.09,"Were we told that the only three people who did the investigation on Batson were the two prosecutors on the case and Mr. Lundy? So if Mr. Lundy says I didn't make that list, it has to be one of the two prosecutors."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2645.09,2651.38,"It has to be one of the two prosecutors, and one was not there on the day it was struck -- the jury was struck; only Mr. Lanier was."
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2665.39,2673.66,"What do you do with other -- I mean, it just -- it seems an out-and-out false statement."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2697.005,2699.97,And I don't think the record bears that out.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2729.65,2730.955,Didn't the habeas court --
2015.14-8349,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2730.955,2732.58,Did Mr. Lanier testify --
2015.14-8349,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2732.58,2733.05,Justice.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2733.05,2734.39,-- provide an excuse and say -- I'm sorry.
2015.14-8349,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2734.39,2735.18,No.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2735.18,2744.84,"Didn't the habeas court accept that he didn't know at the time of trial, but he just knew that Lundy didn't want her?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2744.84,2757.42,The -- what the -- the habeas court actually credited the fact that Mr. Lundy had advised trial counsel that Angela Garrett should be struck.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2757.42,2764.08,"But that was his explanation for why the prosecutor didn't know about the prior arrest, correct?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2764.08,2768.875,"No, I think the -- I think the State habeas court credited that as one of the facts of the strike."
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2768.875,2770.955,That Mr. Lundy didn't want her.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2770.955,2772.115,"Excuse me, I --"
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2772.115,2773.875,That Mr. Lundy didn't want her.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2779.835,2786.485,"Mr. -- actually, Mr. Lanier testified twice, though, that he was aware at the time of jury selection that he knew about --"
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2786.485,2789.055,"Mr. Lundy did, but the prosecutor didn't."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2789.055,2790.32,"Well, no."
2015.14-8349,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2802.69,2813.705,"Well, didn't he also testify -- this is on 14 of the reply brief -- it has come to our attention since the trial of this case that Angela Garrett was arrested?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2813.705,2833.365,"It says on -- on that page of the -- on that part of the transcript, which I -- I cannot explain to you in -- in contrast to in the notes, it is noted that she is the cousin prior to the jury selection, unless that means -- and I've read it several times -- since that time she's been dismissed from her job."
2015.14-8349,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2835.74,2842.075,What about the -- what about the giving a reason for dismissing her that she was close in age to the defendant?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2842.075,2843.875,When -- and the --
2015.14-8349,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2843.875,2845.1,She was in her 30s.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2846.76,2854.74,"And when he initially strikes -- when Mr. Lanier initially explains his strikes, he does state her age, so he is not trying to say she's 23."
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2887.505,2929.27,"But -- but Ms. Burton, wouldn't you agree, in a lot of these Batson cases, you'll have purported justifications, which they could support a valid peremptory strike, right? But that the question for a court is, well, but did they support this valid peremptory strike? In other words, what was the prosecutor thinking? Batson is a rule about purposeful discrimination, about intent. And so it doesn't really matter that there might have been a bunch of valid reasons out there, if the -- if it was clear that the prosecutor was thinking about race. You agree with that, right?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2929.27,2932.89,I think if his intent was to strike based on race.
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2932.89,2940.375,"Yes, if his intent was to strike based on race, it doesn't matter that he could have had a different intent that would have supported a good peremptory strike."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,2973.225,2975.1,And -- and I don't think these notes show that.
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.51,3005.09,"Where -- where there are, you know, other reasons that are plausible but could be phony, surely it's the -- it's the judge that hears the testimony who's best able to judge whether asserted reasons are phony reasons or not; isn't that right?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3005.09,3005.77,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.33,3009.34,It's sort of hard for us to do it on a cold record.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3009.34,3009.67,"Well, but --"
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3009.67,3010.48,"I mean, it's harder."
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3012.32,3022.15,"And Justice Scalia raises, of -- of course, a good point in the mine run of cases, but not in a case where all the evidence of intentional discrimination was not before the judge at the time."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3022.15,3031.64,"And -- and again, I don't think there's -- I don't think there's clear error here on these notes of racial discrimination."
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3049.59,3051.905,Why weren't the notes turned over earlier?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3051.905,3061.3,"The -- the notes were not turned over earlier, although it was brought up in the motion for a new trial in November, right after the trial in 1987."
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3088.06,3101.71,"What did they do with the failure to ask Ms. Garrett any questions about the issues that troubled the -- troubled, for example, her cousin's arrest."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3123.285,3149.865,"Well, I think a number of times -- and I know this Court's precedent on not asking questions is particularly in voir dire as to people. But as to a number of issues, I think when you're in voir dire and you're asking questions, you don't necessarily care what the answer is because with regard to Mr. Hood, if he had said, yes, I have a son that's been arrested, it's not going to bother me a bit that you prosecuted my son."
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3149.865,3163.67,"Well, stealing hubcaps, in my mind, is decidedly different than murdering people or attacking them the way this case was -- this case was about."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3169.865,3170.21,And he --
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3170.21,3171.425,-- he should have been punished?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3171.425,3174.26,"And he may well have, but it's a risk I don't -- the prosecutor --"
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3174.26,3175.72,That's what the record supports.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3175.72,3177.735,"Well, it's a risk the prosecutor didn't have to take."
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3189.54,3192.855,I -- I want to ask you a different question before your time is up.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3197.71,3197.96,Okay.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3197.96,3203.87,"And that is, is there an independent State ground here? Now, you're familiar with the record."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3203.87,3204.38,Yes.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3204.38,3210.4,And I read on page 192 of the -- of your record the decision.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3298.185,3301.125,I actually agree that it's unclear.
2015.14-8349,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3301.61,3303.155,"Well, that's the end of it, isn't it?"
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3303.155,3308.595,It is -- it is the end of it. I think it's unclear. The other -- one other issue --
2015.14-8349,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3308.595,3311.645,What do you think is Georgia res judicata law?
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3311.645,3316.025,"I think res judicata in -- in Georgia, if you have new facts or new evidence --"
2015.14-8349,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3316.025,3318.56,The res judicata goes out the window.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3318.56,3322.77,Then you -- then the court gets to look at the issue and go beyond.
2015.14-8349,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3323.89,3324.18,I'm sorry.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3325.44,3339.87,"In -- in -- in this case, once you have new facts or new evidence, if the Court in this case finds that they can review the evidence anew and a new review is had, then I think you are beyond that bar."
2015.14-8349,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3339.87,3343.045,I -- I don't understand what you've just said.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3344.785,3346.435,Okay. (Laughter.)
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3346.435,3356.705,If you have -- if the issue has been decided on direct appeal and you cannot go back to it -- a superior court obviously can't overturn the State's highest court.
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3370.585,3379.235,"Yes, I mean, I think that that's exactly how the decision is framed, right? Because the decision talks about claims that are not reviewable due to res judicata."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3414.64,3415.93,As much as I would like it --
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3415.93,3416.415,-- it is --
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3416.415,3420.63,"As much as I would like it to be an adequate and independent State law ground, I'm not sure I clearly have that here --"
2015.14-8349,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3420.63,3435.765,"What do you make of the statement on 175, ""As a preliminary matter, this court notes that, as cited by the Respondent, the following claims are not reviewable based on the doctrine of res judicata""? And the first one it lists is the Batson claim."
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3443.28,3443.57,No.
2015.14-8349,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3444.49,3445.55,"Well, I'd like the -- I'm sorry."
2015.14-8349,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3448.135,3449.395,Sorry.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3449.395,3453.61,"Yes, I think it -- if -- if anything, it is an alternate ruling."
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3453.61,3476.325,"But doesn't Georgia have the rule -- Georgia, the supreme court has said, Georgia law allows claims to be revisited on habeas when new facts have developed since the time of the direct appeal because a claim that is based on facts that did not actually exist at the time of the direct appeal, which is this case, is essentially a different claim."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3478.625,3479.13,Yes.
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3479.13,3481.74,New facts is essentially a different claim.
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3481.74,3483.03,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-8349,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3483.03,3487.69,"You may be right or wrong as a matter of conclusion law, but that's the law of Georgia."
2015.14-8349,1,62605,beth_a_burton,,3487.69,3488.575,That is the law.
2015.14-8349,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3488.575,3489.94,"Thank you, counsel. MS. BURTON."
