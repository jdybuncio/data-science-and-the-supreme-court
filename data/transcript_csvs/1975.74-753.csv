1975.74-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,46.478,We will hear arguments next in United States against Testan and Zarrilli.
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,48.405,51.444,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1975.74-753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,219.974,227.057,Do you know by any chance whether there had been many requests for comparisons since the Testan case was decided by the Court of Claims?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,227.057,228.04,I know of one.
1975.74-753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,228.04,231.056,Just one?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,231.056,238.363,There -- I know of one that resulted in a decision.
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,587.585,593.726,"Of course if you read, if you read the Wickersham case, Mr. Rupp, you wonder if the Back Pay Act was not superfluous?"
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,593.726,604.761,"Well, the Wickersham case, it is important to recognize I think that the context in which the Wickersham case was decided."
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.229,628.439,Keim and those case?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,628.439,631.718,"Keim and Hennan are the principal cases, I suppose."
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,673.692,684.094,"But really, all the Back Pay Act does is say if you are wrongfully denied your emoluments, you’re entitled to backpay, I would have thought -- I thought that was established by Wickersham?"
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,684.094,685.243,"Well, to some extent it was."
1975.74-753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,758.874,765.408,The Civil Service Commission is in fact paying different wages for the same work.
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,769.691,777.636,"Well, there are two, I suppose and they are or perhaps more properly stated they are part of the same process."
1975.74-753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,814.598,816.41,Totally prospective?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,816.41,819.21,Yes and I want to make that clear.
1975.74-753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,829.139,830.922,What is the second route?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,830.922,832.791,Well again it is part of the same route.
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,862.507,865.22,"Certainly, it does not cover discretionary decisions then?"
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,865.22,866.789,"No, it does not."
1975.74-753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,869.077,870.439,Maybe there just is no review.
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,871.201,888.098,"Well, if you have a case in which the Civil Service Commission says for the future we will not promote anyone with blue eyes or anyone who is black, I have little doubt that the District Court would entertain a suit under the mandamus action and would overturn that determination."
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.432,891.057,There you would have 1331 jurisdiction?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,891.057,895.501,"And 1331, yes, that is right."
1975.74-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,915.877,916.468,(Inaudible)
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,916.468,925.218,Thank you.
1975.74-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,925.218,928.243,"Mr. Rupp, you have about 15 minutes left."
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,928.243,930.902,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1037.855,1041.742,Must the United States be the only defendant in the Court of Claims?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1041.742,1042.473,Yes.
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.499,1288.185,"It is not often that the Justice Department relies on the Comptroller General to support its views, is it not?"
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1288.185,1293.416,"No, that may be true."
1975.74-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.198,1653.397,"If we agree with you in your first point, we do not reach this issue?"
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1653.397,1654.745,That is correct.
1975.74-753,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.745,1656.461,But we would have to if we did not?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1656.461,1662.495,"If you hold that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction in this case, you would have to reach point two."
1975.74-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1767.54,1772.957,"I suppose one of the considerations among many others would be the budget, would it not?"
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1772.957,1774.77,"Well, yes, that is right and --"
1975.74-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1774.77,1784.163,"If there was a sudden judicial order somewhere to move all of the class of 13s to grade 15, you would have quite a problem?"
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1784.163,1785.134,"Well, that is a problem."
1975.74-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1785.92,1789.251,There would be even more important problems over the budget?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1789.251,1807.537,"Well, there is the problem that you suggest and we referred to that in our brief and another related problem is that the Civil Service Commission could not necessarily assume that the position appointed to by the complaining employees was properly classified."
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.08,1836.928,I did not mean to interrupt.
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1860.953,1863.723,They do both.
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.723,1865.602,I thought they had to do one or the other?
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1865.602,1869.254,"Well, in theory, of course they should do one or the other."
1975.74-753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.208,1874.932,"I do not mean as a practice, but I mean, what should they do, largely under your argument?"
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1874.932,1884.164,"Well, their support for either preposition; I think the Proper Courts to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action."
1975.74-753,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1888.839,1900.494,But it says a jurisdiction is only to award monetary damages even though another Court might have a jurisdiction over a cause of action as to something else.
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1907.314,1907.902,"Well, it may not be."
1975.74-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1918.512,1926.856,"Congress’ determination that there was no cause of action stated in that Court would be essentially the same as jurisdictional determination, would it not?"
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1926.856,1931.604,That is correct and they would be obligated to do precisely the same having reached that conclusion.
1975.74-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1931.604,1932.222,Very well.
1975.74-753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1932.222,1944.326,"Mr. Rupp before you sit down, I ask this purely out of curiosity that Judge Consee (ph) did not sit on the case below, did he, and Senior Judge Larmour (ph) did."
1975.74-753,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1955.666,1956.788,I do not know.
1975.74-753,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.066,1960.403,Mr. McDermott.
1975.74-753,1,22749,edwin_j_mcdermott,,1960.403,1964.907,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1975.74-753,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1982.494,1986.031,"You are starting with their second intention, are you not?"
1975.74-753,1,22749,edwin_j_mcdermott,,1986.031,1986.348,"Well, so far it is first --"
1975.74-753,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1986.348,1988.053,You can come back to jurisdiction (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-753,1,22749,edwin_j_mcdermott,,1988.053,2002.095,"So far as jurisdiction is concerned, the Tucker Act gives the Court jurisdiction and we submit that it absolutely waives sovereign immunity insofar as it goes."
