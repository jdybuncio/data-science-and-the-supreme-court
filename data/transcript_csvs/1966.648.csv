1966.648,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.555,"Number 648, Marvin Clewis, Petitioner, versus Texas."
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,10.844,15.768,"Mr. Chief Justice, associate Justices, and if the Court please."
1966.648,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,179.293,181.0,Was that an arrest?
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,181.0,189.329,"Yes sir, that was an arrest and I believe that the officer concedes Mr. Justice White that it was an arrest."
1966.648,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,244.964,257.451,"Then may I ask if one of your position is then that this having been an illegal arrest not on probable cause at the time, everything after that is moot and that that ground alone inadmissible?"
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,257.451,273.364,"Yes Mr. Justice Brennan, that is one of our positions on this appeal that the arrest being illegal and it being a fragment, disavowed all of the police officer of the -- of the law as they existed."
1966.648,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,285.124,292.646,As to the third confession are you going to have a problem of attenuation of chain of events?
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,292.646,293.651,Yes sir.
1966.648,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,333.352,336.234,During those three days was he represented by counsel?
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,336.234,337.914,"No sir, he was not."
1966.648,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,368.24,369.958,Yes but definitely after the arrest?
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,369.958,372.435,Yes sir.
1966.648,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,555.364,558.093,Subject to -- subject to what did you say?
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,558.093,559.972,To seven polygraph examinations Your Honor.
1966.648,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,559.972,560.847,Oh yes.
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,560.847,563.166,They referred to in the record post line text.
1966.648,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,563.166,566.173,Is this while he was asserting his innocence?
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,566.173,568.74,"Yes sir, each of them."
1966.648,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,568.74,572.184,And we -- does the record show what the results were?
1966.648,0,39815,reagan_h_legg,,572.184,575.72,No sir.
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1524.977,1528.996,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1615.787,1619.874,Why would you want three confessions?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1619.874,1631.719,"Well, apparently the officers weren't satisfied that the version that he gave in the first two was not altogether true."
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1632.938,1640.148,"Well, that's probably the reason why the counsel for the petitioner wanted to see them?"
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1643.147,1665.029,"Well, our argument for that Your Honor, that's true, but our argument for that is that if petitioner had wanted those two confessions, those two prior confessions he should have asked for them when the officers testified on the third confession or any of those officers when they testified he could have asked for them under the holding of Gaskin versus State of Texas."
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1665.029,1668.982,The counsel said he asked for them in an earlier stage as I understand.
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1668.982,1671.039,That's before the trial Your Honor.
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1671.039,1671.398,Oh.
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1671.398,1684.153,"Now, during the trial there was a motion to suppress, heard, but I can't find anywhere in the record where he actually said Your Honor let me see those two confessions, we want to look at them."
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1687.686,1699.658,I don't want to pressure but is it the state's view that if he had asked for them at an appropriate time he would have been entitled to them as a matter of law?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1699.658,1703.352,"That's our position exactly Your Honor, under the holding of Gaskin."
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1703.352,1708.097,Your position is that they would have been entitled to him if he had asked for them in the proper time?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1708.097,1709.23,"Well, let me answer it this way."
1966.648,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1746.663,1751.521,Is that position based on state law or federal law?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1751.521,1758.343,Both Your Honor because the Court of Criminal Appeals has specifically held that we will not follow the Jencks Rule.
1966.648,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1758.343,1759.801,They will not what?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1759.801,1768.331,"They will not follow the Jencks Act or the Jencks case, that's Section 3500 in Title 18, the so called Jencks Act."
1966.648,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1788.828,1791.365,You mean this question wouldn't come up again?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1791.365,1793.232,I don't believe so Your Honor.
1966.648,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1793.232,1794.905,They've changed the law.
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1794.905,1795.873,They've changed the law.
1966.648,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1795.873,1797.134,The Court did it?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1797.134,1799.59,"It is -- no, the legislature did in the last --"
1966.648,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1799.59,1799.905,-- session?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1799.905,1804.266,"This morning, in fact it's more liberal than Section 3500 of Title 18."
1966.648,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1804.266,1806.36,"How did they change it, by rule or the law?"
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1806.36,1811.196,By statute Your Honor -- statute.
1966.648,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1811.196,1812.263,"A new rule, right?"
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1812.263,1813.131,"Yes sir, new rules."
1966.648,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1813.131,1814.929,In a statute form.
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1814.929,1821.086,"In a statute form, so this problem wouldn't arise anymore."
1966.648,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1890.728,1893.502,Was all of that -- was all of that disputed?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1893.502,1894.282,Yes sir.
1966.648,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1894.282,1898.324,All of this testimony was in dispute?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,1898.324,1913.777,"All of it is in dispute except made for the times that he was taken from the jail to Borger where the truck, pound truck he was driving in was searched that was admitted, the fact that he was taken out to the grave, now that was admitted."
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2016.514,2018.784,Was there a probable cause for his arrest?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2018.784,2020.026,"No sir, there was not."
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2020.026,2022.202,Why did they put him in jail then?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2022.202,2027.048,That's something that I would never be able to understand from the testimony of the officer and he was investigating --
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2027.048,2033.315,What were they trying to do when they put him in jail as a prisoner?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2037.05,2043.201,"As I understand it Your Honor, they were investigating the disappearance of his wife and this is why they were talking to him."
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2043.201,2046.799,"Yes, I know but why did they put him in jail?"
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2060.328,2061.425,I can't answer that Your Honor.
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2070.853,2071.855,The what?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2071.855,2075.507,"Was illegal, there was no probable cause of the arrest at that time."
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2075.507,2086.114,And do you concede that he was held there from the time that he was arrested for these several days for the purpose of obtaining a confession from him?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2086.114,2086.321,No sir.
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2092.965,2099.512,"Yes, was that they continue then to try to get a confession from him?"
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2099.512,2115.781,"Alright, let me answer this by saying that Your Honor to the statement of facts where he testified that on Tuesday -- alright, now Monday he gave the confession, he went before the magistrate, on Tuesday he testified that he wasn't bothered by anybody."
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2115.781,2116.637,He said what?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2116.637,2120.005,He wasn't bothered by anybody or abused.
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2120.005,2120.994,Which confession was that?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2120.994,2122.759,That's in the record page 144.
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2122.759,2124.845,Which confession was that Mr. --
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2124.845,2125.949,The first confession.
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2125.949,2126.751,First confession.
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2128.373,2131.654,He went to the magistrate afterwards then he was sent back to jail.
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2131.654,2135.703,And then when did they get number two or number three?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2135.703,2138.309,"Alright, now the second confession was taken on Thursday."
1966.648,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2138.309,2139.629,Thursday.
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2139.629,2153.103,"Now by the way, he did consent at the -- to the taking of the polygraph tests, so this was the reason why he was taken for the safety, that's on page 135 or 134."
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2157.777,2160.272,How many tests did they make of him?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2160.272,2162.529,"Well, there's quite a few Your Honor."
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2162.529,2163.09,I understood --
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2163.09,2164.461,I don't -- I don't dispute that.
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2164.461,2165.062,-- seven times?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2165.062,2168.354,I don't have any dispute on that.
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2168.354,2171.413,Did he -- does it show that he consented to all of them?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2171.413,2172.11,No.
1966.648,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2188.945,2194.937,Mr. Pena did the conviction rest on anything to accept these confessions or this third confession?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2194.937,2195.168,Well --
1966.648,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2195.168,2205.282,Or in other words was there independent proof not secured through the confession?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2205.282,2215.176,"First of all, of course he answers it didn't make any difference because the case is going to go if the confession was illegal, but the answer to your question, the -- there was an eye -- the mother-in-law --"
1966.648,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2215.176,2217.117,What is that -- what is that you said at the beginning?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2217.117,2229.592,"That if the confession is illegal or involuntary, was not voluntary then the conviction as I understand the law, he cannot --"
1966.648,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2229.592,2230.614,That wasn't my question.
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2234.947,2263.662,"Just testimony from the daughter of the deceased who testified that on a number of occasions that she witnessed where the petitioner was choking his mother and telling her he was going to kill her and the other witness was the mother-in-law who testified that on one occasion she came into the house and saw him holding a pistol to the woman's face, he was going to kill her."
1966.648,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2263.662,2268.789,But there was no evidence I gather as to the actual killing for which he was charged?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2268.789,2269.301,No.
1966.648,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2269.301,2274.447,Except for his own confession?
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2274.447,2276.078,There was some circumstantial evidence --
1966.648,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2276.078,2276.512,That's right --
1966.648,1,25906,gilbert_j_pena,,2276.512,2278.962,"That that's mainly it, the confession was really it."
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2830.897,2834.533,Just one or two things Mr. Chief Justice and associate Justices.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2908.548,2914.43,Mr. Legg I'm not clear on some procedural points here.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2924.955,2925.887,Yes Your honor on the face of the record.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2925.887,2932.634,And in connection with that motion did you ask that all three of them be produced?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2932.634,2934.258,"All three of them be produced, yes."
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2934.258,2935.357,Be produced.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2935.357,2936.065,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2936.065,2941.865,And there was the judge ruled on your motion before trial.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2941.865,2942.506,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2943.889,2946.668,"And the judge -- and the judge denied that motion, did he?"
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2946.668,2948.087,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2948.087,2961.626,And then at a later point during the course of trial and first start of hearing with the jury I supposed there was a proceeding to determine the voluntariness of the confession.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2961.626,2962.251,Yes Your Honor.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2962.251,2968.243,That is the state offered confession number three and there was a hearing to determine whether that was admissible.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2968.243,2970.0,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2970.0,2979.48,And at that time you did not again move for production of the other two confessions?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2979.48,2983.871,We did move to exclude all three confessions.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2983.871,2986.211,Prior to the trial.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2986.211,2987.586,"No, no, at this point that we talked about."
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2987.586,2988.435,At this point.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2988.435,2989.45,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2989.45,2998.147,That is to say in connection with the determination of the admissibility of confession number three which has been offered by the state.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,2998.147,2998.665,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3020.028,3029.553,"Yes, I'd like to see them because I didn't see it in your brief, perhaps I missed it."
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3029.553,3042.769,"I don't know exactly where it was, I can't think."
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3042.769,3066.289,Because I think that your adversary's position now is that the state would concede that you would have been entitled to the production of all three confessions had you proceeded in an appropriate way to demand the production and he says you did not proceed appropriately so that --
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3066.289,3067.558,Your Honor that --
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3067.558,3069.892,-- that becomes a point of some significance.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3069.892,3074.737,That appears to be the contention and frankly I don't know of any appropriate way to do it.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3101.123,3102.305,Did they?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3102.305,3102.907,They introduced --
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3102.907,3104.007,Did they also do it under the so called three --
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3104.007,3104.618,No.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3109.323,3112.114,And were they all three interviewed?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3112.114,3114.062,"No sir, only the third."
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3114.062,3119.894,Well if they offered then to produce them and you objected it.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3119.894,3120.053,They didn't.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3120.053,3121.441,Why weren't they introduced?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3121.441,3124.167,"Well, they didn't offer to, Mr. Justice Black."
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3124.167,3125.292,They did not offer them.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3125.292,3127.837,They never did offer to produce the first two.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3127.837,3129.607,I'm not talking about to produce.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3129.607,3130.979,"Well, introduce."
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3130.979,3133.674,Did they ever offered and introduced all three?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3133.674,3134.863,No sir.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3134.863,3136.738,I mean that did they offer to introduce?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3136.738,3137.596,"Just one, the third one."
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3137.596,3138.301,Which one?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3138.301,3139.07,The third one.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3139.07,3141.369,That's the only one that was offered to be produced.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3141.369,3145.873,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3204.945,3212.441,"Now where does that appear, is that -- did you just make that request subsequent to page 90?"
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3212.441,3213.001,No sir.
1966.648,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3238.117,3248.589,Well I guess that's what your adversary refers to then fact that this hearing you did say I am not asking for the confessions.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3248.589,3252.329,And at that particular hearing that is more or less true.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3254.885,3257.36,What was your reason for saying you didn't want them.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3257.36,3258.371,Sir?
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3258.371,3262.407,"What was your reason for saying you didn't want them, I understood you say that."
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3262.407,3265.328,Well Mr. Justice Black if I did say that and I know I did not.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3265.328,3268.449,But I thought you read -- I thought you read it.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3268.449,3276.252,"I did, it said that at that point we were arguing the second motion now which was an independent motion and we had already been denied the right to see them."
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3276.252,3278.853,You said you were not understood in the other?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3278.853,3282.994,I said that we don't want to see them right now but we do want the judge to see it.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3282.994,3287.302,"But did you state right now, you thought you did read a different sentence."
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3288.639,3290.467,No.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3290.467,3291.423,I understood you to say it --
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3291.423,3292.151,I don't think if they -- but --
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3292.151,3295.698,That you didn't want them.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3295.698,3299.013,"Yes sir, I did and in effect I say that at that point we didn't --"
1966.648,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3299.013,3305.818,"Well this was in the context of your trying to get the court, the trial judge as I understood to look at them."
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3305.818,3306.129,To look at it.
1966.648,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3306.129,3309.868,"And you were saying “Look I'm not asking for myself, I want you to look at them.”"
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3309.868,3310.367,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3310.367,3310.811,Is that what it was?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3310.811,3311.456,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3313.001,3319.513,"Well, I understood you to read a sentence that you said you were not interested and didn't want them."
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3319.513,3321.16,I did say that Your Honor.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3322.106,3323.395,Could you read it?
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3323.395,3329.754,"I'm not asking for the confessions, I have told you that I don't even care to see them."
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3337.317,3339.131,That was the whole of the conversation.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3339.131,3342.679,"Yes sir, well that particular conversation, yes."
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3342.679,3344.225,"Yes, meant on that."
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3344.225,3345.611,Yes sir.
1966.648,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3345.611,3349.421,And that was the only one in which you said you didn't want to see them.
1966.648,2,39815,reagan_h_legg,,3349.421,3352.459,Yes sir.
