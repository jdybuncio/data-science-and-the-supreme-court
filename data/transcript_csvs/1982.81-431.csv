1982.81-431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,We will hear arguments first this morning in Guardians Association against the Civil Service Commission of the City of New York.
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,13.141,17.276,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.709,378.227,"Mr. Crowley, may I just ask you, where are the regulations in the materials before us?"
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,378.994,381.179,"--They are not quoted, Justice Stevens, I'm sorry to say."
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,383.048,385.417,"I know they're referred to a couple of times, but I--"
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,385.417,386.167,"--They're not set out, sir."
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,386.683,388.369,"--They're not in the lower court opinion, either?"
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,388.369,390.669,"Not in full, I'm afraid, no."
1982.81-431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,398.808,401.592,I take it you've cited them?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,401.592,403.294,"We have cited them, Your Honor, yes."
1982.81-431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.294,404.928,So that we can find them.
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,404.928,406.08,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,411.448,413.0,But they're not contained in your brief?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,413.0,416.519,"They're not set out in detail in our brief, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.519,422.773,"If you rely so heavily on them, I'm somewhat surprised that you didn't set them out in your brief."
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,422.773,425.708,The relevant impact language is set out in our brief.
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.669,444.455,You say the relevant language is in the brief?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,456.077,469.801,"--Your Honor, it would take me a moment to find it, I'm afraid."
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,469.801,471.937,But you're sure it's there?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,471.937,472.737,I believe it is there.
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,474.372,479.692,"You refer to pages 13 and 32 in your index, and I didn't find it on either of those two pages."
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,480.492,481.225,"All right, sir."
1982.81-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,536.026,539.312,Would you paraphrase the regulations that you're relying on?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,539.312,540.078,"I can, sir."
1982.81-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,553.655,556.29,"Well, if it takes... I don't mean to interrupt."
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,556.29,559.141,I can quote.
1982.81-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,583.924,586.126,How would one interpret the phrase
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,589.911,605.706,"Well, it is our view, of course, that the appropriate thing... that that is a clear indication that to look at effects is an appropriate approach and that to do what was done here, to look at the discriminatory impact, the fact that the whites and Hispanics got in the top deciles at a much lower rate--"
1982.81-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,605.706,608.574,"I don't see how the word ""effect"" really helps you there."
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,617.097,621.049,"--I don't know that it spells it out definitively, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,736.924,742.594,Is there any other evidence of the agencies' interpretation other than the regulation?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,742.594,746.946,"I do not know of other evidence in the record, Justice White."
1982.81-431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.815,761.123,"So... and Congress then... as far as ratification is concerned, you just rely on the fact that Congress didn't disagree or perhaps approved of the existing regulations?"
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,761.123,772.763,"--I would submit that Congress had to be aware of the way in which the agencies were conducting their compliance audits, which they would report on to the Congress in the normal course."
1982.81-431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.763,774.549,"Well, that's what I just asked, whether there--"
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,774.549,775.332,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.332,776.899,--was any evidence other than the regulations.
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,781.703,783.655,I think I was answering your question.
1982.81-431,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.146,798.998,Is there anything in the legislative history?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,814.424,815.959,"I am not aware of any express language, Justice White."
1982.81-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1116.871,1126.495,"Mr. Crowley, are you going to address in your argument the cases in which this Court has expressed one view or another about the intent required under Title VI?"
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,1126.495,1129.797,"Yes, Your Honor, if you like I'll talk to that."
1982.81-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1129.797,1132.148,"No, I just asked you a question, did you plan to address it."
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,1132.148,1132.748,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-431,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.748,1134.767,Because this Court has had several cases.
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,1134.767,1136.05,"Indeed, sir."
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1220.956,1227.294,Do you agree with Justice Brennan's analysis of the legislative history of Title VI in Bakke?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,1227.294,1228.36,"Not entirely, Your Honor."
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.01,1229.646,Do you agree with any of it?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,1229.646,1238.768,--We agree that there is clear indication that many Congressmen were concerned with having a constitutional content for Title VI.
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.371,1270.973,"Well, let me phrase the question this way."
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,1285.131,1286.783,"It's closer to yours, Justice--"
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.783,1288.185,It's the same as my position?
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,1288.185,1288.935,--I think that's correct.
1982.81-431,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.935,1290.601,And quite different than Justice Brennan's.
1982.81-431,0,18547,christopher_crowley,,1290.601,1291.72,"That is correct, sir."
1982.81-431,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1295.271,1300.508,Mr. Koerner.
1982.81-431,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1300.508,1303.81,Chief Judge and other honorable members of this Court:
1982.81-431,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.247,1625.449,Which was the majority opinion in Bakke?
1982.81-431,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1627.433,1631.27,"--Well, insofar as the legislative history with respect to Title VI."
1982.81-431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1901.762,1903.597,"Mr. Koerner, you used the word ""intent""."
1982.81-431,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1906.632,1907.299,--No.
1982.81-431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1908.918,1910.384,"Where did ""intent"" come from?"
1982.81-431,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1910.384,1912.703,--Washington versus Davis.
1982.81-431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1912.703,1913.536,But it didn't come out of--
1982.81-431,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1913.536,1914.053,"No, no."
1982.81-431,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.339,1945.257,"--Even though they didn't use ""intent""?"
1982.81-431,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1945.257,1945.807,--That's right.
1982.81-431,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.161,2030.613,Very well.
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2033.732,2076.659,"I'd just like to add briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, that where there has been no reference in the debates to intent, which is our issue, where the debates are necessarily unclear, that whether you assume a constitutional standard or not, that there should be deference to a comprehensive 18-year history of the use and ratification of regulations like these, which were in our view impliedly endorsed by the Congress in '66 and when they used similar language to Section 601 in later years; and that that's the best evidence of what the Congress' attitude toward intent was, toward intent versus impact was in 1964."
1982.81-431,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2076.659,2077.694,"Mr. Crowley, may I ask--"
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2077.694,2078.511,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-431,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2078.511,2090.652,"--below was there any discussion of the question whether there was a private cause of action derived from the regulations, as contrasted with from the statute?"
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2090.652,2091.201,No.
1982.81-431,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2091.201,2093.103,There was never a discussion of that?
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2093.103,2095.139,"There was never a discussion of that in that light, no, sir."
1982.81-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.139,2096.805,Is the issue here a private cause of action issue?
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2096.805,2102.793,"I would have thought, Justice White, that it was covered by the fact that we did plead Section 1983 in this case, which as as I read your view--"
1982.81-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.793,2106.161,"But that's the issue... but the issue is here, then?"
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2117.719,2120.254,--There was no appeal on that subject.
1982.81-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.276,2139.299,Is the Respondent privileged to rely on... to try to have the judgment sustained by arguing a private cause of action?
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2139.299,2142.084,"--I think that could be raised here, sir."
1982.81-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2142.084,2160.497,"So if we thought 1983 doesn't really dispose of it, when we had to get to the statute, of course Congress could in Title VI have relied exclusively on administrative enforcement wholly aside from 1983."
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2160.497,2162.097,"I understand that, Your Honor."
1982.81-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.937,2178.709,But we have held that Congressional provisions for an administrative enforcement supplant even 1983.
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2178.709,2179.893,"That's right, Your Honor."
1982.81-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.893,2188.649,"Well, relying on 1983 doesn't conclusively establish your cause of action, does it?"
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2188.649,2189.684,I thought it did.
1982.81-431,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.684,2194.719,"Well, Congress could have intended to provide an exclusive remedy."
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2194.719,2197.005,"Yes, sir, I suppose they could have."
1982.81-431,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2198.456,2224.422,"But I gather, Mr. Crowley, if we may address the question of a private cause of action, if we were to conclude that there was no disparate impact liability under 601 itself, but that... I gather you would not think we could reach the question whether impact liability under the regulations here could be reached."
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2224.422,2237.581,"If the Congress... if I understand your question, Justice Brennan, if the Congress in 1964 intended to limit what the federal agencies could do to a clear Washington v. Davis intent standard, I would not argue that the regulations--"
1982.81-431,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2237.581,2238.748,You would not argue that?
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2238.748,2239.432,"--No, sir."
1982.81-431,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.995,2261.447,May I ask another question on the private case of action problem.
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2289.114,2294.434,"I do not... I'm sorry, Justice Stevens, I do not recall the answer to your second question."
1982.81-431,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.059,2311.13,"You'd say the word ""laws"" encompasses regulations as well as federal statutes?"
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2311.13,2311.696,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-431,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.696,2312.296,That's your view.
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2314.915,2318.117,"As long as they are valid and have the force of law, which we strongly urge that they are."
1982.81-431,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2319.034,2323.52,"Mr. Crowley, do you think we have to decide the private cause of action issue in this case?"
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2323.52,2326.322,Cert was not granted on it.
1982.81-431,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2326.322,2327.339,I know it was not granted.
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2331.459,2336.928,"I do not believe so, Justice Powell."
1982.81-431,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2336.928,2339.297,What was your answer?
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2339.297,2340.399,I hope I'm not right about this.
1982.81-431,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2344.184,2347.803,Which would suggest that we do have to decide that issue.
1982.81-431,2,18547,christopher_crowley,,2361.495,2365.847,I'm afraid I agree that you're certainly not precluded from looking at that.
