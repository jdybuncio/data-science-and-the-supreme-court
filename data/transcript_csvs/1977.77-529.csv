1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.846,We will hear arguments next in Wise v. Lipscomb.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,39.223,41.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,68.842,71.202,Was that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,71.202,72.009,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,72.009,73.125,Not the Fifteenth Amendment?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,73.125,74.283,"No, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,78.588,82.533,But the grounds for the Court's decision was the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,82.533,84.356,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,84.356,91.024,"In so far as the Dallas electoral system, discriminated racially, is that it?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,91.024,92.261,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,92.261,98.6,There was no finding of any violations of Reynolds v. Sims in any of this --
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,98.6,101.937,"No, sir, there is no question of Sims, since it was a purely at-large system in the beginning."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,107.688,108.829,It is not a Fifteenth Amendment decision?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,108.829,110.061,"No, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,110.061,116.857,"But there was no finding of any constitutional violation here, was there, in the at-large system?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,116.857,119.633,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,130.554,135.082,"And you are not really released and this case does not involve that issue, does it?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,135.082,135.786,"No, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,136.41,138.158,You have a totally new structure now.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,138.158,138.226,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.226,142.313,"But they did not find a one man, one vote violation?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,142.313,142.62,No sir.
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,187.612,188.431,Mr. Werner?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,188.431,189.767,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,189.767,197.555,You referred the plan having been generated by the City Council would you tell us exactly how that happened step by step?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,197.555,198.478,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,265.059,272.758,The City Council had not adopted the plan until after the Court approved the plan that was suggested?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,272.758,274.303,"That is correct, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,274.303,275.843,Except by a resolution?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,275.843,276.937,Except by resolution.
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.937,278.78,"Well, The City Council did it though, did it not?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,278.78,279.791,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.791,281.582,It just was not in the form of an ordinance?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,281.582,283.117,"That is correct, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,283.117,284.93,Is the resolution in the record?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,284.93,286.177,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,286.177,290.464,"Now, if that had been an ordinance, it might as well have been an ordinance?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,290.464,294.931,"Well, I think if it had been an ordinance, there would not be any question at this point."
1977.77-529,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.931,297.438,But why should there be any difference?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,297.438,304.371,"Well, I think in fairness to the respondents in this case, there is some ambiguity in the resolution."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,312.791,314.994,I thought that is what the City Council was proposing?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,314.994,316.44,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,316.44,317.485,That was clear enough.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,317.485,317.603,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,317.603,327.476,"But let me ask you this question, did the City Council have any power or authority to approve a plan definitively?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,330.893,336.744,"Mr. Justice Powell, what we had here was a previous plan prescribed by a charter."
1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,348.24,349.679,Or an order of the Court?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,349.679,350.566,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.21,377.674,"And you might just as well have passed the ordinance when you passed the resolution, except you probably would rather know whether it was constitutional before you passed it as an ordinance?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,377.674,378.147,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,378.147,384.524,Is that the explanation why the council proceeded by resolution rather than ordinance at that time?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,384.524,388.873,"Mr. Justice Brennan, frankly, we do not know at this point."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,399.841,403.008,What if it had been an ordinance when the resolution was passed?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,408.94,421.462,"Yes, sir, I think it would have and I think, if it had been passed as an ordinance a few days before the hearing then there would be no question that the city had promulgated this plan as law and then it was binding."
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,421.462,452.689,"Mr. Werner, the question I am now going to ask you is not addressed to merits in this case, but you filed an application for a stay with me last August, at least your name is on it, and it states the City Council reapportioned itself, enacted an ordinance and thereafter that the Court held hearing, now that is an error, I take it from what you now say?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,452.689,460.567,"Mr. Justice Powell, if I said that I have misled the Court and you, sir..."
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,460.567,472.144,"I think, I repeated it in the Chambers opinion and I will say this in fairness, the district courts said pretty much the same thing, but I now understand from the facts that is not what happened."
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,488.554,509.055,"Well, Mr. Justice Powell, what happened here was that on the 8th of February there was no order entered and the docket does not reflect any order, what happened was the judge made a preliminary finding that he considered the eight/three plan to be acceptable."
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,538.121,541.181,I just want to clarify that.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,549.979,551.121,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,580.327,583.757,Now you are confusing me.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,595.568,598.825,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, they were both."
1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,615.306,619.833,And that was pursuant to the directives of the Court?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,619.833,622.582,"No, sir, there was no directive from the Court that we pass an ordinance."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.582,632.815,But the Court addressed itself to the plans submitted by the city under the resolution and said it was constitutional?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,632.815,633.18,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.18,654.583,"Now, did it purport to treat that as a court plan and say, I approve this plan, or did they, you know, usually if the city passes an ordinance it is not a court plan, it is just something you either accept or reject."
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,654.583,655.228,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.228,658.571,What did the Court do with respect to the resolution?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,658.571,684.936,"Yes, sir, on February the 8th at the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Mahon, the District Judge, made a rather lengthy statement from the bench in which he said that he finds the eight/three plan, in his words, Passes constitutional muster, and he said he would later issue an opinion."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.936,687.61,He has (Voice Overlap) that plan in a decree?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,687.61,688.845,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.599,700.102,"When you do not do that with an ordinance, that you uphold, you just say it is constitutional and you look to the ordinance to see what the provisions are."
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,700.102,703.726,"I may have misunderstood your question, Mr. Justice White."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.726,713.116,Did he incorporate the very terms of the plan in the decree?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,713.116,716.873,"No, sir, only by saying that he found that it was constitutional."
1977.77-529,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.873,718.057,That it was constitutional?
1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,719.221,733.453,"Then when he approved the eight/three plan, it was simply a holding of the Court that it passed constitutional standards, but it is not part of a decree?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,733.453,735.241,"No, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,741.895,759.18,"I think I have the mind of the District Court that Mr. Justice White may have in mind, it is on page B 16 in the petition at the end of the middle paragraph."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,795.562,798.737,The resolution expressing an intent.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,798.737,799.633,"Yes, sir, and then --"
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,799.633,802.22,He interpreted it as an official expression of the court.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,802.22,803.042,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,803.042,809.226,"And then after this decree it was followed by an ordinance, and that in turn was followed by a charter amendment."
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,809.226,810.266,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,810.266,811.132,"That is my understanding,"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,811.132,812.358,"Yes, sir, that is correct."
1977.77-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.358,814.334,"Mr. Werner, is that quite correct."
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,822.065,827.483,"Mr. Justice Stevens, there was the resolution, then --"
1977.77-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.483,828.677,On January 20th.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,828.677,829.484,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,829.484,831.965,And then on February 8th there was the remedy hearing?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,831.965,832.386,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.386,834.442,In which he made an oral decision?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,834.442,835.077,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.077,842.082,"And then there was an ordinance, which is number 14800, which refers back to the oral decision, is that not right?"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,842.082,842.964,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.964,850.136,"And then after the ordinance was passed, there was then the written decision that Mr. Justice Powell read from in March."
1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,850.136,850.313,Of March 25.
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,850.313,853.266,"Yes, March 25th."
1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,853.266,854.021,That is where he used the word 'enacted'
1977.77-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,854.021,859.716,"So this is after the ordinance, whereas the oral decision was between the resolution and the ordinance?"
1977.77-529,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,859.716,861.904,The enactment is the ordinance?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,866.131,869.642,"Well, I think the reference is to the ordinance, but I cannot be certain what he meant."
1977.77-529,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,869.642,870.965,By this time there was an ordinance?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,870.965,872.604,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.604,886.261,"But if I am not correct, Mr. Werner, at the time of the ordinance, there had already been a decision by the Court because the ordinance itself refers to the decision and I call you attention to page A 2 of the --"
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,886.261,899.984,"Yes sir, it refers to the oral decision and if I may, I will read from the transcript of the judge?s remarks, this is volume 11 of the original transcript, page 86, the Court says, ?This Court has accepting --"
1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,899.984,902.756,Do we have it in print here at all?
1977.77-529,0,33644,joseph_g_werner,,902.756,905.922,"No, sir, it is not reproduced in the appendix."
1977.77-529,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1147.794,1154.952,"Very well, Mr. Werner."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1159.764,1164.353,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1278.7,1287.606,"Mr. Johnston, does it have authority by resolution to empower its legal counsel to make representations to the District Court in a case like this?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1287.606,1317.869,"It can and did empower its legal representatives to make representations to the Court and I have here and can supply to the court a copy of the accompanying letter that counsel for the city sent to the Court and that accompanying letter said, Pursuant to your order issued January 17th, I am enclosing a certified copy of the Dallas City Council resolution dated January 20."
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.519,1354.992,"Well, that sounds like we are going back to the forms of action to make this sort of distinction between a court saying we will impose a plan, but let us hear from the city as to what kind of a plan it wants and saying that that is subject to a different standard of scrutiny than for the court to say the present plan is unconstitutional let the city try again?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1354.992,1364.168,I think the distinction has to be made as to whether or not the city has the authority to try again under its own legislative scheme.
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1364.168,1366.995,Why is that for a Federal Court to decide?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1366.995,1374.572,We are talking about legislative power and the constitution of the State of Texas denies to the City Council the right to change its election scheme.
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1374.572,1394.77,"I do not see why we are talking about legislative power, we are trying to decide what standards the District Court is supposed to use and here this is an unambiguous expression of the lawmakers? views of the city of Dallas."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1394.77,1404.593,The courts had before it in the East Carroll the same kind of unambiguous statement of what the city would choose and the same in Wallace v. Brown.
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.593,1423.28,"I think it is a District Court that rejected the plan as unconstitutional and proceeded to draw up its own, might be something else again or if the city lawyer had just submitted the plan without any evidence that it was official policy of the city?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1423.28,1435.328,The case laws at this point would indicate that this Court has been looking as in East Carroll to the authority of the city to reorganize its legislation.
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1435.328,1451.156,"So you would say if the city had had power to change and represent this scheme overnight by an ordinance and if their first action in response to the Court's suggestion had to pass a new ordinance, the case would be different, you say?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1451.156,1465.148,"The case would be different, I would still urge the same result because we are dealing with a plan that was offered up after the fact of dilution of black voting streams, that finding had already made by it the Trial Court."
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.954,1477.928,"Well, That sounds to me like you are urging that the substitute plan offered was unconstitutional?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1477.928,1482.975,"No, we are saying only at this point that it violates the federal common law of voting rights."
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1482.975,1484.724,"You do not mean the common law of voting rights, do you?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1489.802,1492.465,"That language is not my own, it appears in --"
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1492.465,1495.393,"I would adopt it if I were you, it is not --"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1496.652,1498.9,No.
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1498.9,1530.359,"So we are talking the precedents to which you refer and upon which you rely, have to do what is appropriate and an equitable remedy to repair a constitutional violation and the cases to which you refer all involve violations of the doctrine of Reynolds v. Sims not a single one of them that I know of involved a violation of such as was found here which we do not have before us, and therefore, we cannot assess as to even whether or not it was a constitutional violation, but there is no claim that there was a violation of the so called one person, one vote?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1530.359,1531.306,That is correct.
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1531.306,1560.634,"And indeed all the cases to which you refer, none of them with which I am familiar and you are free to correct me, I may be wrong, I often am, have to do with at-large municipal elections of councilmen and there has been a presumption in this case that multi...member districts to a state legislature are somehow the exact equivalent of at-large elections in a municipality to the city government and they are quite two different animals."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1560.634,1565.475,"Let me respond, if I may."
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1617.088,1623.862,"It did involve a school district but it did not involve a Home Rule municipality, did it?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1623.862,1636.222,"That is correct, Your Honor, but the fact that the City of Dallas is a Home Rule city should not overlook the fact that it is limited in its ability to devise its own election scheme."
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1636.981,1644.888,"Yes, but I am talking about the constitutional test here and the remedy for asserted constitutional violation."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1653.187,1688.369,"That is correct, but it would seem to me that the federal remedy which we urge and which East Carroll urges which would require single member districts absent unusual circumstances it is particularly appropriate when there was a finding by the District Court as a result of an adversary proceeding that the at-large features of the City of Dallas election system diluted black minority voting strength."
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1697.431,1714.292,"It is assuredly that is a given in this case, but in assessing this plan do we not again have to look and see whether an at-large election is unconstitutional, is it not the least the threshold inquiry?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1714.292,1715.902,The District Court had already made findings --
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1715.902,1719.294,"Oh, but District Court did, you are here now."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1731.568,1736.066,"If the Court wishes to address itself to that issue, it may do so --"
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1736.066,1738.606,That is a threshold issue here.
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1738.606,1744.192,"No one else, certainly petitioners have not raised that issue and did not appeal in either court --"
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1744.192,1750.038,They certainly raised it to the extent that they say that the at-large election of three members of the City Council is not unconstitutional?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1750.038,1775.334,That is correct and I would point out to the Court that Wallace v. House had dealt with a commissioner form of a government for a city and that is a case where the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit as in this case had to address itself with that issue.
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1799.138,1812.366,"Has this Court ever held that an at-large election, within a jurisdiction is unconstitutional, be it city or state?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1812.366,1821.026,I think Wallace v. House tacitly reaches that point because it goes immediately to the remedy.
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.026,1827.88,"But those were all based on one man, one vote violation, now you get to the remedial phase, were they not?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1827.88,1833.405,"It is not my understanding that Wallace is based on one man, one vote."
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.026,1859.818,"That is not exactly one man, one vote, Whitcomb v. Chavez certainly rejects any notion that at-large voting in the city is per se or even semi per se, in doubt."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1859.818,1873.26,"That is correct, but it does indicate that if the proof is there and White v. Regester goes farther than that and says that the proof was there in that circumstance then you have established a constitutional violation of equal protection."
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.26,1892.249,"But one of the original complaints in Whitcomb v. Chavez was not the multi member district's violated the constitution, but that there was a violation of one man, one vote principle, was there not and then the question was whether the remedy was appropriate?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1892.249,1895.554,I cannot recall the record of it at that point.
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.554,1899.412,Let me back up on one thing that has left me somewhat confused.
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1923.456,1928.327,"Well, our posture would be the same, that it was in fact a court ordered plan --"
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1928.327,1945.478,"For all practical purposes, it was a court ordered plan, was it not and the city was, simply as a matter of comity or for whatever reasons, passing an enactment that carried out what they knew the Court wanted and what the Court had said would pass constitutional muster?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1945.478,1949.274,And what the Court would require as a remedy.
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1988.008,1998.224,"It is particularly difficult, is it not when you have an eight/three plan that is eight of them elected by districts and only three at-large, two at-large, really, because one of them is the mayor."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,1998.224,2025.017,That is why I think that the remedy required by East Carroll is particularly appropriate in these kind of cases because it instructs the city or whoever is working with the Court in order to purpose a plan that they must do several things and one of those things is that they must establish that there are unusual circumstances which will justify the continuation of any at-large features in that plan.
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.685,2052.326,"We would not suggest for a moment in the course of this case that whatever stage it was that the city, let us assume that the City Council of Dallas had the power in its charter to pass a new ordinance, it just simply passed a new ordinance and the old ordinance that the Court was considering just was not there anymore."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2060.504,2064.212,"Well, of course that is not the facts before us now, but --"
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.212,2066.328,I know you say it is not the facts --
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2066.328,2071.251,"Well, one would have to and I presume, one would seek some sort of injunctive relief from --"
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2071.251,2085.859,But then you would have to submit that ordinance to the Court and that ordinance would have to be found unconstitutional before it could be enjoined and I understand the Fifth Circuit in this case says that this ordinance is not unconstitutional?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2085.859,2091.286,The Fifth Circuit in this case never reached that issue and did not speak to that issue at all.
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2092.926,2094.734,"The District Court certainly did, did it not?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2094.734,2096.271,The District Court certainly did.
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2096.465,2103.207,I think there was no unconstitutional impact whatsoever under this.
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2103.207,2119.051,"That is correct and let me point out the difficulties that anyone litigating a plan in a hurry where we have an election coming up in April and we were in February, we spent five years attempting to prove the unconstitutionality of the eleven at-large seats in city of Dallas."
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2119.051,2124.834,"Exactly, and the city came along and passed a new ordinance."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2124.834,2130.779,Let me point out that the city and I think this is instructive.
1977.77-529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2195.721,2211.115,"Mr. Johnston, was is it part of your submission in opposing the eight/three ordinance, that it was unconstitutional or did you merely argue that it was an inadequate remedy for the previously found constitutional violation?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2211.115,2214.82,"Our argument, essentially, was that it was an inadequate remedy."
1977.77-529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.82,2221.773,"So that there really has never been an issue that anybody has had to decide as to whether the eight/three order was constitutional or unconstitutional, is that correct?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2221.773,2224.441,The judge presumed that if it were constitutional --
1977.77-529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.441,2225.117,It would be an adequate remedy.
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2225.117,2251.126,"It would be inadequate remedy, although I may point out that the judge was troubled by Connor v. Johnson and throughout his opinion attempted to state unusual circumstances such as the Mexican-American situation which would justify the plan, but we were not anywhere equipped to argue the constitutionality of that plan because that kind of proof is very difficult to come by in the short space of time that we had."
1977.77-529,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.126,2260.001,"If the fact or the conclusion of constitutionality were the end of the case, he would not have needed even to address the question of the Mexican-Americans, is that not correct?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2260.001,2263.231,That is correct.
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.604,2327.39,"District Court said that it gave the city a chance to come up with a plan and he said, ""I find that it has met that duty in enacting the eight/three plan of electing council members."""
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2327.39,2330.934,The judges opinion is ambiguous in several respects.
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.765,2353.17,"Well, that may be so, but this seems to me rather unambiguous in saying that in his view, the plan wherever it came from passed constitutional muster."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2353.17,2357.35,"Well, I think that it is clear in the Court's belief --"
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2357.35,2364.519,And do you not believe that the intervenors in that were urging that the plan was unconstitutional?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2364.519,2365.645,I think that is correct.
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.645,2371.43,And so there was an issue before the judge about the constitutionality of the plan?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2377.244,2388.743,"Well, I can only respond that the Court was, as were the parties, operating under intense time pressure --"
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.743,2397.354,"Well, it may be, but the intervenors claimed it was unconstitutional and he said the plan is constitutional and did you appeal that?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2400.94,2407.359,"Well, the issue that we raised in the fifth circuit was the appropriateness of the remedy."
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2407.359,2413.339,And did you say the plan was unconstitutional?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2413.339,2415.362,"That appeal was some years ago, I --"
1977.77-529,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.362,2425.882,"Well, here is what the Fifth Circuit said, It cannot, however, be successfully maintained that the use of at-large voting to select three council members is itself constitutionally defective."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2425.882,2438.514,That is correct and there is plenty of language from this court indicating that at-large features in and off themselves must be attacked on the factual matrix in which they develop.
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2438.514,2443.575,That is multi member districts for a state legislative body?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2443.575,2466.857,"Well, I would say that Wallace v. House and then applying it to the parish as in East Carroll indicates the court is willing to go further than that."
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.083,2479.898,"You have referred counsel several times to Wallace v. House, that is not a case of this court, is it?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2479.898,2481.601,"Yes, it is."
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2481.601,2483.237,We remanded it for consideration.
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2483.237,2486.314,You remanded it for consideration in light of East Carroll.
1977.77-529,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.314,2487.148,That is the extent of its --
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2487.148,2491.71,But it is not a decision on the merits by this court?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2491.71,2503.811,"Well, to the extent that the Court of Appeals took it to mean that what was involved was the East Carroll issue which is a one issue case, essentially."
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.811,2509.49,"Well, then it is certainly a decision of the Court of Appeals to that effect, but not a decision of this Court to that effect?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2509.49,2525.449,"Well, I would only say, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the clear implication of the remand of Wallace v. House was that what the Court of Appeals must consider was the appropriateness of the remedy."
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2525.449,2527.889,(Inaudible)
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2527.889,2534.445,"Exactly, and of course, the Court of Appeals did do that and cert was denied by this Court."
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.445,2546.925,"But do you think all of our remands are that precisely tailored, that we never grant, vacate and remand except having thought the thing through that carefully?"
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2550.553,2552.978,I think it is very fair.
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2552.978,2557.128,A remand is a question not an answer.
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2568.798,2572.331,"Well, the Court of Appeals did reconsider."
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2599.68,2601.498,And then did it not come back here again?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2601.498,2607.366,"It did and certiorari was denied, that is correct."
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2816.571,2831.917,"Well, does that prove any more than what has been said in some opinions of the courts that people do not necessarily indulge always in block voting?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2845.227,2847.668,"It does not, in fact, Mr. Chief Justice, it helps --"
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2847.668,2850.252,"For the man, not on a racial basis."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2850.252,2866.468,"However, the record as developed in the trial of this cause from every expert witness indicates that in the city of Dallas, we have the unfortunate situation where block voting along racial lines is the rule and anything else is the exception."
1977.77-529,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2866.468,2891.425,"The record also shows that when the primary case was won on April 14th, in 1944, all of the Negroes in Dallas were the solid block and by election time they had split into four different groups, that is what the records show, four groups and that was about five months."
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2891.425,2920.736,"The record will also show in this case that since the institution of the eight/three plan ordered by the district court, there has not been a Mexican-American candidate elected to the City Council in the city of Dallas. Previously there had been one, but since this time, although they have run, I do not believe, I think the record will indicate that, none of them have won more than a third of the vote, and therefore, have failed in their efforts to be elected at-large."
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2975.96,2981.412,"Mr. Johnston, was Connor v. Finch a City Council or a legislative apportion?"
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,2981.412,2982.85,It was legislative apportion.
1977.77-529,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2982.85,3000.908,Is there not a fair amount of expertise in city management and city government to the effect that strictly election by ward does tend to lead to pork barreling in a way that it does not on a state wide basis?
1977.77-529,1,31096,james_a_johnston,,3000.908,3007.253,"If there is such study, it was not in evidence in this case."
1977.77-529,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3022.365,3025.878,Mr. Buscemi.
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3025.878,3029.122,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3065.515,3066.507,As this one did not.
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3066.507,3069.91,"As this one did not, that is right."
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3093.042,3098.285,"Well, that is always true when you have an election by majority rule."
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3105.47,3136.538,"That is true and that is what the basis of the Courts holding was in Whitcomb v. Chaviz where the Court found that there was no restriction of access by Blacks to the political process, but the Blacks were primarily democrats, there were lots of republicans in Indiana and the republicans won a lot of elections and as the consequence of that there were very few Blacks that were elected to the state legislature from Marion County, Indiana, but that is not what the district court found in this case and I think the evidence supports the findings of the district court."
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3136.538,3165.878,"Do you not think there is a difference, at least from the point of view of political structure and political science between a board of county commissioners or a county jury or whatever it may be called in various states, the school board on the same side on the one hand, and a small City Council elected at-large with the city manager system in a Home Rule municipality on the other?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3165.878,3171.611,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, there may very well be a difference there and we are not contending and the respondents are not contending -"
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3171.611,3178.855,"And why should the same, if there is a difference, why should the same constitutional rule, at least why should it automatically be transferred from one to the other?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3178.855,3183.063,"Well, this case as it stands now it does not really involve the constitutional rule."
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3184.388,3196.09,"Well, at least at the threshold, it involves whether at-large municipal elections are, if there is any defect in them at all, does it not?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3196.09,3198.347,"Well, that is true and the district court found that in the circumstances --"
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3198.347,3199.833,The District Court found so.
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3199.833,3202.245,In Dallas there was a defect.
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3202.245,3220.141,"Electing eleven of them at-large, now whether or not that is right or wrong is not now before us, as I understand it, but certainly that at the threshold there is before us the question of whether the election of three members of the council, including the mayor at-large is defective in any respect?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3220.141,3221.701,That is right.
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3227.559,3234.914,"Well, if it is undesirable, as a matter of view of a remedy, is that not the threshold consideration?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3234.914,3242.706,"That is right and this Court has said, admittedly in one man, one vote cases that reapportionment should prefer single member districts and that --"
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3242.706,3249.002,"And never said so with respect to a city managed municipality, never, is it?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3249.002,3253.643,Not in the context of at-large dilution.
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3253.643,3258.015,"No, or in any context, has it?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3258.015,3259.508,"Well, in East Carroll for example --"
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3259.508,3262.328,"But that is not a city manager municipality, is it?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3262.328,3266.352,"No, it is a parish police jury."
1977.77-529,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3266.352,3289.112,"Your position is that even though we were to conclude if presented with the issue on the merits that an eleven man at-large City Council would not be unconstitutional, the district court simply should dismiss the complaint, in this case we should nevertheless affirm the Fifth Circuit which held that three at-large members were improper remedially?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3289.112,3296.12,"Well, I think that the only issue before the Court is whether the remedy was improper."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3359.036,3365.734,"After a District Court orders it, are you suggesting that it must be pre-cleared, that the judges order must be pre-cleared?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3365.734,3367.701,"No, not at all."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3367.701,3369.909,"Well, is it not the judges order?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3371.332,3375.505,"Right now, this is a court ordered plan, that is right."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3376.41,3380.393,Then why is it subject to Section 5 then?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3380.393,3387.078,We are saying that as a court ordered plan it is defective because it departs from the remedial principles announced by this court in earlier cases.
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3390.802,3395.637,"Well, Dallas did not wish to have it, the court imposed it on them, Dallas did not want it at all?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3395.637,3400.745,"That is true, but Dallas now says that it wants the eight/three plan and if --"
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3400.745,3412.563,"Well, if it wants it, something as though after it is ordered by this Court, they might want it, but they did not want it in the first place, they have it because the court ordered it, have they not?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3412.563,3413.423,That is true and indeed Dallas --
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3413.423,3417.167,Well then why does Section 6 get into the act?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3417.167,3431.81,"Well because if Dallas now wants the eight/three plan or if Dallas wants the seven/four plan or indeed, if Dallas wants two single member districts and nine members elected at-large, they are free to submit that plan to the district court in the District of Columbia."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3434.41,3437.816,Suppose we do not agree with you that it is a court order plan?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3446.092,3446.851,Yes.
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3446.851,3453.542,"It would, even though it became such before Texas became a covered jurisdiction?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3453.542,3455.043,Yes.
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3455.043,3456.618,What authority is the reason for that?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3456.618,3468.264,"Section 5 provides that the city may not enact or seek to administer any plan not in effect on November 1, 1972."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3468.264,3477.844,"Then is it your submission that if this is a legislative and not a court ordered plan, nevertheless there has to be an affirmance because there has not been a pre-clearance?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3477.844,3478.83,That is right?
1977.77-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.83,3485.478,"You mean Texas, when it was covered should have gone back and submitted every, when was it covered, 1972?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3485.478,3487.601,"September 18, 1975."
1977.77-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3487.601,3496.803,"1975, so it should have gone back and canvassed all the changes that had ever been made since 1972 and submitted them all to the Attorney General?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3496.803,3499.242,"Yes, but indeed, no changes had been made since 1972."
1977.77-529,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3500.412,3501.53,Anywhere in Texas?
1977.77-529,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3501.53,3504.156,How can you know that in a state like Texas?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3504.156,3505.211,"Well, I am talking about in Dallas."
1977.77-529,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3505.211,3508.397,"Well, I am putting to you the question was Texas."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3508.397,3511.199,Your proposition was the whole state.
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3511.199,3512.824,"That is right, if there have been changes --"
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3512.824,3524.779,"Anywhere in Texas, locally, statewide, any change in the great state of Texas, you are supposed to bundle them up in a bushel basket and take them all to the Attorney General?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3524.779,3531.508,"The ones that were not in effect on November 1, 1972."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.508,3534.426,And did they do that?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3534.426,3536.363,Has all of Texas done it or did Dallas do it?
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.363,3540.017,Any of them.
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3545.016,3549.424,"Well, we wait for submissions."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3549.424,3554.564,"All right, very good."
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3565.288,3566.162,That is right.
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3566.162,3572.466,"Do you not suppose since 1972, there have been changes of polling places in the state of Texas?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3572.466,3582.513,I am sure they have and I am sure many of those have not been submitted and I am sure that the Attorney General has not exercised his right under the statute of to bring a private enforcement suits.
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3582.513,3593.431,But perhaps elections based on the changes in the polling places may now be challenged because of failure to get a pre-clearance?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3593.431,3597.786,"Well, I do not think that the change in polling place itself would be --"
1977.77-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3597.786,3608.155,Has there ever been a court decision that the Section 5 is retroactive like that or do you just read it on its face?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3608.155,3610.354,"Well, I think that when Section 5 was initially --"
1977.77-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3610.354,3620.93,"And it is possible to interpret it, I suppose, as meaning that any change hereafter that was not in effect in 1972?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3620.93,3627.199,"Well, any change hereafter by definition would not have been in effect on November 1, 1972."
1977.77-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3627.199,3636.397,"Well, all right, but has there been some court decisions on this retroactivity?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3636.397,3637.641,"Well, I am not sure whether there were any."
1977.77-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3647.169,3663.75,Have there been some submissions from Texas since it was included based on the fact that this particular practice that is now being administered was instituted in 1973 and is still being administered and --
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3663.75,3665.919,Not that I know of.
1977.77-529,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3665.919,3670.627,"So it has never even been construed by the Attorney General, until now?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3670.627,3685.806,"I think that if there had been such a submission, the Attorney General would have reviewed it under Section 5."
1977.77-529,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3745.934,3762.676,Do you think it makes any difference in this connection between a city such as Dallas which has had at-large voting since 1907 and the parish in Louisiana that had had at-large voting only since 1968?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3762.676,3770.073,"Well, I think that may very well make a difference with respect to whether at-large voting is useful in the city or whether it is constitutional."
1977.77-529,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3784.797,3787.741,"No, I think Chapman v. Meier of South Dakota --"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3787.741,3788.355,North Dakota.
1977.77-529,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3788.355,3796.559,"North Dakota, well, did not the court say that Mr. Justice Blackmun would correct me that there had been no tradition in --"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3796.559,3799.825,"In the senate, in the North Dakota senate."
1977.77-529,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3807.733,3808.54,But not in the Senate.
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3808.54,3810.007,That is right.
1977.77-529,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3810.007,3811.679,And the Court made a point of that?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3811.679,3815.016,That is right.
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3815.016,3816.789,We will resume at 1 o'clock.
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3816.789,3840.051,Thank you.
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3840.051,3843.495,You have some rebuttal.
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3850.479,3851.562,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-529,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3886.539,3889.118,I do not doubt it.
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3889.118,3892.581,There are more of the other areas covered under the Act combined.
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3892.581,3897.423,Do you still contend that this case is subject to Section 5 submission?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3897.423,3917.753,"Well, the relevance of this point to this case is that if an ordinance, if the City Council could have under state law reapportioned itself by ordinance and if such an ordinance had been passed and if the eight/three plan was now effective by virtue of a City Council ordinance, then that ordinance would have to be submitted --"
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3917.753,3921.974,"Well, Mr. Buscenmi, why did you not answer the Chief Justice 'Yes'?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3943.055,3954.233,"Absolutely, that is the answer to the Chief Justice?s question to the extent that there is a legislatively enacted plan involved here, it is only through the charter amendment that was passed in April 1976 and that is what we argued in the second part --"
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3954.233,3957.799,Was the city doing any more that rubber stamping what the court ordered?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3957.799,3968.526,"No the city was not, but in Connor v. Waller this Court held that an enacted plan that just reproduces the terms of court ordered plans is subject to pre-clearnace."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3968.526,3976.155,"In effect then, you are saying that the judges action is indirectly subject to review by the Attorney General?"
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3976.155,3988.642,"No, we are saying that if the state legislative body or the local legislative body decides to adopt what a court had ordered into effect then it is subject to pre-clearance and that is entirely different because there are different --"
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3988.642,3991.876,Did the city have any choice about it?
1977.77-529,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3991.876,3996.112,"Absolutely, the city had no obligation whatever to enact the eight/three plan."
1977.77-529,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4034.964,4037.587,"Mr. Werner, do you have anything further?"
1977.77-529,3,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4037.587,4041.713,"Very briefly, Your Honor."
1977.77-529,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4041.713,4048.991,Will you address this question of pre-clearance particularly in light of the referendum in April 1976 after Texas was brought under the Section?
1977.77-529,4,31096,james_a_johnston,,4048.991,4050.303,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4238.599,4241.084,"Or alternatively, the approval of the Attorney General in the --"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4241.084,4242.727,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4266.973,4272.812,"At the time the judge initially passed on the resolution, Texas was not subject to the Voting Rights Act?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4272.812,4275.431,No.
1977.77-529,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4275.431,4293.836,"He was then free to pass on the constitutionality of the substitute, whereas today if they had been subject to Section 5, he would not have been free to address the constitutionality of this, if he considered this to be a legislative submission because that would first then have to go through, under Section 5?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4293.836,4298.606,"Yes, sir, and I think there is a difference here between what the district court did."
1977.77-529,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4310.998,4321.006,"Did any of the parties to this action in their, as opposed to amicus curiae raised the Voting Rights Act issue?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4321.006,4323.47,"The respondents raised it in the Fifth Circuit, yes, sir."
1977.77-529,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4323.47,4325.087,And what did the Fifth Circuit say?
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4325.087,4326.785,They disregarded that.
1977.77-529,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4329.049,4332.637,They went off in another direction in his favor?
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4332.637,4333.691,Yes sir.
1977.77-529,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4333.691,4342.131,"Well, tell me Mr. Werner, I guess, I gather from what you say, at least no decision has yet been made by Dallas whether or not to submit --"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4342.131,4364.788,"Well, until very recently, until Sheffield was decided we did not think that we had to submit anything, frankly and we did submit some polling place changes and things like that over the last couple of years because we were afraid if we were to pick that up if Sheffield were decided against us, we were afraid the administrative burden would just be too much so we went ahead and submitted those, but we did not submit the charter amendment for two reasons."
1977.77-529,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4438.787,4443.297,Do you think the Section 5 issue is here at all?
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4445.188,4448.779,"It was not treated in either of the courts below, Mr. Justice White."
1977.77-529,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4448.779,4451.591,"And again, it could not have arisen in the district court?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4451.591,4453.691,"No, sir."
1977.77-529,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4453.691,4510.436,"It is quite possible, I suppose, you are telling us, that a plan approved by court can be permissible as a plan that has been initiated by a legislative body, even though the initiation by the legislative body does not amount to legislation as such, and that even therefore, if it is not a court devised plan and can permissibly be something other than what a purely court devised plan could be, nonetheless, it is a court approved plan, and therefore, might immunize it from the necessity of submission under Section 5, if later, and adopted by way of a charter amendment which is a must?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4510.436,4512.581,"No, sir, that is not exactly what I am saying."
1977.77-529,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4550.699,4558.328,"Or whenever we have an effect, however, he does not have to in a court ordered plan, he does need to live up to Section 5?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4558.328,4559.762,"Yes, sir, I understand that."
1977.77-529,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4559.762,4572.038,"And my brother Stewart is saying that this is, whatever the chronology here, this qualifies for that rule."
1977.77-529,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4577.958,4590.16,"Even though it might not be a court ordered plan for the purposes of our previous decisions with respect to multi member district, since the initiative came a legislative body?"
1977.77-529,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4590.16,4592.728,We did petition for you except Mr. Werner --
1977.77-529,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4592.728,4596.616,Inviting except a very comfortable position for you.
1977.77-529,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4596.616,4600.622,"Except, Mr. Werner, I take it, you cannot have it both ways."
1977.77-529,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4605.836,4608.262,My question suggested that you could have it both ways.
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4608.262,4615.309,That is why I am trying not to accept the invitation tendered by Justice Stewart.
1977.77-529,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4615.309,4622.758,"If we agree with you to reverse as the chapter 5, how does Section 5 come into that?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4628.939,4629.873,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-529,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4629.873,4632.021,How does chapter 5 affect that?
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4632.021,4642.368,"Well, then we are in the position of being under the literal language of Section 5, but possibly not within the Congressional intent because we did not do this as an evasion --"
1977.77-529,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4642.368,4654.737,"Well, I have to say, Mr. Werner, our cases have not given much weight to that Congressional intent as you limit it in Perkins and all the others."
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4657.924,4663.162,"Well, this is a situation which the court has not precisely addressed itself to."
1977.77-529,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4665.387,4669.892,"We came close to it in the District of Columbia case, did we not?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4669.892,4671.642,I cannot answer that case.
1977.77-529,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4671.642,4675.22,The case that was decided by the District of Columbia court?
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4675.22,4680.258,Yes sir.
1977.77-529,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4687.153,4690.445,And that surely is not going before us in this case.
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4693.378,4697.059,"As we just said, it was not raised below and it was --"
1977.77-529,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4697.059,4701.13,"We should not decide it if the Court of Appeals has not had an opportunity to pass on it, should we?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4701.13,4707.423,I think at best it should go back to the district court to be considered.
1977.77-529,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4707.423,4710.789,"Mr. Werner, when is your next municipal election?"
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4710.789,4716.298,The next council election will be in April 1979.
1977.77-529,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4724.088,4728.488,"But still some time, if you had to go through clearance."
1977.77-529,5,33644,joseph_g_werner,,4728.488,4731.976,"Yes, sir, we have ample time for that."
1977.77-529,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4733.309,4733.893,"Thank you, gentlemen."
