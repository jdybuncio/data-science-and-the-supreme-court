1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,0.97,-- Mr. Justice White.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,23.565,26.227,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,73.977,75.595,"Mr. Cavanaugh, can I interrupt you for a moment?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,75.595,76.432,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.432,80.767,You said the basis of jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,88.767,91.538,"Yes, Your Honor, ultimately state law will be applied."
1978.78-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,91.538,93.445,"In what state, Wisconsin?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,93.445,98.73,"Your Honor, there are three possible choices, Wisconsin, the District of Columbia, and the State of Michigan."
1978.78-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.763,121.562,But it would be a question of Wisconsin choice of law then?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,121.562,125.365,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,340.163,345.705,"On that broadcast, am I correct in remembering that Dr. Hutchinson's name was not mentioned?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,345.705,347.626,"No, Your Honor, his name was not mentioned."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,348.775,349.753,"Well, then yes."
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,350.876,351.951,That's correct.
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,370.116,375.678,Isn't there some question about whether or not there was more than one broadcast?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,377.792,383.477,There is -- we know of one other for certain is the Bob Barry Show which is referred to in the record.
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,464.174,467.392,Didn't the District Court make that same conclusion?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,467.392,481.781,"Your Honor, the District Court would've extended speech or debate, I believe to those items as well, but the -- it is correct that the District Court in addition found that petitioner Hutchinson was a public figure, and therefore, there was protection under the First Amendment."
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.781,485.447,So the Court of Appeals affirmed that part of the District Court judgment?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,485.447,488.728,The Court of Appeals narrowed the District Court's finding.
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,491.484,493.545,I'm talking about the First Amendment part of it.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,493.545,495.284,"Yes, that is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.284,499.338,"Well, when you talk about findings and so on, this case went off on summary judgment against your client."
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,499.338,501.009,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.009,509.111,So we're not talking about a finding of fact on a disputed issue where the Court of Appeals affirms on a clearly erroneous basis.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,509.111,510.423,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.424,529.434,"Could I ask you, as I read the District Court's opinion, the District Court also reached the state law question of whether these remarks were defamatory?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,529.434,530.412,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.412,532.476,And they ruled that they were not.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,532.476,533.429,That is correct.
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.429,539.365,"Now, this is a state law issue, I take it, isn't it?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,539.365,540.02,"Your Honor, --"
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.02,541.131,"Now isn't it, isn't it?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,541.131,541.418,"Yes, it is."
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.418,547.97,You just told that -- said to Mr. Justice Stewart that it was going to be local law that would govern this case.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,547.97,548.104,That is correct.
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,548.104,556.266,"And now if these remarks were not defamatory, what excuse is there for ever reaching the First Amendment issue at least?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,558.479,562.981,"Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit Court did not reach the state law issue."
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.585,569.579,"I know but what -- isn't it the usual rule, you reach non-constitutional issues first?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,569.579,571.555,"Yes, Your Honor, I would think that if --"
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.555,580.872,Well what if the Court of Appeals had affirmed the District Court on the ground these remarks were not defamatory.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,584.061,592.258,"Your Honor, to speak frankly, I think the Court's decision of Paul versus Davis would indicate that the torts involved do not invade constitutional rights."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.258,595.037,"Well now, Paul against Davis is a 1983 case."
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,600.154,604.3,"Yes, Your Honor it is."
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,632.535,641.362,"Mr. Cavanaugh, why should we reach the either the First Amendment issue where the Speech or Debate Clause if the District Court is right that this wasn't defamatory anyway?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,641.362,645.336,"Well Your Honor, we believe that the District Court was clearly erroneous and we would have hoped that --"
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.336,648.862,Maybe so but the Court of Appeals hasn't said so.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,648.862,648.91,That is --
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.91,653.424,And we rarely disagree with lower courts on what state law is.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,653.424,654.19,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.731,666.858,"Why would we rule on then, on the constitutional issue?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,666.858,668.829,"Your Honor, --"
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.829,673.115,Because we granted certiorari that may be is a good answer.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,673.115,675.027,Your Honor it's an answer I was embarrassed to give.
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.027,675.439,Yes.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,675.439,680.937,I think the other answer is that the District Court clearly was erroneous on the state law.
1978.78-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,680.937,695.553,I suppose you contend that the court -- you're entitled to have the Court of Appeals pass on the question of state law just the way you would in any other appeal from the District Court to the Court of Appeals even though the constitutional question shouldn't be reached.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,695.553,696.567,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,726.058,728.887,Before you get on to that.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,742.523,745.779,"Your Honor, that would be your position."
1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.552,772.169,"Well then you must mean that among other things that that's an issue which cannot be resolved, that's a factual issue which can not be resolved on affidavits but only by a trial of the issues, is that it?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,772.169,781.825,"Yes, Your Honor, that it would appear appropriate to reverse the lower decisions and permit the petitioner to have a trial on the issue."
1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.324,822.4,"Did you say there were 100,000 of these press releases sent out?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,822.4,823.473,"Yes, that's correct Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,827.376,828.589,In -- all in Wisconsin?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,828.589,833.865,"No, Your Honor, somewhere in Wisconsin and somewhere in other states."
1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,833.865,836.219,Does the record show what the spread was under Wisconsin?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,836.219,846.109,"No, Your Honor, the only statement I believe is in Senator Proxmire's deposition where he indicated that some of those press releases were sent to Wisconsin, and others were sent outside of the state."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,846.109,847.978,Were those press releases or newsletters?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,847.978,848.997,"I'm sorry, newsletters."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,848.997,849.602,Of course not.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,849.602,851.865,All of the press releases were sent to the media.
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,851.865,854.503,Right.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,854.503,865.34,This Court in the recent past has set out at least on three occasions that publications or republications outside of Congress are not protected by the Speech or Debate Clause.
1978.78-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.689,1012.656,"Mr. Cavanaugh, what would you say if they just mailed out -- that you just mailed out the congressional record?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1012.656,1017.74,"Your Honor, I think then we would have a question of how wide was the dissemination."
1978.78-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.325,1020.549,Same mailing list you got here.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1020.549,1023.471,"Your Honor, I would think it would not be protected."
1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.042,1040.111,But if the Congress for some reason or other sent the same copy of the congressional record out?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1040.111,1044.226,"Your Honor if it was an action taken by Congress, I believe that it would be immune."
1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1044.226,1045.865,Or a committee?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1045.865,1047.377,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1113.116,1138.369,"Now before you get into this public figure business or public official, those concepts have been deemed important in the decisions and opinions of this Court when the alleged false defamatory material has been published by some instrumentality of the public news media."
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1139.72,1140.208,That is correct.
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1140.208,1150.538,"-- is there any case here that holds that the so-called New York Times rules are applicable when the defamatory statement has been made by an individual person, human being?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1150.538,1154.957,"No, Your Honor, in fact that is an issue that we have specifically not conceded."
1978.78-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.302,1185.781,"Well there are required decisions in the state courts the other way, aren't there?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1185.781,1187.45,"Yes, Your Honor there are."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1187.45,1195.872,So it may be that whether or not your client is a public figure is totally irrelevant?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1195.872,1197.582,"It may well be that way, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1197.582,1200.182,You don't brief or argue this basic question?
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1200.182,1201.19,"No, we have not."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1207.844,1208.536,Yes.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1208.536,1215.501,It would appear from the ruling in New York Times that there was an assumption that the same rule would apply to both types of defendants.
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1236.127,1244.117,"And although you've assumed it, you reserve the privilege of arguing that it doesn't."
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1244.117,1244.537,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1244.537,1246.239,But you're not arguing it here.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1246.239,1251.397,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.156,1336.191,"But that's almost like going back to the plurality opinion in Metromedia versus Rosenbloom, isn't it?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1342.182,1343.577,"I think that's exactly right, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1349.91,1351.398,On the very fact of his defamation?
1978.78-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.398,1351.68,Right.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1351.68,1352.667,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-680,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1365.677,1367.489,Or the media always could.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1367.489,1370.711,"That's right, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.12,1499.099,"Mr. Cavanaugh, shouldn't -- if he's going to ask for, what do you get $900,000.00 or something like that according to the footnote in Judge Layton's opinion, shouldn't he be prepared to defend in a public forum the appropriateness of that kind of spending by the Government?"
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1499.099,1504.875,"Your Honor, the $900,000.00 as I mentioned earlier, and $900,000.00 is a high figure."
1978.78-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1521.538,1523.922,"But it may have been entirely proper, I don't suggest that."
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1538.14,1557.572,"I think while the researcher should be prepared to defend his funding, he should not be given a status of public figure so that he has to rise to the high level of meeting actual malice before he can maintain an action, because in addition to the researcher defending the action, the agencies themselves that fund it can defend the action."
1978.78-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1562.871,1571.359,But doesn't he know that this is the kind of thing that is typically a subject of public debate and newspaper articles where there might be careless comment on the way it goes --
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1571.359,1571.533,But Your Honor --
1978.78-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1571.533,1573.759,-- when you get into the appropriations area.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1573.759,1580.136,"But Your Honor if we accepted that standard we would be back to the Metro Media standard, which is that it is a matter of general interest to the public."
1978.78-680,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.937,1589.625,Well that is more of a public issue than the public person.
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1589.625,1594.644,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.932,1599.283,"Very well, Mr. Cavanaugh."
1978.78-680,0,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,1599.283,1603.294,Thank you.
1978.78-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1603.294,1605.473,Mr. Raywid.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1605.473,1608.299,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1719.144,1726.381,Now is this -- these observations directed at the Speech or Debate Clause or the First Amendment issue or what?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1726.381,1729.895,"Principally, the speech and debate issue."
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.173,1750.042,"Mr. Raywid, could you comment just briefly on why we should reach that issue here if the Court of Appeals could've disposed of the case on a state law ground?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1750.042,1750.833,Well --
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.833,1755.034,I take it the Court of Appeals didn't deal with the state law ground at all?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1755.034,1757.595,That is correct.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.202,1790.621,Do you think -- do you say for a speech or debate is involved it is the threshold issue because the senator shouldn't even be in court at all?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1790.621,1792.054,That is correct.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.714,1799.016,Shouldn't reach the local issue at all.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1799.016,1803.615,"Should not reach the local law, should not reach First Amendment."
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.566,1820.885,"So under your hypothesis, say the District Court here in Madison would've addressed first speech and debate then local law then First Amendment?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1820.885,1828.631,"That would be the appropriate order, but in order to reach local law, it might first have to determine First Amendment issues."
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.631,1829.601,Why?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1829.601,1835.709,"Well, if certainly if there is no libel then it need not address First Amendment."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1835.709,1851.978,Well suppose a complaint in its terms alleged only that the defamatory statements were made in a speech on the floor of the House or the Senate on a given day and then give the content of that speech.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1859.723,1863.068,"There would be nothing in that case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1864.875,1870.775,And the demurrer type of response to it by the Senator?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1870.775,1874.972,It would need no evidentiary showing whatsoever.
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1887.044,1909.125,"On your approach on that hypothetical, the senator or congressman might write a letter rather than filing a formal answer saying “On the face of the complaint against me, I am not required to answer in any place other than the Senate or the House itself.”"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1912.872,1923.646,"Perhaps it might, but I would think that the Senator would've observed legal procedure like any other litigant and raise that issue preliminarily."
1978.78-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1974.631,1982.256,"Mr. Raywid as I understood your brief, you'd make precisely the same argument if Senator Proxmire was not a member of any of these committees, is that right?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,1982.256,1991.117,"That is correct, that any member has this right but it certainly more particularized in his responsibilities."
1978.78-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1995.96,2004.09,"Presumably every senator has an interest in avoiding waste of government funds, so I don't understand what the committee membership has to do with the case."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2004.09,2006.61,The committee membership was one of the findings below.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2189.238,2194.191,But it's your position that he could defame.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2194.191,2202.742,"That is correct, if he is properly executing the legislative function which has been authorized by the Congress."
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2202.742,2207.121,He certainly could in a speech on the floor of the Senate.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2207.121,2208.425,Without question.
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2208.425,2216.549,What if he made a commencement speech at the University of Michigan where Dr. Hutchinson was employed and said all the same things?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2216.549,2221.587,"Well, in -- possibly yes, probably not."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.587,2223.457,Probably not protected?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2223.457,2227.381,Probably not protected.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.365,2275.13,"Well that's in general, that's in general I take it because congressmen and senators are authorized to frank their communications to their constituents."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2281.965,2282.683,That is correct.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.683,2285.469,Or by any committee for that matter.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2285.469,2286.768,That is not correct.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.768,2287.256,Why?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2287.256,2299.163,A procedure has been established in 1973 after this Court's opinions in its 1971 and 1972 session.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.04,2324.38,Right.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2324.38,2328.305,They may not mail political items.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.912,2347.484,What I'm asking was this particular publication approved as it was written by a committee?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2347.484,2351.019,It was approved for it was because mass mailed.
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.28,2394.173,Do you think that matter is entirely in the hands of Congress that Congress could've passed a statute saying that anything that a congressman or a senator wants to mail anywhere at anytime is protected regardless of how defamatory it is?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2394.173,2396.059,That would be too broad.
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2439.188,2447.364,"Do I understand you to suggest that Congress by a legislative enactment can broaden, expand the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2447.364,2453.592,The Speech or Debate Clause is broad but Congress helps to define that and Congress helps to --
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2453.592,2456.898,But defines it finally?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2456.898,2461.468,"Well, certainly this Court must pass on the scope of speech or debate."
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2479.516,2494.133,"Well but when you're talking about deference basically, this is a case that could've been in, for all practical purposes for the issues here been brought in the state court in Wisconsin."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2516.569,2523.769,"Well, this Court of course is the ultimate authority on defining legitimate legislative activity."
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.769,2533.251,"And it's up to us in this case to decide the question that my brother Rehnquist accurately, I think, says is posed by this case."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2533.251,2533.88,That is correct.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2533.88,2549.781,"Can the State of Wisconsin enforce its policy expressed in its tort law in this diversity case, in defamation slander cases in these circumstances despite the speech and debate clause."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2554.736,2556.318,That is correct.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.318,2572.274,But your submission is I take it that the Senator may in his newsletter to his constituents tell knowing or -- and deliberate falsehoods about other people and be immune.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2585.401,2589.701,"Certainly that's viewing it in its harshest light, but that one I would have to agree."
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.701,2593.003,"Yes, that's the basis on which we must review the case, isn't it?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2593.003,2595.745,That -- well not entirely since the Court --
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.745,2596.693,Well why isn't it?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2596.693,2603.401,Well since the Court has held that it was not defamatory material that --
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2603.401,2604.636,Who held that?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2604.636,2605.561,The District Court.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2605.561,2608.552,Well that's the end of the case then if we accept that.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2608.552,2608.854,That's the --
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.854,2611.146,-- never been reviewed by the Seventh Circuit.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2611.146,2611.992,"No, it is not."
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.992,2624.367,"So I think we must on the speech or debate issue, you certainly can object to our viewing the case on the basis that this is the grossest kind of defamation?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2624.367,2626.148,That I would have to agree.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.333,2630.781,Exactly.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2641.191,2646.288,We would make a distinction between what has been authorized by Congress.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2651.851,2654.877,Well what do you say about he radio and television broadcast?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2654.877,2660.309,We have advocated to what is specifically authorized a per se approach.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2688.292,2692.613,"And isn't your position, not that we determine by us."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2700.88,2701.853,Well I --
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2701.853,2703.969,Is that your position?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2703.969,2705.973,"In a sense, yes."
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2705.973,2714.874,Well do you think Congress can give to a person that is neither congressman nor anything else that authority?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2714.874,2718.775,"If there are disputes, that is supposed to be referred to the rules committee."
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2726.774,2728.271,And what are the rules?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2730.031,2730.753,The rules are contained --
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2730.753,2734.041,There are the rules says that if nobody can pleads it goes out.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2735.262,2737.368,No the Senate rules in --
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2737.368,2738.025,Says what?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2738.025,2740.6,-- in Rule 25 and Rule 48.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2740.6,2741.591,Says what?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2741.591,2743.516,"-- places authority, screening authority --"
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.516,2750.548,"And where is that, may I see the rule?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2750.548,2753.025,The screening of -- first of all the rules can be --
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2753.025,2754.867,Do have it anything that filed here?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2754.867,2755.288,Yes.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2757.168,2758.44,Then where.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2761.909,2766.954,Well we have a portion there on how Congress actually operates.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2771.235,2778.812,We do know don't we that any congressman is sending a piece of paper in the congressional record and nobody objects.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2780.74,2781.5,Well I --
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2781.5,2782.145,Don't we?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2782.145,2783.934,-- I know of no limitation on that.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.934,2784.91,Right.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2784.91,2788.26,He may put it in the congressional record and --
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.26,2790.36,Get congressional approval?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2790.36,2802.029,He needs no -- there is no censorship imposed on members.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2813.982,2815.55,But does anybody?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2815.55,2815.792,"Yes, yes there --"
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2815.792,2818.823,But first does anybody in the Senate pass upon what goes out?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2818.823,2822.678,"Yes, there is a self-policing policy."
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2824.873,2826.097,By whom?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2826.097,2827.661,By the Senate Service Department.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2827.661,2828.232,Right.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2828.232,2828.27,And the --
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2828.27,2830.169,Those are employees?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2830.169,2834.407,"That is correct, and they are employed by the rules committee."
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2873.175,2881.992,"So that guy should've gone to the committee, if his committee is someplace, someplace in the Senate to complain."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2881.992,2891.987,"Yes, he could have done that as could any citizen."
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2937.762,2946.287,But hasn't that generally applied to committee chairman or committee activities rather than individual members of Congress?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,2946.287,2954.157,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would not say that it has been -- most frequently it's exercised by committee chairman."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3012.599,3032.112,"Well, but you've already said that no one checks the content then how do you authorize the contents of a letter which the Congress has carefully, very carefully said they would not censor, was the term you used."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3032.112,3036.051,It would not -- it would not try to muscle a particular member.
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3055.026,3077.192,"You're only suggesting that Congress could by a legislative enactment authorize a libel, as I think Mr. Justice White put it to you in different terms, extend the statute of the speech or debate immunity to something which it does not cover within the reach of that clause."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3077.192,3083.671,It may frequently and has in the past concern libel.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3083.671,3092.079,Well Mr. Raywid what if Senator Gravel's newsletter had contained the so-called the secret information you referred to?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3092.079,3097.665,Then I expect the screening process might have stopped its distribution.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.665,3100.275,Well you said it doesn't censor.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3100.275,3105.575,I said it screens for conformance with its rules.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.575,3113.878,Well what if something in the newsletter would violate Wisconsin law or local law?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3113.878,3127.929,"So long as it serves the legitimate legislative need, and so long as Congress has made that determination, it seems to me that due deference should be paid to that determination and immunity would follow."
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.885,3146.287,"So you think Congress did intend to authorize senators to in their newsletter, give them immunity, absolute immunity for the grossest kind of defamation that you think that was their intention in this legislation?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3146.287,3149.587,It sought to protect their communication with their constituents and --
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3149.587,3152.291,"Well, yes or no, I would suppose my question can be answered with yes or no."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3152.291,3156.947,"In the extreme situation that you pose, yes."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3174.008,3181.418,"What about the letters, the newsletters that went outside of Wisconsin?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3188.233,3189.62,That is true.
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3210.47,3217.494,And that might include quite a few newspapers for example and radio and television broadcasters.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3217.494,3223.994,"Those -- that determination is made entirely separately, and those are the press releases."
1978.78-680,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3365.05,3378.324,"Mr. Raywid, if gross defamation is not redressable because in speech and debate in a judicial proceeding, what can the Senate do about it?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3378.324,3379.806,"I miss the first part, if you said gross?"
1978.78-680,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3379.806,3390.812,"If gross defamation is not to be the cause of speech and debate redressable in a judicial proceeding, is there anything the Senate can do?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3390.812,3393.747,The Senate can discipline its member.
1978.78-680,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3394.604,3397.217,That's all?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3397.217,3397.843,-- that's all.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3400.896,3404.393,"Then it can't even vindicate the person's reputation, can it?"
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3404.393,3404.682,No.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3404.682,3405.48,Well I would say --
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3405.48,3407.991,There wouldn't be a trial or a hearing or anything?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3407.991,3408.483,Oh yes.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3415.468,3419.369,"For participation by the victim of a libel, for example?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3419.369,3426.101,"It does not specifically call for that, no it does not."
1978.78-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3430.153,3432.413,And Mr. Raywid --
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3432.413,3438.09,How many members have been subject to that procedure?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3438.09,3439.122,I do not know.
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3444.153,3444.369,Are you speaking of --
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3444.369,3454.863,"-- the disciplinary practice was quite common, and it certainly is increasingly so not as to the particular issue raised by Mr. Justice White."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3454.965,3459.756,"Wasn't the last one -- was the last one about 20 years ago, the most recent?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3459.756,3463.515,I do not know that how frequently it is been.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3467.286,3476.563,"Mr. Raywid, the trouble -- what law of libel would you apply in the Senate?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3476.563,3478.409,The -- none.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3478.409,3480.889,Definitely weird.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3487.769,3491.464,We have argued that it was somewhat akin to judicial immunity.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3491.464,3493.604,"Right, right."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3493.604,3494.217,The senators --
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3494.217,3499.051,"Right, so you don't get to be really whether or not it is libel."
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3499.051,3499.742,Right.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3499.742,3504.455,I thought when you get to whether or not that's a libel you're going to be in trouble.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3504.455,3507.409,Well I disagree with you and the District Court supports me.
1978.78-680,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3507.409,3511.897,But you don't mind if we go the other way and say you don't touch it all.
1978.78-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3514.569,3527.542,"It is correct, is it Mr. Raywid that in the disciplinary proceedings for example of Senator McCarthy that the victims of his comments did have an opportunity in some cases to testify and a certain extent vindicate their reputation?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3527.542,3533.111,"Well, I think they had an opportunity and I think they were called by committee council, and a careful bill of particulars was prepared."
1978.78-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3533.111,3535.986,Whether it was an adequate opportunity is another issue of course.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3535.986,3536.622,Excuse me?
1978.78-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.622,3539.388,Whether it was an adequate opportunity is another issue of course.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3539.388,3545.594,"Well it certainly was not an open trial, but it was due process and it was --"
1978.78-680,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3545.594,3548.339,"But in any event, that's the remedy that you say is available on this sort of situation?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3548.339,3549.758,Yes.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3549.758,3552.121,And but they were invited.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3555.03,3558.445,Well I'm quite certain they sought appearance.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3558.445,3559.695,Yes but --
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3559.695,3560.103,But --
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3560.103,3561.809,-- they were there at the sufferance of the committee.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3561.809,3563.865,At the sufferance of the committee.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3563.865,3580.973,"Mr. Raywid, you haven't there, if you have I missed it, mentioned the language the in the court opinion on the Brewster case that explicitly and unambiguously held said, said that newsletters and press releases are simply not covered by the Speech and Debate Clause."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3583.186,3585.512,"Certainly, I have mentioned it extensively in the brief."
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3585.512,3585.845,Yes but at this point.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3585.845,3589.646,"Certainly, I mentioned it to the courts below."
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3589.775,3593.987,"Because it wouldn't be up to you, I suppose, to emphasize it and that's --"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3593.987,3606.105,"Well what we try to point out in the courts below, and successfully so, that that issue was not posed to the Brewster court, that that was not contained in the Brewster case."
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3624.742,3627.265,That is criminal conduct.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3627.265,3627.435,Any --
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3627.435,3630.229,"When you said unlawful conduct, you meant criminal conduct did you?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3630.229,3631.965,"Well, principally criminal conduct but it might."
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3631.965,3638.483,Because the allegation is that the Senator's conduct was unlawful as a matter of civil law.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3638.483,3643.548,Well I'm talking about a proscription imposed by Congress itself.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3643.548,3644.638,Federal law.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3644.638,3645.693,Yes.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3689.189,3696.903,The statements in the Court's opinion in the Brewster case are clear and unambiguous aren't they?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3700.529,3700.715,They are.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3700.715,3704.724,"That the Court would certainly have to modify or remand those views, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3704.724,3705.288,Well the --
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3705.288,3706.145,If you're correct.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3706.145,3706.484,The --
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3706.484,3709.384,Just to -- to accept your submission.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3709.384,3713.834,Well we believe that a majority of the Court has.
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3739.26,3744.119,"In Doe, the committee it authorized the publication, had it not?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3744.119,3744.596,Yes it had.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3746.231,3750.617,"This informal function of, excuse me, excuse me I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3751.303,3764.152,"Well I merely wanted to say that yes, and to that extent we would say that in our per se application that those should be extended."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3809.391,3822.063,"Are you suggesting that in order to explain unwise public expenditures, it's necessary to libel someone in order to get attention?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3824.577,3837.716,"No, but as Mr. Justice White said, or I believe I'm properly paraphrasing him that we may make the assumption that it was libelous."
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3872.244,3882.774,"Well, you say of the judiciary, I mean basically it's a question of Wisconsin tort law unless the Constitution prohibits it."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3890.398,3896.778,"Well that issue may never come to this Court, it's true."
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3915.455,3920.076,Even for openly illegal activities?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3920.076,3925.357,Not for unlawful activity or activity proscribed by Congress.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3926.879,3937.915,"But it's a criminal libel law in the state, and this publication -- anybody would, in his right mind would take this criminal libel, you say he's immune?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3937.915,3944.887,"Yes, it would say he's immune, it sound very much like sedition laws."
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3944.887,3946.208,Mr. Raywid -- excuse me.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3946.208,3947.725,"For libel, the more libel sounds like sedition?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3947.725,3960.899,"A criminal to prosecute a congressman in issuing a letter in the manner proscribed by Congress and make that subject to a criminal libel law, yes."
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3964.094,3968.213,Well sedition it thought was criticism of the Government?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3968.213,3979.958,"Yes, and this -- and I've stated in every one of these instances or the conduct under review here is conduct of criticism of the Government."
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3979.958,3990.537,Well supposing a senator goes back to his home state and says “The guy who lives next to me in Madison is a real SOB.”
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,3990.537,4000.169,"We should bring an action against that congressman, and he should be prosecuted in those local courts without question."
1978.78-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4000.169,4002.98,So your doctrine would not extend that far?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,4002.98,4004.266,It certainly would not.
1978.78-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4004.266,4005.991,That isn't sedition.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,4005.991,4013.116,"No, that's not sedition, the same if he ran over someone."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4013.116,4013.665,"Very well, I think you --"
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4013.665,4015.93,You rely -- I'd like to ask the question I've perhaps been too deferential.
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4015.93,4019.306,Go ahead.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4019.306,4038.821,"You rely a great deal on your brief on what you call the informing function of Congress to justify bringing the newsletters and press release within the Speech and Debate Clause, that function which was emphasized by Woodrow Wilson has been by many, many others."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,4057.365,4068.575,"I don't believe, or certainly not my reading Mr. Justice Stewart of all of those treatises as narrowed it to Congress."
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4069.096,4075.264,You mean the justification for congressional investigations by its various committees and subcommittees.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,4089.511,4102.72,I think Mr. Justice Blackmun has best articulated our position on the informing function in his dissent in Doe.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4121.421,4125.506,"And with all respect to my brother Blackmun, that was a dissenting opinion, correct?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,4125.506,4147.261,"It was a dissenting opinion, but as I've tried to point out it seems to me that a number of dissenters in the varying opinions of the Court had been very much conscious of the informing function then they would make up or which I invite a new majority in recognizing the informing function as --"
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4147.261,4152.602,"That is the informing of the public, not the informing of the members of Congress."
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,4152.602,4154.191,Most definitely.
1978.78-680,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4154.191,4157.604,"It's both at least if you would concede that, wouldn't you?"
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,4157.604,4159.622,Oh certainly.
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4167.515,4175.183,I read Woodrow Wilson's essays as putting the emphasis on informing and educating the public.
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,4190.763,4200.471,"In the tier, in the hierarchy and structure of the Senate, the member's rights have been protected and encouraged."
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4200.471,4201.563,By?
1978.78-680,1,16879,alan_raywid,,4201.563,4203.123,By the Senate rules.
1978.78-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4240.84,4244.512,We have detained you long enough now counsel.
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4260.256,4266.694,"Your Honors, Mr. Raywid just comment that this case does not involve a case of exposure for the sake of exposure."
1978.78-680,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4335.121,4339.939,"Well you can tell him who to vote for, I guess?"
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4339.939,4340.582,"They don't allow in Michigan citizens to vote in other states, do they?"
1978.78-680,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4340.582,4344.763,In Michigan they --
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4344.763,4350.102,"That's right, nor do they do those unfortunate people in Japan who receive these newsletters or the press releases."
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4350.102,4365.396,Well isn't the real damage that you're talking about is in the academic community and his professional reputation as a scientist who either within the country or out of the country if he has a wide enough reputation?
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4365.396,4371.15,"That certainly is a major element, but there also is damage just to the people who know Dr. Hutchinson as a person."
1978.78-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4403.595,4410.156,"Mr. Cavanaugh, in your principle argument I asked you about the public figure issue and you helped me out there."
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4419.614,4421.886,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe he is."
1978.78-680,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4465.793,4469.572,Could you measure -- did you measure it by the number of persons under his supervision?
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4471.37,4476.094,"Your Honor, I don't think that there is any one test."
1978.78-680,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4508.248,4511.059,"He was an officer of the state, wasn't he?"
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4511.059,4512.847,"An officer of the state, sir?"
1978.78-680,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4512.847,4514.941,Usually they are.
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4514.941,4515.337,He was --
1978.78-680,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4515.337,4517.896,They are usually the officers of the state.
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4517.896,4527.157,"He was an employee of the state, Your Honor --"
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4527.157,4544.296,"How is the senator or a congressman, however, who is focusing on some particular problem, how do you say he should inform his constituents or the broad constituency which is the country?"
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4544.296,4547.398,Your Honor he can inform without defaming.
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4563.913,4589.435,"Well, if he issued a press release, even a great many of them, simply stating all these facts that “X” hundred thousands of dollars were being done and reciting factually and accurately the nature of the research, how many members of the media would pay any attention to it?"
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4589.435,4590.111,"Yur Honor, --"
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4590.111,4592.339,"It's a pretty dull stuff, would it?"
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4592.339,4599.04,It's difficult to say how many members of the media to pay attention to one of these Golden Fleece is two weeks after it is issued.
1978.78-680,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4616.152,4632.662,What do you say about the protection of the senator from having to go before a court on the Island of Maui in the Hawaiian Islands and defend the statement that he made?
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4632.662,4636.977,"Your Honor, if he makes a statement, it is his obligation to defend it."
1978.78-680,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4636.977,4638.675,To go to Maui and defend it?
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4638.675,4643.78,"Your Honor, I would disagree of Mr. Raywid's statement that he does not even have to file an answer."
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4663.751,4670.275,"But the clause, if it's within the clause, the clause says he may not be questioned."
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4679.048,4680.657,If it's within the privilege.
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4680.657,4681.54,I see.
1978.78-680,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4681.54,4691.51,"And Congress could forbid any federal court from taking jurisdiction over a claim such as this against a member of Congress, could it not?"
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4691.51,4703.812,"Your Honor I don't believe Congress could, because if you said that Congress could do that then you're saying that Congress has the power to rewrite the Constitution and that Congress has the power to say how broad the protection is afforded by the Speech or Debate Clause."
1978.78-680,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4703.812,4704.193,Oh!
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4712.889,4717.481,"Then, Your Honor, I presume our cause of action would be in a higher court, perhaps in front of this Court as you --"
1978.78-680,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4717.481,4727.316,Simply under Article III that Congress has the power to create any inferior federal courts that it wants to and to allocate to them any jurisdiction that it wants to.
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4729.045,4730.199,Yes.
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4740.33,4746.091,"They surely would have no jurisdiction under Article III, any power under Article III to define state court jurisdiction."
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4746.091,4748.079,"That's right, Your Honor that is absolutely correct."
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4748.079,4754.701,"And when a federal court sits on a state case diversity, it's a surrogate for a state court, is it not?"
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4754.701,4755.224,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4755.224,4758.503,And Congress could repeal diversity jurisdiction tomorrow.
1978.78-680,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4758.503,4759.378,Correct.
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4759.378,4761.601,They have -- Congress has been urged to do it.
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4761.601,4766.436,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-680,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4776.971,4786.935,Is the newspaper publishing a quote from the congressional record liable to a -- to the victim?
1978.78-680,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4786.935,4787.714,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4802.117,4803.085,"It would be, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4803.085,4813.715,"Now, the Senator though if he mails it out in his newsletter, the very same thing, a copy of the congressional record, you say he is not immune?"
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4813.715,4814.546,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.78-680,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4846.731,4852.23,Well the submission is though that newsletters are an ordinary way of legislating.
1978.78-680,2,35573,michael_e_cavanaugh,,4852.23,4863.006,"Your Honor, we would respectfully disagree with that, that a newsletter to a hundred thousand people in Wisconsin and outside of Wisconsin is not within the legitimate legislative needs of Congress."
1978.78-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4866.406,4867.195,Thank you gentlemen.
