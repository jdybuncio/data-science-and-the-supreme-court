1976.74-6632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.96,We will here arguments next in 6632 Moody against Dagget.
1976.74-6632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,39.267,40.207,Thank you Your Honor.
1976.74-6632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,94.858,104.129,"Do you suggest that there is some expectation, a basis for an expectation or it would be -- allowed to be concurrent."
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,104.129,110.204,"Your Honor, under this scheme, let us step back a minute and say that he is in fact still on parole."
1976.74-6632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,114.226,122.888,"Well, we can hypothesize that, but the fact is, he is in another prison through the commission of another crime while he was on probation while he was on parole."
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,122.888,155.06,"Yes Your Honor, the scheme of the rules under which this case takes place of the parole board and visions that there is indeed a good likelihood or a possibility of concurrency and in fact in Jones against Johnson decided by the DC Circuit in -- notes a survey taken by the Federal Parole Board, which would indicate that one in three of such parolees do in fact serve their sentence concurrently or have to detain and revoked all together."
1976.74-6632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,155.06,161.164,"How does that work out in fact Mrs. Bamberger, would you explain that to us, how the concurrency comes about?"
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,161.164,169.392,"Yes Your Honor, under the rules as they applied in this case and those rules are no longer in effect because of the new statute and the new rules."
1976.74-6632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,213.924,221.727,When you say full concurrency that means that the time that he would be serving under his first sentence begins to run again.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,221.727,227.057,"It would have, yes; it would have lost no time back to the date of his release in fact."
1976.74-6632,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,327.865,333.745,I thought he could -- at that later step beheld to have served a concurrent way.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,333.745,337.863,Your Honor that get to the question of Retroactive Concurrency in other words at the time?.
1976.74-6632,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,337.863,338.897,How is that possible?
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,338.897,342.742,"No, I do not believe that it is possible under the Boards rule."
1976.74-6632,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,371.572,374.065,The court couldn't release him?.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,374.065,374.672,The board?.
1976.74-6632,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,374.672,376.103,It could not release him.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,376.103,381.455,They could reparole him or well at that point they could several things.
1976.74-6632,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,390.229,393.083,I am talking about after her served his first sentence.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,393.083,396.94,They could removed the detainer and the one and the detainer altogether.
1976.74-6632,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,407.105,408.602,I thought you said that is what they could not do?
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,408.602,412.418,They cannot give him partial retroactive concurrency.
1976.74-6632,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,445.64,447.468,But it can lift the retainer.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,447.468,448.921,It can lift it altogether.
1976.74-6632,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,459.892,461.465,Let me see if I follow your deal.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,465.233,469.083,"Not if it revokes, no."
1976.74-6632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,513.195,522.323,But Mrs. Bamberger may it not do this substantially the equivalent thing by deciding to the parole on somewhat earlier than they otherwise would have paroled him.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,522.323,532.431,"Well, by then he lose -- the revocation causes him to lose -- the answer to that is not the same thing because he is still in parole custody as oppose to having complete freedom."
1976.74-6632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.431,537.953,Correct and he could be released incarceration in earlier date than he otherwise would.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,537.953,539.724,"Yes, but there cannot be any doubt about."
1976.74-6632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.012,554.592,"Could the problem, this problem you describe be cured by an amendment to the Board Regulations to give them little broader discretion at that point."
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,554.592,556.225,You mean to give him partial?
1976.74-6632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,556.225,558.152,Give them power to allow partial?
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,558.152,562.166,"Partial retroactive, it could but they there is still another problem."
1976.74-6632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.166,565.577,Well then before you get on the other one let me clear up another thing that troubled me.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,579.503,580.015,That is right.
1976.74-6632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.015,591.963,But we should decide the case for you it is not possible the board would adopt new regulation which would change that and make it the normal practice to make the sentence be consecutive rather than concurrent.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,591.963,601.436,"Oh yes, if -- and assuming -- and in fact there are several states that do that it is interesting that two of the amicus (ph) in this case require that sentence run consecutively."
1976.74-6632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.338,631.436,So that your liberty claim really is contingent if I understand you correctly and the present form of the board regulations the board could revise their regulations in a way that would defeat the liberty interest which you assert.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,631.436,638.221,"It could not defeat liberty interest but it could make the denial of that liberty interest not in a essence of denial it could make it harmless, yes that's right."
1976.74-6632,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.296,693.285,"Mrs. Bamberger on that point would you help me because it is a kind of settled point but is there a difference in terms of the conditions of confinement between having a detainer lodged against a man or any alternative having no detainer, but having the fact noted of recorded that he was convicted of a state crime."
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,693.285,716.167,"Oh yes, there is a difference and in fact two states which again signs the amicus brief, direct they lodge the detainer so that the confining prison will have notice that there is another preceding pending and then they lift the detainer with a notice to the confining institution that the detainer is not to have any effect on the conditions of confinement."
1976.74-6632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.718,832.824,Is it possible Mrs. Bamberger that the conduct of the prisoner in prison under the second sentence for whatever period he is there would have some bearing on the parole board's exercise or discretion as to whether or not they ought to then and require him to serve all of the balance of his first sentence?
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,832.824,836.703,Yes and that are what the government's argument but the answer to that I think..
1976.74-6632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,836.703,840.981,Why should they -- that would be compelling to make the decision before they know what his conduct is.
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,840.981,848.443,I think the answer is as follows because the decision making process as far as the board is concerned includes much more than just the institutional conduct.
1976.74-6632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,869.793,884.856,"Are not you overlooking the fact that they have already determined that he has committed a criminal act and there is full due process, a judgment of a court that he has violated his conditions of his parole."
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,884.856,890.781,Your Honor that gets right to the question of the nature of this right that the Federal?
1976.74-6632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,890.781,891.726,Of which right?
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,891.726,893.77,Of the parolee's right.
1976.74-6632,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,937.109,970.421,"Perhaps the Board's position might be that we don't want to make the decision on whether we revoke the parole until we see how he conducts himself in this second round under his second conviction, that is if during that second period his conduct is such that he has denied all his good time credits if he engages in prison riots and violence, I suppose you agree that the parole board would not be very sympathetic with having his sentences run concurrently."
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,970.421,979.245,"Well let me answer that by saying that the board can consider an early hearing, all of the non-institutional factors related to medication."
1976.74-6632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1444.211,1450.476,"Well, why is this still a live case, Mrs. Bamberger, if new rules have been substituted for the ones that you are litigating?"
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1450.476,1463.366,"It is still a live case because the petitioner here is not eligible for hearing under the new rules because there is a provision in the statute, which says that any valid order of the parole board shall not be reopened or reconsidered under the new statute."
1976.74-6632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.344,1504.524,"If the court rules against him then he would not have the advantage of the new rule, if the court rules against your constitutional convention content, he could not go back and say well now, I want a hearing under the new rules."
1976.74-6632,0,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,1504.524,1525.547,"That's right, the only thing that could happen is that the board could periodically, review the institutional reports and perhaps revise its decision based on those reports, but it wouldn?t reconsider the mitigating factors with respect to his life on parole, with respect to the crime and other factors which he may choose to introduce."
1976.74-6632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.535,1540.049,"Very well, Mr. Easterbrook."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1540.049,1543.295,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.559,1817.205,"Mr. Easterbrook can I just ask you right at that point, is it your view that Morrissey does not apply to any case in which the parolee admits the fact, justifying revocation."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1817.205,1839.38,"Yes, Your Honor that is our view, it is our view in some that once the facts justifying the revocation have been established, those facts, forfeit the claim of entitlement to remain free and once that claim of entitlement can no longer be setup against the parole authorities, there is no remaining liberty or property interest."
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1852.862,1863.653,"Mr. Esterbrook I do not have the Morrissey opinion in front of me, but I have a recollection of there being discussion of the double need for fair procedure, one, to establish the fact of violation and another on the dispositional phase."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1863.653,1885.99,"That is right Your Honor, there are two discussions of that sort in Morrissey, one discussion appearing at page 490 of the Morrissey opinion, says, ""If it is determined that petitioners admitted violations to the parole board and if those violations are found to be reasonable grounds for revoking parole under state standards, that would end the matter."""
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.2,1963.295,How is that question different from the question you have in any criminal case where you have first the determination of guilt where clearly there must be due process applied and then a subsequent discretionary hearing before the judges to what sentence you will be imposed.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1968.519,1977.862,"There is one way in which it is different and one way in which it is the same Your Honor, the way in which it is different is that that is part of the criminal process and it is directly controlled by the Sixth Amendment."
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1990.459,1998.629,"But, are you saying, putting the Sixth Amendment to one side for a moment -- are you saying that the due process clause has no application to a sentencing hearing and a criminal proceeding."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,1998.629,2002.093,We are saying that the due process clause has no application Your Honor.
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.093,2004.76,Do the same proceeding (Voice Overlap) criminal trial.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2004.76,2017.789,"That is right Your honor, the court held inspect against Paterson, a case that cited and discussed in our brief, that there is no need of a sentencing hearing conducted by state authorities to allow the accused to be heard or to present evidence."
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.887,2038.127,"What is the underlying theory that there is no, he has no -- this is not going to have any depravation of his liberty as a result of his sentencing hearing, how do you analytically pick that in?"
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2038.127,2045.602,The analytical theory I think is that the legitimate claim of entitlement to remain free the liberty interest.
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.602,2048.92,I am talking about the criminal proceeding that is gone once he is found guilt?
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2048.92,2050.556,He is gone once he is found guilty.
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.556,2057.4,He has an insufficient interest in whether the sentence is for ten days or for life to justify due process.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2057.4,2068.726,"His interest in the range of sentences is protected by the statute establishing the range of permissible sentences and of course in the federal system, I would like to point out that there is no arbitrary procedure in the federal system."
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2073.143,2076.299,What about it could get probation?
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2076.299,2078.268,"In a federal system, yes he could your honor."
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.268,2082.08,"So, I mean either he has his liberty or not?"
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2082.08,2089.425,The federal system allows a broad range of alternatives from suspended sentence to a sentence the maximum under the statute.
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.867,2119.282,You mean that a judge could be arbitrary in sentencing?
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2126.606,2134.783,"Your Honor, that raises a question of a different sort, that is the question of the reliance on an impermissible reason."
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2134.783,2137.335,But you said that need (Inaudible).
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2137.335,2146.607,"In our view if there is no reason, then the judge have whole discretion and the Parole Commission has whole discussion, let me setup contrast between two cases.."
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2146.607,2164.21,"This shows that, that the record shows you never gave any reason, but the record show that he had sentenced 40 people, 20 redheads and 20 non redheads each redhead had gotten 20 years and each non redhaed had been paroled."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2165.682,2182.685,"Yes, Your Honor we would and we would find some thing wrong in the reliance on an impermissible and irrelevant reason, but the question whether it permissible to rely on irrelevant or impermissible reason is different from the question whether there must be an oral hearing to determine whether such consideration have added the process."
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.618,2229.804,"Mr. Easterbrook, but there is a big differences between that and the question Mr. Justice Marshall asked in Elrod against Burns they allegedly were discharged for constitutionally impermissible reason, namely they exercised the Free Speech Right, he said there is no constitution right to be a redhead."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2229.804,2233.919,"It might be suggested Your Honor, that you have very little choice in being a redhead at birth."
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2233.919,2240.382,"No, but the constitution is neutral on the point, it is completely independent of any constitutional claim."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2240.382,2261.77,"I think the point is the same Your Honor, though that a claim that a decision has been made for impressible reason is very different form a claim that a decision has been made without notice and an opportunity for an oral hearing and that it is not necessary to have a hearing in every case in order to minimize or avoid the possibility of reliance on an improper reason."
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.77,2278.018,"How long in the British Common Law and this law in the United State has it been since a Judge asked do you have any think to say before I pay a sentence on you, how long has that been going on."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2278.018,2282.411,"Your Honor, in some states the right of allocution is not now allowed."
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2282.411,2287.013,How long has that been growing on in the British Common Law?
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2287.013,2290.967,In the Federal System it has been going on as long as I know.
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2290.967,2291.809,Well that is good enough.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2291.809,2294.159,And it is provided by the rules of criminal procedure.
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2294.159,2297.91,Alright just waste of time.
1976.74-6632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2297.91,2303.709,"Mr. Easterbrook are not you really arguing the (Inaudible) law that you have to argue it, to sustain the government's position."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2303.709,2304.419,I am.
1976.74-6632,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2304.419,2307.963,Mr. Easterbrook you have ten minutes that I would suggest.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2307.963,2329.679,"I am about to turn to over little bit less ambitious argument, second point is that if a hearing is required, it is not required now, more as he indicated as I discussed in response to Mr. Justice Stevens's questions, but the hearing would be helpful to determine whether the authority should exercise discretion to revoke parole."
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.188,2357.429,"I hate to interrupt as you get to the heart of your argument but your directed my attention to Page 488, and you just used the term that the opinion suggested that the hearing would be useful, but as I read the sentence the parolee must have an opportunity to be heard and to show if can that he did not violate the condition or if he did that the circumstances and mitigation suggest that the violation does not revocation."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2359.883,2368.524,To the extend them must clause applies the both consideration it is inconsistent with the language on page 490 of the same opinion indicating that if it were established there would have been a violation?
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2368.524,2372.87,do you think the language on Page 480 is constituently inaccurate?
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2372.87,2378.731,"It is inaccurate in light of language on Page 490, Your Honor."
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.731,2380.259,But I just want to be sure I understood your position.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2380.259,2385.877,"Yes, that is our position, petitioner is not now subjected to imprisonment as a parole violator."
1976.74-6632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.112,2686.052,"Mr. Easterbrook you refer to the new parole act, I understood it was your opponent's contention that the new parole act didn't have any application to this case because her client was not able to take advantage of it, if the old procedures were constitutional."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2686.052,2691.267,The new act both applies and does not apply to this case.
1976.74-6632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.399,2730.445,So when you have refer to a provision of the new parole act in your argument you are referring to a provision that would have some applicability in your view to the petitioner.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2730.445,2732.747,Yes it would Your Honor.
1976.74-6632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2776.144,2779.558,Well it could allow both either partial or total concerns could it not?
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2779.558,2780.483,Yes it could.
1976.74-6632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2780.483,2788.223,It could allow total concerns by simply a decision that they would not revoke parole at all.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2788.223,2788.649,That's correct your honor.
1976.74-6632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2788.649,2792.365,That might be even eliminate the seconds hearing.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2792.365,2799.659,They would probably have a second hearing to determine which of the courses they would follow and that would be a full oral adversarial hearing.
1976.74-6632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2799.659,2816.126,"But under Morrissey which will no longer be applicable as it will be superseded at least by the new act, When this occurs, under the Morrissey the first preliminary hearing might result in a determination not to have a second hearing at all, would it not."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2816.126,2818.321,"It might, if it were to determine, that there was no probable cause."
1976.74-6632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2818.321,2830.923,"Hypothetically, they might have got to the wrong man the person with the same name or that the violation of parole was so minimal that if wasn't significant."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2830.923,2831.958,That's right your honor.
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.202,3059.16,"Mr. Easterbrook may I just raise a question, you may answered it but I want to be sure I understand your answer."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3073.725,3075.118,"Your Honor, that is not true."
1976.74-6632,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3092.099,3100.903,"I understand Justice Steven question would be quite that whether or not there was a need for, but whether or not in fact that is what happens."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3100.903,3104.51,"Your Honor, it is not in fact what happens."
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.566,3161.989,"I answered the question I want to be sure I have, assuming that they do have a prompt hearing and make prompt decision to revoke then your opponent says that the rules provide that in that eventuality the sentence will be concurrent."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3163.65,3165.453,"My opponent is not correct, Your Honor."
1976.74-6632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3173.136,3175.087,"So, revocation will begin or this --"
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3175.087,3182.096,That the time served as a parole violator would begin after the intervening sentence.
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3212.324,3215.778,What would happen if the man had been pardoned.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3215.778,3217.179,Excuse me Your Honor. If this man --
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3217.179,3225.311,"What would happen if the man had been pardoned and that nobody notified the board, that would have been a mistake then."
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3225.311,3226.325,Yes your honor it might have?..
1976.74-6632,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3226.325,3229.64,So you cannot be sure that no way they are mistaken.
1976.74-6632,1,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,3229.64,3235.91,"Your honor, there is no way that the possibility of error can be excluded on supposition of that sort."
1976.74-6632,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3250.661,3251.777,Thank you Mr. Easterbrook.
1976.74-6632,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3253.807,3254.568,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.74-6632,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3254.568,3256.071,You have five minutes.
1976.74-6632,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3256.071,3261.518,"The government refers to its new regulation to say, that they can give partial retroactive concurrency."
1976.74-6632,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3362.673,3370.714,"I hope that Due Process hearing occur when, as and if the parole is revoked."
1976.74-6632,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3370.714,3391.483,"Not at the end Your Honor, hearing will occur at the end, but he will be harmed because of the affect of the detainer, because of the modification of the parole conditions, which results from the detainer, while he is in the institution and from the loss of concurrency."
1976.74-6632,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3393.474,3399.449,"Perhaps it will cleared, perhaps the action will result in its being concurrent, how can you predict that?"
1976.74-6632,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3399.449,3412.899,"Well, the government's position is that the total withdrawal of the detainer and the warrant at the end of the intervening sentence, where the new crime is serious is not likely to occur."
1976.74-6632,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3499.757,3503.065,Has he not admitted it here?
1976.74-6632,2,37717,phylis_skloot_bamberger,,3503.065,3518.406,"Oh, yes, we are not disputing that he has admitted it, but we are saying that even where he admits it, the dispositional phase is still critical and the government attempts to distinguish Morrissey and Gagnon, saying that they do not apply where the parolee has admitted the violation."
1976.74-6632,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3568.653,3574.007,"Thank you, the case is submitted."
