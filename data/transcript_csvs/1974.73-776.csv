1974.73-776,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.669,We will hear arguments next 73-776 in Schlesinger against Ballard.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,29.155,33.011,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,187.01,193.864,"I take it as we judge this case, assuming the validity of that statutory restriction?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,193.864,202.345,"Yes, I believe that is not basically in this case."
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,256.541,262.185,"Mrs. Shapiro, are there some male officers ineligible for sea duty?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,262.185,262.436,No.
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.436,263.555,Ineligible to do the duty --
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,263.555,271.526,"There are limited service officers, limited duty officers who are not eligible for command at sea."
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,271.526,275.567,So they're disadvantaged by the existing system then?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,275.567,281.731,"Not necessarily, they can serve on board ships but they can't command ships."
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.969,299.222,Would you have felt any differently if the court below had declared 6401 unconstitutional instead of the general statute?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,299.222,299.367,As a --
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,299.367,302.194,That should be here today?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,302.194,329.951,"As a practical matter I'm not sure that the Navy would have felt nearly as upset about it for one thing, the Navy has proposed to Congress that the special 6401 statute is no longer necessary in light of current conditions."
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.951,333.794,Is that the younger of the two statutes the most recent or is it?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,333.794,341.118,"Yes, not by very much but slightly."
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,373.922,377.172,Why isn't the up and out rule good for the women?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,377.172,395.099,"Well the up or out rule does apply to certain women and it applies, the up or out right rule does apply to women the only difference is that out doesn't occur after two pass over it occurs after 13 years."
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,395.942,398.785,Why isn't out rule good for women as you said?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,398.785,401.425,"Well the out rule applies to women, it just doesn't apply as rapidly --"
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,401.425,403.017,Well it doesn't apply to the women.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,403.017,403.923,Pardon?
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,403.923,408.969,Why do you have to say this is a very good rule for the men?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,413.262,436.743,"Well, there are several reasons, one of the reasons is that the women are affected by it are relative small group, they are at a disadvantage in competing with men in the group for sea jobs."
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,436.743,440.919,"And that disadvantage is brought about by the navy, the same group that brought up or out rule?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,440.919,449.742,"Well, it's brought about by the statute which prohibits them from serving on ships, on combat ships."
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,449.742,451.799,The same thing.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,458.095,472.021,Well that's true but the -- let's say I don't believe that the statute prohibiting women from serving on combat ships is really in this case.
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,472.021,477.399,"Why couldn't you put that out, why is this up or out rule on women?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,477.399,478.055,"Well, you could."
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,478.055,479.708,Congress doesn't prohibit that.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,479.708,491.389,"Yeah, well Congress says that women shall not be discharged until after 13 years of service, if they're not on a promotion list."
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,491.389,505.071,"Well, in order to conform the Congress, why didn't you say that “Its the navy people who are sent to sea duty shall up or out”?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,505.071,509.015,You mean why doesn't the navy say that?
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,509.015,513.496,Instead of making it male to female.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,513.496,516.94,The Congress has said that the --
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,516.94,525.503,I don't think -- couldn't the navy say that all people subject to sea duty shall either qualify twice or get out--
1974.73-776,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,525.503,527.04,They always have to accept transport --
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,527.04,534.376,"I don't believe the navy could say that in light of the current statutes, Congress could say that."
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,534.376,535.587,You don't think the navy could?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,535.587,536.241,No.
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,536.241,537.155,Why not?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,537.155,539.969,Well because Section 63 A --
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,539.969,545.798,"Well the Navy has said it, so far the women are concerned."
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,550.498,567.561,"The problem in the case Mr. Justice Marshall is that 6382 A provides that; Male officers and women – well, it actually provides that all officers except women appointed under Section 5590."
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,567.561,568.765,Right.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,568.765,572.454,-- must be separated after they have twice failed of selection.
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,572.454,576.524,There's nothing the navy could do to get around that that's the one point I am talking about.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,576.524,577.748,"No that's, that just way --"
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,577.748,581.749,So the only way that we correct it is to go against the statute itself?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,581.749,582.357,That's correct.
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,582.357,583.027,That's what I was trying to explain --
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,583.027,591.519,"Yes, exactly."
1974.73-776,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,697.633,703.705,"What percentage of lieutenants that are passed over twice these days, a lot of lieutenants?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,703.705,712.145,"Well, approximately 15% to 30%, the promotion rate is about 85% -- 70% to 85%."
1974.73-776,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,712.145,713.432,To lieutenant commander.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,713.432,713.941,Pardon?
1974.73-776,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.941,714.701,To lieutenant commander.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,714.701,719.998,"But yeah, this is from lieutenant to lieutenant commander."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.943,948.557,"When you're talking about officers, you're talking about lieutenants or ?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,948.557,949.829,"Lieutenants and yes, I'm sorry."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.829,950.381,Lieutenants.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,950.381,952.844,"I'm talking about lieutenants, yes."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,952.844,954.574,Navy lieutenant?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,954.574,956.149,Navy lieutenant that's right.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,956.149,968.591,Incidentally is the ratio of female lieutenants to female lieutenant commanders about the same as male to male in both of the categories?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,968.591,972.242,There are less women lieutenant commanders.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,972.242,973.698,What about the ratio?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,973.698,981.302,The ratio is lower.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1023.907,1025.375,Even though they had been passed over --
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1025.375,1026.222,"Passed over twice, yes."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1026.222,1026.901,Their promotion twice.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1026.901,1029.301,"Yes, that's right."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1048.388,1053.764,"So that you say in peacetime, they too would have stayed on for almost 13 years?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1053.764,1056.914,Yes.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.914,1058.879,"Well, that would have been the predicted average?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1058.879,1060.307,That's the normal peacetime.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1060.307,1064.226,It was not the statutory about that and it was just the predicted average time.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1064.226,1072.337,"Well, a statute process that the normal length of service should be 12 years and this is the peacetime goal."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1072.337,1078.227,"Oh actually, is that the statute that has been suspended by the executive order?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1078.227,1081.59,The eligibility statute has been suspended by the executive order.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1081.59,1083.497,Does that have a relation to this process?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1083.497,1085.009,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1085.009,1088.983,How could a lieutenant is so close to retiring?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1090.513,1102.738,"Well, as a matter of fact, Lieutenant Ballard, the real, I think the real reason of Lieutenant Ballard is so anxious to remain in service is because he was -- did have a listed service."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1102.738,1103.628,A listed service.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1103.628,1106.352,Yeah.
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.352,1113.667,Does the Army and the Air Force have similar differences in (Inaudible).
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1113.667,1115.394,"No, they don't."
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.739,1215.162,"(Inaudible) tension however to the subject of any difficult amendment, other than this, I mean in terms of quality?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1215.162,1219.194,"No, this at least, this is --"
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.194,1224.863,You just could pass it over --
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1224.863,1229.764,"Yes, I'm not sure if that would be a wise policy."
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.764,1241.807,"Well, I take it that your goal is that all the navy's goals but one could be accomplished by saying women are subject to same rule as men, namely out and if you pass over twice."
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1244.822,1245.892,No.
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.58,1260.518,"Well, you could solve, you can solve the fact that having an over supply of lieutenants by simply making those women and the men subject to same rule."
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1260.518,1261.261,Yeah.
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1264.498,1267.523,But that part of your argument all aside.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1276.346,1285.054,"Well, the other justification relates to considerations of fairness to the woman involved."
1974.73-776,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1341.766,1353.21,"Mrs. Shapiro, when the 13 year statute was first enacted was it at that time fairly close to the length of time that a man had to go to be passed over twice?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1353.21,1365.628,The statute was designed to be equivalent to the peacetime goals for men.
1974.73-776,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.926,1378.811,Why was the statute ever passed out?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1378.811,1421.438,"Well, that the Title 10 includes when it was caught upon in 1947, it included one section that was -- permanent design, the permanent peacetime military provisions and then there are other sections that are temporary national emergency sections, the permanent provisions have never come into effect, they come into effect when there are no more reserves in the military."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1499.931,1517.388,"Is there any statutory limitation now on the promotions for the women in the navy, used to be back generation ago for example, (Inaudible) ways was a captain, he didn't have the flag rank and that was a matter of statute."
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1517.388,1525.469,"Until 1967, the highest rank that a woman could have I believe was captain."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1525.469,1526.262,As a matter of statute?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1526.262,1526.676,As a matter of statute.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1526.676,1531.224,The highest rank to which a woman could achieve in the navy was captain.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1531.224,1533.086,That's no longer true.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1533.086,1534.061,There are no limitations?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1534.061,1534.456,No.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1534.456,1536.283,There is no sex limitations?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1536.283,1536.756,"No, the only limitations."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1536.756,1539.666,Limitations on the overall member of flag hoisters I guess.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1539.666,1544.897,"Yes, that's right, and of course, there is this limitation on service."
1974.73-776,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1544.897,1548.864,Where stands this proposal or appeal of a 13 year statute.
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1548.864,1562.686,"Hearings were held on it over the summer, it's part of a overall provision, an overall revision of the entire military promotion and retirement provisions."
1974.73-776,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1562.686,1564.198,For all the services or just the Navy?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1564.198,1569.273,All services.
1974.73-776,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1577.772,1582.587,"Well, you say soon be eliminated that's rather optimistic is it?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1582.587,1586.746,It's probably not this here.
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1586.746,1594.26,"Ms. Shapiro, I think you've covered it, but your figures on the women includes the medical and the nurse school?"
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1594.26,1602.845,"No the 14 year -- the 14th figure, no, that includes only the women that are subject to this special provision."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1607.909,1609.678,"And then the nurse core, excuse me."
1974.73-776,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1609.678,1610.828,How about the medical core?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1610.828,1615.214,The medical core the women are subject to the same two pass over role.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1615.214,1618.569,And are there now men in the naval nurse core?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1618.569,1620.983,"Yes, not very man --"
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1620.983,1621.723,Commission officers?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1621.723,1626.302,Yes.
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1626.302,1628.211,Commissioned officer nurse in?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1628.211,1630.743,"Commissioned officer nurses, yes."
1974.73-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1630.743,1640.017,The new navy?
1974.73-776,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1640.017,1642.034,"If there no further question, I will reserve the time I have?"
1974.73-776,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1642.034,1645.526,Very well Mrs. Shapiro.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1646.755,1651.858,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court I'm Charles Khoury.
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1714.986,1716.43,How many years will he need --
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1716.43,1723.865,"Well, right now at this instant he will retire in February of 1975 which is about 4 months from now."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1723.865,1724.738,So he will have.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1724.738,1730.175,"I mean he would, but that's another issues that I want to talked about is mootness of this case but I'm saving that for the end of that."
1974.73-776,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1730.175,1731.774,"Well, let me see if I get this."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1735.652,1736.945,"Exactly, and if he will win this --"
1974.73-776,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1736.945,1743.002,And now this law suit has accomplished that for him or will by February as you said it.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1743.002,1743.767,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1749.736,1756.443,"Mrs. Shapiro, tells tells us the statute is going to be repealed, you tell us he gets everything he wants, but what are we dealing with?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1756.443,1759.219,"Sounds like in its fullness, doesn't it?"
1974.73-776,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1778.609,1782.575,Is it your view that the rational basis test applies?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1782.575,1795.977,"Your Honor, I feel that the compelling interest test would apply here, however we're talking about if the court were to find a rational basis I feel that that would also be a compelling interest in this particular situation."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1807.434,1809.518,Being a man it's not a tax case.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1809.518,1810.58,That's right.
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1810.58,1812.151,That's what Kahn v. Shevin was.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1812.151,1819.58,"And so I'm not at all saying, I'm responding to what Mrs. Shapiro said about a rational basis and our brief I talk."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1819.58,1823.223,It's not a Florida tax case either which is what that was.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1823.223,1839.554,"But at any rate, I agree that con is not applicable here, but basically what Mrs. Shapiro is saying is that because this is going to cause a great problem there's a military necessity for doing this, in other words, it's the reasoning backward problem."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1917.335,1924.834,"Since you want to talk about figures, what's your basis of nine based on the number, total number of years he was in the navy?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1924.834,1925.538,That's right.
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.538,1930.376,The total number of years that he was a Lieutenant.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1930.376,1935.034,"Officer and enlisted man, I'm talking about total number of years in the Navy Officer and enlisted men."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1936.553,1939.285,What has that got to do with the issue in this case?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1939.285,1940.416,Well --
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.416,1947.736,I mean how lieutenants did they have that it never been an enlisted man.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1947.736,1958.972,Her figure about lieutenants who would be covered by the statute 10 U.S.C. 6382 the whole number of lieutenants is correct.
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1960.17,1962.417,What's wrong with that figure?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1962.417,1964.107,"Well, what I'm talking about Your Honor."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1964.107,1967.367,"The statute only talks about those, is that right?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1967.367,1967.614,The statute talks about.
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.614,1969.926,The statute talks about enlisted people?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1969.926,1970.567,No.
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1970.567,1975.845,"People that have enlisted services, they don't talk about that, the statute you're talking about talks about lieutenants?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1975.845,1978.012,"Well, let me talk about this Your Honor too."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.717,1980.952,It is somewhere in the statute or where it is?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,1980.952,1995.828,"How many people are actually going to, if the Court finds that this is an unconstitutional discrimination how many lieutenants are actually going to say I want to stay in the Navy for an extra one or two years."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1999.244,2000.243,You tell me I don't know.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2000.243,2002.728,"Okay, the point is that she is trying to stay."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2002.728,2004.989,"Well, how many in (Inaudible)"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2004.989,2007.915,"One person, one person it's not possibly."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.915,2010.044,1It's awful large person.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2010.044,2020.682,"That is exactly right and that's the point I'm trying to make is that we're talking about one person here and the government is arguing that we're going to bring the, you know, have a whole lot of people 600 people over 33 years."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2020.682,2023.748,Can you take care of this one without taking care of it yet?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2023.748,2028.2,"Well that's what I suggest that the Court do here is worry about the cases, the class action when it comes --"
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2028.2,2031.094,Did the lower Court take care of one or all.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2033.05,2036.738,"One person, and it declared the statute unconstitutional."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2036.738,2040.188,Well that affects how many people.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2040.188,2047.505,"Well as a practical matter, it would affect only those people who opted to take advantage of it and that's point I'm trying to make."
1974.73-776,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2257.242,2260.343,Does that tie to your constitutional argument at all?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2260.343,2262.48,It talks about the turn of the calendar.
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.157,2287.032,That's the basis that Court had followed in --
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2287.032,2298.315,"Exactly, Your Honor, and another point that I want to talk about that has to do with this constitutional issue is the assertion that women are also subject to the same statute."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.566,2327.095,Is it not valued that I have been promoted.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2332.988,2354.702,"Namely, in other words, that no -- well the government is trying to say that basically that there has been a detriment,in other words, a detriment equally applies to women and I guess what the Court is saying is that maybe no women has ever been passed over that is subject to -- twice that was subject to the statute and that's a possible interpretation."
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2407.705,2419.333,"Why did the custom changed with respect to men Mr. Khoury, I take it, it hasn't been a result of statute but simply it's a result of practice that gradually the period for men has gone down from 13 years."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2419.333,2441.492,"Basically, what happened is that a restriction on time and grade was listed by an executive order, Presidential order and the latest one was signed by President Johnson in 1958 which took away a restriction that's -- before it used to have to be an (Inaudible) in a certain amount of time and then lieutenant JG a certain amount of time, before he was even eligible for promotion."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2441.492,2445.058,"Well, is this accurate in the government's supply brief?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2462.021,2465.915,"Basically, it says the suspension order says this is a national emergency."
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.364,2477.913,"Well of course, in the Second World War you had 21-year-old Colonels."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2480.285,2484.8,"And they did away with also this, the up or out procedure too during that period of time."
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.446,2506.923,"But if he does in fact suspend, so that you don't have to spend as much time and grade, doesn't it follow as a natural consequence of that, that the opportunity to judge the man may come up more frequently?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2506.923,2511.979,The opportunity to judge the man is still going to be subject to two Passovers.
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.142,2541.447,But that your chance to be promoted from lieutenant would come at the sooner date by reason of the Executive Order.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2541.447,2545.588,"That's right, and that's exactly right."
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.416,2587.65,"Well, if you're right the Court below was wrong if Congress wouldn't have intended this to apply to Lieutenant Ballard they should have enforced the Congressional intent and not declared as statute unconstitutional."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2587.65,2597.45,"Well, I never asserted and didn't mean to give the Court the impression that it was Congress's intent not to apply 6401 to Lieutenant Ballard."
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2632.571,2636.472,"Well, why on earth do they have to declare a statute unconstitutional."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2636.472,2644.947,Well that was an executive order and in 1968 and the --
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2644.947,2652.392,Why wouldn't they just told the Executive order was inconsistent with this intent of Congress that you described.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2652.392,2675.263,"No, I wouldn't say that the -- because here's the thing can we say that Congress would realized that the same statute or that the suspension of time and grade or the President would realize that this suspension of time and grade which causes the rapid promotion would also push out a bunch of well qualified people, do you see what I'm getting at."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2687.535,2702.232,"And I'm still worried about your statement that this one man Lieutenant Ballard, Congress meant to give him the same relief he gave women."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2702.232,2713.848,Because it's in the record that Congress made 13 years in the women statute so it would equal the male statute.
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2715.28,2722.157,"Well, does that apply to the other 200 to be in the same category as Lieutenant Ballard?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2722.157,2727.952,"Well, it would apply if in fact, the Department of Defense bill --"
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2727.952,2733.484,If the other 214 join in this lawsuit would it apply to him?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2733.484,2742.953,"If the other 214 were to join in this lawsuit, they -- depending on how many years they had been in the service."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2742.953,2749.078,But what is there in the Congressional History that limited to the number of years?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2749.078,2758.374,"I'm just saying, Your Honor, that we can't assume that it would be the intent of Congress to deny Lieutenant Ballard of this extra three years, that's the assumption that we can't make."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2758.374,2763.179,"Well, we can't speak of Lieutenant Ballard but I still think of those other 200 in this."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2763.179,2768.434,"Well, that's a separate lawsuit that maybe completely decided by the changing of the slot."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2768.434,2769.928,I don't know there's separate lawsuit.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2775.713,2785.868,"Well, basically we're talking about men who, they haven't intervened and we're up to the Supreme Court."
1974.73-776,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2785.868,2800.872,"Of course, (Inaudible) so all 200 and some of them are now in the same category as women according to you --"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2800.872,2815.969,"Anybody who was subject to discharge of that statute and if the statute is declared unconstitutional could be subject to that, but this is not a class action even though the government is talking about it like it's a class action."
1974.73-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2815.969,2830.285,Besides several times that this procedure operates to push out well qualified people but isn't that inherent in a process of keeping better qualified people?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2830.285,2836.99,"We don't attack the selection out procedure, Your Honor, just as the government stated we don't attack that."
1974.73-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.99,2843.235,"Well, I wondered why you put so much emphasis on the fact, that on the idea that this pushes out well qualified people."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2854.799,2875.13,"But what if you inject sex into that pushing out of well qualified people and that's really what our problem is, because we have no quarrel with the selection -- the up or out selection procedure – so it is a hard procedure but I'm not attacking it here, I can't really but if it's tied to sex I can and have and --"
1974.73-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2875.13,2886.042,The government tells chooses that's part of a compensatory arrangement for the fact that the female officers can't get sea duty except in limited categories.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2886.042,2902.432,"Well, I have a hard time with that, I couldn't find any intent of Congress to that effect and I'm wondering about justifying a discriminatory scheme by saying that it's to make up for another discrimination and we're not in an attack situation like Congress or Shevin."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2917.862,2934.12,"Mr. Khoury, getting back from this February date when he would be eligible for retirement, have you had any assurances from the Navy without the guards and the outcome of this case, that he will be kept out until he is eligible?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2934.12,2935.453,No Your Honor.
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2986.638,2990.747,Even if the judgment flows reverse?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2990.747,2992.239,Exactly.
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2992.239,2996.093,On that basis that you're suggesting this case might be moot and dismissed?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,2996.093,3014.188,"Yes Your Honor, and the reason is such a late suggestion on my part is that I just came across Odegaard and that logic, and DeFunis v. Odegaard yesterday in researching this and I felt that I must bring that up to the Court."
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3075.544,3099.518,"If the rational basis applies Mr. Khoury, does it make much difference whether the arguments are put in the form of an affidavit by an admiral or whether they are put in the form of an attorney's brief saying rational people could argue that such and such would serve a purpose, I mean one way you're confronted with that as a statement of fact, and other way your confronted with a legal argument but it's pretty much the same right?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3099.518,3113.988,"Your Honor, the whole point of their affidavits is the Pandora's Box argument that I've alluded to before, namely, words to the effect that the Navy is going to come it's screeching halt if the Court implements this relief."
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3140.773,3143.96,Is this really the way we're trying constitutional cases now.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3162.002,3176.796,There are a lot of facts which have been spoken to by the government in an attempt to support a rational basis which would never raise before and that's and I contest their accuracy.
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3180.222,3188.057,But you're just as able to make that argument now having seen the affidavit as you would be had just seen it in our opposing brief.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3188.057,3188.25,Oh!
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3211.978,3214.674,"Well, does that meet the rational basis test?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3214.674,3217.164,"No, I don't think that meets the rational basis test at all."
1974.73-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.164,3220.905,Mr. Khoury let me go back where I started.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3227.12,3229.875,10 U.S.C. 6382.
1974.73-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3231.689,3238.114,(Inaudible) was it a practice before the formation ways.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3238.114,3241.367,"I can't answer that, Your Honor, and all that --"
1974.73-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.367,3254.814,"If it were I suppose at that time, there isn't any constitutional argument, and the constitutional argument arises only because of the presence of 6401."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3254.814,3255.645,That's true.
1974.73-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3255.645,3262.255,And then why is it in 6401 the unconstitutional statute?
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3262.255,3281.098,"Well, the scheme is unconstitutional and the point is in the two ways that we approach this, the Court below has the decision what were they going to do, what relief were they going to grant and then that's the decision that they had to make is to try to figure out what Congress intended."
1974.73-776,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3308.6,3330.983,"My problem here is that do you think we have a constitutional system before 6401 was enacted, and because of it's enactment all of a sudden you're here claiming unconstitutionality of the others, I just wanted the chronology had to do anything with it all?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3330.983,3337.821,I think the chronology would help in figuring out what the intent of Congress is Your Honor and that's what the Court has to do when they're granting relief.
1974.73-776,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3372.949,3378.763,"Sure I understand your suggestion, that this case maybe moot?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3378.763,3452.435,"Yes Your Honor, because of the fact that at the time the lawsuit was filed he did not come within the relief established in this and I'm referring, let me just refer the Court specifically to the brief and the government alluded to it in the oral argument but basically in the government's brief at page 5, footnote 6, there is a statement about this long standing policy of the navy to retire individuals when they've gotten within two years of retirement and then there's a Forbes's affidavit which is in Appendix 9 (a) and then there's also an affidavit which is not in the Appendix but which is in the record of this case which was filed by the government which stated that yes in fact, the navy does have this long standing policy to retire individuals when they get within two years of retirement and it's supported by statute and that's what I cited the statute 10 U.S.C 1006 e and that he is now within that and it‘s my understanding that he is going to be retired on that, that they really -- based on the navy's long standing policy what is there to exempt him from that long standing."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3452.435,3455.156,And he is now within about five months or so.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3455.156,3456.661,Well February --
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3456.661,3458.896,Whatever that is next January?
1974.73-776,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3458.896,3463.229,"Yeah, but that is not mandatory is it?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3463.229,3466.661,Let me state what that situation is.
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3498.417,3501.983,Yes but the policy involved is the reserved appointment according to that but--
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3501.983,3503.262,That's right in other words --
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3503.262,3504.144,Your thought is that --
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3504.144,3504.921,You resign --
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3504.921,3512.839,"At this junction however this case comes out, he would probably get a reserved appointment so that it could retire in February."
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3512.839,3515.327,Exactly.
1974.73-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3516.932,3519.968,Do you have anything further Mrs. Shapiro?
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3519.968,3522.188,I just have one other question.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3528.1,3528.412,Oh!
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3529.883,3533.007,Will that equalize him with the woman -- who have all the (Voice Overlap)
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3533.007,3552.622,"As a practical -- yes Your Honor, as a practical matter he will be able to stay until retirement which his retirement is, well his retirement actually even if he stays in until February 16, 1975 that's retirement that's 19 ½ years, you mean in 19 ½ years February 16th 1975."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3552.622,3558.269,"But that still doesn't give him what a woman would have, I take it, does it, 13 years as a Lieutenant?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3558.269,3559.031,Very close to it.
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3559.031,3559.763,As a lieutenant.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3559.763,3562.346,Very -- it will be very close to it Your Honor.
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3562.346,3580.963,"Mr. Khoury, I believe our practice in cases where we find the case is moot is to vacate the judgment below and direct the action be dismissed so that you would in effect lose the benefit of your District Court judgment whereas I understand it, we concluded it as it is moot, is that agreeable to you?"
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3580.963,3586.482,"Well Your Honor, I was in dismissing I'm talking about that in the context of dismissing the appeal."
1974.73-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3595.52,3603.307,If a case is moot though under our (Inaudible) case we vacate the judgment below and directed the action be dismissed.
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3603.307,3608.41,It's different from a dismissal and the appeal is properly broad.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3614.652,3619.163,"May I suggest something to the Court then, because this is a very important point and I'm only raising for the first time."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3638.004,3648.812,Suppose the government were to say to us today we're doing the apply this policy put him on a reserve appointment status so that then he can be retired in February.
1974.73-776,1,19341,charles_r_khoury_jr,,3654.153,3675.712,"The court puts me in a tough position, I don't see how -- if the -- if my client is going to be -- is to get this retirement which is -- which was really the ultimate of the lawsuit, I don't see how I could object."
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3678.076,3679.042,What about other?
1974.73-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3679.042,3684.318,Mrs. Shapiro.
1974.73-776,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3684.318,3699.777,"Well, what about -- is it true that as your --instances like this, if within two years of retirement as he now is, -- your plot park probably practice where they have to do it or not is to give them a reserve appointment and let them finish out the term."
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3699.777,3703.565,That is the policy but this is certainly a special situation.
1974.73-776,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3729.465,3739.72,Well if you could still win the case and the injunction could still have been proper issue.
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3739.72,3740.953,I --
1974.73-776,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.953,3750.088,"Well, what about -- I suppose -- until the appeal was finally over, until the case is finally over and the injunction has been outstanding."
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3750.088,3757.609,"Well, the injunction against discharging him I believe is based on the conclusion that the statute was --"
1974.73-776,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3757.609,3760.428,Requirements on the merits?
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3760.428,3760.937,Yeah!
1974.73-776,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3767.554,3769.018,Is there a preliminary injunction?
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3769.018,3770.473,Yes there was.
1974.73-776,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3770.473,3775.694,"Of course if there is an affirmance, then what's your situation?"
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3775.694,3777.969,The Secretary of the Navy hasn't decided.
1974.73-776,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3779.534,3784.155,"Well, that -- if the injunction remained, you can't discharge him."
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3784.155,3784.877,That's true.
1974.73-776,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3786.081,3787.594,And in February he may retire.
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3787.594,3788.175,That's right.
1974.73-776,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3788.175,3789.263,"Well, no -- he can't retire --"
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3789.263,3791.097,"Well, we can't discharge him until -- for 13 years."
1974.73-776,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3791.097,3792.796,And you can't even discharge him in February.
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3794.748,3795.157,We have to hold him --
1974.73-776,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3795.157,3800.02,"Just prior to the expiration, you can't just discharge him prior to expiration of 13 years of commission service."
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3800.02,3800.721,Yeah.
1974.73-776,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3800.721,3804.686,Making him the same equivalent as though he were a female.
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3804.686,3823.04,"We would hope that if the Court found that there was an unconstitutional discrimination -- we would have -- the relief would indicate that if the special statute were repealed, why?"
1974.73-776,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3828.01,3834.3,"Well, I would suppose if it were reputed, you'd go back to District Court and tell him so and let them decide in the first instance for what happens."
1974.73-776,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3842.273,3865.75,"The only other point, I wanted to make was that the class actions that Mr. Khoury referred to are pending in the District Court and as a matter of fact, we are under injunctions prohibiting the discharge of the people that are involved in those cases."
1974.73-776,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3882.302,3887.46,"Thank you Mrs. Shapiro, and Mr. Khoury."
