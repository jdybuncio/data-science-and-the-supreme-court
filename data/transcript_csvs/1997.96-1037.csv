1997.96-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.238,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1037, the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.--"
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,11.35,14.673,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,87.341,91.665,"Well, are those issues that you mentioned just now, are they necessarily involved in this case?"
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,91.665,108.374,"They are involved in the case, in this case to the extent that they show the true impact of the judgment and some of the policy reasons why Congress has not elected to waive the sovereign immunity of tribes."
1997.96-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,108.374,121.204,"It is quite possible, it seems to me, that a State court might have jurisdiction to enter a judgment but perhaps not have the jurisdiction to do some of the things which you describe as having happened in this case."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,121.204,130.541,"I think you would have to look more deeply at what kind of judgment, and whether or not there was in fact a waiver."
1997.96-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,158.77,164.514,"Well, suppose there had been a waiver, would you think that these actions could then have been undertaken?"
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,175.751,182.417,"Well, that's true, Your Honor, and it depends very much on how the waiver is structured."
1997.96-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.481,208.412,But suppose they didn't.
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,223.793,260.937,"Well, in representing a tribe in that situation I would certainly take the position that until there is a waiver with respect to what assets can be subjected to the judgment, then the waiver is incomplete, that in order to have a complete and effective waiver so that a judgment can be entered and can be enforced, the waiver has got to have the court agreeing that it... excuse me, have the tribe agreeing that it will be subject to court process, and then the enforcement must also be specifically covered."
1997.96-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,260.937,281.96,"So that if the tribe said, the tribe hereby waives sovereign immunity for liability on this note, that would be insufficient to waive immunity if a court ordered execution or attachment of a tribal bank account."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,281.96,283.312,I think it's in... yes.
1997.96-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.006,327.984,I just don't know if it's the tradition in our law to parse and separate sovereign immunity into those two components or not.
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,327.984,349.969,"State statutes that deal with State sovereign immunity very regularly say the State will agree to be sued for these causes of action, and then very regularly address the means of enforcement of those causes of action... or, excuse me, of any judgments under those causes of action."
1997.96-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,349.969,352.112,"Usually by appropriation by the State legislature, or something."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,352.112,355.624,That is one of the devices that's used.
1997.96-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.084,374.856,"That is certainly not the case, I am sure, with regard to foreign sovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, where a foreign sovereign is liable for its commercial activities--"
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,374.856,376.448,Foreign sovereign--
1997.96-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.448,386.734,"--and I'm quite sure that even when there's been no waiver what you can do is, if the foreign sovereign has a bank account in this country, you can move against the bank account, period."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,386.734,387.314,"--Yes, sir."
1997.96-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,424.639,427.05,"I must confess, I'm a little puzzled by--"
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,427.05,427.44,--Excuse me?
1997.96-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,427.44,427.951,--the discussion.
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,434.545,435.777,"Well, that's true."
1997.96-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.4,488.53,"Now, that's the question we have here, is it not?"
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,488.53,490.982,"That's... yes, sir."
1997.96-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.982,491.513,"Yes, that's the question--"
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,491.513,492.374,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.374,493.285,--you presented in your petition.
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,493.285,494.013,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,495.305,512.908,"In so holding was the Oklahoma court in effect accepting the invitation... maybe that's too strong a word, at least the suggestion in the, what was it, the Cabazon case that in fact that might be the case."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,516.299,536.203,"I can remember a point in a concurring opinion in Citizen Band Potawatomi where there were... where there was a question raised with respect to whether the immunity of a tribe would apply to commercial activities off of Indian country, yes, sir, Your Honor."
1997.96-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,536.203,537.054,All right.
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,542.877,557.007,The Congress is vested with exclusive control over tribal sovereignty and tribal immunity as a part of tribal sovereignty.
1997.96-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.477,586.776,"Well, in our Mescalero opinion we said that activities conducted by the Mescalero Band off the reservation were subject to nondiscriminatory State taxes, didn't we?"
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,586.776,601.716,"Absent... yes, absent Federal law to the contrary, the Court held that the activities were subject to nondiscriminatory State taxes."
1997.96-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.716,615.356,"So to say, absent Federal law to the contrary, these activities are subject to State authority suggests that the Congress would have to affirmatively prohibit the jurisdiction, rather than affirmatively authorize it, the way you're talking."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,615.356,623.931,I think the problem with the line of reasoning there is a couplefold.
1997.96-1037,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.399,703.544,"But Mr. Wallace, it has to come from some place originally."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,722.735,734.382,"Yes, and the Court has found in the past that the immunity exists as an aspect, an inherent aspect of a sovereign that preexists the Constitution."
1997.96-1037,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.744,744.82,"But then you're distinguishing the tribes as sovereign from a sister State as sovereign, from a foreign nation as sovereign."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,744.82,750.274,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I think the distinction is probably valid."
1997.96-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,766.996,782.724,"What is... if the... suppose the tribe goes downtown Tulsa and they buy a piece of property and open an office, and the taxes are [dollars] 4,000 a year, and they don't pay, right."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,787.557,788.368,For taxes?
1997.96-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,788.368,788.699,Yes.
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,788.699,793.662,"Well, I... if the acquisition is done appropriately--"
1997.96-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,793.662,795.524,Yes... they buy it.
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,795.524,798.556,--The ad valorem taxes do not apply to the--
1997.96-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,798.556,799.077,"All right, fine."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,806.391,817.677,"--Well, Oklahoma has to figure out collection and remedial devices short of going to the court and filing a lawsuit."
1997.96-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,817.677,820.599,"So you think Oklahoma cannot collect the taxes, either."
1997.96-1037,0,40760,r_brown_wallace,,851.661,862.627,"Well, in the regulatory and taxation cases this Court has approached the issue on an infringement and preemption analysis."
1997.96-1037,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,881.23,883.711,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,885.524,900.423,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.04,972.813,"Well, let's talk about the practical importance a minute."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1005.594,1007.764,They are actively considering it.
1997.96-1037,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1028.969,1035.874,"But Congress is debating the desirability, or lack thereof, of certain waivers of sovereign immunity."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1035.874,1067.804,"That's absolutely correct, and Congress as long ago as 1934 in the Indian Reorganization Act recognized exactly this issue that you bring up about, and that the Oklahoma courts adverted to as a matter of policy, which is, will anyone deal with the tribes, and they provided in the Oklahoma Welfare... Indian Welfare Act, for one thing, for not only the incorporation of tribal governments as governments, but also separate incorporation as business entities, and those entities are or may be subject to suit in certain circumstances, limited to their business property, just like a normal corporation would be."
1997.96-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.877,1076.13,Have they ever passed a statute saying the tribes have immunity?
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1076.13,1092.842,"--There are a number of statutes, I think the most recent one being the Indian Tribal Native American Agricultural Reform Act of 1993, which recognized that implicitly by saying that nothing that Congress is doing--"
1997.96-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.842,1095.104,I understand all the implicit record.
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1100.105,1103.739,--I'm not aware of any statute that says that in those terms.
1997.96-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.588,1121.771,"Well, of course they can assume that, because we have cases that have said that, but let me ask this."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1158.985,1161.869,"Yes, and I would say that because--"
1997.96-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.869,1162.217,Yes.
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1162.217,1162.797,--Yes.
1997.96-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1162.797,1164.92,We would have had to wait for Congress?
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1164.92,1189.194,"You would have had to wait for Congress, and I would say that because the original common law, if you will, recognition of the foreign... of the scope of a foreign sovereign's immunity came so early in this Court's history and this country's history in the Schooner Exchange case that by the time you got to the 1950's, when the State Department was recognizing the commercial exception, it was already firmly settled in this Court's jurisprudence."
1997.96-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.549,1197.55,So it never changes?
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1201.293,1225.479,"If circumstances dramatically change, then it is always the prerogative of the sovereign to make its own decisions about what cases its courts will entertain, and that's true from the Schooner Exchange on, but the question here would be who would represent the sovereign of the United States, and this Court had made clear consistently that the default rule was going to be absolute immunity, and it was then up to Congress to vary that."
1997.96-1037,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1225.479,1226.18,Then what was going on with the Tate letter?
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1237.667,1250.915,"I think what the courts had recognized was that in cases where the State Department was willing to represent to the Court that it was important... that it was not important that immunity should not be recognized, then the courts would frequently accept that as consistent with--"
1997.96-1037,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1250.915,1252.227,But the State Department is not Congress.
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1252.227,1264.304,"--No, but the State Department is a political branch of the Government, and I think our submission is merely that the Court's policy... whether the Court had the power to do it or not, it may very well have had the power to see a development in common law, but the Court did not do that."
1997.96-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1294.723,1296.536,"In particular, what is the default rule?"
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1302.62,1306.803,"--Against a foreign sovereign, or against a tribal--"
1997.96-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1306.803,1308.685,"No, say the Indian tribe in your view."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1308.685,1316.02,"--Well, there are... as the Court had recognized in Potawatomi, there may be ways, some of them more effective, some of them less effective."
1997.96-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.991,1321.314,"In other words, the answer is they cannot sue to get the money from the tribe."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1321.314,1322.966,"--They cannot sue the tribe, and the tribe--"
1997.96-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1322.966,1325.436,Can they sue to get the... can they sue to enforce the environmental regulation?
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1331.551,1337.043,"--Well, under... if there's a specific Federal statute, which in RCRA I believe there is, there's a specific waiver by Congress of the--"
1997.96-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.043,1344.998,"Well, all these... there's a State law that says you can't keep owls in the basement, or you can't keep... you can't have holes for the coyotes, whatever."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1361.04,1366.273,--Under State... a State may not proceed under State law to get an injunction directly against the tribe.
1997.96-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1367.963,1372.847,"Even though it's in downtown... so in fact, an officer of the tribe is driving a tribe truck, and he speeds."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1379.4,1379.89,--Yes.
1997.96-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1392.981,1397.255,--Where does your position leave what we said in Mescalero?
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1403.367,1421.709,"--I think it leaves the tribe... it leaves the States in exactly the place they were left in Potawatomi, which is they have a variety of mechanisms to enforce their valid regulations, but those mechanisms do not include a direct judgment, either injunctive or monetary, against the tribe, and that's... I think that's really precisely what the Court said in Potawatomi."
1997.96-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1421.709,1425.522,But in Mescalero they said the tribe was subject to taxation.
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1425.522,1433.059,It is crucial to distinguish between... we heard in the first argument about the many... the hydra-headed concept of jurisdiction.
1997.96-1037,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1454.954,1476.479,"But that is entirely... but that... as I understand it, your argument rests entirely upon a rule of prudence, self-administered by this Court, that we will not revise or consider revising the traditional rule, and I'm not sure why we should be bound by that rule of prudence."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1476.479,1486.214,"--I think it rests on something that is... the Court has always recognized that the tribes were created as sovereign, they have sovereignty."
1997.96-1037,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1487.777,1497.583,And we developed this rule at a time when the kinds of problems that are being hypothesized in this argument really would not have been realistic hypotheses.
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1500.114,1518.675,"--Well, I think that because the Court has recognized the tribes are sovereigns, and because immunity from suit is such a central part of the inherent background of the rule of sovereignty... and we see this in cases like Couer d'Alene, we see it in cases under the Eleventh Amendment before the States, we see it in cases involving the United States."
1997.96-1037,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1525.671,1546.073,"Mr. DuMont, those principles have changed, at least with respect to sister States, and with respect to foreign countries, so you are now urging a kind of sovereign immunity that doesn't... no longer exists State-to-State or foreign nation vis-a-vis the United States."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1546.073,1548.367,"--Well, let me make two points about that in reverse order."
1997.96-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.713,1624.637,Do you think that's true with regard to tribal commercial activities off the reservation?
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1626.967,1648.222,"Again, regulatory power has to be distinguished, but I think it is true with respect to jurisdiction, and the tribal immunity from suit, and what that effectively did was to freeze into place a Federal common law rule which, Nevada v. Hall recognized that if you had looked at that rule at the time of the Constitution you would have said that every State would recognize immunity for every other State."
1997.96-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.222,1653.476,But the regulatory jurisdiction is just illusory if there's no way to enforce it.
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1653.476,1660.89,"I think that's not correct, for all the reasons that were stated in the opinion in Potawatomi, which is to say that there may be damage actions or injunctive actions against--"
1997.96-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1660.89,1663.272,But how could there be damage actions against the tribe?
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1665.212,1666.564,"--I'm sorry, against tribal officers."
1997.96-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.566,1671.227,Officers have no money.
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1679.801,1680.913,"--Well, I--"
1997.96-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.913,1682.894,--tribal officer for millions of dollars?
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1682.894,1688.387,"--I simply have to suggest that if that were the controlling principle, then the result in Potawatomi would have been otherwise."

1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1698.755,1724.954,"--Well, I think it's very instructive that when Congress applied parts of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Constitution to Indian tribes in the Indian Civil Rights Act the Court has held that it clearly thought about this issue and decided that damage actions were not... against the tribe were not an appropriate means of resolution, so it specifically withheld jurisdiction to enter... even under a Federal law to enter money judgments against the tribe, and the same principle applies here, that you have to protect these small governments."
1997.96-1037,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1736.122,1749.669,"Mr. Dumont, there's one justice of this Court that said, if there's jurisdiction to regulate, and specifically jurisdiction to tax, then of course there must be jurisdiction to enforce that tax."
1997.96-1037,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1751.441,1766.91,"Well, I would suggest that, for instance, there are a variety of Federal laws that clearly impose mandatory Federal law obligations on the States and State officers, and yet they are not... the State is not amenable to a private suit in Federal... even in Federal court to enforce those obligations."
1997.96-1037,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1805.115,1806.106,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,1809.138,1816.955,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1037,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1839.299,1843.222,"Do you concede that the issue is a Federal law issue, not a State law issue?"
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,1843.222,1856.15,"It is a Federal law issue which can be determined very properly, as this was, in the District Court of Oklahoma County and in the State courts of Oklahoma under Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Graham."
1997.96-1037,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1856.15,1859.852,But the State applied its own State law in resolving this.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,1861.862,1862.773,The State--
1997.96-1037,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1862.773,1870.387,How can you defend the State court decision by applying State law to answer this question?
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,1870.387,1876.682,--The State court looked to Federal common law in part.
1997.96-1037,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.372,1904.692,"Well, I would have thought that for you to argue for affirmance here you would have to at least justify it on the basis of Federal law principles."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,1904.692,1907.333,And we do very much.
1997.96-1037,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1907.333,1911.206,But were Federal law principles decided below?
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,1932.389,1953.552,"Yes, except the... if I understand your question, Justice Souter, the lower court made its decision based on principally Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, and the language which has been referred to, the situation has been referred to which is to the effect--"
1997.96-1037,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1953.552,1954.814,If I understand you... you correct me if I wrong.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,1963.369,1985.054,"--The Oklahoma supreme court in Hoover, which is... was held to be controlling in this case, was based on an examination, and my understanding of Federal law as enunciated by this Court, and in light of Federal statutes."
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.512,2040.995,"It usually takes two to engage in commercial activity, doesn't it?"
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2044.868,2052.503,--The tribe can't... in the commercial contract case you have two parties of supposedly equal statute.
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.503,2053.824,Right.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2053.824,2069.945,"If you have a tribal operation, a business office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for instance, where there are business invitees in that tribe, they are not people who have available waiver, for instance, of sovereign immunity."
1997.96-1037,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2077.76,2084.165,"Well, this is a suit on a promissory note where on its face it said sovereign immunity wasn't waived."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2103.399,2121.05,"If I might, Justice O'Connor, reading from the record at page 14, the language is, nothing in this note subjects or limits the sovereign rights of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, and we don't have any argument with that language."
1997.96-1037,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2124.132,2126.283,"Well, it's a little like buyer beware."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2150.63,2157.963,"--Once again, if it's activity which is protected by sovereign immunity that's exactly the case."
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.348,2164.969,What's the--
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2164.969,2165.469,--in a commercial--
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.469,2182.581,"--That is to say, if there's anything to... maybe there's no sovereign immunity, but if there's any sovereign immunity, wouldn't it at least at its heart be there to protect the treasury in a contract suit from money damages, and if that's so, why does it matter?"
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2193.777,2211.869,"--The cases which amounts to the general rule that the tribe is not subject to suit absent its waiver or a congressional abrogation of immunity arose historically out of cases where the tribe was acting in proper tribal matters on a tribal reservation, on land."
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2211.869,2212.871,"Yes, that's true, so that's why I ask."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2233.363,2239.698,The place of the contract in this particular case is of critical difference.
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.663,2338.382,"Well then, the rule you're arguing for really is not... is not a... analogous to the rule in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act at all."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2353.572,2354.934,There--
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.934,2367.79,"You can't really appeal to the change in sovereign immunity internationally, or the provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as exemplifying what you would want us to do."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2376.547,2380.81,"--And we would urge that that is, in fact, the rule."
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.463,2422.538,"You, do you just so... I don't mind you saying all of this, but so long as you get around to answering my question."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2437.297,2441.42,"That's not my understanding, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2442.119,2467.417,"You think if France sets up an aircraft company and it's a purely commercial venture, profit-making venture, but all the shares are owned by the State of France, the Nation of France, that if that company makes a contract, so long as it makes the contract in France the commercial activities exception to sovereign immunity does not apply?"
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2467.417,2469.889,"--No, absolutely not, it does apply."
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.889,2471.159,I think so.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2471.159,2473.652,I was afraid I was not communicating with you--
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.652,2474.281,Mm-hmm.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2474.281,2476.674,--I had misspoken my position.
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.937,2486.818,Okay.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2486.818,2488.16,--as per Mescalero--
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.16,2492.683,But not if conducted the commercial activities on its reservation.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2492.683,2494.993,--And that is the distinction.
1997.96-1037,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.993,2496.666,"And that's different from the international rule, isn't it?"
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2496.666,2507.293,"In the international rule, once again, when a sovereign conducts activities on its... in its own jurisdiction, then it is sovereign."
1997.96-1037,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2507.293,2509.844,Does this tribe have a reservation?
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2510.335,2515.217,"This tribe has approximately 1,200 acres of land--"
1997.96-1037,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2515.217,2516.389,Does it have a reservation?
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2516.389,2518.549,--It does not have a reservation.
1997.96-1037,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2518.549,2518.919,No.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2526.054,2527.505,That's not our position.
1997.96-1037,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2558.686,2564.801,"Well, I can understand... I guess I can understand what you're saying, but I don't understand the justification for it."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2610.419,2637.018,"Because the... historically the immunity which was accorded the Indian sovereign was as to the tribe's acts on tribal lands in relation to its own internal affairs, management of its internal affairs."
1997.96-1037,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2638.069,2656.36,"Well, that... historically that is certainly true with respect... I guess it's certainly true with respect to legislative or regulatory jurisdiction, but we're now talking about judicial jurisdiction, and I'm not sure that it... anything follows with respect to judicial jurisdiction."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2656.36,2680.227,"--The... if I may answer indirectly, the rationale of Potawatomi in separating regulatory and adjudicatory authority of the State in that case, it was critical that the activities there involved took place on State land... I'm sorry, on tribal lands."
1997.96-1037,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2725.714,2729.607,"But that was in the context of State taxation, wasn't it?"
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2729.607,2731.719,And... that is correct.
1997.96-1037,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.719,2743.336,Might not that principle be perfectly sound in the case of State taxation but perhaps be of more limited effect where you're talking about the jurisdiction of a court?
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2743.336,2747.47,That may very well be of more limited jurisdiction.
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2791.408,2799.944,"Is it your view, too... you also have asserted what I call an all-or-nothing position that once the tribe... there are a lot of different kinds of laws."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2827.002,2829.553,That... no... that would be correct.
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2881.657,2899.89,"So the... you and the Solicitor General agree that either you can bring a lawsuit against the tribe acting off-reservation under all these laws or under none of them, and you say you can bring the suit irrespective, and they say none."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2902.141,2911.558,"That is right, once again, as modified by the language in Mescalero, absent Federal law to the contrary."
1997.96-1037,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2911.558,2932.481,"--And of course the debate between the majority and the dissent in Mescalero was whether there was Federal law to the contrary in that case, because the dissenters claimed that they were... the tribe was a Federal instrumentality, in effect."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2932.481,2950.174,The... and... I believe that I'm correct when I say that the... they... the rule of Mescalero is based on a finding that there was no tribal sovereign immunity for the off-reservation activity.
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2952.675,2978.483,"In Potawatomi... you're more familiar... I looked at it quickly, but... or is there some other precedent that makes clear that in the noncontract context, say the State regulatory law context, or the State tax context, that the State or a city or some private person can maintain a lawsuit and collect money from the tribe, or didn't Potawatomi leave that open?"
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2978.483,2991.16,"Well, once again, in respondent's view, Potawatomi announced the rule for onreservation activity."
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2991.16,2992.793,Yes.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,2992.793,2996.715,Our position is that that rule doesn't travel off the reservation.
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2996.715,3019.31,"So that... but you... there is no authority, I take it, either way in respect to any of these laws for tribe activity, in respect to any of these laws off the reservation, any category, which makes clear that the State or a city or a private person can sue the tribe, or that makes clear it can't sue the tribe."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,3019.31,3021.42,Justice--
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3021.42,3023.741,"There is no clear authority either way on that, I take it."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,3024.352,3025.754,"--Justice Breyer, I find none."
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3119.874,3132.974,"What is... but I'm beginning to... I hadn't seen fully the implications for tax law, regulatory law, all kinds of other laws, and if there are... I'm not certain they've been fully argued out, because you've been focusing on contract."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,3143.142,3152.967,"If I... if I understand you, you ask is this a State law question to be--"
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3152.967,3157.732,"No, I'm thinking... I think perhaps the lower court said it was State law, and perhaps it's wrong on that."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,3157.732,3158.329,--I--
1997.96-1037,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3158.329,3160.682,"If it's wrong on that, I wonder if we shouldn't send it back."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,3169.739,3173.9,--In my view this is not a State law question.
1997.96-1037,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3183.527,3192.093,"Well, isn't it correct to say that it's both a Federal law question and a State law question, because if there is a Federal law that says the tribe's immune here, that would obviously control."
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,3217.31,3241.144,"I would agree that... I think the principal issues are Federal law principles, but once you find that a State has certain rights, then you do get into the State law aspect of the question, and this Court has dealt with that in a number of cases on-reservation, arising out of State regulatory actions."
1997.96-1037,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3344.692,3347.015,Until Congress says otherwise.
1997.96-1037,2,32448,john_e_patterson_jr,,3372.122,3374.403,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
