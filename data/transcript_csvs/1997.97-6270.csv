1997.97-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.067,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-6270, Gerald Caron v. The United States."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,40.139,40.48,Thank you.
1997.97-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,40.48,50.216,Mr. Walker.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,50.216,53.037,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.97-6270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,106.144,115.74,"Of course, if we accept your interpretation of the law it wouldn't matter that the firearms he had were the kind that Massachusetts allows him to have."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,122.245,130.109,"That is the... what the statute literally says, and it is the... we contend the only literal reading of the statute."
1997.97-6270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.695,137.806,What is the literal reading?
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,139.188,157.79,"The literal reading is that if the... a conviction... if a pardon says... only if a pardon says you can have no firearms, only if a pardon says no firearms can the conviction be considered a conviction."
1997.97-6270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,164.145,165.186,"He wasn't pardoned, was he?"
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,165.186,166.288,--I beg your pardon?
1997.97-6270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,166.288,166.919,Was he pardoned?
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,166.919,167.119,No.
1997.97-6270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,172.983,182.019,"That's where I'm having trouble, because I read this statute... I'd always thought that a felon in possession of a gun was committing a Federal crime."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,226.049,226.3,--That's correct.
1997.97-6270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,226.3,227.772,So how do we deal with this?
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,231.124,235.076,"Well, I would suggest that the Court should follow the words of the statute."
1997.97-6270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.666,260.925,--I don't think it has to be read that way.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,268.341,268.942,"Well, that's--"
1997.97-6270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.942,274.565,So in prohibiting handguns it's prohibiting his possession of firearms.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,274.565,281.04,"--There is a false syllogism in the circuit court's reading of the statute, and it goes like this."
1997.97-6270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,315.232,317.534,It does not say that.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,318.836,320.596,"--Well... you're correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-6270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,320.596,321.738,It does not say no firearms.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,337.637,339.019,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-6270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.57,340.511,"So you have to be very, very careful."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,342.344,344.517,"--Well, I beg to differ, Your Honor."
1997.97-6270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,382.522,383.924,Let me take your lawyers example.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,396.376,398.359,That... that--
1997.97-6270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.359,403.071,"I have been cheated by A, B, and C, and wouldn't I make the statement, I've been cheated by lawyers?"
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,403.071,408.464,"--Well, that is a different... there's no prohibition in that."
1997.97-6270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.694,435.015,It doesn't work.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,452.065,467.125,"--You would say there's certain candy that I prohibited my child from eating, but if the question is, have you ever expressly told your children not to eat candy, the answer would be no, if you've only limited it to M&M's."
1997.97-6270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.125,467.335,I wouldn't say no.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,469.216,475.22,"Right, I couldn't eat... but you wouldn't say, on one occasion I told them they couldn't eat candy."
1997.97-6270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,479.213,498.965,"Mr. Walker, can we get away from grammar for a moment and say, why isn't... since you can read this at least three ways, say why isn't the question, is this person, this ex-felon, now like everybody else with respect to guns, so if he can have guns like someone who never committed a crime, fine."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,507.296,508.868,I think that is the most sensible reading.
1997.97-6270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,508.868,515.092,But your client is not like everyone else because he can't have handguns on the street.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,515.092,521.238,Other people can't have handguns on the street unless they get a special license.
1997.97-6270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,521.238,531.974,"Yes, but as I understand it, under Massachusetts law ex-felons can never be equated to people who never committed a crime because there's always a prohibition."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,531.974,533.256,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-6270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,577.973,587.27,"Yes, but deference I don't think really... assuming that was the intent, I don't think that gets you where you want to go, because they could defer in either of two ways."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,618.271,619.112,"--I disagree, Your Honor."
1997.97-6270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,647.674,650.686,"There's no room for the Rule of Lenity here, then."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,650.686,654.27,"Well, there's... I do not think--"
1997.97-6270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,654.27,656.323,"Rule of Lenity, I assume, is a compromise rule."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,670.773,683.963,"--I am just saying... I am saying, Your Honor, that there was only one reading that is grammatically correct that the ordinary person who had a pardon that says on it, pardon, you can have all the hunting guns you--"
1997.97-6270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.963,685.092,I thought we're not talking about a pardon.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,686.294,695.22,"--Well, there... if Your Honor please, the issue of some but not all is exactly the same for the pardon as it is for restoration of civil rights."
1997.97-6270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,731.153,736.336,--That's why I couldn't understand why you were running away from the Rule of Lenity that Justice Souter brought up.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,737.678,739.288,"Well, I think it does ultimately."
1997.97-6270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.54,745.642,It says only if you're totally prohibited will this criminal law apply to you.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,749.538,772.263,"--I agree, Your Honor, completely, but I do think the Government's attempt to come up with a different interpretation of the literal interpretation is very strange, this question about there's four verbs in the statute rather than only one; that suddenly changes the whole meaning of the statute; that's why the First Circuit was right; they didn't realize it, but it was because there were four verbs there."
1997.97-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.088,802.954,"May I interrupt just a minute, because the question is, is it not... the question is whether Massachusetts law, which has restored the civil rights, expressly provides that a felon may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms, and does... is it not clear the Massachusetts law does provide that a felon may not possess, transport or ship certain firearms that other people can--"
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,802.954,806.116,There are firearms which Massachusetts law--
1997.97-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.116,807.695,"--Well then, why isn't the plain language against you?"
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,808.756,814.42,"--There is a difference between, there are certain items that are--"
1997.97-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,814.42,822.927,"The question is whether what he cannot ship, transport, or possess is a firearm, and there are certain firearms that he may not ship, transport, possess or receive."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,822.927,825.249,"--Exactly, Your Honor, and if Congress had--"
1997.97-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,825.249,825.75,And other citizens may.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,825.75,826.828,--If Congress had said that--
1997.97-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.828,828.24,But that's what it did say.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,828.24,831.562,"--No, it said... it doesn't say, if there are firearms--"
1997.97-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,831.562,838.606,"No, it says, unless such pardon, restoration... expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess or receive firearms."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,838.606,839.066,--Right.
1997.97-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.066,839.427,And it does.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,839.427,840.088,No.
1997.97-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.088,842.129,His restoration of civil rights is not total.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,847.492,862.082,"I dis... I completely agree that there are firearms that Massachusetts prohibits the ex-felon from having, but I disagree that Massachusetts expressly provides that a felon may not have firearms."
1997.97-6270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.843,865.904,"Well, he may not have those firearms, the ones that he's prohibited from having."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,865.904,877.321,"--That's correct, but when you say candy is prohibited to a child... I expressly provide you can't have candy, you're saying to the child, no candy, no M&M's or whatever."
1997.97-6270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,877.321,892.372,"Mr. Walker, I think I agree with your analysis generally that when a prohibition is expressed without qualification... no candy, no firearms... that means absolutely none, and that's not what we have here in Massachusetts."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,952.784,974.137,"If Your Honor please, the only literal... my position is, the only literal reading produces that result, but as the Court recently said, a literal reading that dramatically separates a statute from its purpose should not be followed that far, and that's in the Lewis case on any enactment in the Assimilated Crimes Act."
1997.97-6270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1017.386,1023.681,"Take the... take that case, because I'd like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's question, which I'm not certain I see the answer to."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,1108.448,1109.707,Because in fact--
1997.97-6270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1109.707,1110.858,That's the policy question.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,1110.858,1119.955,"--Because in fact, Your Honor, restoration of civil rights does not treat... result in treating somebody as if they'd basically never been convicted."
1997.97-6270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1148.085,1169.409,"The Federal statute is saying when these three happen in respect to firearms, any of these three things, the felon is, in effect, put back in the big pool of everybody, but he's not put back in the big pool of everybody if that event, which to a degree at least made him like everybody, is conditioned in a firearmsrelated way."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,1183.287,1185.68,"Well, if Your Honor please, I'm not making myself clear."
1997.97-6270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1294.604,1299.406,"Well, I think you can make sense out of the policy that this statute has to be enforced Nationwide."
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,1330.958,1344.749,"--Well, there... if Congress had said that, if the Congress had said, if there are firearms you can't possess, and we're just not going to make these interstate distinctions in that kind of thing, that would be a sensible policy."
1997.97-6270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1373.439,1374.621,It didn't overrule us.
1997.97-6270,0,37608,owen_s_walker,,1376.774,1379.346,"--Well, thank you, Your Honor."
1997.97-6270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.696,1407.556,"Very well, Mr. Walker."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1409.595,1417.212,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-6270,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1449.252,1460.93,"Well, the fact that there are these differences of opinion may point in the direction of suggesting that the language is ambiguous, and therefore we have to apply the Rule of Lenity."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1460.93,1469.786,"--Well, in our brief we've noted that there are two possible grammatical ways to read this language, but one of them is not what petitioner proposes here."
1997.97-6270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.949,1518.769,"Well, there's a certain incongruity in saying that you're following State law and yet... this person was apparently allowed to possess long guns under State law, and yet he's being prosecuted as a felon in possession."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1518.769,1539.683,"Well, Federal law requires a court to look to the law of the convicting jurisdiction for its purpose, and everyone acknowledges that, but the purpose is to determine whether or not that convicting jurisdiction has continued to give the conviction effect with respect to firearms, and that is the only respect in which Federal law defers to State law in this context."
1997.97-6270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1539.683,1541.515,So you say it's not deference across the board.
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1543.215,1552.612,"That is correct, and it's important to remember that even under petitioner's position there are a variety of contexts in which Federal law would criminalize the possession of a firearm by a felon where a State law would not."
1997.97-6270,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1570.614,1582.433,"Yes, but not for sentencing under the three-strikes-you're-out proposal, because if the Massachusetts convictions don't qualify then he'd be sentenced differently."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1582.433,1594.519,"Well, I think that the fact that this case arises as a 924(e) case dealing with the recidivism sentencing provision, merely serves to emphasize why this reading has to be correct."
1997.97-6270,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1603.766,1619.586,"Well, I think the reading you espoused may be the one that most closely tracks what Congress must have intended, but I'm not certain that the language requires it, and in that posture I ask you again whether we don't have to be concerned about the Rule of Lenity."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1619.586,1630.674,"--Well, I think again the Rule of Lenity can only be used to advocate a position that is consistent with the statutory text, and this statutory text cannot be read to turn on what kind of firearm a felon happens to possess in the present."
1997.97-6270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.037,1651.948,"Well, Mr. Nuechterlein--"
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1693.005,1703.883,"That is correct, and as this Court has repeatedly stated the Rule of Lenity cannot be used to support a reading of a statute that gives rise to implausible results and that would be one of them."
1997.97-6270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1703.883,1704.514,But I think the--
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1732.985,1743.41,The Rule of Lenity would not... could not be used to support a reading of the statute that is either implausible or is grammatically incompatible with the language of the statute.
1997.97-6270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1748.324,1752.646,"Well, I question the plaus... here's the problem that I have with the plausibility."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1805.974,1807.636,I disagree for two reasons.
1997.97-6270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1848.374,1859.141,"Okay, but he would not be barred, in effect, through the use of the Massachusetts scheme as a pitfall, or as a trap for him."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1882.319,1894.377,"Well, Federal law in our view does, in fact, expressly prohibit possession of a firearm by a felon if the convicting jurisdiction has not... or has continued to give effect to his conviction in a manner that relates to firearms."
1997.97-6270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1894.377,1894.968,In any way.
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1894.968,1906.345,"But even in Massachusetts, even if you look only at Massachusetts, then there are two additional circumstances under which the Federal law prohibition will be broader than the State law prohibition under anybody's construction of the statute."
1997.97-6270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.884,1945.971,"But he has to commit a felony, and he would say, well, you know... and in the circumstances of this case I don't feel too sorry for him, because it's just a question of how much of a penalty he gets for a later felony that he committed, but the statute also covers a case where he hasn't committed any later felony, and he's just following the State law which says, you may now possess long guns, and suddenly he's guilty, nonetheless, of a Federal firearms offense."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1945.971,1953.116,"--Justice Scalia, if Congress had wanted simply to track in every respect the State law prohibition it would have been very easy for it to have done that, and it didn't."
1997.97-6270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1985.248,1990.772,"Why wouldn't... I mean, I don't understand what Congress was driving at."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2028.757,2029.107,Right.
1997.97-6270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2029.397,2030.258,So that's a possible reading.
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2076.129,2080.062,--It's important to remember the historical backdrop against which Congress legislated.
1997.97-6270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2119.9,2131.567,"Am I right in understanding that there was a lot of labor lost, if your interpretation is correct, with all the time that the First Circuit spent figuring out if civil rights had been restored?"
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2144.135,2149.378,"Well, the district court had never reached the firearms restriction question, because under binding First Circuit precedent--"
1997.97-6270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2149.378,2153.141,But shouldn't the district court have gone right to that question?
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2153.141,2153.732,--It was--
1997.97-6270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2153.732,2169.214,Why get into this whole hassle about whether civil rights had been restored if the Federal legislation means so long as the State bars you from carrying any gun you don't come out from this category?
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2169.214,2174.305,"--It was because at the time the district court ruled, the First Circuit law was crystal clear."
1997.97-6270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2189.145,2195.199,What do... if my... the question I just asked you... you remember that one?
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2195.199,2195.419,Yes.
1997.97-6270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2195.419,2195.79,All right.
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2244.745,2245.537,There wasn't--
1997.97-6270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2245.537,2253.013,"Was this meant to be a major change in the statute that really would have eradicated half the statute, or was it meant to be some minor thing?"
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2253.013,2253.181,--No.
1997.97-6270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2299.122,2307.659,How many States are there that allow ex-felons free access to guns just like everyone else?
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2307.659,2323.999,"States have 50 different approaches to this problem, and I've... I couldn't give you an exact figure, but I do know that most States do not restore firearms privileges immediately upon release from confinement."
1997.97-6270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.272,2330.974,"You mean, even for embezzlers and bigamists?"
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2330.974,2336.498,--I think most State statutes are phrased in terms of whether or not you've committed a felony.
1997.97-6270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.498,2339.48,"No matter what felony, whether it's a violent crime or not."
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2339.48,2342.584,Some States I think also have fine-tuned this to focus--
1997.97-6270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2342.584,2346.505,Maybe embezzlers have their check-writing privileges restored gradually.
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2380.229,2381.891,"--Justice Ginsburg, there are States that do that."
1997.97-6270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2410.782,2422.65,And in Massachusetts your view is that no ex-felon... the Massachusetts conviction will always stick because there's always a bar on at least some gun possession.
1997.97-6270,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,2422.65,2426.924,Unless the felon were to have that removed under State law processes.
1997.97-6270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.547,2433.489,"Thank you, Mr. Nuechterlein."
1997.97-6270,2,37608,owen_s_walker,,2438.041,2442.666,"May it please the Court, unless the Court has further questions, I have no further argument."
1997.97-6270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2442.666,2451.691,"Just the difference... the difference... the consequence of this, am I right that it was 120 months versus 262 months?"
1997.97-6270,2,37608,owen_s_walker,,2452.853,2466.372,"The maximum would have been 10 years, that's correct, Your Honor, so the add-on because of the fact that he did what... well, because of the court's... circuit's interpretation of this statute was 12 additional years."
1997.97-6270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.575,2471.837,"Thank you, Mr. Walker."
