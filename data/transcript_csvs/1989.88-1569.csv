1989.88-1569,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.927,"We'll hear argument first this afternoon in Number 88-1569, Richard H. Austin v. the Michigan Chamber of Commerce."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,11.828,15.591,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.502,204.496,"Why are labor unions excluded from the scheme, Mr. Caruso?"
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,204.496,204.755,Labor unions--
1989.88-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,204.755,209.599,Do they not pose some of the same dangers that corporate expenditures do?
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,209.599,211.409,"--Justice O'Connor, labor unions are not excluded as such."
1989.88-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.527,288.079,"General Caruso, why is there a greater risk to the political process from an independent political expenditure by a family corporation, closely held corporation, eight family members, and they want to spend the corporation's money for a particular candidate whom they think will favor their business."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,305.91,316.179,"Well, the Court has viewed that political corporations, that corporations are given by state authorities certain benefits by virtue of the corporate form."
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,358.064,358.575,"Well, let me ask this."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,371.034,371.855,"--Yes, that is correct, Justice Kennedy."
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.855,377.569,--And I take it that the state must establish a compelling interest to restrict that speech?
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,377.569,378.651,That is correct.
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,378.651,380.991,And that the means be narrowly tailored.
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,380.991,383.633,"And the means are to be narrowly tailored, that is correct."
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,383.633,384.093,All right.
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,399.962,401.113,"Well, the thing of it is--"
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,401.113,405.328,And it has to be answered in the terms of a compelling interest that is narrowly tailored.
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,405.328,414.952,--The compelling interest is the fact that they have been given certain advantages by the state legislature for other purposes.
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.952,415.473,"Well, that's not an interest."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,415.473,417.393,"Well, it's the fact, the fact--"
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,417.393,421.958,"That's not an interest, that is just a rationale, that's just a rationale for the legislative exercise of power."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,426.91,439.929,"--The evil is the fact that by virtue of the fact that they are incorporated, corporations, they gain an advantage, and they are able to amass great wealth in the economic sphere--"
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.929,444.331,But you have just been put... you've just been put a hypothetical where that is not the case.
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,444.331,446.494,"--Not in the family corporation case, that is true."
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.31,479.654,"But, but... that does not sound to me... that does not sound to me like a compelling interest, and it does not sound to me like scrutiny."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,481.026,498.518,"--That is, the fact is that the evil is a potential corruption of injecting monies that have been generated through the corporate process in the economic sphere to effect an equal... to unequal a playing field in the political arena."
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,556.594,573.147,"As I understand... as I understand this statute, if a candidate Smith has been a member of the Ku Klux Klan, the ACLU cannot take out an advertisement explaining that fact and asking people to vote for Jones."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,578.109,578.73,--The ACLU?
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,579.57,580.371,It is a nonprofit corporation.
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,580.371,582.531,--Nonprofit corporation.
1989.88-1569,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,593.489,607.469,"I find it very hard to see that, the fact that they can make this expenditure through a fund in any way really mitigates the evil, but it certainly does diminish the message."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,611.412,619.186,"--The thing of it is, the segregated fund, they can do this, simply because the money contributed to a segregated fund is money given for political purposes."
1989.88-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,675.453,679.576,"Mr. Caruso, there is some kind of a media exception in the statute."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,693.325,712.726,"--There is a media exception, but that media exception, Justice O'Connor, has to do specifically with news stories, commentaries, editorials, and the regular course of publication and broadcasting."
1989.88-1569,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,717.5,722.153,"If they publish something, they can editorially endorse a candidate."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,722.153,722.734,--That is correct.
1989.88-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.309,749.802,Why doesn't that distort the electoral process?
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,749.802,750.561,Pardon?
1989.88-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.561,752.484,Why doesn't that distort the electoral process?
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,762.378,763.159,"Well, the fact is that--"
1989.88-1569,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.159,771.324,"But here the only evil, as I understand it, is that there will be too much speech on one side of the issue, funded by vast amounts of money."
1989.88-1569,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,774.216,777.128,"--Well, I couldn't put it that quite way."
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1571.238,1583.066,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1652.503,1654.774,Can it communicate the ratings?
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1654.774,1656.704,It cannot.
1989.88-1569,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1663.73,1678.019,"So if one candidate was rated on a scale of one to... or zero to ten, and he was rated at ten and the... his opponent was regulated at one, then that would obviously be interpreted as support if you communicated the rating?"
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1678.019,1681.963,If the purpose was... and I am assuming that the purpose would be to influence the general public.
1989.88-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.458,1722.769,Was this point argued in the court of appeals?
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1722.769,1724.401,"--Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1989.88-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1724.401,1726.122,The equal protection point?
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1726.122,1727.932,The... yes.
1989.88-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1737.278,1739.558,And did the court of appeals pass on equal protection?
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1739.558,1740.059,They did not.
1989.88-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.059,1743.251,Any explanation of why not?
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1743.251,1747.095,Because the court of appeals found for us on the First Amendment--
1989.88-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.095,1748.725,They did not need to reach the equal--
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1748.725,1750.708,--They did not need to go to the equal protection.
1989.88-1569,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1797.088,1809.978,"--But all we ordinarily require to reject an equal protection claim is some sort of rational basis, and isn't it enough that the unions are unincorporated, they don't have the freedom from liability that the corporation has?"
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1809.978,1825.518,"It may be important in your analysis, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case, because Mr. Caruso and the state have argued that the amassing of wealth is the important state interest."
1989.88-1569,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.485,1842.969,"Do they do that through their own funds, or do they set up separate funds for doing that?"
1989.88-1569,1,40040,richard_d_mclellan,,1842.969,1848.653,"In Michigan, unlike the federal law, they use their general union treasury funds for--"
1989.88-1569,2,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2547.781,2550.67,"I have two points to make, and the first--"
1989.88-1569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.67,2551.151,You have three minutes.
1989.88-1569,2,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2551.151,2557.806,"--The first point I would like to make, and that has to do with contributions and independent expenditures, and the difference between the two."
1989.88-1569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2612.013,2612.934,You ought to fix that.
1989.88-1569,2,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2612.934,2613.332,In the state statute you can.
1989.88-1569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.813,2614.374,You ought to fix that.
1989.88-1569,2,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2614.374,2614.934,Pardon?
1989.88-1569,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.934,2616.176,I mean you ought to fix that.
1989.88-1569,2,34272,louis_j_caruso,,2624.4,2635.527,"Well, even the feds, even the Federal Election Commission takes the position that independent expenditures are... should be... is prohibited, and it is a valid prohibition."
1989.88-1569,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2681.109,2685.342,"Thank you, Mr. Caruso."
