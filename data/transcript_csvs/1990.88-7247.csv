1990.88-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.777,"We'll hear argument now in No. 88-7247, Bryan Stuart Lankford v. Idaho."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,11.089,14.121,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.88-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,70.651,82.468,"Ms. Fisher, you say, you intimate that if the prosecution doesn't seek the death penalty under Idaho law, then the death penalty cannot be imposed under Idaho law."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,84.301,88.194,"That is not a correct statement of Idaho law, especially in light of this case."
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,101.113,118.754,"Why would the death penalty... there is an Idaho case that neither side cites, by the way, called State v. Rossi, which didn't involve the death penalty, but it involved a case in which the judge imposed a sentence double that that the State had recommended."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,138.72,143.342,"The major difference, of course, or the critical difference, is that this is a death penalty case in which we--"
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.342,143.893,"Well, why is that critical?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,144.134,151.429,--We go beyond a mere recommendation of sentence into an affirmative pleading that they're not seeking the death penalty.
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,159.426,164.819,--Not insofar as whether you're bound by the recommendation of the prosecution is concerned.
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,178.469,183.223,"Well, State v. Rossi, if it was before the litigation, there's two things."
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.103,247.767,"Suppose what the court had said was, in a third paragraph of that order, and in the event the state does not educe further evidence of aggravating factors, the court will, on its own motion, weigh the aggravating factors disclosed at trial and determine whether or not the death penalty is appropriate."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,249.6,250.258,The court could have done that.
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,251.801,259.264,"So then it's not the question of whether or not the State can in effect waive the death penalty, it's a question of whether or not you had notice."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,259.825,261.067,"--That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,261.067,288.154,"And... in that respect I'm concerned that, unless I misread the record, you indicate nothing in your briefs and nothing in the trial court to indicate that you would have done anything any differently, nor did you express any surprise or make any objection when the penalty was imposed, but correct me if I'm wrong."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,288.154,298.23,"Um... insofar to the first ques... the first portion of that question, yes, things would have been done differently had I known it was a capital proceeding."
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.23,299.802,"Well, has there been any showing of that in this record?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,299.802,318.764,"Your Honor, there has always been argument that I would have treated the case differently because, because there were a number of things that would be relevant, a certain amount of evidence that could have been marshaled in argument that went directly to the aggravating factors, but I didn't know that the aggravating factors were at issue."
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.764,324.19,"Well, you knew those aggravating factors were at issue with reference to the length of the prison sentence."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,335.699,344.964,"There are a number of items that I would have done had I known it was a capital sentencing that I would not have done, and did not do because it was a noncapital sentencing."
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,368.972,378.439,"Well, you're telling us that now, I'm not sure that it's an appropriate argument for us to take into account when you did not make that submission at any point below or in your briefs."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,385.868,395.102,--I... we have always argued that there were things that I would have done... and I have always argued that there were things that I would have done had I known it was a capital case.
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,426.834,432.758,Where did you advise... in the record does it show that you have advised the trial court of that?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,432.758,439.073,--I believe it's in the... there's an excerpt in the J.A. on the postconviction proceeding.
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.073,458.925,"Well, you can return to it later if you wish."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,461.215,468.802,"The argument has been made, certainly, as to specific things that I would have done differently, they have been argued... it has not been argued."
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.529,480.692,I don't see how the calligrapher is one of them.
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,485.144,490.397,It was a nondeath case.
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.169,493.408,As far as that rule of evidence is concerned?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,493.408,496.12,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.603,536.509,"But your objection would have, would have been just as valid whether it was a capital, whether you knew the death sentence was going to be imposed or not, wouldn't it?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,536.509,546.486,"Well, the issue, the issues to which the polygraph had been, had been given were specifically in reference to those issues that arise under the statutory aggravating factors."
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.486,552.731,But... but aren't those aggravating factors relevant to the length of the prison sentence as well?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,552.731,555.232,They are relevant.
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.528,590.497,"And you think we would not have applied that rule simply because the State here had said that it was not going to, going to seek the death penalty?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,590.497,592.778,That's correct.
1990.88-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.636,678.644,"At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, Ms. Fisher, the judge did say that one possible upshot of it would be the death penalty, did he not?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,678.644,686.259,"At the conclusion, after all of the evidence, all of the argument and evidence was heard in the sentencing, there is a reference by the trial judge to ""or death""."
1990.88-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,710.696,723.165,"Don't you think that had you to do it again, and perhaps any lawyer exercising a reasonable judgment in that situation, when the judge said that, it would have alerted them if they hadn't been alerted before?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,723.165,728.567,"--No question that if I had to do it again, I, it would have alerted me."
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,778.349,782.443,"Well, sometimes counsel don't want to mention the most frightening possibility for their case."
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,810.803,826.224,"--Well, there is no question that at trial counsel where they received affirmative notice from the State that they're not seeking death is in a dilemma as to whether or not argue against, set up argument as to the potential of the death penalty."
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.902,843.147,You say there was no reason... under Idaho law there was no reason to believe it was at issue?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,843.147,843.427,That's correct.
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.427,843.968,Why was that?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,849.794,860.319,There has to be... there has to be a distinction between a recommendation... I obviously knew that the court was not bound by the recommendation of the State.
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,941.404,950.709,"Well, there might not have been a reason to think that a judge would normally do that, but you think there was no reason to think that it could be done in law?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,967.872,977.759,"Well, certainly... you know, my thoughts are not in the record, but I never contemplated the possibility that the judge could in fact impose the death penalty at--"
1990.88-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.759,978.65,The legal possibility.
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,978.65,979.221,--That's correct.
1990.88-7247,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,979.221,984.617,Did Osborn 2 advert specifically to Gibson?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,984.617,986.226,"No, it did not."
1990.88-7247,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,998.365,1001.908,"I take it that outline was not the holding of the case in Gibson, however?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1001.908,1007.481,"Well, they had a number of holdings because there were a number of issues."
1990.88-7247,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1011.795,1018.95,"Ms. Fisher, when was the first time that the judge made it known that death was still in the case?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1025.023,1031.509,"Assuming that you accept the reference at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing as such notice, that would have been the first time."
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1109.121,1112.463,Did Idaho law permit you to move the trial court to reconsider the sentence?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1112.463,1122.107,"The post... because of the post... the consolidation statute in capital cases, the first opportunity to raise that issue would have been in the postconviction--"
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1122.107,1133.066,You mean at the time he enters a sentence in the trial court you can't ask him to consider whether or not he might withdraw that determination--
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1133.066,1133.467,--The motion--
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1133.467,1136.83,--based on a showing that you were surprised?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1136.83,1143.835,--I... the motion... there is a Rule 35 in which you can move to reduce a sentence.
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1194.75,1197.722,Did you raise it at one of those two points?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1197.722,1199.074,"--Yes, I did, Justice Kennedy."
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1199.074,1200.875,And did you include... at which point?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1201.954,1203.125,"120 days after the affirmance, yes."
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1203.125,1207.988,Did you include in there an affidavit or a showing or an allegation that you had been surprised?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1207.988,1208.469,Yes.
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1208.469,1215.575,And does that contain an enumeration of the things you would have done differently?
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1215.575,1217.655,"I don't believe that it does, Justice Kennedy."
1990.88-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1237.389,1240.812,"Is that motion and those proceedings, are they in that record, in the record?"
1990.88-7247,0,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,1240.812,1247.177,"The... I believe it's a different appeal, because we also appealed that, that ruling."
1990.88-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.162,1254.192,"Very well, Ms. Fisher."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1255.712,1265.569,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.88-7247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1328.831,1330.461,Do you consider--
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1332.694,1336.758,Your Honor--
1990.88-7247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1336.758,1338.468,Yes or no?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1338.468,1341.48,--I believe that it is.
1990.88-7247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1341.48,1348.375,And you believe that if that grew up to be a practice it would be legitimate all over the country if we say so?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1348.375,1356.529,"Your Honor, I believe that the petitioner and the petitioner's counsel are presumed to know the law."
1990.88-7247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1359.522,1364.687,And doesn't the law speak that prosecutors shall tell the truth?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1364.687,1370.28,--Your Honor--
1990.88-7247,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1370.28,1372.681,Or would you like to see it be the law?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1372.681,1388.233,"--Your Honor, I believe the prosecutor gave a recommendation in good conscience to the court that the death penalty was not appropriate; but under Idaho law it's not the prosecutor's job to decide what that ultimate sentence will be."
1990.88-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1418.483,1420.914,"Well, it's something more than that, isn't it?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1455.508,1458.48,"Your Honor, I don't believe it is."
1990.88-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1459.669,1468.715,"So you, you interpret this order as saying that the... could the State have argued for the death penalty after failing to make this file?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1468.715,1477.343,"--Your Honor, I believe the State would be in a position as it approached to change its recommendation."
1990.88-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1477.343,1482.165,Despite noncompliance with the court's order of May 17?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1482.165,1502.641,"Well, Your Honor, I think it's important to recognize that the, the order that the court released in May was as a result of a hearing that was held on April 5; and the counsel has, the petitioner's counsel has argued that this was something that the court pretty much thought up on its own."
1990.88-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1507.764,1514.747,"Well, but whatever its genesis, it's a court order, and each side is ordered to set forth the aggravating or mitigating circumstances, as the case may be."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1524.544,1536.201,"--Your Honor, the way that the Idaho capital punishment law is structured, it is very clear that it is the judge who makes that sentence."
1990.88-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1545.889,1553.304,"Well, suppose the judge said the death penalty is not going to be part of my consideration, then he changes his mind after the arguments."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1554.724,1557.035,"--Well, that's not the case here, Your Honor."
1990.88-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1557.035,1558.958,I know that's not the case.
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1560.317,1564.079,"Well, I think ultimately the--"
1990.88-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1564.079,1570.615,I'm testing whether or not the trial court can take any action which misleads counsel.
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1570.615,1590.44,"--Well, Your Honor, the point is that the court has the ultimate decisionmaking authority on the sentence, and if it were to change its mind and some way give a false signal and then come back and do, do something else, I believe that the counsel would be in a better position to make the argument."
1990.88-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.677,1667.05,That was an opinion of the Supreme Court of Idaho you were quoting from?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1667.05,1671.804,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, that was an actual proceeding where the--"
1990.88-7247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.804,1673.394,"This was an arraignment, wasn't it?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1673.394,1682.951,"--Your Honor, this, this language that I quote comes out of a, this was after conviction, just 5 days after the conviction--"
1990.88-7247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.951,1683.351,In this case.
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1683.351,1684.323,"--Yes, in this case."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.063,1710.055,"Well, was the present counsel for the defendant counsel at that time?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1710.055,1714.497,"--Your Honor, Ms. Fisher was not counsel--"
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1714.497,1715.759,Was she in the room when this happened?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1715.759,1717.77,--She did not enter the case until--
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1717.77,1720.942,Was the record of this colloquy that you describe provided to her at any time?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1720.942,1728.028,"--Your Honor, Ms. Fisher had available to her under court order the services of the trial attorney right up through sentencing--"
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1728.028,1732.109,"So she could have asked him about it and found out by making the appropriate inquiry, but she didn't hear it said herself?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1732.109,1733.01,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.511,1738.414,And that's what you regard as the best example of advance notice?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1738.414,1739.966,"Your Honor, I think the--"
1990.88-7247,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.966,1743.646,"The transcript, there was a transcript of the hearing, and--"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1743.646,1745.309,--That's the transcript of the April 5 hearing.
1990.88-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.309,1745.84,"--I think we have it in the record here, too."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1758.459,1760.552,Your Honor--
1990.88-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.552,1763.264,"Probably should have, if, if there was any doubt about the point."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1763.264,1765.976,--He could have volunteered that information.
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.005,1771.098,"This also was before the order requiring the prosecutor to take a position, wasn't it?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1771.098,1773.229,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1773.229,1773.68,May I ask something?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1785.118,1799.729,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that the evidence showed that the person that actually struck the deadly blow was Mark Lankford, the brother of the petitioner."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.729,1799.909,The brother.
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1807.024,1815.109,"Your Honor, I believe that the judge, judge's findings would have identified that this was a common scheme to commit the murderous act."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.109,1822.636,"No, but my question is can you tell from the judge's findings which person the judge thought actually did the killing?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1822.636,1833.511,"Your Honor, I believe that the judge thought that the person that actually delivered the deadly blow was Mark Lankford, but that the--"
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.511,1833.982,"How do, how do we know that?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1837.676,1838.925,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1838.925,1852.055,"And isn't it a fact that had he had the results of the polygraph examination, which apparently were part of the attempt to work out a plea bargain before this defendant testified at his brother's trial, those would have shown who did the actual killing?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1852.055,1858.36,"--Your Honor, I don't think it was in dispute as to who struck the deadly blow."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1863.475,1869.057,"But there is no... you cannot tell from the judge's findings who did the actual killing, can you?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1869.057,1876.151,"Your Honor, I'd have to go back and read that specifically to see if there's, you know, one comment."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.679,1909.734,"That's right, but on the questions that related to who did the killing and which were the basis for the prosecutor being willing to make a plea bargain, he was truthful on those."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1910.525,1929.86,"Your Honor, where he failed is where he identified that he did not know that these people were going to be killed, and that where he passed was where he identified that his brother was the one that actually struck the blow."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1929.86,1937.654,"Which is the fact that was material to the prosecution when it negotiated, when it negotiated the plea bargain that the judge refused."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,1937.654,1945.22,"Your Honor, clearly the prosecutor thought that Bryan Lankford was the less culpable of the two."
1990.88-7247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2102.547,2119.437,"What significance, if any, should we put in the language quoted on page 45 of the opposing brief from Gibson which refers to the procedures which they are claiming should have been followed as being mandated in potential death penalty cases?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2119.437,2130.574,"--Justice Souter, I believe that this Court should place no significant, significance to that language because that was not at issue."
1990.88-7247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2130.574,2133.886,"What language we're talking about, please?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2150.83,2153.401,"Your Honor, that was not the issue in the case."
1990.88-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.346,2207.609,"General Echohawk, I don't, I don't understand."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2226.881,2227.452,That's correct.
1990.88-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.452,2234.177,"It doesn't at all say that once the State does make known its intent not to seek the death penalty, the death penalty can't be imposed."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2242.361,2243.263,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.88-7247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2287.314,2303.093,"But just to be clear on the point, what you, what you are saying in effect is that when the court referred to a potential death penalty case it was referring to a case in which at any time capital sentencing was a possibility."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2320.535,2327.619,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that what a judge has to do is examine independently--"
1990.88-7247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2327.619,2328.39,"No, I realize that."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2362.856,2364.127,"--That's what I'm saying, Your Honor."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.371,2390.154,"Well, but counsel, your opponent did that today."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2411.247,2420.734,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the polygraph evidence would have presented an issue for the trial court to consider, but the fact is that she did not offer that proof."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.734,2421.265,"Well, right."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2435.215,2447.293,"Your Honor, I believe that my assertion today is that, that evidence would have made, she has made no showing that the evidence, the outcome would be any different from anything that she could have produced."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.293,2449.984,"Well, it's pretty hard for her to make that showing."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2484.831,2487.971,"Well, Your Honor, I think she was clearly--"
1990.88-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.971,2490.395,I didn't know that we were arguing about whether this was a death case or not.
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2492.524,2513.279,"--Your Honor, I understand that the petitioner's argument is that once the prosecutor made the recommendation, that it became a nondeath case, that the prosecutor could bind the court unless the court came out and made some specific statement that I'm going to ignore what the prosecutor's recommendation is."
1990.88-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.279,2515.079,I didn't understand her brief to say that.
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2536.225,2540.647,"Your Honor, death was in the wind all the way through--"
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.647,2540.787,"No, but even if it hadn't been."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2546.413,2551.525,"--Your Honor, the petitioner knew that the judge--"
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.525,2551.866,Can't you answer my question?
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2559.673,2560.742,--Yes.
1990.88-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.742,2577.073,"General Echohawk, under Idaho law if the judge is debating a sentence, there is no possibility of death, does the defendant ordinarily, is the defendant ordinarily allowed to call a number of mitigating circumstance witnesses?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2577.073,2584.41,"Yes, Your Honor, in all cases, whether it be capital or noncapital, the defense can call mitigation witnesses."
1990.88-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.41,2587.879,"Even in a robbery case, say where the maximum is 20 years?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2587.879,2590.241,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.88-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2590.241,2593.694,"At a sentencing hearing, the defendant can call witnesses?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2593.694,2594.545,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.88-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2594.545,2599.959,"So there was nothing about this hearing, per se, that would indicate that it's a death penalty hearing?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2608.317,2612.878,"I think, Your Honor, it was very clear that this was a capital sentencing."
1990.88-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2612.878,2623.045,"Well, but so far as all the evidence and all of the arguments, those same evidence and same arguments would routinely have been presented in Idaho even if death had not been one of the options?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2623.045,2625.176,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.88-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.413,2786.914,"Before you sit down, General, when was the notice... was the notice given to the court of the, of the sentence that the prosecution was seeking before or after the presentence investigation?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2797.971,2801.424,"Your Honor, I don't recall the date that the presentence investigation was filed."
1990.88-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.085,2813.813,"Well, the order is May 17, at page 22 of the Appendix, and it sets the presentence investigation report to be filed on June 14."
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2813.813,2826.13,"--There was a subsequent order in early September dealing with notice, and the prosecutor actually filed his notice, or, of intent not to seek the death penalty, I believe that was on September 13."
1990.88-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.13,2830.624,"So that was after the presentence investigation was completed and filed, then?"
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2830.624,2834.706,"I think perhaps you have both sides covered, both before and after."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2834.706,2837.247,Let me just ask the same question in another way.
1990.88-7247,1,34407,larry_echohawk,,2851.769,2855.049,"Your Honor, I believe there was an addendum to the presentence investigation that addressed that."
1990.88-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.049,2857.593,"That addressed that cooperation, yeah."
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,2863.158,2864.177,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1990.88-7247,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2936.778,2947.925,"Well, Ms. Fisher, do you think you can just take the case stepping into, as counselor, as, be kind of a tabula rasa, and not be bound by anything that has gone before in the case?"
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,2947.925,2952.339,"Not be bound... no, I do not, Chief Justice."
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.636,2964.388,How did you know that?
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,2964.388,2966.707,--How did I know that?
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.17,2978.947,"And, and it was entered, that order was entered, or that letter... was it a letter or what?"
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,2978.947,2982.769,"No, it was a formal pleading indicating that the State was not recommending the death penalty."
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.769,2988.363,"But that, that was filed because, as a result of this hearing--"
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,2988.363,2991.825,"Well, certainly the hearing--"
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.825,3001.352,"--when the judge, the judge says I don't know whether or not the statute calls for this, and the defense attorney says I don't either, but I'm asking for it anyway."
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3008.735,3010.918,--It's reasonable to infer.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3014.671,3018.324,You just said that that transcript of that hearing was not available to you.
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3018.324,3019.243,--That's correct.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3019.243,3021.536,"Well, did you ask for it?"
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3021.536,3022.307,Yes.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.193,3030.024,You were denied?
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3030.024,3030.314,Denied.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.314,3034.368,And what was the ground for the denial?
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3036.368,3038.441,"That's correct, Justice White."
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3048.769,3049.518,Um hum.
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3053.611,3058.814,He... on October 10 he said we will try to make available to you tapes of the trial.
1990.88-7247,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3076.408,3081.841,"In any case, I take it from what you say that you would, you never did get a tape of the hearing that we're discussing here."
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3081.841,3082.001,No.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.405,3090.418,"Where did we ever get a transcript of that hearing, do you suppose?"
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3090.418,3095.541,The transcript was developed during the postconviction and the appellate process in the Idaho Supreme Court.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.541,3096.532,What do you mean developed?
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3097.824,3098.135,"Well, it was typewritten."
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3098.135,3099.447,--Typewritten from a tape?
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3099.447,3103.007,"I have, I have no idea, Justice White."
1990.88-7247,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3156.068,3162.452,"Well, now, it's not as though anything that was done by the prosecutor or the trial court contradicted the statute."
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3168.897,3178.944,"The court order says, says... well, I suppose I took assurance from the court order and from the resulting notice."
1990.88-7247,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3181.656,3182.856,The court order said what?
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3185.22,3185.669,--That's correct.
1990.88-7247,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.669,3186.138,All right.
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3188.021,3189.43,They ordered the prosecutor to say--
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.43,3193.495,"--They ordered the prosecutor to say, and then the prosecutor filed a pleading in response to that."
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3193.495,3194.296,"--That's correct, Justice White."
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3194.296,3199.368,"So the court never said anything about, about whether the death penalty would be sought or not."
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3199.368,3200.089,That's correct.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3232.031,3238.155,"The... I suppose that judge, had that judge tried a death case before?"
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3238.155,3240.937,These were his first two death cases.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.508,3246.992,He seemed to think that it was sort of a strange request.
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3260.903,3263.951,There have been a number of first degree murder cases.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.605,3315.737,"--Is there something, from something you said before it sounded as though when you get to the penalty phase in a capital case, is there something like a pretrial order entered outlining the issues that are to be tried?"
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3315.737,3317.449,In a death penalty case?
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3317.449,3317.8,Yeah.
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3317.8,3319.032,Not generally.
1990.88-7247,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.745,3325.146,Which order?
1990.88-7247,2,30324,joan_marie_fisher,,3325.146,3329.28,--Only the court order regarding whether the State was seeking the death penalty.
1990.88-7247,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3336.023,3337.685,"Ms. Fisher, could I ask you--"
