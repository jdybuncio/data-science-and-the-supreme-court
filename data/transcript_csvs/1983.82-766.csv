1983.82-766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.997,We will hear arguments first this morning in Secretary of State of Maryland against Joseph Munson Company.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,15.322,17.899,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,123.681,128.806,"Ms. Motz, at some point in your argument are you going to discuss the standing question?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,128.806,130.369,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,133.587,135.537,Whenever you plan to get to it is fine.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,138.129,140.894,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, perhaps I can address it right now."
1983.82-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,213.631,220.893,Do you think the Maryland Court of Appeals' ruling on standing was based on Maryland law or on federal law?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,220.893,223.158,"I believe it was clearly based on federal law, Your Honor."
1983.82-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.158,225.564,They certainly cited mostly federal cases.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,225.564,231.765,"This is the first case in Maryland in which there was ever found any jus tertii standing, the first case."
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,250.692,252.912,May I just ask one other question on standing?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,252.912,253.286,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,253.286,260.566,"If you are right on standing, that there is no jus tertii, whatever you call it, standing, what shall we do with the case?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,260.566,269.469,"Well, Your Honor, I think that it is very, very clear that the question of whether... The real question here is whether there is overbreadth standing."
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.469,273.841,We don't even have to reach that if we agree with on jus tertii standing.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,273.841,286.571,"Well, I believe you do because it seems to me that whether or not there is jus tertii standing the Respondent here could make an overbreadth challenge separate and apart from any jus tertii standing."
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.696,326.944,"So, really there is no difference in your view between the standing issue and the merits issue on the overbreadth question?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,326.944,332.441,"It took us a long time to get there, Justice Stevens, but that is, in fact, our position now, yes, sir."
1983.82-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.426,578.529,"Ms. Motz, may I ask you whether it is your position now that there are... Are there any limits in your view on the circumstances in which the exemption is available to a charity?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,578.529,579.842,"--Yes, ma'am."
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,649.343,655.434,"May I ask what that means, effectively prevent from raising contributions?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,661.351,664.228,I think that the practice has been they would raise less money.
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,667.352,675.235,As long as they can show that by exceeding the limit they would raise an extra dollar than if they didn't have the 25 percent they would be exempt.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,675.235,684.013,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I am not sure I would go that far, but the Secretary has been liberal in granting the exemptions and if a charity comes in with a showing--"
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.013,688.311,How many of these exemptions were granted before this lawsuit was filed?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,688.311,693.685,--There were 14 organizations that requested exemption and 13 of those were granted.
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.685,696.15,How many before this lawsuit was filed?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,696.15,700.368,Before this lawsuit... The lawsuit was filed in 1978.
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,702.303,705.036,So those are all post-litigation exemptions?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,705.036,706.975,Post the beginning of this litigation.
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,706.975,707.396,Yes.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,707.396,717.783,"The statute was not enacted until 1976, so the regulations, in fact, were not promulgated until February of '78."
1983.82-766,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,726.639,732.559,Do you feel the regulations are consistent with the statute as interpreted by your highest court?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,732.559,734.493,"I do, Your Honor."
1983.82-766,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,776.269,782.219,I take it you are satisfied with so-called narrow interpretation of the statute.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,784.45,785.264,I think that is right.
1983.82-766,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,789.496,794.48,"Ms. Motz, I would like to ask question about the statute also."
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,800.758,804.582,"That is right, Justice Powell."
1983.82-766,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,804.582,808.454,Will you tell me about some of normal administrative expenses.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,814.562,820.684,"Those expenses, those salaries are not touched by the Maryland statute."
1983.82-766,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,820.684,821.526,Nor is rent?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,821.526,822.918,"Nor is rent, no, sir."
1983.82-766,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,822.918,824.603,Nor is travel expense of executives?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,824.603,825.776,"No, sir."
1983.82-766,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,826.446,827.538,What is touched?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,827.538,833.863,--What is touched are what is defined as explicitly fundraising expenses.
1983.82-766,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,841.612,844.345,Could you give some illustration?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,846.096,850.921,--Printing of materials that are mailed is not included.
1983.82-766,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,857.183,858.591,What about radio?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,858.591,866.522,"Radio cost, advertising cost, yes, sir, all of those are limited by the exemption... by the limitation."
1983.82-766,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,866.522,866.869,Yes.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,866.869,880.064,"But, none of what would be thought of as administrative costs, attorney's fees, bookkeeping, the salaries of people that are at headquarters, researchers, none of that is touched by the Maryland statute."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,880.064,887.295,What if the organization just hired a fundraiser and the fundraiser charges a fee or percentage?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,890.406,899.06,"That would be covered, Justice White, except if the fundraiser was doing a feasibility or preplanning study, the professional fundraiser."
1983.82-766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,906.009,908.352,What about expense accounts of the staff?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,908.352,910.426,The staff of the charity--
1983.82-766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,910.426,912.364,The expense accounts.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,912.364,918.424,"--Of the United Fund, for example, the charities' expense accounts, the administrative expense accounts?"
1983.82-766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,918.424,921.594,I am talking about unlimited expense accounts--
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,921.594,922.499,"Sir, if--"
1983.82-766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,922.499,931.917,"--where you raise money for somebody and you don't charge any fee, but your expense accounts run about twice what you raise?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,931.917,937.43,"--I don't think that problem... Well, if all that this person does--"
1983.82-766,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.43,940.304,You evidently don't have some of the sharp ones around here then.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,941.961,946.285,"--Well, I don't suggest, Justice Marshall, that this statute covers every problem."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,961.372,977.052,Let's assume in this case there was a specific case for an exemption which was denied and then this suit is brought.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,989.328,994.499,"Well, in point of fact, we don't have... We don't have any showing here--"
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,994.499,996.043,I know.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1016.8,1029.123,"--Well, Justice White, if we assume further that the group that is denied the waiver is an advocacy organization, then I think we... I don't necessarily think that the Maryland statute can be applied constitutionally."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.277,1052.38,"Well, if you say that... If the statute is applied to some advocacy groups would be unconstitutional I take it you are saying it might be."
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1052.38,1053.503,--I am saying--
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1053.503,1070.902,"If an exemption were forbidden or if there was a prosecution for raising money without a permit of some advocacy organizations, the statute would be unconstitutional, is that right?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1070.902,1072.494,"--I am not sure of that, Your Honor."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.494,1082.456,"Well, you are not... I take it then we should judge the case as though that were the case, unless you want to take a position on it."
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1082.456,1086.021,Let me try to articulate my position on it.
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1097.247,1108.009,"Well, you say that you can imagine some advocacy groups which would... to which the statute could not be applied constitutionally."
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1108.009,1108.54,"No, sir."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.43,1115.353,"All right, I will take that."
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1127.519,1130.175,I think it is arguable that the statute would be unconstitutional.
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.31,1143.183,On your submission then we must assume that in some circumstances the statute could not be constitutionally applied.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1143.183,1151.977,"I think that one can assume here, as one did in Broadrick, that it is possible the statute may have a limited number of impermissible applications."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.977,1153.88,How do you avoid the overbreadth argument then?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1153.88,1168.577,"Well, it seems to me that we avoiding it exactly as it was avoided in Broadrick, that the chance of... The likelihood of that happening is so infinitesimal that we would reserve that case to a case-by-case determination."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.091,1177.527,"Well, did your court agree with your assessment?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1177.527,1180.619,"Well, no, sir, that is why we are here before you."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1180.619,1188.913,"Well, I know, but don't they know more about the possibilities in the great State of Maryland than we do?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1188.913,1201.672,"Well, I think, Justice White, what they did was try to apply the Schaumburg analysis in a mechanistic way and not look at the true and substantial differences between this case and Schaumburg."
1983.82-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.998,1213.481,"You are not suggesting that the author of Broadrick and the author of Schaumburg disagree with one another, are you?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1213.481,1215.496,"Well, I would certainly hope not, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.915,1448.617,May I ask a question that is based on something you said earlier?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1459.864,1461.567,"It is not a... Well, it is a complete exemption, but--"
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.567,1462.394,It is subject to disclosure.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1462.394,1464.114,--there is a disclosure requirement.
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.114,1468.923,"And, I take it the thought behind the disclosure requirement is that would avoid any danger of fraudulent--"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1468.923,1474.419,"Well, it would let the prospective donor know."
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.419,1475.952,--Know what was happening.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1475.952,1476.404,Yes.
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.404,1489.663,"Why would not such a blanket requirement of disclosure, whenever over 25 percent is used for administrative expenses, why would that not adequately serve the State's interest in avoiding fraud?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1489.663,1493.411,"Well, I think there are two reasons, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.104,1518.914,How can you say it doesn't do the trick?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1525.332,1527.926,"--Well, the problem--"
1983.82-766,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.926,1531.111,"And that is your only interest, to avoid the risk of fraud as I understand it."
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1531.111,1539.453,"--Well, the problem here though is it raises... We are telling people we spend 10 percent on fundraising expenses... raises more questions than it answers."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.305,1664.6,Except in the opinion of your court.
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1664.6,1670.177,"The Court of Appeals' decision, Justice White, rests entirely upon conjecture."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.201,1695.305,Do you think the overbreadth argument must always be supported by evidence in the record?
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1695.305,1700.865,"--Sir, if I... No, I don't think it need be supported by evidence in the record."
1983.82-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.08,1723.389,"So, what do we say... If we agree with you, what do we say about the conclusion of the Court of Appeals about the substantiality of the overbreadth?"
1983.82-766,0,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,1730.306,1735.868,"--I think what you say is... While in Schaumburg it was likely, it was almost inevitable."
1983.82-766,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1761.339,1762.181,Very well.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,1766.93,1771.864,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, with the Court's permission:"
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.047,1899.389,"Now, going back to your statement that the states do have the power to regulate, constitutional power--"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,1899.389,1899.951,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1899.951,1911.664,--do you mean by that if the states... at least 50 percent of the money must go to the charitable organization... that the expenses can't exceed 50 percent that might be satisfactory?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,1911.664,1915.302,"No, no, indeed, Mr. Chief--"
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1915.302,1916.02,How about 75--
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,1916.02,1917.829,--Mr. Chief Justice--
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.829,1919.019,--Wait a minute.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,1919.019,1919.627,"--I am sorry, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1919.627,1928.733,"If 25 percent must go to the principal, that expenses can't exceed 75 percent?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,1929.45,1941.773,"Your Honor, respectfully I would suggest that any percentage, any, whether the percentage were 25, 50, 75 or--"
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1941.773,1942.366,Even 90?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,1942.366,1944.022,"--Even 90, yes, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2001.451,2014.058,"Mr. Goldberg, what if a legislature were to say that our statute is not only designed to prevent fraud, but we think it is against public policy for charitable solicitors to make 90 percent of what they take."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2020.114,2021.74,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1983.82-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.814,2030.549,What do you mean by intrusive?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2034.812,2048.884,"Well, no, Your Honor, but if it is, it has to be minimally intrusive of a First Amendment right of freedom of speech."
1983.82-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.82,2138.456,"But, you seem to insist that only fraud can be a permissible motive, legislative motive, for a statute like this."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2155.419,2164.072,"Your Honor, that is so, but I don't think it is applicable in the area in First Amendment and freedom of speech."
1983.82-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2164.072,2180.645,"But, what if a state said that we think literary agents are just getting too much money from authors, so we are going to forbid any literary agent from collecting more than 10 percent by way of a commission from an author's royalties on a book?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2192.516,2197.749,"I think, Your Honor, that it conceivably could be challenged, yes."
1983.82-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2197.749,2201.59,"Well, all statutes conceivably could be challenged."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2201.59,2202.074,Yes.
1983.82-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.074,2203.965,What do you think would be the outcome of the challenges?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2203.965,2229.094,"I frankly, Your Honor, would feel that perhaps the outcome of the statute, I think, would be declared perhaps unconstitutional as an unjustified intrusion into the right to deal freely in business in the absence of any suggestion of fraud or wrongdoing."
1983.82-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.92,2243.695,"If that analysis is true, the cases of holding of regulation on employment agency fees must be wrong if it is just a market place analysis."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2243.695,2264.517,"--Your Honor, I don't stand before this Court and suggest that I would be a sage in suggesting that I would agree or disagree with all past holdings of this Court or any other court and hope that what my position is with respect to a particular issue is the correct one."
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2373.344,2376.624,Maryland wasn't attempting to tell them how to do it.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2395.619,2396.508,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2449.971,2452.111,Let me put this hypothetical to you.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2493.595,2504.9,"--I would suggest to the Court, if I understood your question correctly, and I think it was whether or not if they required them to do it on a weekly basis, would that be a fair statute."
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.9,2508.339,So that the people being solicited would understand where their money was going.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2508.339,2545.306,"I would suggest to the Court, Your Honor, that in that form, in that form, such a disclosure law might be considered overburdensome in that not knowing what funds that they were going to be able to obtain, to expend the monies necessary to effectively publish, I would suppose, in a local paper on a weekly basis might be in itself such a heavy obligation as to be prohibitive."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2578.682,2583.241,"Well, how much publication would you have to give?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2583.241,2588.848,"Your Honor, in the statute in effect--"
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.848,2595.754,I mean on your statement... You have just said it would be perfectly all right to compel them to make a public disclosure.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2597.251,2597.875,"--Yes, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2597.875,2601.888,How often and how detailed?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2601.888,2610.088,"Your Honor I wouldn't suggest that I know the answer to that question, however, I would suggest this."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.801,2628.221,That is not my question.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2637.825,2639.479,"--Yes, I do."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2639.479,2643.57,"Well, how often, once every thousand years?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2643.57,2645.788,"No, sir, absolutely not."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2662.095,2663.936,I thought you said to the public.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2663.936,2664.813,Sir?
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2664.813,2672.824,I thought you said they could be compelled to report to the public not some agency.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2672.824,2683.632,"If they were compelled to report to the public, Your Honor, I would suggest that once a year would not be unreasonable."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2683.632,2686.679,In how much detail?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2692.536,2706.203,"Your Honor, I honestly can't address that to you, because how detailed a statute... a state ultimately comes--"
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2706.203,2709.607,"You really didn't mean what you said, to give it to the public, did you?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2713.557,2714.384,"--No, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2741.42,2742.761,Did you ever look at the New York statute?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2742.761,2743.526,--Sir?
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.526,2745.507,Did you ever look at the New York statute?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2745.507,2746.427,"No, sir, I have not."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.427,2750.678,I don't know how you ever got to the Indiana one.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2752.503,2756.535,"Well, it was forwarded to me, Your Honor, if the Court please."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2756.535,2757.284,Oh !
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2757.284,2772.48,"And, I would take a few moments at this time to further try to distinguish the two statutes."
1983.82-766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2787.458,2792.691,"Mr. Goldberg, what about the exemptions that are allowed under the Maryland statute."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2794.614,2797.378,"--Thank you, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-766,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2882.247,2891.321,"But, you say the Maryland Statute would be fine under Schaumburg if the exemption provision set forth some standards."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2891.321,2970.82,"--Your Honor, I would suggest to this Court that any attempt at curing the overbreadth by way of an exemption provision, which in itself leaves a discretion in the administrative body, that is a secretary of state or other administrative officers, not withstanding that there may be an appeal to a judicial body, is no less offensive, in fact, perhaps more offensive of First Amendment Rights as anything could possible be, because you are talking about leaving discretion... I refer now to Justice Rehnquist's dissent in the Schaumburg case in which he so eloquently pointed out that it is almost academic that if you have a First Amendment right involved you cannot have discretion."
1983.82-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2995.283,2999.498,"Mr. Goldberg, may I ask you a question right there?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,2999.498,3000.546,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.546,3019.506,"If your position is the statute is overbroad and the exemption doesn't help, I take it you are arguing that even if you had applied for an exemption and you had received the exemption and you were able to solicit on behalf of this organization, you would still have this lawsuit that you would be able to maintain?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3019.506,3021.989,"I am sorry, sir, I didn't hear."
1983.82-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.989,3031.361,"You would still make your overbreadth attack on this statute even if you had applied for an exemption and obtained an exemption, is that correct?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3031.361,3032.11,Of course.
1983.82-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3032.11,3035.374,Why didn't you ask for an exemption then?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3035.374,3043.699,"Because, Your Honor, we didn't feel that the statute was constitutional."
1983.82-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3045.275,3047.026,"But, you wouldn't have lost your right to challenge it."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3047.026,3049.978,"--That is very true, Your Honor, but then again--"
1983.82-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3049.978,3051.928,You might have been able to solicit in the meantime.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3051.928,3078.511,"--You don't have to... When a statute is being challenged on First Amendment group you don't have to have a violation of that statute, we have what is generally referred to in these cases a chilling effect which gives us the right to come in and test these statutes."
1983.82-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.294,3111.385,"I understand all that, but it does not explain to me why you wouldn't have applied for the exemption."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3116.93,3124.082,"--Well, Your Honor, we didn't apply for the exemption, because frankly, sir, we didn't feel we had to."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3229.112,3231.047,"Mr. Goldberg, may I ask a question?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3231.047,3231.814,"Certainly, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3231.814,3239.262,The stipulation states that the Fraternal Order of Police that you represent is engaged in advocating causes.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3251.304,3291.149,"Well, Your Honor, the Fraternal Order of Police has evolved in the past two years, I would suppose, in as much as a voice of the police officers in connection with work-related activities that is almost in the form of a union chapter, if you will, expressing the views of the police officers as to working conditions, as to benefits that might be obtainable by them, and in an area that is terribly important--"
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3291.149,3296.035,--So the cause is to improve employment conditions of police?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3296.035,3297.926,"--Not entirely, Your Honor."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3325.636,3328.069,As a public relations program?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3328.069,3329.383,Sir?
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3329.383,3331.006,As a public relations program?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3331.006,3331.899,Public relations program.
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3331.899,3337.756,"How is that put on, by radio, television, newspaper ads, or what?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3337.756,3343.395,"Your Honor, each chapter does it, I would presume, in their own way."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3364.167,3377.862,"Mr. Goldberg, are any of the funds used directly to benefit aged police or police whose disability benefits are not adequate to take care of them?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3377.862,3380.362,"Yes, Your Honor, that is another area."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3380.362,3382.082,Tell me this.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3385.704,3397.699,"As of this time, whether or not the Montgomery County Chapter has filed such report, I cannot answer, because--"
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3397.699,3399.368,I am asking about Maryland law.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3399.368,3399.977,--Sir?
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3399.977,3404.133,Does Maryland law require the filing of any report to anyone?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3404.133,3411.504,"I can tell you that my client, the Respondent, the Munson organization, has not filed such a report."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3411.504,3413.535,But you don't know what Maryland law provides?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3413.535,3416.846,As to the filing of a report?
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3416.846,3417.361,Yes.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3417.361,3418.125,Absolutely I do.
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3420.281,3421.564,I am not talking about this statute.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3448.066,3456.894,"--Well, Your Honor, the answer... I am not saying the answer is no, but what I am saying is that I am not familiar with it."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3456.894,3457.378,You don't know.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3457.378,3467.699,"I do know that under the statute which we have here before us there is a requirement of filing of complete financial information, yes."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3467.699,3469.356,Would you object to that?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3469.356,3471.4,"No, absolutely not."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3471.4,3483.991,"And, do you know, for example, what percentage of the funds raised by your client go to the direct benefit of police who are needy or otherwise need the money?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3483.991,3486.129,"Sir, I am--"
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3486.129,3492.796,I am thinking about the distinction between advocating causes and providing relief for needy policemen.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3492.796,3511.9,"--Your Honor, I don't know what the variation is, what the percentage is between how much goes to the policeman who is incapacitated and how much goes to the public relations or just where the line is or what percentage on what part of the line."
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3511.9,3524.253,"So, you are not able to tell us with any figures or even with any rough estimates as to what extent this organization is a cause advocacy organization?"
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3527.096,3531.893,"Your Honor, I--"
1983.82-766,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3531.893,3534.735,"If you don't know, just say so."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3534.735,3536.717,"--I don't now, sir, and I don't want to speculate, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3536.717,3538.265,Mr. Goldberg--
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3538.265,3538.92,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3538.92,3542.683,--The one thing clear is that your client is not a charitable organization.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3542.683,3545.511,The Munson organization?
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3545.511,3546.057,That is right.
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3546.057,3547.323,"No question about it, sir."
1983.82-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3547.323,3547.931,It is not?
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3547.931,3550.961,"It is not, sir, that is quite correct."
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3644.191,3648.078,"Your time has expired, Mr. Goldberg."
1983.82-766,1,46689,yale_l_goldberg,,3648.078,3648.671,--Thank you.
1983.82-766,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3648.671,3654.326,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Motz?"
1983.82-766,2,21238,diana_gribbon_motz,,3654.326,3655.796,"I have just one point, Your Honor."
