1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.124,We'll hear arguments next in Laird against Nelms and others.
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,10.264,15.003,"Well, thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,70.374,82.281,"I am not so sure that it's important at all that Dalehite case, actually it was not government, private contractors were --"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,82.281,86.384,"That's right, but it had been carried out for suing to a government --"
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,86.384,96.42,That was basic issue that a private contractor was implementing governmental policies and try to keep (Inaudible) from starving?
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,96.42,116.063,"I think, for the most part Mr. Chief Justice, it was assumed in the decision that the government had played a sufficiently close role in entire process including the planning of the export and the transporting and packing of the materials, that, that issue was, at least that level of responsibility was assumed in the opinion."
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,488.435,499.412,I thought that the government had a department where the person who suffered damages of this nature can submit a claim and they would be paid administratively.
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,499.412,501.719,That is right Mr. Justice Douglas.
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,511.954,523.676,"It is at West, where I come from, this sonic thing has been a terrible nuisance and it has injured a lot of properties, people have filed their claims and they get paid."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,523.676,528.384,"Yes, and so in this case, similarly in this case a claim was filed to the Air Force."
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,570.698,578.721,"Mr. Stone, one of the most frequent kinds of damages from the sonic booms is shattered windows. Were there any shattered windows here?"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,578.721,591.005,"According to the investigative report, there were no shattered windows here and I gathered that the primary aspect to damage which respondents have alleged is cracking in the walls."
1971.71-573,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,618.185,624.533,"But in any event, this suit was not filed until after administrative denial --"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,624.533,625.948,That's right.
1971.71-573,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,625.948,627.37,That we saw through the --
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,627.37,635.388,"And the suit was filed under the Tort Claims Act which is by the very terms of the Military Pay Claims Act, mutually exclusive with Tort Act liability."
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,652.248,659.117,"Is there a, like the maximum that's allowed under the Pay Claim Act?"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,659.117,668.154,"Under the Pay Claim Act, there is a $15,000 maximum except in certain -- that can be through certain special procedures can be waived, if necessary."
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,668.154,686.791,"Well, I get that Mr. Stone, are you suggesting that under the Military Pay Claims Act, in that procedure, there has to be a determination in the first instance before an allowance is made to the claimant, that there would be liability under the Tort Claims Act?"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,686.791,690.924,"No, there has to be a determination that there would not be liability under the Tort Claims Act --"
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,690.924,692.103,"Before that maybe, is that right?"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,692.103,693.401,"That's right, that's right."
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,693.401,700.723,And the only inquiry is whether the sonic boom caused the damage to the extent of the damage.
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,700.723,701.513,Exactly.
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,701.513,706.313,Are you suggesting anything in the nature of the election of remedies here?
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,706.313,709.725,"No, we are not suggesting, I don't think anything in that nature."
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,724.478,727.875,"Well, did he have to go first for relief from the military --"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,727.875,729.552,"No, I don't believe he did."
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,733.581,736.81,"Because for no other reason, they are mutually exclusive."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,736.81,738.545,"Mutually exclusive, that's right."
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,738.545,749.065,And is it Congress that has said that no administrative payments where it is covered by the Tort Claims Act or is that regulated --
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,749.065,752.736,"That's Congress who said that, that's 10 U.S.C. 2733 (b)."
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,752.736,761.413,"So that, you argued that Congress thereby itself indicates at least, some kinds of damage that are not covered by the --"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,761.413,763.711,"Tort Claims Act, that's right."
1971.71-573,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,843.671,866.371,"Do I get that, does it (Inaudible) Mr. Stone, if the discretionary exception properly applied, nevertheless, under the Military Pay Claims Act, there might have been -- Air Force satisfied itself there is cause of connection of the sonic boom to this damage."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,868.292,869.772,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1971.71-573,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,891.242,895.002,And if either is not present then you have to go other?
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,895.002,900.018,Then your only remedy is from the Air Force administrative procedure.
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,965.546,972.239,Are there any private aircraft that created sonic boom?
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,972.239,976.459,"To my knowledge Mr. Chief Justice there are not so far, but I don't know the answer to that --"
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.459,979.353,"So, it's military aircraft only."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,979.353,1000.211,"To my knowledge, it is a problem that has been exclusively here in the domain of military aircraft but if that is not in the record, I don't know the answer to that question whether -- I am quite certain that there are private companies which are engaged in building the planes that can fly at more than supersonic speeds but whether they are being used for any other than military purposes, I don't know."
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1000.211,1002.996,"But they are all properly built, there are no governmentally instructed construct a military aircraft?"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1002.996,1005.903,That's right.
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1020.639,1024.487,The Concord (Inaudible)
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1024.487,1029.167,I don't know.
1971.71-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.333,1066.703,Does the Court Claims at cover intentional --
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1066.703,1077.671,"It excludes most intentional wrong, Section 2680 (f), I think, it is, quite explicitly excludes assaults and false imprisonments and intentional --"
1971.71-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.671,1079.84,That's deliberate trespass isn't there a test?
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1079.84,1088.303,"Well, those deliberate torts which are excluded are excluded by name and trespass, deliberate trespass is not excluded."
1971.71-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.303,1089.579,And therefore would fall within wrongful --
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1089.579,1091.218,"Within wrongful, that's right."
1971.71-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1091.218,1109.637,"Well, if you, if the Air Force knows that it's inevitable that there would be sonic booms on this plane, they know that, that it's inevitable sonic boom, they don't know that every sonic boom will cause damage, they know there is a serious risk of it and they do it deliberately."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1117.496,1140.277,"I think that's precisely the kind of situation which gives rise to strict liability for ultrahazardous activity where there is a statistical certainty that at some point if you continue to carry on this activity, some kind of damage will occur, but it is considered inherently a reasonable activity to perform, and liability is considered to be imposed regardless of any fault."
1971.71-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.277,1145.761,But doesn't it get close to being intentional?
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1145.761,1154.03,"Well, this is a question that's raised in all the commentaries with respect to where the strict liability is an intentional tort."
1971.71-573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1165.032,1177.7,"I think that there is a difference too, where you are talking about an intentional tort, whether you mean, whether the act intending to do the particular act or whether we did it with some sort of bad intent towards the recipient of the circuit."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1177.7,1179.648,"I think, that's right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1971.71-573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1198.814,1200.405,"And was not wrongful, isn't it?"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1200.405,1216.031,And we say not wrongful and this court quite specifically in Dalehite said that activity of this nature was not wrongful and that was not dealing with sonic booms but it was dealing with this broad category which is defined in terms of a relative certainty that some sort of damage will occur.
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1216.031,1220.151,Have you ever been on a horse when one of these sonic booms hits?
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1220.151,1221.723,I have not been Mr. Justice Douglas.
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1225.854,1246.53,"Speaking of what's wrong or not, perhaps that aircrafts fly over horse and people not doing their own business in a peaceful ordinary way, and this thing hits."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1246.53,1248.608,"Mr. Justice Douglas, there are --"
1971.71-573,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1248.608,1252.381,"And the question, is who is to suffer the loss?"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1252.381,1264.808,"There indeed is the question as to who should suffer the loss, in this situation and in many situations in which many governmental activity regardless of finding a fault or wrong causes damage to an individual."
1971.71-573,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1264.808,1265.544,"Well, I suppose your answer is --"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1265.544,1267.966,The Congress has not chosen to --
1971.71-573,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1267.966,1284.45,"Well, I accept your answer would be that if a boom -- everyone of like, if you get thrown off a horse when the boom goes off, you know what caused you, you get thrown off a horse and you are hurt, I suppose, your answer would be that you may not have recovered from the Tort Claims Act which you are likely to get under the Military training."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1284.45,1294.241,"That's exactly right Mr. Justice Brennan, but the Tort Claims Act in very specific terms says that the activity must be wrongful and this Court in Dalehite very explicitly --"
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.241,1302.519,Well this is -- North Carolina has what's called a Uniform Aviation Statute.
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1308.468,1312.469,"Oh, it's -- yeah, I am told that it's not."
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1312.469,1322.107,"You referred to trespass and my impression was, although I don't have the text to this statute, state statute, before me that that's exactly what the state makes this."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1357.22,1363.631,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I don't know the answer to whether North Carolina Law categorizes this as a trespass."
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1363.631,1366.168,We don't have the text of the statute.
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1366.168,1405.023,"We have a reference in our petition to North Carolina General Statute 6314, this is on the footnote on page 26 of the petition and I think that the reason we have not gone into this in detail in North Carolina Law is that the Court of Appeals which held in respondent's favor assumed that the theory of North Carolina law which it was based in its holding of Tort Claims Act liability on was a strict, conventional strict-liability for hazardous activity theory and not a trespass theory."
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1405.023,1409.37,"(Voice Overlap) liability, we were told that it was trespass and there wasn't that kind of a physical kind of trespass and that wasn't that kind of trespass into my case."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1409.37,1414.032,"Oh, excuse me, let me --"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1414.032,1421.25,"Let me answer the question by saying that I don't think -- I think that the kind of trespass, even a trespass would have to be wrongful in some sense."
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1421.25,1425.127,"Well it is wrongful it's by virtue of apartments and trespass, is it not?"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1436.349,1441.95,"I think unless there is some element of thought even though it can be labeled a trespass, it's not necessarily wrongful."
1971.71-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.95,1444.275,"I would say, if there is no damage in that kind of action (Voice Overlap)"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1444.275,1445.498,It's tortious.
1971.71-573,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1451.185,1461.349,"The trespass, I should have thought -- it could at least be argued that a trespass is per se wrongful, it's the invasion in somebody else's real estate."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1461.349,1471.435,"Well, I would suggest that we don't know whether North Carolina Law specifically hold this on."
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1471.435,1475.143,"I should say, it might be rather important in this case."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1475.143,1475.816,It would be rather importance but it's not.
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1475.816,1479.799,I know it's not this theory on which of the Court of Appeals has rested but --
1971.71-573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1479.799,1484.689,Do you think Congress use the word “wrongful” in the Act?
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1490.705,1520.049,"Oh, quite, and we believe quite certainly that it had a much narrower definition that if had meant something that would give rise to liability under State Law, different words would have been used and the Court said in Dalehite, that different words would have been used and the Court said in Dalehite that if “wrongful' had meant simply tortious in the sense of giving rise to liability that there are other models for compensation such as the Maritime Act, for example, which specify that any act which is considered tortious, gives rise to federal liability."
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.049,1547.721,"Mr. Stone, suppose this plane, this was giving off sonic booms or creating, had instead, or at the same time it was doing this booming, lost its power, and fallen right on this house and demolished, Tort Claims Act case?"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1547.721,1567.253,"That I gather has been held in different ways in Circuits that if a falling which is -- a falling which occurs, regardless of fault, I think we would argue, it's still not a compensable necessarily under the Tort Claims Act."
1971.71-573,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1567.253,1579.405,"If it fell out of the sky because of a bomb had been placed on it, and exploded, so the non-negligent falling, you would say that it wasn't covered by the Tort Claims."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1579.405,1585.933,"That's right Mr. Justice White, we'd say that that was not a wrongful, not a wrongful act by a federal employee."
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1585.933,1617.358,"I don't recall the Fourth Circuit case, there was one perhaps 17 or 18 years ago, shortly after Dalehite in which the pilot thought his plane was going to crash and so he put it on automatic control and headed it out to sea and he jumped with a parachute and the automatic pilot wasn't working and the plane circled and landed on a house in Baltimore."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1617.358,1632.801,"I believe Mr. Chief Justice, that that's the Praylou case and indeed that case was decided very shortly after Dalehite, and this Court held that -- this Court denied certiorari in the case."
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1688.636,1694.683,"That strikes me, might be materials that you do see --"
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1694.683,1718.063,"Well, we'd be happy to address ourselves to this question in a supplemental -- I see, I have right at the time and I have not yet gotten to the second question which is whether the Tort Claims Act precludes recovery on the basis of the Section 2680a exemption for discretionary functions."
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.666,1895.446,"Mr. Stone, we will remand your time five minutes and give Mr. Allen five minutes, so you can divide it the way you wish."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1895.446,1919.01,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and I would add again that I don't think Air Force regulations dealing with repayment of claims can confer Tort Claim Act jurisdiction on the Federal Courts in cases which are specifically excluded from jurisdiction by that Act.
1971.71-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.002,1996.541,"Mr. Stone, could the Air Force decide that we will send supersonic planes on wars in a thousand feet, because it would be cheaper."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,2000.173,2019.318,"I don't want to go all that distance of course, I don't have to in this case Mr. Justice Marshall but I suppose if the Air Force could produce important governmental considerations which weighed into its decision to fly supersonic flights, thousand feet over Washington -- at least its face, the discretionary function exemption of the Tort Claims Act would apply."
1971.71-573,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2019.318,2023.106,"My trouble with Dalehite, and other is that, you don't take position."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,2028.633,2029.348,I think we do.
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2068.871,2076.036,"Well, exactly those imply to my brother Marshall's question as I understood it."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,2092.745,2123.712,"In fact that is -- I see what the, if we read the language of 26-88, the provisions of this chapter in section 13-46 (B) which is the Tort Claims Act shall not apply to any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation be valid, or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty."
1971.71-573,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2178.056,2190.217,"Mr. Stone, as I read the respondent's brief, they contend that even though they don't prevail on statutory grounds, they are entitled to remand on Fifth Amendment grounds on United States versus Causby."
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,2196.436,2214.827,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Court of Appeals ordered that the Trial Court was to allow plaintiffs to change their complaint around so as to fit in, unjust taking provision under the Fifth Amendment."
1971.71-573,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2256.546,2259.369,And basically here you would say there was simply no taking whatever --
1971.71-573,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,2259.369,2260.979,No I don't think.
1971.71-573,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2281.43,2284.439,"Very well, Mr. Stone."
1971.71-573,1,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2293.235,2298.925,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1971.71-573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.099,2508.584,Do all of these allegations and damage appeared in the complaint itself?
1971.71-573,1,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2508.584,2511.676,"Yes Sir, they appear in affidavits that were filed."
1971.71-573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.759,2697.225,But are they not limited to cases which are not covered?
1971.71-573,1,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2697.225,2698.594,Sorry.
1971.71-573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.594,2700.243,Are those regulations limited --
1971.71-573,1,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2700.243,2701.522,"No, Sir, no Sir."
1971.71-573,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2701.522,2702.127,They are not.
1971.71-573,1,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2702.127,2704.443,"No, Sir they are not."
1971.71-573,2,32445,judge_powell,,2718.455,2734.764,"The North Carolina statute, it appears on Appendix 2 of your response seems to say that as a matter of state law the landowner owns the space above the land?"
1971.71-573,3,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2734.764,2736.575,Yes Sir.
1971.71-573,4,32445,judge_powell,,2736.575,2753.462,And subject to the right of flight described in 6313 and that flight is described as flight that is not dangerous or injurious to the persons or property beneath.
1971.71-573,5,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2771.875,2772.962,That's right.
1971.71-573,6,32445,judge_powell,,2772.962,2776.619,And doesn't that make this quite different therefore from the Dalehite case.
1971.71-573,7,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2776.619,2778.114,"That's right, that's what Judge Butzner had --"
1971.71-573,8,32445,judge_powell,,2778.114,2780.79,And the matter of state law.
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2780.79,2782.327,That's right.
1971.71-573,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2953.322,2956.699,What's that decision?
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2956.699,2962.01,That's the Praylou case from the first --
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2962.01,2965.775,"That's the case where the plane fell on the house in Baltimore, isn't it?"
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2965.775,2966.935,"No Sir, I don't think that's this case."
1971.71-573,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2970.704,2971.992,You have to have the citation?
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2971.992,2973.891,"Yes, we have a citation."
1971.71-573,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2974.934,2982.993,"In your brief, no doubt, but I can't find -- Page 3 of the brief on opposition?"
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2982.993,2993.987,"It's 208 Federal 2nd cited in our brief on page 10, of our brief."
1971.71-573,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2993.987,2994.38,Thank you.
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2994.38,2995.932,Our brief is a readmission.
1971.71-573,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2995.932,2996.64,"Yes, I have."
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,2998.162,3006.423,Now this court refused certiorari in the Praylou case.
1971.71-573,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3046.278,3049.944,"Was the Praylou case decided before or after the Dalehite case, do you know?"
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,3049.944,3051.381,Afterwards.
1971.71-573,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3051.381,3054.959,"Afterwards, thank you."
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,3054.959,3069.237,"Now, when the Nelms case came before the Fourth Circuit, what was that court supposed to do?"
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3191.033,3193.938,Before you go onto that Mr. Allen.
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,3204.342,3207.205,"I don't think it can do it, sir."
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3209.958,3211.391,Your last statement sounded as though that --
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,3211.391,3213.074,Sorry.
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3213.074,3218.336,Your prior statement sounded as thought that Tort Claims Act had intent on the --
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,3218.336,3219.895,"No, not at all."
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3708.358,3716.58,Mr. Allen let me a put a hypothetical question to you which may or may not shed any light on the problem.
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,3754.944,3776.914,I don't think that the Federal government has any right even for the benefit in war times and any other times to destroy a property and put the burden of all damage on that property only rather than on all the people through taxes letting all the citizens bear it.
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3780.266,3785.735,That would be a highly discretionary governmental function was it not just to shoot --
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,3785.735,3788.849,"Yes Sir, it would."
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3800.635,3808.443,What do you think that exception that about discretionary actions means then?
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,3808.443,3809.379,Well.
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3809.379,3823.806,"That would be the highest order of discretion, would it not if the ground forces were ordered to repel the enemy attack by the use of anti aircraft fire?"
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,3823.806,3842.745,"That's right, it certainly is, but still if they destroy the property of a private person, you have being destroy for public purposes, private property being destroyed for public purposes, without compensation."
1971.71-573,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4005.638,4009.459,Do you happen to have any citations of those two law reviews?
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,4009.459,4013.118,"Well, I have one of them, sir."
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4014.745,4022.046,"If you could supply both of them to the clerk Mr. Allen, if you may supply both to the clerk after the argument if you don't have them at this time."
1971.71-573,9,24871,george_e_allen_sr,,4022.046,4030.311,"Now, the one from Washington State, the only citation, I can give there is the name of the two gentlemen that wrote it."
1971.71-573,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4237.083,4239.286,Thank you Mr. Allen and thank you Mr. Stone.
