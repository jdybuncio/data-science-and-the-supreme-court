2011.10-1399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 10-1399, Roberts v. Sea-Land Services."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,10.656,13.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.443,100.597,It seems to me that -- that the two parties are at extremes and that there is indeed something in the middle.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,131.716,136.184,"Well, because the statute -- in some sense of the word ""award""--"
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.184,143.172,"Yes, a sense that -- that the text would bear, as opposed to the -- to the sense that the other side argues here."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,143.172,157.931,"--I think that the text will not bear that reading, in particular because the payments that you are describing that could be considered an award are described throughout the act as payments ""without an award""."
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.757,180.613,"Where -- well, I wish you would submit the sections of the act that use it that way, that say compensation without an award."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,180.613,186.451,Section 14(a) through (e) refers to compensation payments without an award.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,186.451,187.734,Okay.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,187.734,188.986,Those are the provisions.
2011.10-1399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,195.122,212.334,"And the -- and the critical time, then -- I think, isn't it true that most compensation payments are the -- are as a result of voluntary action by the employer and not a proceeding?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,212.334,213.601,"That is true, yes."
2011.10-1399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,213.601,237.116,"So then in those cases, when the employer says, okay, I will voluntarily make this compensation available, then the measuring -- the -- the pay would be measured by the time the employer makes -- makes the compensation available, right?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,237.116,245.889,"I think not, because the -- the statutory provision says it's the award that is determinative."
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,245.889,246.505,"Well, it's--"
2011.10-1399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,246.505,247.174,But there's no award.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,247.174,248.974,But there can be an award.
2011.10-1399,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,250.709,253.911,"But we have -- what is -- I mean, it can be."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,273.741,283.597,--The employer that wants to lock in this year's maximum rate and not have his liability progress above that simply needs to have an award entered.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.597,284.464,"--No, he doesn't."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,309.732,312.717,"That provision, which -- that clause--"
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.717,313.35,That clause.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,313.35,316.085,"--that separate clause, which is not in this case, because--"
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.085,317.019,I understand.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,321.555,323.522,"--No, I think not."
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.522,323.941,No?
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,323.941,334.547,"The function of that clause is that in permanent total and death cases, because there is an annual escalator provision, whatever your rate is this year going to go up."
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.284,343.219,But only if you have been receiving compensation.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,343.219,344.588,If you -- if--
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.588,344.921,Okay?
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,357.728,361.966,"--I wouldn't say (c) doesn't apply, no."
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.849,364.099,How else would it apply?
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,380.694,399.489,"--Well, the -- the function of that separate clause is for cases in which an award has been entered of death benefits or permanent total disability benefits, and everything up to that point is governed by the maximum that is in effect at the time of that--"
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.489,400.674,"It doesn't say that, counsel."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,425.373,431.111,"--Well, Mr. Roberts did not fall within the currently receiving compensation--"
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.111,432.344,I understand that.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,439.549,440.466,--Okay.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.326,458.011,It doesn't say that.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,475.356,487.447,--I can certainly see that those terms would appear to apply to that situation in which the employer is paying compensation for death or for permanent total disability.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.784,494.001,I don't think it affects your case.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,497.219,497.653,Yes.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.286,529.024,"But if the employer has been paying voluntarily, you don't penalize the employee for not having an award, right?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,534.028,536.528,"He certainly is not in the same position, no."
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,536.528,550.638,"Counsel, would Justice Scalia's reading in your judgment -- accept his proposition that those currently receiving voluntary payments from the employer fall under subsection (c)."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,560.076,560.761,"Yes, it would."
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,560.761,562.478,And that's why his reading--
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,562.478,565.713,And that is precisely the function of that clause.
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,565.713,571.967,--The function of (b) is to set a maximum that will control all payments present and future.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,571.967,574.069,"Yes, yes, definitely."
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,574.069,579.057,"And so if you read it the way he does, that maximum would change each year."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,579.057,580.39,Yes.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.009,589.496,I don't understand why that's so only for employment -- for employer payments and not the case for awards.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,595.95,597.001,--They do.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.303,603.005,"Okay, so then my reading makes perfect sense."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,603.005,606.04,"Yes, your reading does make perfect sense."
2011.10-1399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,626.371,653.605,"When -- one of the arguments on the other side that I thought made some sense was the idea that you should focus on a particular point in time when you are figuring out what the amount of the award is going to be; that it doesn't make -- that it's at least odd to say, well, we're going to calculate how much you're entitled to at this point, but in terms of the applicable maximum we are going to wait however long it takes and calculate that as of this point."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,657.823,661.877,"Marginally more sense, perhaps so."
2011.10-1399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,673.352,682.04,"So if we think -- if we think the statute -- in other words, your argument, your response is that the statute is unambiguous and it can't be read in a more sensical way."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,682.04,682.557,--Yes.
2011.10-1399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,683.49,683.906,Okay.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,683.906,690.06,"Yes, and that each use of the term ""award"", contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view, is consistent with that."
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,702.368,704.819,"You don't really have to establish that, do you?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,714.859,715.642,That is exactly true.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.642,722.631,"You don't have to show that it's used consistently throughout, only that it's never used to mean entitlement to compensation."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,722.631,724.431,That is exactly correct.
2011.10-1399,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,724.431,732.154,"Are you conceding in answer to these questions that your reading doesn't really make any sense, that's just what Congress -- that's what Congress did?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,732.154,734.423,"No, I hope I am not conceding that."
2011.10-1399,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,734.423,735.973,"Well, what sense does it make?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,763.858,767.227,I would say they certainly are not identically situated.
2011.10-1399,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,769.429,771.612,They are identically situated in every respect except one.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,776.6,784.021,--There are serious consequences of the fact that one has an award and the other is being paid only without an award.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.021,790.759,"Counsel, if I understood your response to my prior line of questioning, you deny that they are treated differently."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,815.075,816.058,No.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.058,816.577,No?
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,816.577,817.76,"No, no."
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.936,833.452,I see.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,834.788,835.254,Correct.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.254,835.738,Okay.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,835.738,836.788,And temporary total.
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,841.858,847.679,Would you then go back -- I did have the same question Justice Alito asked and I would like to hear the answer.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,889.089,889.706,Yes.
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,889.706,898.862,"But the maximum that it could be is figured out as of January 1, 1998, when he finishes a proceeding."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,916.906,917.708,Okay.
2011.10-1399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,935.301,940.472,But I thought Congress wanted the system to operate so that people just did it voluntarily without an award.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,940.472,955.814,"Well, they want that to happen as often as possible, but the employer has the right in any case to file a notice with the Department of Labor saying, we do not believe the claimant is entitled to compensation."
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.814,957.416,"Counsel, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,979.097,983.567,"I don't think it's stupid, but yes, my basic argument is--"
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.567,998.843,You think it is not stupid because you think it is a good idea to give a lot of work to the Department of Labor and that all the employers are going to do this voluntarily and there will never be a problem with it; all should be encouraged to go and get a certificate from the Department of Labor.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1011.851,1015.955,"--""Newly awarded compensation"" are the critical words."
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.955,1017.022,Where exactly?
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1019.507,1020.674,"In (c), yes, 6(c)."
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1020.674,1023.859,"You just told me that just this had to do with permanent or total disability, and this is far--"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1023.859,1024.111,No.
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1037.118,1040.67,--Why don't they both?
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1104.28,1106.882,"For permanent total disability and death, yes."
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1106.882,1107.615,Right.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1114.718,1117.503,"No, the -- the clause--"
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.503,1118.855,The whole thing.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1130.477,1141.284,"--Well, that's certainly -- no one has put forward that construction, and that would mean that there is no maximum applicable to other categories of disability, like Mr. Roberts's disability."
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1141.284,1143.553,"Oh, yes."
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1149.474,1158.396,"Counsel, so what happens to your argument if we disagree with you that employers have a way to seek a compensation order?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1187.665,1197.855,"I think -- actually my experience, my universal experience with this statute, is that that is not a realistic view of what claimant's behavior is."
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1210.246,1211.015,That's not my question.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1218.619,1219.22,--Yes.
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1219.22,1221.103,--by seeking an award.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1221.103,1221.637,Yes.
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1221.637,1234.646,"If I disagree with you that the Act doesn't provide for that and neither do the regulations, that only employees can seek awards, what happens to your argument?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1234.646,1243.502,"Oh, I think -- well -- I have trouble accepting that hypothetical situation, because--"
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1243.502,1245.669,"As I've studied it, I think that's the case."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1264.582,1265.199,--Nothing.
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1270.569,1271.286,By stopping payment.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1271.286,1272.186,Yes.
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1272.186,1274.605,So that destroys the whole voluntary payment aspect.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1274.605,1277.323,"Well, they wouldn't -- indeed, they wouldn't have to stop payment."
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1283.311,1285.996,That's an odd statute.
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1285.996,1287.198,--I see.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1331.394,1332.027,Yes.
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1332.027,1332.827,That's the argument?
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1332.827,1333.444,"Yes, it is."
2011.10-1399,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1333.444,1336.012,"Like Abbott and Costello, I don't know what I'm talking about."
2011.10-1399,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1340.666,1342.65,"Mr. Gillelan, could I just--"
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.65,1346.569,"Counsel, could I ask you about another inconsistency in this section?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1384.861,1385.628,No.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.282,1392.848,"No, they haven't gotten an award yet."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1403.323,1409.477,"--Well, they are covered by it, but before we know which year's maximum applies, an award--"
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1409.477,1413.096,"Oh, that's right, but they -- but it doesn't take effect--"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1413.096,1413.979,--That's correct.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.979,1414.598,--during that year.
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1414.598,1415.298,That's correct.
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.298,1416.364,"Well, does that make any sense?"
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1416.364,1418.166,Yes--
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.166,1418.916,"No, it doesn't."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1421.368,1432.592,--I think it does because it encourages the employer to have an award entered so that it will have the benefit of the current maximum rate and not next year's or the year's after or the year's after that.
2011.10-1399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1432.592,1433.009,All right--
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.009,1433.875,That's not a serious--
2011.10-1399,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1433.875,1435.377,Go ahead.
2011.10-1399,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1438.413,1451.471,"--I think the way the argument has gone so far is that we've all been saying this can't make sense, and you have been saying, as you have every right to say, yes, but this is what the statute says based on the ""newly awarded"" language."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1517.346,1520.817,I may have missed what the third of those was.

2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.923,1616.629,"--Well, you're -- you're making your case harder than it has to be, it seems to me, by saying that it always means an award of compensation by the agency."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1640.744,1644.029,"No doubt it is, yes."
2011.10-1399,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.891,1671.365,"Oh, I think that's true, but only because of the earlier portion of 6(c) which -- which covers all other payments that are not by virtue of an award, receiving compensation."
2011.10-1399,0,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,1671.365,1671.748,Yes.

2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.406,1710.856,Your -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-1399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1710.856,1720.645,"So if you're walking down the street, you're on a business enterprise, they haven't shoveled the snow, you slip and fall and you're hurt, you go home and say: Good news, I've been awarded damages?"
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1720.645,1733.285,"The statute provides for the award of damages, and I think this is -- this -- the key to this, understanding how this scheme works, is understanding section 914 and section 913."
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.821,1737.839,We're not talking about how the scheme works.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1747.362,1749.195,It's absolutely not up to you--
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.195,1749.595,Okay.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1749.595,1749.962,"--to rewrite the statute, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.962,1757.801,"So what we're talking about is whether ""awarded"" in that provision can bear the meaning that you want to give it."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1781.016,1782.316,I think it's--
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.316,1784.385,I am entitled to it under this statute.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1815.589,1825.795,"--I think Justice Kagan highlighted three provisions where the statute does in fact use the word ""award"" to indicate a statutory entitlement."
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.795,1827.147,Let's go through those.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1827.147,1828.38,"I'd be glad to, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.38,1841.455,"And you -- you show me how -- I agree with you that they don't mean the entry of an award by the agency, but I don't agree with you that the only -- only reading you can give them is entitlement."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1841.455,1849.494,"Well, Justice -- to start with, section 933, which is at page 24a of the government appendix."
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.112,1854.814,933 of the gray brief?
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1854.814,1855.731,Of the gray brief.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.826,1873.426,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1873.843,1874.545,Okay.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.545,1877.33,"The language is important, isn't it."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1877.33,1878.013,Absolutely.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.013,1879.03,What page?
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1879.03,1882.549,Page 24a of the appendix to the gray brief.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.549,1885.334,"Okay, got it."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1885.334,1886.186,Okay.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.186,1887.469,And the language is?
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1887.469,1888.902,So the first sentence says:
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.171,1893.456,Right.

2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.008,1897.308,Right.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1897.308,1898.291,--that aren't important here.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.762,1905.181,"Oh, yes."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1905.514,1909.798,"--the last sentence says: ""For purposes of this subsection"" -- not the purposes of the entire act --"
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.821,1919.488,That's -- that's true.

2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1978.21,1986.399,"Well, I think section 910(h)(1), another provision cited by Justice Kagan, is another example."

2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,1991.652,1991.986,Right.

2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2005.26,2006.879,They make a critical--
2011.10-1399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2006.879,2007.479,What page are you on?
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2007.479,2008.112,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-1399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2049.622,2057.478,And his answer to that was -- his answer to that was that the provision also permits an entry after someone -- of an order after someone dies.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2057.478,2060.014,--That's his answer on some of the other provisions--
2011.10-1399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2060.014,2062.564,So it's -- the incongruity is taken care of by the act directly.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2062.564,2062.966,--Right.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2079.958,2082.427,What -- what does
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2087.729,2089.897,--There was an old maximum.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2092.48,2092.849,Right.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2092.849,2093.782,Okay.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.515,2095.582,Aren't you entitled to get the maximum?
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2095.967,2096.651,--Yes.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.726,2112.226,I got you.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2112.226,2119.832,"For everyone else who was already at the maximum, they got a new, statutorily-created time of injury, which was itself significant that Congress went -- used that route."

2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2123.084,2125.32,--It doesn't make sense under Petitioner's reading.
2011.10-1399,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.403,2127.636,"Yes, yes."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2127.636,2128.17,Okay?
2011.10-1399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.932,2174.651,But you're doing that -- you're doing that without an award.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2174.651,2175.586,Correct.
2011.10-1399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2175.586,2181.054,So how can you say what the employer pays should be considered an award if it's not an award?
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2181.054,2187.025,"Because if you don't consider that, then the -- the statutory provision is impossible to apply."
2011.10-1399,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2199.348,2201.682,"Well, then we're back -- we're back into (b) overrides (a)."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2209.371,2210.504,"--No, I'm saying that--"
2011.10-1399,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2210.504,2212.04,Because I agree with the Chief Justice.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2216.81,2224.281,"--That use of ""award"" clearly means compensation order, and I'm not here to suggest that the -- that the statute never uses the word award to mean compensation order."
2011.10-1399,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2230.302,2231.035,"Oh, I see."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2231.035,2235.522,"--has to start payments in 14 days, and he has to know what statutory maximum applies."
2011.10-1399,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2245.211,2247.33,And in what percentage of the cases are we in that world?
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2247.33,2253.484,"--It's a -- in a substantial majority of cases no claim is ever filed, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-1399,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2275.997,2285.019,"But your reading doesn't encourage employers to pay, because they can stop -- just by saying they contest, right?"
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2285.019,2286.388,Absolutely.
2011.10-1399,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2288.571,2292.942,So -- so your reading leads I think to protraction.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2308.551,2309.92,Newly awarded compensation.
2011.10-1399,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2309.92,2326.663,"--You can say, well, that means in the case of the employer who pays promptly, pays immediately and continues to pay voluntarily, that the compensation is required when the employer starts paying voluntarily."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2375.713,2382.749,It's again a reading that hasn't been advanced in this case but I understand Your Honor's question and Your Honor's point.
2011.10-1399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2405.632,2407.65,"But those aren't going to be the typical cases, I think."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2429.063,2435.801,"--Well, the -- the employer will need to protect itself by writing that check unless it's going to controvert liability."
2011.10-1399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2454.179,2457.13,I -- I understand the amounts at issue here.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2467.236,2467.836,"Well, the--"
2011.10-1399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2467.836,2470.372,"I don't know; maybe you don't have statistics, on an average."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2470.372,2473.24,"--Well, I can give you this case as an -- as an illustration."
2011.10-1399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2500.374,2504.378,"The consequence -- I mean, there is a time value of money, too."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2513.467,2514.517,"--Well, that's -- that's right."
2011.10-1399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2514.517,2516.919,"It's reasonable for an employer to say, okay, if you want to wait, I'll wait."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2516.919,2517.803,That's right.
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2540.868,2549.807,"What happens, just for my technical knowledge here, the -- the employee suffers partial disability on February 1."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2578.494,2582.611,"Well, he needs to provide -- he needs to make a payment within 14 days."
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.611,2582.995,That's right.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2584.997,2585.713,Right.
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2585.713,2587.682,And the wage could have changed in those few weeks.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2587.682,2588.149,It's from the--
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2588.149,2592.253,"The first week he didn't get the notice, then the second week he did get the notice."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2594.453,2596.538,--From when the disability commenced.
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2596.538,2597.088,All right.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2597.088,2598.407,But you're not--
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2598.407,2604.394,"Then we can't -- we cannot read this thing ""award"" to mean award by the employer."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2616.869,2618.652,"--That is our submission, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2618.652,2622.438,"And the tough thing is saying, well, that that's an award."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2624.338,2628.092,"Well, as we've -- as I was discussing earlier we -- sometimes do awards that way."
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2628.092,2636.532,"And what you pointed to in the statute is you pointed to some situations which say we have situation 3 and 4, and they are not present here."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2640.9,2641.784,I think--
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2641.784,2642.284,All right.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2642.719,2643.186,--Right.
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2646.471,2653.875,"--You don't have another example of a -- of a situation where award did mean -- so you are saying there are some others where award doesn't mean, okay."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2653.875,2654.975,"--Well, I think there are--"
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2654.975,2671.837,"But is there anything -- what is the most analogous thing you can find anywhere where award has referred to the time that a person became entitled to a thing, prior to the time anyone was -- became obliged to give him some money?"
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2671.837,2672.52,"--Well, I think--"
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2672.52,2676.371,Even if that time first was the period for -- way for calculating the money?
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2676.371,2679.24,--I think 910(h)(1) is that example--
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2679.24,2679.723,910(h)(1).
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2679.723,2681.958,--And I hesitate to go back into the weeds of that provision.
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.958,2682.325,"No, no, don't do it again."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2684.227,2692.416,"But the first sentence says -- it talks about those who were entitled to total permanent disability or death, which commenced, so it talks about commencement of entitlement."
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2692.416,2693.933,It says awarded was awarded compensation.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2693.933,2695.535,And then later it uses awarded compensation.
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.818,2698.487,"Yes, okay."
2011.10-1399,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2698.487,2714.163,"Your brief -- your brief seem to use the newly awarded compensation, your meaning of it, at the time of injury, at the time of disability, the time of entitlement to compensation; and it seems to use those terms interchangeably."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2717.698,2718.165,--Okay.
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2750.003,2750.953,"I mean, you can do it."
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2756.54,2758.192,"--That's -- that's correct, Justice -- Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1399,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2759.142,2760.394,And it's the statute that is doing the awarding.
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2760.394,2774.452,"--To make his -- I think Petitioner has developed kind of a procedural work-around to the -- the problem created by his interpretation the statute, which is if he needs a compensation order in every case to make the scheme make sense, to get compensation order he needs a claim in every case."
2011.10-1399,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2832.924,2854.939,"And your answer to the problem of an employer protracting, so he doesn't have to pay sooner, he can wait till later is there would be no penalty as long as the employer says I am contesting, but you say the attorneys fees, is that--"
2011.10-1399,1,32447,joseph_r_palmore,,2854.939,2863.545,"Attorneys' fees and interest, both of which are generally applicable remedies that apply to cases that don't implicate the statutory maximum or the statutory minimum."
2011.10-1399,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2886.208,2887.577,Thank you Mr. Palmore.
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,2898.283,2900.301,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-1399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.228,2945.93,I agree with that.
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,2970.711,2978.567,"--I think the party becomes newly awarded at the time that the party becomes disabled, and therefore there is an amount due under the statute."
2011.10-1399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.951,2979.284,"Yes, that's what you say."
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,2982.853,2985.905,"--But it is a usage within the Longshore Act elsewhere, as Mr.--"
2011.10-1399,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2985.905,2992.661,"But, about the business, was newly awarded the tax credit at the time they made the deduction."
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,2992.661,2996.946,"--At the time they became qualified for what the statute required them to do to get the tax credit, yes."
2011.10-1399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3013.205,3015.157,But that's not the way it is used in 914.
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3015.157,3015.724,That's correct.
2011.10-1399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3120.677,3122.979,But how much of a practical problem is this?
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3156.017,3163.754,But if Your Honor thinks about the situation in which the employee is voluntarily receiving from the employer everything that the employee agrees is due.
2011.10-1399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3179.965,3191.44,"Well, no, I mean -- apparently -- I don't know what the employers do, but usually in a situation like this, the employers have good lawyers and they write at the end of the check, you know: This is in full satisfaction of any claims under the -- the whatever."
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3191.44,3196.058,But there is no compensation order until that employee files a claim.
2011.10-1399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3242.289,3246.658,--Give me your example again of award used as -- a penalty?
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3246.658,3247.692,910(8)(1).
2011.10-1399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.692,3249.059,"No, no, no; not from the statute."
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3250.342,3251.761,New Energy Company v Limbach.
2011.10-1399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3270.923,3273.492,"--That wasn't -- you, you gave another example."
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3273.492,3275.26,--Robinson v. Shell oil?
2011.10-1399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.26,3276.544,"No, not a case."
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3276.544,3276.927,Okay.
2011.10-1399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.927,3283.033,Just an example you made up out of your fertile imagination which seemed to me pretty good.
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3286.152,3292.138,"I think it's the employee who was receiving voluntary payments, and everything is proceeding the way the Act intended."
2011.10-1399,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3326.36,3331.763,What percentage of the compensation cases involve the statutory maximum?
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3337.417,3342.988,"In 1972, Congress was told that it would be about 10 percent."
2011.10-1399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3351.927,3354.379,Does the maximum always go up?
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3354.379,3361.283,"Ever since 1972, each year's maximum as calculated by the Secretary of Labor has been higher than the preceding year."
2011.10-1399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3361.283,3363.002,"Theoretically, it can go down."
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3363.002,3363.968,"Theoretically, it can."
2011.10-1399,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3367.354,3370.221,"Mr. Keisler, if I could just go back to this language."
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3387.167,3387.933,"That's right, Your Honor."
2011.10-1399,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3387.933,3389.469,Yes.
2011.10-1399,2,38044,peter_d_keisler,,3408.161,3411.947,"I think the function of ""newly"" in this statute is something different, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1399,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3481.376,3482.859,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1399,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3489.565,3501.289,"Counsel, let's assume an employer pays, continues to pay over a period of time, and the employee needs more money and goes in and says"
2011.10-1399,3,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,3530.29,3536.611,"Only, of course, if the employees' own wages at the time of the injury qualified for that."
2011.10-1399,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3536.611,3538.762,"Assuming it does, that the answer is yes?"
2011.10-1399,3,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,3538.762,3539.313,Yes.
2011.10-1399,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3539.313,3543.699,So what stops an employee from simply doing what I said?
2011.10-1399,3,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,3553.389,3557.959,"Well, I think in that situation, the claimant hasn't triggered that award."
2011.10-1399,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3587.828,3610.392,"If we find any ambiguity in the statute, in the statutory language, would it then make more sense to adopt your meaning or the government's, given all of the factors that the government argues counsels in its favor?"
2011.10-1399,3,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,3610.392,3615.313,--I think each of those arguments is fallacious.
2011.10-1399,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3627.87,3629.055,Assume that--
2011.10-1399,3,30404,joshua_t_gillelan_ii,,3629.055,3639.511,"--Before -- before we lose, that -- the other possible meanings of ""newly awarded"" have got to include what they say the test is."
2011.10-1399,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3639.511,3640.78,"Thank you, counsel."
