1985.84-1974,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.947,We'll hear arguments next in Rose against Clark.
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,59.49,64.454,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1974,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,453.531,474.872,"General Cody, would you say that the instructions here were like those in the case of Connecticut versus Johnson and were conclusive presumptions or were these instructions, in your view, rebuttable presumptions?"
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,474.872,476.504,"Justice, they were very--"
1985.84-1974,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.504,480.828,That had the effect of maybe shifting the burden to the defendant.
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,480.828,485.58,"--Justice, I think very clearly they were rebuttable presumptions."
1985.84-1974,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,520.305,525.167,"Did you tell us, Mr. Attorney General, that there was no objection to the instructions?"
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,525.167,530.561,There were no objections whatsoever to the instructions during the trial.
1985.84-1974,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.584,611.875,"General Cody, can I interrupt you with a factual question?"
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,618.618,619.099,Yes.
1985.84-1974,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.099,620.58,Which one?
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,620.58,631.896,"The first degree murder was the murder of Joy Faulk, the woman who was shot twice in the head and once in the shoulder."
1985.84-1974,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,650.928,662.798,I take it the harmless error inquiry would be whether there was no possibility or no reasonable possibility that the first degree murder conviction might have been a second degree murder conviction?
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,662.798,686.211,"I think the inquiry could go to both, but I believe that it is very clear in this case that the overwhelming... First of all, on the first degree charge, there is no question that premeditation and deliberation and willfulness were all properly charged."
1985.84-1974,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.271,815.067,"Well, to urge... Your first point is that it is subject to harmless error analysis, that assumes there was error."
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,817.768,819.779,"Well, Justice--"
1985.84-1974,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,819.779,827.783,Or do you say there is no problem in the instruction if there is no issue about malice?
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,827.783,830.955,--It is difficult to answer that question.
1985.84-1974,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,850.21,855.032,"So, you are suggesting that the narrow question presented here is the harmless error question?"
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,855.032,858.785,"Yes, that is the only question upon which certiorari--"
1985.84-1974,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,858.785,860.648,Because of the overwhelming evidence?
1985.84-1974,0,44135,w_j_michael_cody,,860.648,863.897,"--Yes, if the Court please."
1985.84-1974,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,907.925,909.978,Very well.
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,915.352,919.045,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1974,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1035.202,1039.165,"Frady was decided before Connecticut against Johnson, wasn't it?"
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1039.165,1040.375,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1974,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1040.375,1046.709,Why do you think it wasn't cited by any of the opinions in Connecticut against Johnson?
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1046.709,1050.292,"That I don't know, Your Honor, but I can say the Court clearly--"
1985.84-1974,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1050.292,1054.454,"If it is controlling here, you would have thought that it would have been cited by one side or the other."
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1054.454,1058.887,"--Clearly, for that reason at least, it hasn't been overruled."
1985.84-1974,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1106.428,1107.918,Does that make them right?
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1107.918,1109.25,Not necessarily.
1985.84-1974,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.763,1236.904,"Mr. Larkin, can I interrupt?"
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1258.326,1261.588,"Well, I would explain that the same way the trial judge explained it here."
1985.84-1974,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.07,1318.497,"If that is true then, maybe the harm of the presumption was that it was prejudicial as to the one that was found guilty of second degree murder."
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1323.349,1333.107,"Well, there was no basis in the other jury instructions for allowing them to reduce the second degree murder verdict to manslaughter which require provocation and passion."
1985.84-1974,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.951,1394.926,Did the Defendant undertake to prove an alibi in any way that he wasn't there and that two other people had committed the crime?
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1394.926,1397.457,"That was his primary defense at trial, yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1974,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1433.421,1447.239,"If the jury in this case had found him guilty of both in first degree, would you make the same argument?"
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1447.239,1447.92,Yes.
1985.84-1974,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1449.691,1451.774,"Well, how can you make a different argument?"
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1472.747,1475.119,The evidence clearly--
1985.84-1974,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1475.119,1476.411,The jury didn't agree.
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1476.411,1478.213,--The jury didn't agree as to Browning.
1985.84-1974,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1490.422,1492.162,"Well, how can it be so clear?"
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1495.715,1501.388,The evidence in this respect as to the threats--
1985.84-1974,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1501.388,1503.158,Didn't the other man have a gun in his pocket?
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1503.158,1504.43,"--Yes, he did."
1985.84-1974,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1504.43,1506.411,"So, it is clear."
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1506.411,1508.193,"And, the gun was not out of his pocket."
1985.84-1974,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.193,1510.605,It is clear he had a gun.
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1510.605,1513.266,And the gun had not just been fired.
1985.84-1974,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1518.249,1529.879,"I am not arguing that it isn't possible for the jury to say it, but to say that it is clear that the jury had to come out this way and no other way."
1985.84-1974,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1531.781,1533.422,Your time is up.
1985.84-1974,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1533.422,1536.614,--Thank you.
1985.84-1974,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.614,1546.792,Mr. Daniel?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1546.792,1551.423,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1658.414,1663.658,Are you now arguing there is some doubt about the guilt of this man?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1668.312,1669.922,"Well, we did, and I wasn't intending to do that."
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1693.536,1696.909,You mean you do not concede the evidence of guilt was overwhelming here?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1696.909,1698.341,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1985.84-1974,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.239,1824.613,"Mr. Daniel, you spoke a moment ago of the psychiatric testimony supporting your client's amnesia defense."
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1847.319,1852.683,"Amnesia in and of itself was not preclude intent to kill, no, I wouldn't argue that."
1985.84-1974,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.543,1868.963,"That wouldn't be amnesia, that would be--"
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1868.963,1869.333,--No.
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1888.285,1895.78,"--Mr. Daniel, did any psychiatrist say that your client lacked the capacity to have malice?"
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1895.78,1901.503,They said that he lacked the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1901.503,1902.284,That is right.
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1910.249,1928.341,"If Your Honor please, under the terms of Tennessee definition of insanity, and Petitioner conceded this in their brief, that we presented what would have been a valid insanity defense under the Tennessee law."
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1928.341,1930.464,With respect to the issue of malice?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1930.464,1938.299,With respect to the issue of whether or not he had the ability to... Malice requires intent.
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1938.299,1938.7,Yes.
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1938.7,1942.783,"And, it requires the ability to formulate and carry out an intent."
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1942.783,1944.493,Are you arguing that he did not intend to kill?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1944.493,1946.995,I am arguing that he did not intend--
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1946.995,1950.676,Then I come back to my original question.
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1955.148,1956.019,--Well--
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1956.019,1959.382,That he was incapable of possessing malice?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1959.382,1967.687,"--What they said was that he... as I pointed out before, that he was incapable of, in their opinion--"
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1967.687,1969.63,Of conforming to the law.
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,1969.63,1970.018,--Of conforming.
1985.84-1974,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2010.927,2015.159,"Mr. Daniel, why don't you argue the case we asked you to argue?"
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2015.159,2018.722,I apologize for getting off on that.
1985.84-1974,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2018.722,2020.452,"I mean, it is your case."
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2020.452,2022.595,I respectfully agree with Your Honor.
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2105.587,2119.618,"Now, on the question of malice, does this record show with respect to the examination by the psychiatrist whether he had any recollection of having threatened to do these killings?"
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2119.618,2122.159,"No, there was no evidence to that."
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2122.159,2128.753,The psychiatrist didn't ask him whether he recalled that when they are dealing with his capacity for recollection?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2128.753,2142.462,"The psychiatrist, as I recall it, in essence said that he had no... He said he would never have done anything like that and had no recollection of ever having threatened or having done anything that would harm."
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2165.386,2167.309,"The presumption, of course, was rebuttable."
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2176.714,2182.988,Do you mean the evidence in the sense that we were--
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2182.988,2187.743,You had no psychiatric evidence to enable you to argue insanity.
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2221.052,2221.683,"--Oh, no."
1985.84-1974,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2229.818,2231.901,So you don't have to rely on insanity?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2231.901,2233.471,Don't have to rely on insanity.
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2391.465,2398.938,Do you suggest that there was not abundant evidence on the malice issue apart from the instruction?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2405.724,2410.466,I say it contains sufficient evidence of malice just as in the case--
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2410.466,2412.677,"First, he had threatened the man."
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2428.339,2430.81,"--Well, first of all, the pursing."
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2445.219,2452.164,"Well, when it is coupled with going ahead of the man and blocking the victim's car, does that tell you something about the purpose of the pursuit?"
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2452.164,2455.627,We don't have any proof of that that is credible proof.
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2455.627,2462.002,"Well, is there not something there on which reasonable people could draw certain inferences?"
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2462.002,2483.793,"Well, if you feel that you are required to accept the state's testimony of a little girl who was the only eye-witness, who the judge said was impeached, and who admitted that she had been told by her father what to say at the trial... her father being the other man we suggested who possibly could have committed the offense... then you can draw certain conclusions."
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2486.345,2490.559,I thought you had earlier conceded that the evidence here was overwhelming.
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2492.92,2499.395,"No, if Your Honor please, you asked me that question earlier, I believe, and my response, as I understand it, was that it was not overwhelming."
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.366,2519.027,"Well, then, let's take your position that it is merely sufficient to support the verdict."
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2528.673,2541.463,"--Well, if Your Honor please, we contended throughout the case that, number one... Our defense was this: Number one, that we do not believe he committed the offense."
1985.84-1974,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2602.342,2604.653,He wouldn't have killed her because he loved her.
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2604.653,2605.835,That is his--
1985.84-1974,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2605.835,2610.068,Did he love the man too that he killed?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2610.068,2618.733,"--No, Judge... Excuse me, Mr. Justice Marshall, I am sure he didn't love the man and I wouldn't say that."
1985.84-1974,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2633.594,2635.474,"But, he didn't testify."
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2635.474,2636.814,"--No, no, he didn't."
1985.84-1974,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.416,2777.959,"May I ask you a question about Tennessee law, Mr. Daniel?"
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2794.908,2797.031,"--No, they follow a harmless error rule."
1985.84-1974,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.031,2800.464,Is it the same test as in Chapman against California?
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2800.464,2802.224,"Basically it is the Chapman test, Your Honor."
1985.84-1974,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2802.224,2817.885,"Does Tennessee in cases generally follow the general rule on inconsistent verdicts of juries, the general law on that subject?"
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2817.885,2820.947,"Generally, I would say so, Your Honor."
1985.84-1974,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2831.663,2833.754,"Mr. Daniel, was the weapon recovered?"
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2833.754,2837.036,The weapon that was used in--
1985.84-1974,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2837.036,2837.807,Yes.
1985.84-1974,2,41254,scott_daniel,,2837.807,2839.978,"--It was recovered, yes, Your Honor."
