2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.578,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-562, United States versus Atlantic Research Corporation."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,9.648,13.37,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,82.654,91.412,"Mr. Hungar, was this Court wrong in your view, it wasn't dispositive of the case in Key Tronic when it said,"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,101.357,121.269,"Your Honor, we agree that Section 107(a)(1) through (4)(b), subparagraph (b) creates a cause of action for private parties, in particular the private parties who are not PRPs, who are therefore other persons other than the PRPs who are the subject of that statutory sentence."
2006.06-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,129.227,137.091,"So you think that when the Court says this, it didn't contemplate that PRPs would be included among private parties?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,137.091,147.107,"Well, in Key Tronic, obviously the Court was facing a different question so I don't think it was trying to in any way authoritatively resolve this issue, as the Court held in Cooper Industries."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,171.342,182.141,"Who were the PRPs, or who are the individuals other than PRPs who are likely to, to avail themselves to the cause of action under Section 7?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,191.167,199.812,"Well, people who are... who are excluded by other provisions of Section 107 from the category of liable parties would be entitled to bring such an action if they don't--"
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,199.812,201.703,But can you give me an idea of generally--
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,201.703,206.006,--A city that cleans up a site and that is not itself--
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,206.006,210.508,"--That's not... you know, that's not a private party within the meaning of the quotation."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,210.508,211.37,"--No, it is, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,211.37,211.8,Pardon?
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,211.8,214.662,"It is, because a city can't sue under subparagraph (a)."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,215.841,220.416,"Well, it's not the United States of America, but we wouldn't normally refer to it as a private party."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,232.293,232.834,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,237.727,238.558,No I realize that.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,239.116,247.223,"But with respect to private parties in particular, any private party who was a so-called innocent person under the statute, who because--"
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,247.223,247.564,--No.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,258.44,281.585,"--I think, Your Honor, that you have to read the statutory sentence in Section 107(a) as a whole, and what it says is that the people in these categories, owners, operators, arrangers and so forth, collect in the conjunctive, shall be liable for... and then under (b), any other necessary cost or response incurred by any other person."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,315.157,317.288,"Well, you know that when they go into court."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,340.694,342.554,"Well, I don't think it's a collateral trial."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,344.647,350.34,"But I mean if that would be the first issue, we'd have to try the innocence of the person who was bringing the action?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,350.34,359.396,"Well, I think the court could obviously structure the issues as it saw fit but certainly that would be one the issues in the case, but again people in that category aren't the only--"
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,359.396,367.171,"Well the... the trouble with having, I mean the trouble with that approach is that whatever you, whatever may be the ultimate effect of subsection (b) is referred to as defenses."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,384.141,390.896,"--Well I don't think so because what the statute says is people, the people who are the subject of the sentence shall be liable to other persons."
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,393.898,394.339,"Well, but you--"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,394.339,396.44,--they are not in the subject; they are in the other category.
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,396.44,402.847,--Well you've glided over the great difficulty which is it doesn't say that people identified in the statute shall be liable to other persons.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,420.385,426.481,"Your Honor, that would certainly be a... a permissible reading of the statute, were it not for the other ""other""."
2006.06-562,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,482.52,490.684,In the years since CERCLA was enacted have there been any real cases in which a party that you would regard as an innocent party has brought a cost recovery action?
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,490.684,491.433,"Yes, sir."
2006.06-562,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,536.493,537.725,What are... what are they?
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,618.167,636.389,"--Your Honor, the sky will fall because under that interpretation PRPs can evade the settlement bar that Congress enacted in order to encourage settlement, and Congress's clear goal in providing a contribution remedy and providing an explicit opportunity for PRPs to sue was to encourage settlement with the Government."
2006.06-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.271,662.817,"How does it work with ""or a State"" because I thought that there was some suggestion that States, they don't want to bother with the Federal legislation, so they'll say you're okay under the State legislation."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,668.631,685.571,"--Well, Your Honor in our view what Section 113(f)(3)(b), the settlement contribution provision, requires is that a State settle, the parties settle with the State and resolve its liability to the State for response costs which is a defined term under CERCLA."
2006.06-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,685.571,691.257,"The States, we have a brief from the States telling us look, we don't want to put our money on that kind of thing."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,698.33,713.92,"Well, Your Honor, every State has a voluntary cleanup program which encourages parties to settle, and under many of those programs there is an opportunity if they do the settlement to required standards to obtain a discharge of liability from the State for response costs."
2006.06-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,717.704,718.052,"Well, they... they can."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,725.178,728.63,"Your Honor, the States already have these programs in existence."
2006.06-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,762.324,769.408,"Well, let's just go back to Justice Breyer's question, because it was I think a major point of the Eighth Circuit."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,809.464,810.834,"--Well, two... two responses."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,827.915,837.381,"Well, what about the... what about the statement in the red brief that... that there is presently in existence a directive that EPA not proceed against any Federal agency?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,837.381,850.752,I... I think what Your Honor is referring to is a directive perhaps that requires EPA to obtain the Attorney General's approval before it will issue a unilateral administrative order.
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,869.832,870.583,"Well, excuse me."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,880.35,880.801,Yes.
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,882.654,882.934,Okay.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,888.458,892.739,If Your Honor means filing a lawsuit the answer is no--
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,892.739,893.05,No.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,893.05,895.623,--because in our view EPA can't sue the United States.
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,924.331,924.781,All right--
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,924.781,925.562,They always do that.
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.562,929.484,"--What if, what if one of the PRPs they so identify is the Department of Defense?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,929.484,929.944,Yes.
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,934.056,936.71,Do they have to get the Attorney General's approval before doing that?
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,939.642,942.023,"--Well, they wouldn't sue them."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,944.924,950.377,"However they initiate, I don't know as a matter of procedure how they initiate enforcement action--"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,950.377,950.678,--They send a letter.
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,950.678,951.379,--It's by that letter--
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,951.379,952.979,They send a letter to all PRPs.
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,952.979,954.792,--Do they need the Attorney General's approval to send the letter?
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,954.792,955.68,I'm not sure.
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,956.802,959.874,"What if, what the Department of Defense says ""nothing doing""?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,961.386,970.934,"--They would... if, if the private parties are willing to settle and pay, and take responsibility for their share of the liabilities, EPA can and will settle with them, regardless."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,970.934,972.834,"Well, what does it do about the Department of Defense?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,972.834,974.266,Well--
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,974.266,979.518,"In my hypo, the Department of Defense says you know, we are not talking with you."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,979.518,986.752,"--Well, number one the Department of Defense has additional legal obligations to deal with hazardous waste even beyond anything EPA can do."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,986.752,987.083,Maybe it does.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,991.466,996.028,"Just, just to be... just to finish my last point, if I may... which can be enforced by citizen suits."
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1026.769,1028.258,And at that point 113 would kick in--
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1028.258,1028.559,--Correct.
2006.06-562,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1028.559,1029.28,--regardless of Defense?
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1029.28,1029.771,Correct.
2006.06-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1043.281,1072.978,"Then why this case... there's a point that was made by the Eighth Circuit, and also in the States' brief on page 24, and that is that the EPA was engaged in settlement negotiations with Atlantic Research, and then after this Court decided Cooper Industries that negotiation terminated."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1072.978,1074.51,"Your Honor, that's not correct."
2006.06-562,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1118.208,1118.789,Can I... can I go back?
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1129.638,1129.909,Yes.
2006.06-562,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1129.909,1139.166,"On their side I have an acorn, which is if they don't win, EPA and DOD just are not going to settle these things because they want to escape us suing them."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1170.324,1171.185,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1171.185,1171.986,--What are they?
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1174.278,1188.866,"Well, the first and foremost way in which the sky is falling is that the court of appeals approach, Respondent's approach would eviscerate the settlement bar, because the whole point of the settlement bar is to give parties an incentive to settle with the Government knowing that they will be protected from contribution claims."
2006.06-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.779,1208.669,But you have to pay the costs.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1212.523,1218.186,"Well, but the claim here is that the parties want to pay the costs and incur voluntary cleanup costs anyway."
2006.06-562,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.1,1222.39,Yes.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1237.569,1240.842,--Maybe I'm not understanding.
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1258.003,1260.424,"Well, how sure are you... how sure are you that it doesn't protect them still?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1260.424,1276.794,"Well, Your Honor, what it applies to is contribution claims, and respondent and Respondent's amici are very clear that they want is not a contribution claim because they recognize that the settlement bar would preclude their claims, but a cost recovery claim, and Section 113(f)(2) says ""contribution"", not ""cost recovery""."
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1277.955,1288.892,"Well, when one responsible party has paid out the cost and is seeking a cost recovery claim from another responsible party, it's not too much of a stretch to call it a contribution claim, is it?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1288.892,1305.064,"--Well, Your Honor, if you want to call what the PRP is seeking a contribution claim, then we submit that it should be governed by the traditional understanding of contribution and by Congress's explicit terms defining what it wants contribution claims to be."
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1329.42,1337.735,"You're not worried about any of that when you're dealing with an innocent party, the person you say can bring this action under 107(4)(b)."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1342.307,1357.948,"No, Your Honor, because the normal rule in American law is that innocent victims get to sue the people who have injured them for recovery, but the defendants, the liable parties, don't get to sue each other except in contribution when it has been made available."
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1357.948,1360.699,"But you don't know, you don't know, that you're dealing with an innocent party until the end of the litigation."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1360.699,1363.601,"Well, that might be true in many circumstances, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1372.527,1379.283,Do you have another example of an innocent party who can bring an action under 107(4)(b) other than a governmental subdivision?
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1379.283,1380.922,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1391.658,1393.751,But they're somehow affected by the hazardous release.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1393.751,1394.352,I'm sorry?
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1394.352,1397.713,But they're still somehow affected by the hazardous release.
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1397.713,1398.254,"Well, yes."
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1404.076,1410.121,"But my point is that subsequent owner, EPA is going to start looking at him as a PRP, not as an innocent party."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1418.386,1420.769,"Well, they could also just resolve it through settlement, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1458.955,1462.007,"The person who settled, wouldn't that person be protected?"
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1470.422,1478.136,"Not if the claim is a cost recovery claim under Section 107, because section... the settlement bar applies only to claims for contribution."
2006.06-562,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1483.349,1493.296,"Yes, but to make the statute work in harmony, to harmonize 107 with 113, it seems to me that would be an altogether reasonable position for a court to take."
2006.06-562,0,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1513.398,1536.634,"Your Honor, I submit if the court were seeking go harmonize Sections 113 and 107 the way to do it would be to give effect to the limitations that Congress imposed on PRP remedies, but not merely the settlement bar, but also the requirement that actions be brought during or following civil actions and settlements, and also the statute of limitations, which the Respondent's theory would also permit them to evade."
2006.06-562,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1538.496,1539.666,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1546.461,1548.742,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.06-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1605.742,1605.942,How?
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1630.779,1637.232,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe the district court as a matter of equity should accord in most cases... now there may be exceptions--"
2006.06-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1637.232,1638.473,"Well, I would worry about the equity."
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1675.837,1678.278,"--No, Your Honor, it would not be barred in that case."
2006.06-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1678.278,1679.8,"Ah, that's what I thought, and that's what he's saying."
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1698.952,1723.709,"Well, Your Honor, in your hypothetical, spending one dollar, there is no question that the court sitting in equity and also as a matter of a contribution counterclaim would be entitled to review the settlement and if that matter is in the matters addressed, if it has been resolved by the Government... and I should point out that in a settlement, settlements are publicly noticed, so parties have an opportunity to object to any settlement which they feel is unfair."
2006.06-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1728.321,1730.995,"Well, but there's nothing, there's nothing unnecessarily unfair."
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1752.847,1753.729,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1762.675,1770.862,"Well, almost by definition a settlement is for less than the full amount that you'd have to spend without the settlement, almost by definition."
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1770.862,1772.132,"Well, that is correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1772.132,1774.916,You don't usually settle for 100 percent of your liability.
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1774.916,1777.868,"That is correct, and I think Congress did write that into the contribution part of the statute--"
2006.06-562,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1777.868,1784.733,So that means that in every settlement agreement you'd have to engage in this analysis to see whether or not it was fair.
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1784.733,1792.009,"--Well, I believe in every settlement agreement the court would have to engage in an analysis as to what matters addressed are for purposes of the settlement."
2006.06-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1792.009,1793.191,How are you going to choose this?
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1855.839,1862.224,"Well, Your Honor, that's absolutely true, because I think one of the principles of fairness is to solidify the settlement agreement."
2006.06-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1862.224,1868.478,"When you say that's absolutely true, you mean absolutely true that you have that choice, or is it--"
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1868.478,1883.138,"I believe that a reviewing court should in each instance... if a district court decides to avoid the settlement, if it says that it's not fair, I believe that would undercut the finality of a settlement so long as it's contained within the matters addressed."
2006.06-562,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1883.138,1893.225,"--All right, so then he's wrong in thinking that the motivating force behind this action is to permit people to get equitable review of prior settlements?"
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1906.125,1909.167,"That is absolutely correct in our case, Your Honor, and I think we've stipulated to that."
2006.06-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1909.167,1922.538,"But to talk about the other polluter or the other in this case, where the other polluter is not someone who is going to settle because it's the Government itself--"
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1922.538,1923.579,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1923.579,1929.102,--So I don't think you're in a position to concede anything one way or another because that's not your case.
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1929.102,1939.056,"That is correct, Your Honor, because in our case, I think as we have made it quite clear, all we are seeking in this case is to recover a proportion of our response costs."
2006.06-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1970.519,1977.625,What about the Government's concern that prenups shouldn't go on unsupervised.
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,1996.826,2001.0,"Your Honor, I believe in most cases there is State involvement."
2006.06-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.607,2046.781,"As you read the statute, you're talking about a PRP, but any other person doesn't have to be a PRP, does it?"
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2046.781,2048.962,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2049.733,2059.456,"You could set up a company that cleans up these sites, right, and go traveling around the country and clean them up and then send people a bill and cite your reading of 1074(b), right?"
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2059.456,2063.989,--107(a)(4)(B) would include both PRPs and what we might call non-PRPs.
2006.06-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2076.699,2081.67,"Well, if we rule in your favor presumably there will be a lot more, right?"
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2081.67,2086.027,PRPs will certainly be able to seek cost recovery under 107(a)(4)(B).
2006.06-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2086.027,2087.234,What about non-PRPs?
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2087.234,2090.168,There are very few non-PRPs.
2006.06-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2233.873,2252.797,"But in... in response to your... going back to your response to Justice Breyer, I take it the... the right under... under 107 was affected to the extent, or at least you would agree that it was affected to the extent that if there is a settlement they are home free and there can't be a 107 action; is that correct?"
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2252.797,2253.478,That is correct.
2006.06-562,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2253.478,2253.768,Okay.
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2256.909,2269.867,"It did, although most of these cases I do believe did not involve settlements, but I think obviously when Congress enacted 113, I think it certainly wanted to encourage settlements in cases where there had been an action brought against a PRP."
2006.06-562,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2304.391,2307.233,--What about the disincentive to settlement?
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2329.076,2339.303,"--Well, Your Honor, I think once again, settling is not a disincentive in the sense that if you do settle, you are deemed... all of your costs are deemed to be consistent with the national contingency plan."
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.051,2405.057,So you say there are two factors which still exert pressure to settle.
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2414.401,2415.904,The second factor is--
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2415.904,2420.106,--you insulate yourself from contribution suits by other people.
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2420.106,2420.856,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.04,2439.999,Do you rely at all on... in 9607(a)(b)?
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2457.4,2458.299,I believe it--
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.299,2460.062,Other necessary costs?
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2460.062,2461.312,"--I believe it does, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.167,2579.578,Now you say this very language that's in 107 now had been interpreted unanimously by the courts?
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2579.578,2580.269,That's correct.
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.269,2589.906,"So that part of your case is that, is to say that it's limited by 113 is to say that there's been an implied repeal."
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2589.906,2590.888,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.888,2592.258,Unless all those cases were wrong.
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2592.258,2593.359,That is absolutely correct.
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2593.359,2598.672,"So it's not just a legislative history point you're making, it's not just a point as to what Congress's expectations were."
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2604.216,2605.908,It would be tantamount to a repeal.
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.908,2621.947,"And if the Government's only strong point is that 113 is meant to coerce settlement, and 113 didn't exist before, then it must be very clear that previously 107 did give them a cause of action."
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2621.947,2622.959,That is absolutely correct.
2006.06-562,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.785,2635.127,No acorns on the other side.
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2635.127,2635.445,--No acorns.
2006.06-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.497,2645.653,May I ask just one question about your position on the meaning of the settlement provision in 113(f)(2)?
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2652.899,2656.172,"No, Your Honor, it's not any other litigation whatsoever."
2006.06-562,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.158,2688.723,"If there were a claim that didn't really technically qualify as contribution, it would not, it would not provide a bar."
2006.06-562,1,37364,owen_t_armstrong_jr,,2688.723,2692.937,"--If it were a CERCLA claim, Your Honor, under 107(a)(4)(b), it would."
2006.06-562,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2708.138,2710.167,"Thanks, Mr. Armstrong."
2006.06-562,2,30429,jay_d_geck,,2717.894,2722.416,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-562,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2822.543,2836.031,"Why wouldn't the States prefer to proceed, to force people to proceed under 113, so that the States would have, you know, a hand in deciding how the cleanup should go?"
2006.06-562,2,30429,jay_d_geck,,2844.827,2850.871,The States recognize that to proceed under settlement puts a near impossible task.
2006.06-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2938.661,2941.381,Is that how it works?
2006.06-562,2,30429,jay_d_geck,,2960.365,2966.69,"--I would rely first on the textual basis, that any person can bring a cost recovery claim."
2006.06-562,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.277,2980.558,"The last sentence of (f)(1), right?"
2006.06-562,2,30429,jay_d_geck,,2980.558,2983.59,The fifth sentence of (f)(1) is what I was referring to.
2006.06-562,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.486,3106.169,"What's the meaning of that last sentence in (f)(1),"
2006.06-562,2,30429,jay_d_geck,,3117.516,3123.84,"Well, it clearly indicates that there is a savings for other contribution rights that may exist under other areas of law."
2006.06-562,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.84,3124.781,State law?
2006.06-562,2,30429,jay_d_geck,,3124.781,3135.909,State law is certainly a possibility there and that would of course be a stronger indicator that you could give a broader reading to contribution protection under (f)(2) and that's what several courts have done.
2006.06-562,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3203.733,3204.845,"Thank you, Mr. Geck."
2006.06-562,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3207.285,3213.49,Mr. Chief Justice:
2006.06-562,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3228.099,3232.423,So the only thing they would need the Attorney General's approval for would be institution of suit?
2006.06-562,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3232.423,3234.654,Or a unilateral administrative order.
2006.06-562,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3234.654,3235.395,Could they institute suit?
2006.06-562,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3235.395,3240.948,"Well, in our view the EPA can't sue the Department of Defense because there would be no justiciable controversy."
2006.06-562,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3254.976,3269.837,"But even if there wasn't, you wouldn't have your principal argument, which is, you know, which is that the reason not to interpret 107 the way your friends on the other side want is that you're going to destroy the settlement provision of 113, which didn't use to exist."
2006.06-562,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3277.603,3290.213,"Your Honor, the point is that the settlement bar under their interpretation is either eviscerated, as Respondents amici argue, or that's the position that they take, that they want to be able to sue for cost recovery and evade the settlement bar."
2006.06-562,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3300.507,3301.749,You're missing my point.
2006.06-562,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3318.27,3328.896,"Your Honor, as I understand the argument it's that there was this unanimous pre-1986 body of law and it was completely clear and perfectly understood that there was this cause of action."
2006.06-562,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3328.896,3330.438,Assume it didn't exist.
2006.06-562,3,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,3345.518,3353.413,"But, Your Honor, the point is it was not clear in 1986 what this language meant and what the extent of the PRP rights were."
2006.06-562,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3486.402,3487.424,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
