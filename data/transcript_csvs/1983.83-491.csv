1983.83-491,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.903,We will hear arguments first this morning in Immigration and Naturalization Service against Lopez-Mendoza.
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,9.652,14.085,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.83-491,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,109.342,109.923,"Mr. Frey, may I ask--"
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,109.923,110.828,--Certainly.
1983.83-491,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,110.828,114.217,"--before you begin, respondent's brief has this statement."
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,154.248,156.888,"Well, I guess I have two things to say about that."
1983.83-491,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,201.246,205.492,"Well, has there been a practice for 60 years of recognizing the exclusionary rule?"
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,205.492,208.21,--That is a point that I intend to address.
1983.83-491,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,215.944,217.005,"No, but has it been a practice at all--"
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,217.005,218.599,"--Well, I am not sure--"
1983.83-491,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,218.599,219.831,--in deportation proceedings?
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,219.831,221.707,--I am not sure how to answer that question.
1983.83-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.174,343.516,What about the situation of the egregious violation that might constitute in and of itself a violation of the due process clause?
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,348.637,358.494,"As to that narrow class of cases, and I believe there are two instances where it has actually found that evidence should be suppressed under a due process rationale."
1983.83-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.928,362.242,--Do you agree with that?
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,366.879,371.019,--I don't believe it has done it... I don't believe it has done it because it thought it constitutionally required it.
1983.83-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.704,378.015,And what is your position?
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,382.091,402.239,"My position, I think, would be that it is not constitutionally required, but it is a very different thing to say that the Board of Immigration Appeals in its discretion should determine what kind of evidence it will receive in its proceedings for the courts to tell the Board of Immigration Appeals what kind of evidence it should receive."
1983.83-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.239,403.023,How about the courts?
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,414.094,420.949,"You are talking about in the context of Fourth Amendment, evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment--"
1983.83-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.949,421.308,Yes.
1983.83-491,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,421.308,421.792,--but egregious violations?
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2038.665,2055.482,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the heart of this case is the question of whether the Fourth Amendment will remain enforceable in the immigration context."
1983.83-491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2152.117,2154.164,How widespread was that?
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2154.164,2158.52,"Well, as explained in greater detail in our brief, the--"
1983.83-491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2158.52,2163.972,"Well, Mr. Frey takes very vigorous issue with what you said in your brief."
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2163.972,2182.603,"--Well, the administrative practice and the judicial history both demonstrate that there was a substantial body of both administrative cases and judicial review cases looking at the Fourth Amendment violation."
1983.83-491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2182.603,2183.964,Are they cited?
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2183.964,2186.105,They are cited in our brief.
1983.83-491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.105,2217.714,"When did the BIA do that, what you just referred to?"
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2217.714,2220.276,--The BIA did that in the early seventies.
1983.83-491,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2309.895,2310.894,"Well, is that bad?"
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2310.894,2314.782,--I am not suggesting that--
1983.83-491,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2314.782,2321.968,If people opt for voluntary deportation when they admit that they have illegally entered the country?
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2321.968,2338.729,"--There is a mechanism set up so that they can opt for voluntary departure, and in that way avoid some of the consequences with regard to being detained while waiting for a hearing, and--"
1983.83-491,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.729,2352.813,"Since you analogize this... you seem to think a deportation proceeding equates to a criminal proceeding, is that voluntary deportation somewhat analogous to a guilty plea in a criminal case?"
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2352.813,2359.844,--It is analogous to a plea bargaining situation.
1983.83-491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.455,2743.548,May I ask a question?
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2769.741,2780.421,"Well, as in the criminal setting, the Bivens actions or civil damage actions do not provide an effective substitute for the rule."
1983.83-491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.423,2799.07,"But the reason... the difference that occurs to me as I listen to your argument is that you have a large number of potential plaintiffs out there in this particular area that you may not have in the other areas, because you are talking about arresting the wrong person basically."
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,2799.07,2815.127,"Well, the problem with regard to the reliance on civil damage actions as a surrogate for the rule in this context is that first of all the nature of the population, which I already mentioned."
1983.83-491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.133,3091.72,"Ms. Heen, in your brief, at Footnote 9 on Page 30, you refer to the fact that patterns of INS conduct described and reported in cases evidence widespread Fourth Amendment violations by immigration officers."
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,3109.349,3112.582,--No.
1983.83-491,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3553.774,3554.667,Such as?
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,3554.667,3560.571,--Such as its area control operations.
1983.83-491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3644.644,3647.191,"May I ask you this question, Ms. Heen?"
1983.83-491,1,36023,mary_l_heen,,3674.787,3709.305,"Well, there may be some slight increase in the number of suppression motions, which may be tied to the increased enforcement activity of the INS at the present time, but in terms of looking at the past history of applying the rule in this context, as mentioned earlier, the leading treatise in the field, going back to its original editions, had stated that it was undisputed that evidence obtained illegally may be suppressed in deportation hearings."
1983.83-491,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4078.219,4081.92,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?"
1983.83-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4081.92,4084.341,Mr. Chief Justice--
1983.83-491,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4084.341,4091.446,"Mr. Frey, before you commence, it may or may not be important, but I am not clear as to what the answer is."
1983.83-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4131.869,4146.035,"--Well, I think the situation is that it is difficult to know in the purely abstract sense whether the exclusionary rule in the air applied in deportation proceedings prior to 1979 or not."
1983.83-491,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4190.155,4203.523,"They really wouldn't have wasted their time deciding Fourth Amendment issues in a case if the evidence was admissible anyway, would they?"
1983.83-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4203.523,4206.989,If it was inadmissible anyway?
1983.83-491,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4206.989,4208.943,You say they actually ruled on Fourth Amendment claims.
1983.83-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4210.662,4216.019,I am not suggesting to the Court that there was a settled principle that the exclusionary rule did not apply.
1983.83-491,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4238.665,4246.803,"But isn't it correct that they cite some cases that say they set up a regular procedure for processing, who had the burden of proof and all that sort of thing."
1983.83-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4246.803,4248.632,I am not aware of that.
1983.83-491,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4296.658,4298.97,Could it be they didn't have lawyers?
1983.83-491,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4298.97,4302.453,"Well, that is an interesting point that I wanted to get to."
1983.83-491,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4501.667,4502.883,"Thank you, counsel."
