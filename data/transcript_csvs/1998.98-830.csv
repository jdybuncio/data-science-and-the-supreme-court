1998.98-830,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.477,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-830, Amoco Production Company v. Southern Ute Indian Tribe."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,60.101,63.912,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-830,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,111.574,120.621,"Mr. Phillips, you already brought up just implicitly in what you said an issue that I was going to ask you to speak to, and I'll ask you now."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,134.169,135.19,"That's correct, Justice Souter."
1998.98-830,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,135.19,142.243,Was the usage at the time such that it would make sense to speak of mining gas?
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,142.243,159.196,"Not typically, although to be honest with you, I wish I could make more of that argument, Justice Souter, but if you look at the 1914 act and its description of dealing with gas and oil, phosphate, and the other minerals that it identifies there, it uses essentially the same language."
1998.98-830,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,159.196,160.005,They used it generically.
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,160.005,162.697,"So while I'd like to take advantage of that particular language, I can't."
1998.98-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.885,209.238,"Well, I mean, as I understand it, you assert the right not only to take out the methane that... the gas that happens to be in the coal when you mine the coal, you assert the right to by whatever means drill a hole and take out just the gas and leave the coal, right?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,209.238,212.471,"Well, I don't have the right to take the coal, you're right, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,214.732,215.193,Right.
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,215.193,224.837,"It's my opponents who claim that they have the right to... that based on their right to the coal, that they in fact can take out all the gas, leave all the coal behind, and that, what is to me--"
1998.98-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,224.837,225.368,What if... what if--
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,225.368,227.649,"--Justice Scalia, is the counterintuitive nature of the argument of the holding below."
1998.98-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.649,234.975,"--there's some water that adheres to the coal as well, I mean, a certain... that is, in its composition."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,242.598,250.636,"There is a fundamental difference between water and coalbed methane, Justice Scalia, both chemically and as a matter of law."
1998.98-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.953,304.159,"Well, what if the coal miner digs into the coal and in the process releases this gas that you say the petitioner owns?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,311.565,316.677,"Well, it's going to depend on the, essentially the State tort law, or the tort law that would be applied to it."
1998.98-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.187,340.103,"But as a practical matter, what would happen to the coal miners who are trying to take out the coal and at the same time releasing gas, if your position is correct?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,340.103,346.487,"--Well, I think if they release the gas and we don't assert any rights to the gas, we have no basis to come in after--"
1998.98-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,346.487,348.508,"Well, let's say you do assert the rights to the gas."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,349.469,349.659,--Right.
1998.98-830,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.739,365.13,It's the--
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,365.13,369.872,--and there is an accommodation then that would be worked out between the coal rights owner and the gas rights owner.
1998.98-830,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,369.872,375.455,--The same accommodation problem arises when oil and gas rights are owned by different parties at different levels.
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,375.455,376.216,Exactly.
1998.98-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,382.982,385.884,"Well, except that the gas doesn't adhere to the oil the way it adheres to the coal."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,404.735,411.25,"Well, the amount that's derived from burning the methane is negligible as a scientific matter, so that's not likely to be particularly important."
1998.98-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.441,430.633,"Right, but--"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,430.633,436.297,--coalbed methane when we know that because it comes out and gets vented as a part of the process of mining the coal.
1998.98-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.297,440.388,"--But that's the point I was making, at least as to the methane that is not in a pocket."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,461.722,467.036,I don't doubt that they don't... that there's no notion that we have a right to make an argument along those lines.
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,489.511,529.116,"Mr. Phillips, you said what... when Congress used the word coal, it had a meaning, and in 1910, if I were to put the question, who has dominion over this gas... as I understand it, it was bad gas in 1910, and wouldn't the answer be, of course the coal miner is responsible, has the care of, the guard of that gas, has dominion over it, and if there's an explosion, the coal owner is going to be responsible?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,532.839,533.239,Well--
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,533.239,536.441,--when this gas was not considered any kind of an asset?
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,536.441,537.072,--No.
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,558.096,562.62,There had to be some control over this when it was a hazardous waste.
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,562.62,564.24,Yes.
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,564.71,571.614,Didn't someone in 1910 have responsibility for handling that bad gas?
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,571.614,572.395,--Yes.
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,577.51,584.543,So they had the control over the gas to see that it didn't cause injury.
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,584.543,588.026,"Well, you describe it, Justice Ginsburg, as control."
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,654.8,655.619,"Now, later--"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,675.104,675.985,"No, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.985,677.385,"Your argument is that all of it, whether it's--"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,677.385,677.726,Exactly.
1998.98-830,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.051,701.32,"--Well, I certainly didn't, I know."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,701.32,706.163,"--they'd break immediately upon the reduction of pressure, and then the gas flows out."
1998.98-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,711.647,716.271,"May I just follow up on one of Justice Scalia's questions, because I think I under... it's a tough case."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,736.963,739.525,"There will be, at least for a few days."
1998.98-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,739.525,740.526,Who owns that methane?
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,740.526,743.478,"We own that methane, but there's nothing we can do about it."
1998.98-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.478,744.287,"You still own that, even though it's--"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,744.287,744.508,Sure.
1998.98-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,760.34,769.124,"--And if a large piece of coal happened to have some foreign object in it, whatever it might be, a piece of gold, an old shoe, or whatever it was, you would own that old shoe, too?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,769.365,772.647,"As I understand it, I mean, the reservation of rights is quite clear here."
1998.98-830,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.451,781.543,But not whatever might be within a piece of coal.
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,781.543,802.307,"--That's correct, and if you go back to the Smoot case, for instance, the Illinois court of appeals decision that was rendered at or around the early part of the 20th Century, talking about pyrite and coal, and they were both removed, and one was a waste product for the coal, and the Illinois court of appeals, relying on general common law principles, said the owner of the pyrite is different from the owner of the coal."
1998.98-830,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,803.637,817.066,"Was there ever a commercial practice of taking the coal, in the ordinary sense that we think of a lump of black stuff, and refining it or processing it to get gas?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,817.066,822.069,--There was a very early stage process.
1998.98-830,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.21,827.372,"If that had happened, would you have said that they were mining coal or extracting gas?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,827.372,830.835,"They were mining coal, because that, you have to take the coal, you have to work on it."
1998.98-830,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,830.835,836.098,"Just like if you take timber and make it paper, you're taking timber, not paper."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,836.098,836.588,Exactly.
1998.98-830,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,855.241,855.972,Do you know--
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,855.972,857.132,We can go right through the same coal seam.
1998.98-830,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,857.132,874.603,"--Do you know whether or not in the West Virginia and Pennsylvania area... maybe you don't know the answer to this question... did the common lease say that the lessee is entitled to extract coal, reserving to the owner all other minerals?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,874.603,877.185,"I don't know the answer to that, Justice Kennedy."
1998.98-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,877.185,897.547,"Mr. Phillips, after the legislation you're talking about, 1909, 1910, subsequently Congress enacted other laws, I believe, in subsequent land grant legislation to reserve gas estates, did it?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,897.547,902.692,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I think that reveals plainly Congress' ability to distinguish gas from--"
1998.98-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,902.692,918.501,"Well, what is the best indication that in those subsequent legislation, in the subsequent legislation reserving gas to the Government, that it intended the gas to include the coalbed methane?"
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,918.501,937.024,"--Well, if you look at the regulatory definition of gas as it's implemented in the coal... I mean, excuse me, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920... and in the Mineral Leasing Act, remember, Congress decides how it's going to obtain moneys for the rights that it reserved under both the 1909 and 1910 acts, and the 1914 acts."
1998.98-830,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,953.575,961.291,So Congress did later have legislation that reserved gas that you think can persuasively be shown to include coalbed methane.
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,961.291,974.828,"Not only can it be persuasively shown to do that, but the Solicitor of the Interior in 1991 took precisely that position and concluded that coalbed methane is a gas deposit within the meaning of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920."
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,986.716,986.967,Mr.--
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1001.577,1005.219,"Yes, but that doesn't come from ordinary property concepts."
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1009.641,1012.125,"Yes, but in doing that, some of it may escape."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1012.125,1014.505,"Oh absolutely, and we don't have any claim to that."
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1026.684,1028.292,And how does it determine who goes first?
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1033.957,1038.021,"Well, you're going to have to get the methane out before you can mine the coal, otherwise it's a safety hazard."
1998.98-830,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1047.996,1051.629,"In other words, you would be saying, you can't mine until we do our thing first."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1051.629,1052.099,That's correct.
1998.98-830,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1052.099,1063.967,"Mr. Phillips, I think you contrasted the clear advertence of Congress in 1920 to coalbed methane as at least against the language that it used in the time we're concerned with here."
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1078.316,1078.606,No.
1998.98-830,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1082.139,1084.15,But they knew it just as well in 1909--
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1084.15,1085.302,--It was exactly the same information.
1998.98-830,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1085.302,1085.462,--as they did in 1920.
1998.98-830,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1085.462,1085.973,That's correct.
1998.98-830,1,42595,thomas_j_davidson,,1094.327,1098.511,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-830,2,43310,thomas_h_shipps,,1687.028,1690.691,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-830,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2571.892,2580.009,"Thank you, Mr. Chief--"
1998.98-830,4,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3451.971,3453.593,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
