2004.03-10198,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.642,We'll hear argument now in Antonio Dwayne Halbert v. Michigan.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,9.418,12.357,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,24.17,28.729,"Well, now, Douglas didn't involve a guilty plea, I guess."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,28.729,30.373,"--It did not, Your Honor."
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,31.034,36.558,And did the Court say anything about the effect of having it be a guilty plea?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,37.721,38.371,It did not.
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,43.938,46.162,Does that make a difference or could it?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,46.162,55.112,"I don't believe it does, Your Honor, because as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of difficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea."
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,80.919,89.852,Did... did your client waive any right to appeal here in connection with the proceedings at the plea?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,89.852,93.312,He did not waive a right to file an application for leave to appeal.
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.131,96.218,What did he waive?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,96.218,104.201,"--He waived the right to have a... to have what is called in Michigan an automatic appeal, in other words, the right to automatically have full briefing and oral argument."
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,114.729,121.3,Why didn't he waive the right to have counsel for that... for that purpose since that was the law in Michigan?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,121.3,124.59,"Well, he did not... first of all, as a matter of fact, he did not."
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.115,135.107,"Well, he was told what... what right to counsel he would have and it didn't include this."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,135.107,138.871,He was told that under certain circumstances the judge would appoint counsel.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.871,139.293,Right.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,139.293,142.908,"But the judge never said, under any other circumstances, I will not appoint counsel."
2004.03-10198,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,142.908,154.79,"Well, isn't that a perfectly natural inference if you're told you get A and B, that C and D might have been... that C and D will not be given?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,154.79,163.344,"It might be a natural inference for somebody with a level of sophistication, but Mr. Halbert is a special education student, functionally illiterate."
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.7,173.829,"Well, did we take this case on the ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we take the case on the ground that even if he were advised, he'd still have his right?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,173.829,180.458,"I hope the latter, Justice Kennedy, because this is a case in which the State is making a waiver argument."
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,191.961,196.361,"Well, I... I take it you would challenge the validity of the waiver even if he were advised?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,196.361,197.054,Absolutely.
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.054,198.644,"And even if he said, I hereby waive?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,198.644,205.177,"Absolutely, we would because that is a waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor."
2004.03-10198,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,216.418,217.617,"Well, wouldn't... I'm... I'm sorry."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,217.617,220.763,--It would have no effect whatsoever on money defendants I'm saying.
2004.03-10198,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,220.763,235.232,"Wouldn't your position be different if he had been advised that he had exactly the right that you claim he has, and the court said, however, in Michigan you may not enter the... the plea unless you waive that right?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,245.808,250.405,The waiver would be unconstitutional under those conditions because it is a discriminatory waiver.
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,254.025,257.976,How... why is that prejudicial to him?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,261.199,263.119,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,263.119,265.124,Why doesn't he just have a trial?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,267.012,271.368,"Well, as this Court has long recognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit."
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.349,286.012,"I thought you were going to say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's... that it's far-reaching."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,286.012,286.978,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.132,305.147,These are all disparate impact arguments.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,327.223,329.27,"Well, Justice Scalia, I actually have two responses to that."
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.912,371.083,"In any event, you pointed out that on the face there is the distinction on the face of it--"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,371.083,371.563,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,371.563,374.464,--it is not a disparate impact case at all--
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,374.464,374.842,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,374.842,376.523,--because it affects only indigents.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,376.523,377.792,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.781,406.116,"Whenever a State has... has initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it cuts back on poor... on part of that benefit, it is denying equal protection to the poor?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,426.456,431.746,"--It's not a... a disparate impact claim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at the poor."
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.051,444.823,So any cutback on benefits that is given... on benefits that are given to the poor is intentional discrimination against the poor.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,444.823,447.08,"I'm not saying any, Justice Scalia."
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.08,448.684,Just this one because that's your case.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,448.684,449.809,This case certainly is.
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,449.809,458.017,"You're saying this is case like Douglas which was equal protection, like a free transcript, like a filing fee for an appeal."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,458.017,458.502,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,458.502,459.179,You're bracketing--
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,459.179,476.688,"This case... in many ways the restrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability to appeal in Michigan, as a result of this statute, are worse than those that were struck down in Douglas because at least in Douglas the court, the appellate court, would review the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues."
2004.03-10198,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,503.946,508.703,May I just understand one point that Justice Scalia's question raises for me?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,518.852,529.721,"--Oh, it's my... it's certainly my contention, Justice Stevens, that Michigan is required to afford appellate counsel in this situation for a first tier direct felony appeal on the merits."
2004.03-10198,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,529.721,533.918,So that ultimately your case rests not on equal protection but due process.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,533.918,536.766,"It's a merger of both principles, as this Court said--"
2004.03-10198,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,536.766,538.578,"But it's one as much as the other, isn't it?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,538.578,539.117,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,539.117,548.311,"I mean, you're... we're saying if you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one incident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've got to provide counsel."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,548.311,549.132,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.132,553.543,So you're... you're retracting the pure equal protection claim?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,562.768,564.064,It is directed--
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.064,564.485,Or not?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,564.485,569.722,"--It is directed against the poor, which is why there is an equal protection component to this argument, but this Court's cases--"
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.722,574.852,But you say that component wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right to have counsel on appeal.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,574.852,576.579,--I believe that's right.
2004.03-10198,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.025,602.246,You're... you're saying that the due process is what gets you beyond the stage of merely providing counsel as a matter of grace.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,617.124,618.456,"--I think that's right, Justice Souter."
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,619.324,625.51,"Can... in your view, can the State require a waiver of the right to appeal for everyone?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,625.51,629.974,"That's a question this Court hasn't decided, and I don't have a position on that."
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,633.712,635.663,"Well, I'm not so sure."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,655.572,656.287,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,656.287,658.17,And do you question the lawfulness of that?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,658.17,659.417,I don't.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.942,695.88,"But, Mr. Moran, if... if you're... if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due process claim and if it is not a violation of due process to require people to waive their... I mean, you can waive entirely the right to appeal."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,702.764,710.876,"But, Your Honor, the problem is... is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a forced waiver on only the poor."
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.876,711.909,That's an equal protection claim.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,711.909,712.443,That's an equal protection claim.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.443,715.989,But you've... you've said your equal protection claim hinges on the due process claim.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,730.772,742.703,"I'm really not sure that you can separate out the two strands of the Fourteenth Amendment again, and I know this Court didn't try in MLB, and I know this Court didn't try in Smith v. Robbins, so that there is... there is a component of both."
2004.03-10198,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,749.593,750.339,In any case--
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,750.339,752.77,Where... where do we find the waiver here?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,754.904,758.125,"Well, it's my position there was no waiver, but the--"
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,758.125,761.068,But you referred to something that was waived.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,761.068,761.201,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,761.201,762.545,Where would we find that?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,762.677,762.545,"Well, the plea proceeding."
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,766.832,768.954,"Well, don't take your time to look it up."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,773.668,773.801,--It's... it's in the joint appendix--
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,773.801,774.862,All right.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,774.862,777.108,--beginning on page 19.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.108,778.319,It's their argument anyway.
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,778.59,785.416,"I'm missing something on waiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a... a right to have a counsel on appeal."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,795.986,797.302,That's right.
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.302,803.093,And why wouldn't he also have to have the... to know that he has the constitutional right to a lawyer to represent him?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,803.093,803.989,"Well, that's my position--"
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,803.989,804.522,All right.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,821.086,821.95,--That's right.
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,821.95,822.674,That's all.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,823.372,823.603,That's right.
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,823.603,824.855,So what's all this complicated thing about?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,824.855,842.497,"If an indigent, after being sentenced, decided for whatever reason I would prefer to go on appeal by myself, which is actually a... a right this Court rejected in Martinez, that you have a right to represent yourself on appeal, but in Michigan an indigent is allowed to... would be allowed to represent himself or herself on appeal if they chose to do so."
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.272,848.379,"No, no."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,852.379,852.591,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,852.591,857.406,"But he can waive it if he wants to, knowing that he has the right."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,857.406,858.013,That's right.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.912,872.986,"--Oh, but... but that happens all the time."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,879.033,880.942,--I take no position on that.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.344,883.912,"Well, you have to if you're going to make the argument you just made."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,883.912,888.268,But it's far different because that's something that can be obtained in negotiation.
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,889.67,904.389,"Well, Mr. Moran, here on page 22 of the joint appendix, the court is speaking to the defendant and says, you understand if I accept your plea, you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of right."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,904.389,904.809,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,904.809,909.053,And you think that was not effective?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,909.053,909.806,No.
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,918.225,920.135,"Well, I... it doesn't say that."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,920.135,921.341,"--No, it doesn't."
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.231,928.678,"Well, he does--"
2004.03-10198,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,928.678,928.785,I'm--
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,928.785,935.739,--he does go on to say that... that he can appoint a lawyer for... in certain instances.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,945.13,945.759,"--Yes, he was."
2004.03-10198,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,945.759,946.772,He had a counsel at the plea.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,946.772,947.205,He did.
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,947.205,948.613,I'm mixed up again.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,969.534,970.926,"Yes, Justice Breyer, I agree."
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,970.926,972.867,And does anybody dispute that?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,972.867,974.727,I believe--
2004.03-10198,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,974.727,975.206,Is that at issue here?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,975.206,978.56,--I... I believe the State might dispute that.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.367,1012.534,That's a strange terminology.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1023.621,1027.055,It's framed in terms of a... of a right.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.771,1030.643,So you have an absolute right to ask for an appeal.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1030.643,1030.994,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.994,1033.102,But that's not a right to appeal.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1036.771,1037.661,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.661,1038.392,Okay.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1038.392,1043.575,But it's a... it's... what Michigan has done is it has changed the method of the appeal.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.67,1053.185,"Well, it's done more than change the method."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1061.59,1065.973,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, but that's not how the... the Michigan Court of Appeals works."
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1084.39,1086.773,"--That's just... but that's just boiler plate, isn't it?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1088.661,1089.531,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1089.531,1097.05,And I think Michigan cites a Michigan Supreme Court decision that says it's not on the merits.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1097.05,1097.967,That--
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.967,1099.284,It's People v. Berry?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1099.284,1099.63,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1114.531,1121.026,"Well, why wouldn't it be the same if the... if it's a discretionary appeal at the intermediate appellate level?"
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1121.026,1125.174,"Because the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, is an error correcting court."
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1140.812,1144.966,Didn't... didn't the supreme court in the Bulger case... was that the name of it?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1144.966,1145.424,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.424,1153.626,Didn't it say that the... that the intermediate court's denial of... of appeals was a discretionary judgment?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1153.626,1163.734,"It called it a discretionary appeal, Justice Scalia, without ever explaining why, and the... the dissent in Bulger pointed out the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court."
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.808,1167.259,"That was a dissent, though."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1167.259,1181.477,"--That's right, but the very author of the opinion in Bulger, Chief Justice Corrigan, just 1 year later or 2 years later describes the effect of... of an order denying leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and rejected the merits."
2004.03-10198,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1181.477,1196.692,"--So, in effect, it's discretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to whether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom line, whether they give it full dress or... or merely discretionary denial is... is an implication on the merits."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1196.692,1197.971,"Yes, exactly as in Virginia."
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1219.224,1222.067,Is that something the intermediate appellate court has said?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1238.173,1251.868,"If a... if a appeal or an application to the Michigan Court of Appeals is filed in the wrong form or is untimely or has some other defect, then the court will occasionally issue an order denying the application for that reason."
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.766,1277.109,"This means, I would presume, that... that we would... we would have to give... our Federal courts on habeas would have to give deference to all decisions of the intermediate court since they're all on the merits."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1277.109,1277.578,And they do.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.578,1279.668,Federal courts do?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1279.668,1279.78,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.78,1288.403,They assume that all factual and legal arguments have been decided against the... the person applying for a discretionary appeal?
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1288.403,1288.809,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1338.465,1338.583,Mr. Moran.
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1338.583,1340.886,--has made an even more radical argument in its brief.
2004.03-10198,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1382.768,1397.221,"Mr. Moran, before your... your time is up, I did want to know what is your position on... let's say that there is... you prevail and there is a right to counsel for these applications to appeal."
2004.03-10198,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1412.139,1412.763,Yes.
2004.03-10198,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.776,1576.188,"Very well, Mr. Moran."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1579.666,1587.1,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1637.005,1644.743,"Well, I mean, wouldn't we have to conclude that if we're going to apply the same standards here that we usually do in... in the plea waiver situation?"
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1672.065,1672.523,Yes.
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1672.523,1688.122,"But unless he were told that, the... the waiver that... that depends upon parsing the difference between must and may in the two paragraphs of explanation certainly wouldn't be taken as the predicate for a waiver of a known right."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1688.122,1694.697,"I... I think that the colloquy makes clear that he does not... he's not going to have an appeal as of right, and then when told that--"
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1694.697,1701.56,"Well, the... the appeal of his right... the appeal as of right point, as I understand it, is a different point."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1729.74,1741.233,"--I think in... in context when told that only under these circumstances you're going to receive counsel in bringing discretionary application, that it's clear that he is waiving in his decision to go forward with the... his plea--"
2004.03-10198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1741.233,1746.309,"Look, the... imagine... I'm just repeating what Justice Souter said."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1801.242,1809.221,"--I think that the... the... for the two questions that are asked, he explains... the court explained to him he didn't have appeal as of right but then said--"
2004.03-10198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1809.221,1810.964,"Okay, that's the end of it."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1811.236,1813.021,--But then... and then the... the following--
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.021,1816.777,But he had an appeal of right until he pleaded guilty.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1816.777,1817.934,--That's right.
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.934,1820.69,And that's where... that's what the waiver consists of.
2004.03-10198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1829.083,1829.851,Precisely.
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.851,1836.89,"Do you want to... do you want to plead guilty, even though if you plead guilty, you'll get... you'll get a lawyer only under these circumstances."
2004.03-10198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1836.89,1837.344,Precisely.
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.344,1838.25,The court didn't say only--
2004.03-10198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1838.25,1839.828,And that's what we're deciding is--
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.828,1839.94,--That's the problem.
2004.03-10198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1839.94,1842.175,--That's exactly the issue in front of us.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1847.563,1854.671,"I think that... I also want to make the point, of course, that there was a factual finding, so if this Court did conclude, it would have to find the trial court was clearly erroneous."
2004.03-10198,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.609,1877.966,"Mr. Restuccia, the... we are dealing here, as is not uncommon, with someone who is learning disabled, mentally impaired, and the trial court did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1914.013,1914.552,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1914.552,1917.101,--that was never imparted in this case.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1917.101,1923.175,"The advice concerning right to appeal, the one that was used in the trial court here, was a form from 2000."
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.731,1960.112,"Of course, your case is a little stronger than... than the court just asked... just saying I must appoint counsel in this circumstance and I must appoint counsel in another circumstance."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,1991.653,1992.73,--I think... I think that's right.
2004.03-10198,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1992.73,2005.625,"Well, apparently the people who... who redid the model instructions thought that this would be a clearer one, to tell him up front you don't get counsel if you don't fit under these exceptions."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2005.625,2006.141,That's right.
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2033.414,2038.46,"Do you agree with your opponent that for AEDPA purposes, they treat the intermediate decision as a decision on the merits?"
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2038.46,2038.635,No I'd--
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.178,2055.369,So your opponent has misrepresented Michigan law.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2055.369,2055.581,No.
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.402,2069.225,But he says there are dozens of cases at the district court level that apply AEDPA in the way he described.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2069.945,2072.467,"Well, he didn't cite those cases."
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.857,2074.275,"No, he didn't, but do you think he's wrong?"
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2074.275,2078.498,--I... I know that our office handles all the habeas... habeas corpus--
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2078.498,2078.797,Do you think he's wrong?
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2078.797,2079.88,--I think he is wrong.
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2081.356,2091.056,"Are you going on... on record as saying that Michigan does not and will not, in the United States courts, claim any AEDPA deference as a result of one of these determinations?"
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2091.056,2096.643,--The Solicitor General made that position clear before the argument... before this Court in Tesmer v. Kowalski.
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2099.636,2104.286,And you have not been... and... and Michigan lawyers have not been advancing that claim in the district courts?
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2104.286,2123.032,"--The... all the habeas petitions are run through the office of the Attorney General, so that the... when the Solicitor General from the State of Michigan instructed our staff not to advance that claim, that means all habeas cases in Michigan essentially there will be... that argument will not be advanced."
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2123.032,2125.373,"So, so far as you can tell, that's the way it's been."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2125.373,2125.863,That's right.
2004.03-10198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.262,2182.825,Do they all sit together?
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2182.825,2183.39,--No.
2004.03-10198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2190.374,2191.873,But it's just one court.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2191.873,2192.871,--One court.
2004.03-10198,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2213.199,2224.057,"Then why... if it's just denying... or not granting appeal, why does it use the boiler plate, for lack of merit in the grounds presented?"
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2224.057,2228.078,--It's used that standard order for the last 20 years or longer.
2004.03-10198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.776,2260.514,Why... sorry.
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.036,2267.276,Could I ask about grounds presented before we get off this?
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2285.307,2286.513,--They're supposed to raise those arguments.
2004.03-10198,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.102,2331.507,"What of Mr.... Mr. Moran's point that this... whatever the merits are, it counts as law of the case and it's... it conclusively determines the issues presented?"
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2331.507,2347.56,"That's not what happened in... in People... in the Bobenal case, which was a court of appeals published decision where the order read virtually identical... identically to this one, and the court of appeals said it could... would not be bound by its original denial of leave for the lack of merits on the grounds presented and reached the merits of the claim."
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2350.333,2352.514,"Well, that was the same court, though, wasn't it?"
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2352.514,2353.33,--Right.
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2353.33,2356.034,But what... what about preclusion on other courts?
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2356.034,2357.373,The--
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2357.373,2358.647,In litigation in other courts.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2367.004,2371.339,"--The court of appeals was only examining its effect on itself, and wasn't examining on subsequent courts."
2004.03-10198,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2371.339,2376.874,"And any... any court, I mean, in... in theory, can... can revise its own... its own opinions."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2385.248,2389.488,"Well, but both... both opinions, in Bobenal and Berry, the court said it was not a ruling on the merits."
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.602,2401.674,"And they have said the same, you tell us, as to Federal courts."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2401.674,2403.348,Right.
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.046,2409.512,"I mean, that's another court, and... and they are not asserting that they've decided on the merits in Federal court."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2409.512,2411.138,--The Federal courts have been ambiguous.
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2412.919,2414.326,I'm not talking about what the Federal courts have said.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2421.083,2421.914,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2469.088,2472.245,"Look, this is what I'm... I'm interested in."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2492.238,2497.699,"Well, I think that, in a way, Michigan provides a... a greater protection by enabling itself."
2004.03-10198,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2518.439,2524.028,Is this a case where it would meet the standard for granting leave to appeal?
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2524.028,2524.246,No.
2004.03-10198,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2526.096,2528.32,Because of the error in scoring?
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2528.32,2535.285,"--In fact, anyone who's very familiar with the Michigan guideline system would recognize that Mr. Halbert, if anything, received a break in the scoring of the guidelines."
2004.03-10198,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2540.97,2544.841,You take the position that in fact there was no error in scoring.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2544.841,2545.283,No.
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.993,2587.029,I thought at page 36 of your brief that you agreed that he made a correct... that there was an error in... of application.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2587.029,2587.141,--Right.
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.572,2602.937,So there were at least two errors.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2606.952,2608.355,"--Well, in fact, if anything, helped him."
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.858,2610.37,Is that correct?
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2611.496,2612.039,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.039,2612.162,--at least.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2612.162,2612.695,Yes.
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.695,2615.617,"And he contends there were two more, and that hasn't been resolved."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2615.617,2618.555,"That's... that's right, but I... I think those claims are--"
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.555,2623.786,So at... at least we have to assume that it was not an error-free sentencing proceeding.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2623.786,2624.623,--Yes.
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2655.961,2657.261,May I ask another question?
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2670.449,2670.571,--No.
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.013,2721.004,"But if the counsel happens to be incompetent, that's the end of the ball game."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2721.004,2731.638,"--And that's always the circumstance for a defendant who's bringing a discretionary application where his prior counsel was ineffective, that he can be left to identify the meritorious claims on his own and to make the argument of ineffective assistance of counsel."
2004.03-10198,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2769.477,2773.317,"But, of course, if he had had paid counsel, he would not have had these handicaps."
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2773.317,2781.29,"--That's right, that the... there is some advantage, but that's not the ultimate--"
2004.03-10198,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.29,2782.602,Competent paid counsel.
2004.03-10198,1,17976,bernard_e_restuccia,,2782.602,2783.68,--Thank you.
2004.03-10198,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2783.68,2788.181,"Thank you, Mr. Restuccia."
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2790.687,2793.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-10198,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.196,2883.63,"Now, I take it that the basic rule that we've followed... and this is what people are arguing about... could be a criminal trial or proceeding, plea, something in a trial court."
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2883.63,2884.253,Right.
2004.03-10198,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2884.253,2890.258,"It emerges with a judgment, and then there is going to be the first review."
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2923.98,2929.062,"Well, again, Justice Breyer, it's a question of allocating scarce legal resources."
2004.03-10198,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2963.07,2965.731,Is there any other State that's done it the way Michigan has?
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2965.731,2969.255,--I don't believe there's another State that's done it exactly the same way.
2004.03-10198,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.121,3021.392,"Are you saying... I just want to be clear... that even if this defendant had had paid counsel, he would not have had any right to appeal to the intermediate court?"
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3021.392,3022.384,That's correct.
2004.03-10198,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3072.802,3077.623,"But it's not that... it's not that sharp because it was... in Ross, it was the second appeal."
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3092.694,3099.292,"--I... I understand, Justice Ginsburg, but... but that's not the distinction that I understand this Court's decisions draw."
2004.03-10198,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.764,3115.366,"Of course, the question is whether the words, of right, were essential to that statement."
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3115.366,3123.211,"I... I'm assuming that the Court was being careful in its... in its choice of words, and I believe it was because that... that--"
2004.03-10198,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3123.211,3125.573,Because then it wouldn't have needed to include the word first.
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3125.573,3126.636,--I'm sorry?
2004.03-10198,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3126.636,3129.851,"But then the word first was redundant, not the words, of right."
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3129.851,3130.662,"No, I don't--"
2004.03-10198,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.662,3133.531,You can have two appeals of right--
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3133.531,3134.203,--That's right.
2004.03-10198,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3134.203,3135.003,--I suppose if you wanted to.
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3135.003,3136.027,That's right.
2004.03-10198,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3189.87,3192.467,May... may I ask you one thing lest we forget it?
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3202.936,3204.248,"--No, I don't think so."
2004.03-10198,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3222.193,3224.912,"Well, we accept cert before we do that."
2004.03-10198,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3234.903,3235.569,"Yes, yes."
2004.03-10198,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.569,3239.323,Does the denial of an application for appeal have any merits consequence?
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3239.323,3244.106,"--Well, as... if... if that's the question, I... I would defer to... to Michigan counsel--"
2004.03-10198,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3244.106,3254.057,"No. But I'm asking whether that's a premise of your argument because the consequences of your argument are going to be very different depending on whether that is the premise or whether it isn't, whether that premise is true or whether it isn't."
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3254.057,3259.785,--I... I think the distinction is... is not necessarily whether the decisions are on the merits or not.
2004.03-10198,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.701,3268.422,"If it's always on the merits, it's an... it's an appeal of right, it seems to me."
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3273.557,3278.794,"Well, I... in... in fact, I don't think that's what happens in Michigan, and... and I think the--"
2004.03-10198,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3278.794,3282.608,So your... the assumption of your argument is that it is not on the merits.
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3287.167,3289.828,--I... I think that's true.
2004.03-10198,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3292.84,3297.71,"You're talking about a piece of paper, that first piece of paper saying to the appeals court, appeals court, please hear my appeal."
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3297.71,3298.35,Right.
2004.03-10198,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3298.35,3301.155,And then it lists a whole lot of reasons like a cert petition.
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3301.155,3301.662,Right.
2004.03-10198,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3301.662,3303.811,And those are likely to do with the merits of the case.
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3309.869,3310.525,That's right.
2004.03-10198,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3310.525,3310.999,All right.
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3320.593,3324.262,"It... it is more difficult, but... but the disparity between--"
2004.03-10198,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3324.262,3326.325,So why draw that distinction?
2004.03-10198,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3333.291,3345.222,"--Well, again, because... because if you... if you broaden the right to State-paid counsel, as... as in Douglas, you're going to require States to... to reallocate resources to that priority and away from other priorities."
2004.03-10198,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3390.41,3391.488,"Thank you, Mr. Schaerr."
2004.03-10198,3,21199,david_a_moran,,3395.317,3396.586,Thank you.
2004.03-10198,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3415.109,3416.068,Appeals as of right?
2004.03-10198,3,21199,david_a_moran,,3416.068,3417.711,--Not necessarily.
2004.03-10198,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3460.366,3478.168,What's the effect of the constitutional provision then?
2004.03-10198,3,21199,david_a_moran,,3478.168,3481.821,I'm sorry?
2004.03-10198,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3483.234,3487.483,"If that's so, what is the effect of the constitutional provision that Mr. Schaerr read?"
2004.03-10198,3,21199,david_a_moran,,3487.483,3491.11,--The Michigan constitutional provision?
2004.03-10198,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3520.076,3522.017,I... I... you... you have the wrong one.
2004.03-10198,3,21199,david_a_moran,,3530.235,3537.007,"The... I assume you're still referring to article I, section 20 of the Michigan constitution."
2004.03-10198,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3537.007,3537.081,Yes.
2004.03-10198,3,21199,david_a_moran,,3543.282,3554.268,"They were saying that first-tier felony appeals in Michigan following pleas require leave of the court, require an application for leave to appeal, like latent appeals from trial cases do."
2004.03-10198,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3614.038,3615.372,"Thank you, Mr. Moran."
