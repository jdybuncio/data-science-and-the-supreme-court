2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.951,"We'll hear argument next today in Case 12-1036, Mississippi v. AU Optronics Corporation."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,8.951,11.809,"That you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,117.344,122.859,"Mr. Massey, with respect to that, there is a claim for restitution."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,137.275,142.788,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's very unlikely in this case."
2013.12-1036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,211.401,212.291,"And you're asking for $10,000 for each one?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,212.291,213.338,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
2013.12-1036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,213.338,216.259,"You're asking for $10,000 for each one."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,216.259,219.29,"Well, the -- the complaint does pray that."
2013.12-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,231.831,240.437,Let's assume a case where -- forget about that the consumer action was settled.
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,247.106,247.183,--Yes.
2013.12-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,247.183,261.32,"Let's think of a case in which the damages can be determined, and the State comes in on behalf of a class of consumers and says we're seeking their restitution."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,264.303,267.098,Our argument does not change.
2013.12-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,312.429,319.143,"So is this a real party in interest argument, or is it a statutory argument that--"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,319.143,319.363,--It is--
2013.12-1036,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,319.363,327.268,"--the statute requires named plaintiffs as opposed to -- named or unnamed plaintiffs, but plaintiffs."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,327.268,328.641,"--Yes, named plaintiffs."
2013.12-1036,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,356.808,358.1,What do you do with reference to persons?
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,358.1,358.917,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1036,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,402.455,403.173,"Well, I -- I realize that."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,403.173,403.877,Yes.
2013.12-1036,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,403.877,409.72,But I'm not sure why that -- why it wouldn't make sense to read two different terms in the same sentence to mean two different things.
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,409.72,410.1,Well--
2013.12-1036,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,410.1,419.745,"The persons could be here, the citizens of Mississippi, who were damaged by the activity in question."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,434.178,457.497,"--Well, because -- we think that our reading is better because if you're applying the common question test, not to the persons who were in the case, those abstract unnamed, unknown consumers, you're not inquiring as to what their claims might be, you're applying the common question test only to the plaintiff, how could that -- how could that produce an administrable result?"
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,508.195,518.987,"What if you have an executor and he's administering an estate in which 100 people have equal shares to the estate, and the estate has a claim."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,523.704,531.451,"That, of course, is a different case when it is not involving the government."
2013.12-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,571.779,595.847,"Mr. Massey, you envision one proceeding, it could be a class action on behalf of the individuals, that doesn't require everybody tot satisfy the amount in controversy, and then this action by the Attorney General, which does, among other things, seek restitution."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,614.527,615.464,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,615.464,620.682,"But now we have the consumers who were affected, they've already been paid."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,635.004,636.145,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,752.926,759.674,Then it would make -- it would make no sense for a defendant in a class action brought by consumers to ever settle the case.
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,776.246,777.979,"Well, the evidence, the evidence of loss is relevant."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,805.217,816.104,"Is there -- what is your understanding under Mississippi law, which you know a great deal more than I do, about any limits on a parens patriae action?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,824.475,825.443,"--That would be a very different case, Your Honor."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,825.443,827.177,"Well, I know but I'm trying--"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,827.177,829.974,I think very unlikely.
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,831.473,835.689,--Unlikely as a practical matter or as a legal matter?
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,835.689,836.361,--Both.
2013.12-1036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,877.719,889.355,Are there parens patriae actions where the State Attorney General brings the action in what is really a suit on behalf of private parties?
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,893.761,899.196,"Well, we do not think that would be -- that is not a proper parens patriae case, and the Attorney General--"
2013.12-1036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,899.196,902.99,"In other words, parens patriae has to have -- you have to ask for restitution?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,902.99,904.098,"--Well, no."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,934.274,942.505,Did the State interest that's being -- the State interest that is being asserted is damage to the consumers?
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,942.505,944.878,"--Well, no."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,956.303,960.857,"Because it harmed members of the population of Mississippi, right?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,960.857,979.741,"--Well, yes, but I think in Snapp the Court discussed how the -- when a harm is broad enough, when it affects a substantial segment of the population and affects them in their economic capacity, there are indirect as well as direct effects that the State could be concerned with."
2013.12-1036,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.582,981.489,What are those?
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,981.489,987.721,"--Well, in other words, there are -- if people are harmed by a price fixing conspiracy, they have less money, they're--"
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,987.721,992.812,Damage to -- having less money is a damage to the consumer.
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,992.812,996.078,"--Well, but that has a ripple effect in the economy."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1029.11,1052.54,"What prevents -- what prevents attorneys general from around the country sitting back and waiting until every -- as private class actions proceed, and as soon as one settles or the plaintiffs' class prevails, taking the same complaint, maybe even hiring the same lawyers, to go and say, well, now we are going to bring our parens patriae action."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1059.74,1069.937,"--Well, if there is a harm, as there was in this case, Federal criminal allegations -- there were guilty pleas and there were 800--"
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1069.937,1071.155,"Well, that's got not nothing to do with it, does it?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1071.155,1072.562,"--Those are serious matters, and I think the--"
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1072.562,1080.48,"I'm sure it's a serious matter when a plaintiff class recovers for, as in this case, an antitrust violation or whatever."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1082.667,1087.65,"--Well, I think the answer is that the State has separate interests."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1093.911,1112.733,"So the answer is that there is nothing to prevent 50 attorneys general, 51, from saying, every time there is a successful class action as to which somebody in my State purchased one of the items, we are going to file a parens patriae action, the complaint is going to look an awful lot like the class action complaint, and we want our money?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1112.733,1119.809,"--Well, I think that -- I think that isn't going to happen because the State -- well, the complaints are not the same."
2013.12-1036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1127.01,1128.4,"Well, that means that it could happen?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1128.4,1130.525,"--Well, it could happen, right."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1136.773,1151.031,"I'm sorry, counsel, but you told me the State's own interest was in protecting its consumers, so it would be able to file this suit every time its consumers have been harmed as demonstrated either through settlement or suit."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1153.015,1165.963,"--If -- if -- if a State -- some States may adopt a different rule from Washington, as the Washington court said, the State -- the consumer claims would preclude a State attorney general action."
2013.12-1036,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1187.923,1192.75,"Well, as a matter of efficiency, take the Chief Justice's hypo, the hypothetical and back it up."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1204.714,1219.566,"If -- if the State attorney general was combined with thousands of individual claimants that otherwise would trigger CAFA, then CAFA -- then you would be forced into this whole case situation."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1275.067,1283.642,"But you can't provide any reason why they wouldn't do so, and presumably would start doing so with greater frequency if you prevail in this case."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1283.642,1284.267,--Well--
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1284.267,1285.874,It doesn't have to be the same case.
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1295.058,1296.574,"--Well, we don't think so."
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1342.321,1346.46,"And in every one of those cases, there had been private class litigation prior to the filing of parens patriae?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1346.46,1349.412,"No, I don't think there has -- I don't think there had been in virtually any of them."
2013.12-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1359.736,1362.83,Except we know that's not true in this case because we already have a settled--
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1362.83,1363.516,There is a -- there was a class action settlement here.
2013.12-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1364.904,1381.524,"--Is your -- is your view of what's called the mass action -- a mass action is you have to have a sizeable number of plaintiffs, each one with 75 -- at least $75,000 at stake."
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1381.911,1382.087,Yes.
2013.12-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1382.665,1383.524,--And so they would all be named plaintiffs.
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1383.524,1384.587,That's correct.
2013.12-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1391.819,1400.674,"Are there many actions of that nature where there are hundreds of people each with a claim of 75,000 or more?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1400.674,1402.158,There are.
2013.12-1036,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1415.762,1424.632,Why would you bring such a claim in Federal courts in this mass action formula?
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1433.801,1436.597,"Well, if you -- if you could identify the plaintiffs, you don't need to go through Rule 23."
2013.12-1036,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1451.544,1458.463,"Mr. Massey, if you are right about what mass action means in this statute, what is this exception about the general public doing?"
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1458.463,1460.712,--The general public.
2013.12-1036,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1525.075,1526.7,Can you tell me when you come back where the money goes if you win?
2013.12-1036,0,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1526.7,1528.464,Yes.
2013.12-1036,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.373,1565.075,"Thank you, Mr. Massey."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1568.465,1570.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1683.706,1690.031,So how do you remand a case when it involves unnamed plaintiffs?
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1710.29,1710.899,"Well -- well, a couple of things."
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1757.082,1764.626,"You know, this language is very reminiscent in what's in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, the joinder rule."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1764.626,1765.907,Well--
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1765.907,1771.108,"And if I look at the joinder rule, it uses “ persons ” and “ plaintiffs ” essentially in the same way."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1778.5,1779.671,--Well--
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1779.671,1782.562,--or the proposed class in essence.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1782.562,1793.245,"--Your Honor, I see similarities between this provision and the PSLRA, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that reformed class actions in the securities context."
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1840.477,1845.348,"It seems that that would be hard, to invoke that case when a statute commands differently."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1845.348,1846.926,"Well, I mean, I don't see--"
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1846.926,1852.751,"In that case, it's in the -- in the absence of statutory language that requires remand."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1852.751,1853.986,--Well--
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1853.986,1863.998,I -- I'm hard-pressed to think that we can be exercising supplemental jurisdiction in a case where Congress has expressly spoken and said you can't or shouldn't.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1863.998,1873.884,"--Well, I don't understand that, because Section 1367 says supplemental jurisdiction shall exist unless it's expressly provided otherwise in a Federal statute."
2013.12-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1897.312,1936.922,"In this particular case, the individual claims were settled in the class action, so if there -- if there are no individual claimants to be -- to be represented, why doesn't this end up being a claim where only the State of Mississippi has a stake, because the individuals that the State might have been representing have already been satisfied, so if this is--"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1936.922,1938.937,There are -- there are a couple of aspects to this.
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.797,1976.938,Why is that?
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1991.916,1993.185,--That is under Federal law.
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1993.185,1993.463,Yes.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,1994.572,2000.0,"The IPT case, that was a State law case in Federal court."
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2000.555,2003.662,"I know your case is, but the one that settled previously?"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2003.662,2004.194,Yes.
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2007.402,2007.708,All right.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2017.236,2018.203,--The named plaintiff.
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.203,2025.53,"And moreover, the State of Mississippi is suing in order to obtain money, is what we just heard, for its treasury."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2067.948,2075.493,Because we are not disputing that the Attorney General has standing to bring a claim as a nominee for the real parties in interest.
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.493,2078.274,"I understand that, but why does that fall within this statute?"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2078.274,2093.314,"Because the statutory language says if it's a civil action with monetary relief claims -- we clearly got that -- of 100 or more persons, we think those claims under the Mississippi statute inescapably belong to those persons."
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2093.314,2095.986,"If you go on and read that a little bit further, Mr. Curran--"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2095.986,2096.438,I'm getting there.
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2096.438,2097.0,--it says
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2104.997,2105.716,Yes.
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2105.716,2122.099,"And here, of course, you know, there's no joinder, let alone any proposed -- you know, there's no -- there nothing that the Mississippi Attorney General has to go through to show that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact, right?"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2127.769,2136.733,"Well, they filed a single complaint, right, under Rule 42 and -- of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the State analog to that, and pre-existing jurisprudence."
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2143.7,2144.622,"But again, this clearly--"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2144.622,2146.606,So I submit there is a proposed -- a proposal to try these claims jointly.
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2146.606,2156.868,"--But they don't have to show -- and this is clearly referring to a kind of Rule 23 inquiry, which they don't have to go through to do a parens patriae."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2156.868,2164.144,"That would be the same thing, Your Honor, in the case that they say is the quintessential mass -- mass action case."
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2169.581,2171.315,"Yes, but they do have to show that--"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2171.315,2171.784,--Why?
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2171.784,2171.94,--in a massive--
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2171.94,2172.987,"No, they--"
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2172.987,2173.456,--consolidation case--
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2173.456,2174.641,--file a complaint.
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2174.641,2181.654,--the judge is going to say: You have 100 claims; we want to see that those 100 claims have common questions of law or fact.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2193.205,2217.382,"Well, Your Honor, I think -- I submit that when a State attorney general files a complaint on behalf of 100 or more persons claiming to have standing and to be seeking to recover for the damages to those 100 or more persons, he's proposing to try those claims together."
2013.12-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.11,2239.482,"Yes, but the Attorney General says that that's not what's going to happen here."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2243.7,2246.294,He cited the statute that has that plain language.
2013.12-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.661,2263.675,He says you can't -- he says you can't even identify those people.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2263.675,2266.44,"Well, that is -- that doesn't hold up."
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.688,2327.477,"What about -- see, I can understand a complaint where they have taken 100 individuals or 102, and they list them as plaintiffs, and they don't call it a class action."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2332.163,2332.772,That's right.
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.772,2359.169,"But if we take your approach and depart from that mechanical, but simple -- simply administered interpretation, what was worrying me, and perhaps you can help me with that, is that there are perhaps all kinds of State actions where one of the motivating reasons is behind the lawsuit is some person hurt our citizens."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2386.719,2387.157,I do.
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.157,2387.782,I've departed from the clear and simple.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2387.782,2388.266,Okay.
2013.12-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2404.933,2414.819,"--That seems to be -- that seems to be disputed, because I understood Mr. Massey to say that the restitution claim would go to the State."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2421.097,2421.659,--That's right.
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2423.611,2430.562,"You can hold him to that, and I guess he can say, no, I don't want to be held to that or -- but that seemed to be not for this Court."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2432.077,2432.967,We don't care where it goes.
2013.12-1036,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2432.967,2435.7,--But can we not take him at his word?
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2436.528,2438.184,"Well, the Mississippi statute is clear."
2013.12-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.923,2523.672,What -- what do you do about this -- this language in the definition?
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2556.534,2563.759,"Well, I -- I view that language as contemplating a Rule 23 type analysis."
2013.12-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.759,2565.284,"Yes, I understand that."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2565.284,2565.436,Okay.
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2592.395,2614.167,"Well, Mr. Curran, really, do you -- are you saying that as a matter of State law, that in this suit the attorney general has to make a proposal that -- that the plaintiff -- that -- that he can bring the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact and that that proposal has to be adjudicated by the Court?"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2614.167,2618.243,"I think, Justice Kagan, that the attorney general has already done that."
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2629.753,2635.907,But he does not have to show any common questions of law or fact in the typical way that we demand.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2653.431,2664.974,"--Well, I guess -- I suppose we could move for bifurcation to separate the -- the proprietary claims from the claims on behalf of citizens and then he would say, no, it makes sense to keep them all together."
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2675.22,2676.921,I guess I don't understand the bifurcation point.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2702.241,2717.717,"Well, certainly, he -- he at least is attempting to combine the claims of all the various individuals in the State on the grounds of commonality, right?"
2013.12-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2723.513,2734.225,Suppose it's a given that we all concede that the complaint is both for private-named persons and for restitution.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2735.786,2740.944,"--Well, certainly, it's -- it's a mass action in that circumstance."
2013.12-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2746.645,2751.235,"No, the rest of my hypothetical, part of the restitution goes to the State."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2751.235,2756.406,"Well, then, again, the statutory language says if it's a civil action--"
2013.12-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2756.406,2756.796,Where's the language?
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2756.796,2759.749,"--Well, it's at the beginning of the mass action definition."
2013.12-1036,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2766.011,2766.964,I have 79.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2766.964,2768.088,Okay.
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2819.771,2824.3,And this is the main provision where they're trying to define what mass action means.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2860.782,2866.312,"If that's all this statute was meant to reach, that would have been such an easy statute to write."
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2878.339,2880.916,But that would have required this Court--
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2880.916,2882.728,That's essentially what it says.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2891.77,2897.236,"--Well, how -- well, first of all, how do you explain -- I don't mean to pose a question to you -- it's inexplicable that the word “ persons ”--"
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2897.236,2898.455,I might not answer it.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2900.454,2911.528,"--It's -- it's inexplicable that Congress would use the word “ persons ” and then 12 words later use “ plaintiffs ” if it signifies the exact same thing, and then continue to use the term “ plaintiffs ” throughout."
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2911.528,2922.024,"--But doesn't your proposal mean that before someone can remove, they have to decide whether the class is certifiable?"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2922.024,2922.431,No.
2013.12-1036,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2922.431,2932.238,Because you're not going to decide whether these plaintiffs are actually going to be plaintiffs and part of this class until you decide the class question.
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,2951.34,2956.322,There's another provision in here that is incorporated into the mass action.
2013.12-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3033.246,3034.745,"Sometimes, Congress doesn't do it right, you know?"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3042.822,3044.25,"But here, I think it does do it."
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3044.25,3045.023,But more than that--
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3045.023,3047.053,"And if there are competing interpretations, then that purpose should drive the decision."
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3047.053,3054.77,"--But more than that, Mr. Curran, is that there was actually a considered effort by the attorneys generals here to take themselves out of this statute--"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3054.77,3055.317,And they failed.
2013.12-1036,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3055.317,3059.501,"--and that that -- well, you say they failed and, I mean, that's the statutory question."
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3072.45,3073.901,"No, no, no, no."
2013.12-1036,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.617,3148.723,"Maybe they didn't, but if you look at the committee report, what is the definition of mass action?"
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3170.588,3172.432,"--Yes, I am familiar with that sentence in that Senate report."
2013.12-1036,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3184.975,3186.754,You mean it's contrived legislative history?
2013.12-1036,1,18627,christopher_m_curran,,3188.691,3197.594,"But -- but even if it somehow could be considered, I don't think that -- that sentence is definitional."
2013.12-1036,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3367.886,3368.792,"Thank you, Mr. Curran."
2013.12-1036,2,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,3371.009,3372.617,Thank you.
2013.12-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3448.946,3453.195,Did not the Fifth Circuit decide that State law question?
2013.12-1036,2,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,3453.195,3454.82,"--No, Your Honor, we don't believe so."
2013.12-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3508.328,3511.654,"What he says is -- in the complaint, it says --"
2013.12-1036,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3570.802,3573.254,And that's what I understood the Fifth Circuit to have held.
2013.12-1036,2,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,3573.254,3579.798,"Well, what the -- what the -- what the prayer for relief says is the -- “ restitute to the State ”--"
2013.12-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3579.798,3580.329,Right.
2013.12-1036,2,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,3580.329,3582.875,"""-- for its purchases and the purchases of its citizens. """
2013.12-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3582.875,3584.297,"Yes, and the purchases of its citizens."
2013.12-1036,2,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,3584.297,3585.266,So the State will get the money--
2013.12-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3585.266,3586.436,I know they'll get the money--
2013.12-1036,2,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,3586.436,3587.155,--Right.
2013.12-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3587.155,3588.561,"--but he's saying to get the money, you have to say which money."
2013.12-1036,2,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,3588.561,3590.747,"Well, it--"
2013.12-1036,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3590.747,3607.943,"And to get the money, which money means you better have a list of the individual people who bought something, or otherwise, there is no such money, and that's enough to make those in respect to this paragraph, individual people whose claims the State of Mississippi is pursuing."
2013.12-1036,2,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,3611.52,3614.409,"--Well, the -- the evidence will be proven through statistical aggregate evidence rather than a list of names."
2013.12-1036,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3622.251,3623.984,But that has to go with the facts of this case.
2013.12-1036,2,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,3638.077,3638.929,"--In many cases, we are."
2013.12-1036,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3643.836,3644.867,"Thank you, counsel."
