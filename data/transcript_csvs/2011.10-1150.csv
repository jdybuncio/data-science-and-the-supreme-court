2011.10-1150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1150, Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,10.939,13.974,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,50.766,51.849,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,60.039,67.894,"Well, what it can't do is use any number from 400 up until infinity, and it believes that's the wrong number."
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,79.0,81.452,It -- it actually is much narrower than that.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,102.949,107.935,"Well, you -- you see, Your Honor, we believe the correct number is 450 to 700."
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,122.462,126.814,"Well, it took that position, but the district court narrowed it to 15 percent, to 15--"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,126.814,129.033,"Well, you know, actually it didn't, Your Honor."
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,152.531,152.864,--It can offer the test.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,152.864,153.414,--you get one opinion.
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,155.214,156.233,It can offer the test.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,159.935,166.922,"Well, it -- it can't have a test that has a different therapeutic range, because that's a preemption."
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,168.374,170.057,Tests do two things: they measure something--
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,170.057,170.809,--Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,170.809,173.61,--And therapeutic range does something else.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,181.014,194.941,"And -- and what -- what Prometheus submitted and the court agreed is if you are notified, if you are aware of their range when you're drawing blood, that's an infringement right then and there, if -- if you're aware or warned by their number."
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,206.916,220.925,"When -- when the Respondent addresses this, will they take issue with the way you describe what has been preempted, or as you read their -- we'll ask them -- but as you read their brief, is this crystal-clear?"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,220.925,228.079,"Well, you'll see, Justice Kennedy, in the district court, they argued for any number above 400."
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,234.949,242.089,"In thinking about what's preempted, I looked at the Diehr case involving the rubber molding and the constant monitoring."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,278.512,280.297,"Well, it may be patentable."
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,280.297,282.666,"And it's hard for you to answer -- you know, there's a million hypotheticals."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,283.832,284.832,The -- the key is--
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,284.832,286.165,--see what the process is.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,286.165,286.532,--the specificity.
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.113,311.28,I'm -- I'm not comfortable with that.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,314.232,314.801,--Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.457,325.873,What about up to 700?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,326.575,328.692,"--Well, no."
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.611,330.527,550?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,330.527,331.477,--No.
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.479,333.746,830?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,333.746,334.613,--No.
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.613,337.765,How are we supposed to apply that kind of a rule?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,337.765,341.835,I think doctors have to have freedom to make their own judgments about these natural phenomena.
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.835,344.12,Above 830 or below 830?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,344.587,345.354,"Well, I -- no."
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.803,349.238,It just seems to me not a -- not a patent rule that we could possibly apply.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,349.238,357.011,"--Well, it's the rule I believe adopted in Bilski and in Flook, that you can't wipe out a whole field so no one else can have a competing test."
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.852,373.837,But doesn't -- doesn't any -- any medical patent rely on natural processes?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,389.313,389.931,"--Oh, yes."
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.931,392.717,Is it -- is it therefore precluded from patentability?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,392.717,393.467,"No, it's not."
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.267,395.835,What is different here?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,395.835,397.402,The difference is the specificity.
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.341,417.915,"I thought your answer to Justice Scalia would be -- and please correct me -- the difference is, is that what the Respondent is claiming is a -- a patent on the measurement of the result."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,417.915,419.95,"--Yes, it -- it is a patent--"
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,419.95,421.783,But they're giving a different answer.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,427.085,429.687,--I think that's -- that's one -- one part of it.
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.687,433.924,"Well, that's another one of your arguments, but one of your arguments says you can't patent nature."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,433.924,436.959,"You can't patent nature, that's correct."
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.959,438.426,"Right, and that relates to the question that I asked."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,438.426,438.876,But--
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.876,441.328,"Now, tell me why you can't patent nature, then?"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,441.328,447.565,--Because -- because of the law of nature doctrine that has existed for 150 years in this Court.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,453.102,454.052,Nature--
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.052,457.103,But nature always has a reaction to the drug.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,457.103,458.789,Pardon me?
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.789,460.574,Nature always has a reaction to the drug.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,460.574,461.074,Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,488.559,488.909,--All right.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,504.651,505.02,Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,505.02,510.674,It is also hornbook law that the application of a law of nature can be patented.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,510.674,510.99,Right.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,510.99,511.457,All right.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,546.263,546.663,Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,546.663,547.313,--at least.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,548.98,558.988,"For us, the real oddity is that this numerical calibration that they've given extends up to infinity, and it precludes every other blood test."
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,558.988,559.238,All right.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,595.661,596.863,Sure.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,596.863,597.263,Okay?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,598.58,599.982,"No, it's not."
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,599.982,600.498,Why not?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,600.498,601.582,It's not a good patent.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,601.582,605.017,"If you can tell me why not, I'll have an understanding of where you are coming from."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,605.017,612.123,"Well, because you -- you've added to a law of nature just -- just a simple observation of the man's little finger."
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,612.123,612.556,Ah.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,617.443,617.893,Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,617.893,623.013,"If you look at the Court's cases, they seem to say Flook, one thing, and Diehr another thing."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,635.655,638.607,There are several things that it can't be.
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.103,661.222,"Well, excuse me."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,670.827,671.261,--Well--
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.261,674.029,"That's not what we're talking about here; we are not talking about novelty, are we?"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,674.029,675.479,"--No, we are really not."
2011.10-1150,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,692.491,702.762,"Mr. Shapiro, on that question and the question Justice Scalia just raised, the government, you know, has taken the position that you are under the wrong section."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,721.724,724.51,That's a very important question for the medical community.
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,747.125,756.147,It's hard to resist the temptation to peek into the obvious component or the nonobvious component and then go back and apply it to 101.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,756.147,757.131,--Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,757.131,760.385,You want us to discipline ourselves to talk just about 101 in this.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,760.385,763.268,"Well, no, I think -- we have two arguments on this point."
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.157,774.376,"But once you say conventional nature, you are saying it's not novel."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,778.93,780.347,--Well--
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.347,780.963,Because it's novel.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,780.963,787.452,--this -- this is the Court's 101 analysis in both Flook and in Bilski.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,808.282,809.716,"You are getting warmer, but--"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,824.291,824.708,"Oh, yes."
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,824.708,827.577,And there's lots of investment to be protected.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,827.577,827.927,"Oh, sure."
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,827.927,829.862,"But they can't, okay?"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,852.811,853.578,Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,853.578,854.095,What?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,854.095,854.93,Our view--
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.93,856.713,Now that -- what do you have to add?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,872.891,882.247,"--In our view, the rest of it has to add up to some step that limits the natural phenomenon, so that you have a concrete, specific--"
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,882.247,883.78,You are going on a limitation thing.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,888.068,889.201,"--Well, in the Diehr--"
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,889.201,894.472,"But it's pretty easy to think of the same problem you have, you know, which doesn't have this infinity in it."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,894.472,895.388,--In the Diehr case--
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.388,898.274,Which unfortunately we have to deal with.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,898.274,910.314,"--In the Diehr case the natural phenomenon was limited with steps that confined the invention to a specific machine with doors opening and closing, temperature being monitored so a product was cured."
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,912.516,917.087,I -- I don't know what -- you keep saying you have to limit the product.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,917.087,918.17,Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,918.17,922.622,But you told me that there is a different range for the treatment of skin diseases.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,922.622,922.991,--Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,922.991,927.526,So presumably there are different ranges for treatment of other diseases.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,927.526,928.243,Absolutely.
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,928.243,934.197,So this patent has not limited exploration in there.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,951.558,952.76,"Well, here's what--"
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,952.76,954.843,--how do you answer Justice Breyer's question?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,954.843,958.997,"--Here's what they say, joint appendix pages 13 through 14, the second volume."
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,980.411,981.261,Mr. Shapiro--
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,981.261,982.03,--and they do have different numbers.
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,982.93,992.968,"--So we -- so do we add up all of the diseases in the world, all the potential diseases, and pick a percentage that this covers within that range?"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,992.968,993.753,"Well, this--"
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,993.753,997.789,I think Justice Breyer is asking you for something that doesn't involve that.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,997.789,998.522,--Well--
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,998.522,1005.276,That involves some greater answer to the issue of limitation.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1005.276,1011.715,--I -- I think what the Court did in Flook and what it did in Bilski is ask if a broad field is being preempted.
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.786,1020.571,What if -- what if they -- what if they just split up the patent?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1032.128,1032.645,Well--
2011.10-1150,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1032.645,1034.195,"Would each of them be okay, because--"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1034.195,1034.945,"--No, it wouldn't."
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1047.836,1065.13,"Yeah, but what my opinion lacked, frankly, and sometimes that's the virtue of a dissent in such a case, it lacked -- and Novartis points this out very well in their brief -- it lacked an explanation as to why what I thought was a patent just said, observe the correlation--"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1065.13,1065.514,Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1065.514,1069.784,--why isn't that an application of the law of nature?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1076.688,1084.961,"Well, if -- if -- observe the -- that's another area of the breadth of this patent, because there is no specific action the doctor has to take."
2011.10-1150,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1102.255,1111.361,"Is there -- Mr. Shapiro, is there a patent that Prometheus could have written that you think would have met the 101 test."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1111.361,1112.028,Certainly.
2011.10-1150,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1120.384,1124.419,So if they had added a treatment protocol that would have been a completely different case?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1124.419,1125.103,Yes.
2011.10-1150,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1125.103,1126.871,And what makes it a completely different case?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1126.871,1136.31,What makes it different is that leaves room for Mayo Clinic to come up with different numbers that it believes are more accurate and more helpful for patients that are suffering from these life-threatening diseases.
2011.10-1150,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1142.797,1143.749,"Well, I think I'm not sure I understand that."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1151.103,1159.59,"Well, that could be specific enough again that others could have a rival test that -- that used a different treatment protocol."
2011.10-1150,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1160.542,1161.575,So if the idea--
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1161.575,1165.778,But then why didn't you answer her first question that it was -- that it was not patentable?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1166.728,1167.745,"Well, I think--"
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1167.745,1169.397,--I think I am having the same problem as Justice Kagan.
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1169.397,1169.73,--I think it would be patentable.
2011.10-1150,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.73,1178.669,"Why can't you just go -- the hypothetical was -- was one range, one result -- pardon me, one measurement, one result."
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1183.871,1190.644,"Well, I don't think they can -- they can wipe out the entire field so that others can't have rival tests that use different numbers."
2011.10-1150,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1200.0,1214.176,"--I guess the question -- the question I'm asking is, in your response to me is the difference the -- the extent of the ranges, or is the difference that there would be clear treatment decisions attached to those ranges?"
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1214.176,1215.892,I think you would need both.
2011.10-1150,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1234.756,1237.173,How many patents of this type are out there?
2011.10-1150,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1237.173,1240.844,My view is there are only a couple of them.
2011.10-1150,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1283.987,1284.821,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1293.092,1295.378,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2011.10-1150,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1318.827,1336.621,"Mr. Shapiro just told us, when I asked him that question based on your brief, that people need to know up front that this is not a patentable subject matter; very important that it be 101 and not 102 and 103."
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1346.643,1374.71,"I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that from the perspective of the United States and the PTO, it's exactly the opposite; that importing these -- taking, as Justice Kennedy suggested, taking up the temptation to import a look into novelty and nonobviousness into the 101 inquiry is going to be very destabilizing; 101, as Bilski said, is a threshold eligibility test and the question is whether there is a process."
2011.10-1150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1387.818,1391.505,That -- in your test for that -- I see on page 9 of your brief you say:
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1425.143,1425.876,No.
2011.10-1150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1427.595,1427.978,"No, no, no, no."
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1429.045,1430.297,You can't get a patent for it.
2011.10-1150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1430.297,1431.28,--That's patent-eligible?
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1431.28,1440.485,"But that's our -- that's our point, Mr. Chief Justice, that the right way to look at this issue is under 102 and under 103, and I think--"
2011.10-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1440.485,1440.936,Why?
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1441.787,1442.387,--Because--
2011.10-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1442.387,1445.472,Look: Anything can be transformed into a process.
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1453.928,1456.53,--Most are pretty obvious.
2011.10-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.53,1458.147,Why not cut them off at the pass?
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1475.659,1476.359,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1476.359,1482.146,"--Well, I will add a little bit to this because I am questioning what you say here in the other direction."
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1502.559,1504.459,Our position is a little different.
2011.10-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1504.459,1504.844,All right.
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1507.078,1507.963,"Your Honor, if I could, if I could."
2011.10-1150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1558.645,1579.142,"I was just going to say, what is the great advantage you see of putting this critical question off until the 102, 103 analysis, rather than cutting it off at the beginning, 101, which I understand your friend to say is very important because you don't want people to have to pause terribly long to see if this is something they can do?"
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1579.142,1592.45,"As a practical matter, at the PTO, Mr. Chief Justice, it doesn't make any difference, because the PTO examiner gets a patent application and answers every question, 101, 102, 103, 112, and makes a decision about all of them."
2011.10-1150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.068,1596.585,What about litigation?
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1603.591,1612.197,Not if one moves the novelty and obviousness inquiries from 102 and 103 into 101.
2011.10-1150,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1615.916,1616.366,"Well, I'm not so sure."
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1625.421,1628.973,"I think this case is a pretty good illustration, Justice Kennedy, of why that's not true."
2011.10-1150,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1648.62,1657.107,"But, General, I read you in part as saying: Don't worry, because if something strikes you as wrong with this patent, we are going to catch it under 102."
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1680.52,1682.638,"But there was no new process, Justice Kagan."
2011.10-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.536,1729.953,What about--
2011.10-1150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1729.953,1732.636,Justice Scalia?
2011.10-1150,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.636,1740.975,--What about the discovery of a new physical change in the body caused by an old drug?
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1750.699,1766.292,"Well, I think that's a harder question, but there are, for example -- and I think the Court was looking at some of this in the Caraco case on Monday, follow-on patents with respect to pharmaceutical products, where you patent it originally for one use and then you can later patent it when you discover a different use."
2011.10-1150,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1773.03,1787.04,Could I ask you about your argument that the correlations that were discovered and that are involved here are not natural phenomenon because the thiopurine drugs are synthetic products of human ingenuity?
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1801.965,1816.809,"The existence of a pollutant in the air and its effect probably is a natural phenomenon, but the difference here is that there is a conversion of the natural body chemistry."
2011.10-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1846.411,1850.113,"--Yes, but this drug is patentable because it's a -- what is the third word."
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1855.517,1855.95,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.052,1859.469,They don't have to be.
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1885.369,1886.636,"Well, but that's a use patent."
2011.10-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.821,1889.855,That isn't a process patent.
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1889.855,1891.523,"--Yes, it's a process patent."
2011.10-1150,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1894.559,1895.259,All right.
2011.10-1150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1895.259,1896.261,Finish your sentence.
2011.10-1150,1,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1896.261,1905.95,"--If one says that it's nonpatentable because all you are doing is patenting the application of a law of nature, you're invalidating all those process patents."
2011.10-1150,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1906.75,1907.2,"Thank you, General."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,1910.569,1913.104,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2113.585,2115.204,And that's a natural phenomenon.
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2115.204,2120.488,"It is a -- It's according to a law of nature, and I will agree with that, Your Honor."
2011.10-1150,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2147.675,2152.727,"Yes, but if photosynthesis is induced by a lamp inside a building, then it's not a natural phenomenon?"
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2152.727,2156.28,I think you could probably get a patent.
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2163.85,2170.421,"I thought of two examples that will try to get you to talk about the problem that's really bothering me here, anyway."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2170.421,2171.623,"I would love to, Your Honor."
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2171.623,2172.523,Well.
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2260.431,2261.614,"Okay, You Honor."
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.085,2297.803,Where is lack of novelty?
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2305.074,2316.249,"--Your Honor, the law, as you well know, recognizes that under section 103, if something would have been obvious to someone with ordinary skill in the art--"

2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2324.77,2335.912,"--Your Honor, the first person who came up 10,000 years ago with the best way to do -- to use fertilizer in a way that nobody had ever done before would presumably get it."
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2343.149,2344.268,"No, no."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2351.838,2352.172,To make--
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2352.172,2361.794,"And if you put too little in the answer to that question, I believe I can take things that like E equals mc-squared and make them patentable."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2365.097,2368.133,"--Your Honor, I will try very hard not to do either."
2011.10-1150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2489.162,2502.22,"Why couldn't someone come up with the idea that at a level which is in the range that is within your patent, that if at a certain level for a certain -- a person of a certain age, you administer a new drug, you have a new result?"
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2505.255,2514.944,"Your Honor, in that case they could get an improvement patent on it, first of all, no question about it, that they could apply for an improvement patent."
2011.10-1150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2514.944,2515.73,But the--
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2515.73,2516.68,They're building on it.
2011.10-1150,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2516.68,2520.932,"--Petitioner is saying that if you think about that, it's an infringement."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2520.932,2525.085,"Well, there's a -- let me explain why I think there is not a problem with that, Your Honor."
2011.10-1150,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2737.79,2739.374,"But, Mr. Bress, here's what you have not done."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2756.336,2758.221,"--I agree it would, Your Honor."
2011.10-1150,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2760.254,2782.403,"And I think that the difference that people are noting or some people are noting is that this is not a treatment protocol, it's not a treatment regimen, all you have done is pointed out a set of facts that exist in the world, that exist in the world, and are claiming protection for something that anybody can try to make use of in any way and you are saying you have to pay us."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2782.403,2782.836,Right.
2011.10-1150,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2785.438,2786.588,I thought you might not.
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2786.588,2787.557,--why.
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2917.758,2924.762,What about a process that all the steps are -- it's a process to -- to generate some useful information.
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2924.762,2925.696,--Yes.
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2925.696,2927.231,Fine.
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2931.416,2933.201,Yes.

2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2938.971,2940.371,"Actually, Your Honor, yes."
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2940.371,2940.64,What?
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2941.973,2942.323,Certainly.
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2956.233,2956.933,"No, no."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2984.05,2989.788,"--I'm not sure that I am understanding, Your Honor, because the patent that tells you where to find the ore is telling you what you're going to--"
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2989.788,2992.656,--But you don't know what you are going to find because you don't know how much ore you are going to find?
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,2994.208,3008.166,"--Well, and if we talk about modern days because I think it's helpful now to move this forward, the court has never suggested that there is an extra statutory limitation that prevents patents on developing useful information, even if they have a mental step at the end."
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3069.806,3070.323,What's your view?
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3070.323,3073.477,"--Okay, Your Honor, I'm happy to address that, too."
2011.10-1150,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.344,3076.596,You should not lose it.
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3076.596,3077.362,You should not lose.
2011.10-1150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3194.923,3199.125,"Suppose somebody thinks you're wrong, that the numbers you've come up with are wrong."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3208.881,3209.516,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1150,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.516,3209.883,No?
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3209.883,3210.649,And let's explain why not.
2011.10-1150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3286.099,3297.389,"Well, it seems to me that's your -- the problem with your whole approach is that every time you're pressed on 101, your answer is to fall back to 102 or 103 or the utility part of 101."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3303.727,3307.346,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; I appreciate the question."
2011.10-1150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3346.221,3348.589,"Well, just as -- I'm sorry to interrupt."
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3369.003,3372.455,"--Well, Your Honor, again, if -- if it's very clear that we're not novel."
2011.10-1150,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3408.811,3409.411,So that's novel.
2011.10-1150,2,38746,richard_p_bress,,3411.496,3412.53,--Right.
2011.10-1150,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3434.361,3435.178,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1150,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3438.147,3443.801,Justice Scalia asked the critical question here: what if you think these numbers are wrong?
2011.10-1150,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3469.784,3473.986,He says the solution to that is that -- you're saying their patent is not useful.
2011.10-1150,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3476.688,3480.307,--It's important that 101 be the robust test here.
2011.10-1150,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3561.508,3575.267,"I guess my problem is, if we call this just simply a application of natural phenomenon or of a natural process, why are treatment patents at all--"
2011.10-1150,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3575.267,3576.917,"Well, because--"
2011.10-1150,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3576.917,3588.325,"--permissible, meaning if someone finds out that at level 300, it's bad, and tells doctors to stop, that's natural, too."
2011.10-1150,3,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3588.325,3589.325,--Yes.
2011.10-1150,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3678.433,3679.167,"Thank you, counsel."
