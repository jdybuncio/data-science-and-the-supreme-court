1984.83-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.295,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Hensley.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,43.991,47.351,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.825,158.655,"Ms. Oberly, do you take the position that a Terry stop could be made to investigate a past misdemeanor offense?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,158.655,166.209,"I think that it probably could be, Your Honor, although this here is a past felony offense."
1984.83-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.209,166.82,"Yes, I know."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,166.82,169.672,But it would depend somewhat on the circumstances.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,247.874,261.593,May I ask if the law enforcement interest would have been served if the wanted flyer disclosed whether or not a warrant had been issued for the individual?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,266.805,268.477,"They certainly could, Your Honor."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,273.24,278.232,"Except that the police can control what they put in the flyers, but you can't control the informer's tips."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,278.232,278.833,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,304.95,309.804,"But if the flyer had said there is no warrant outstanding, then I take it they wouldn't have even stopped him?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,309.804,319.72,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, because the flyer was issued six days before the Covington, Kentucky, police department came upon Respondent."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,338.262,342.885,Does the record tell us how long it normally takes to find out if a warrant is outstanding?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,342.885,347.649,"--No, but if it's been computerized it's a matter of minutes, and they--"
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,347.649,356.234,"And had they been able to get that information in that matter of minutes, they could have avoided the necessity for a stop, is that not right?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,356.234,359.156,"--No, Your Honor, not on the facts of this case."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,369.142,369.923,I understand.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,369.923,377.66,He radioed to his despatcher and said: I just spotted Tommy Hensley and he took off; could you check and see if there's a warrant on him?
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,432.514,437.178,And how much additional time would you judge was required to find out the answer?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,437.178,442.992,"Well, in this case they never had to find out the answer, because within minutes--"
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.992,444.042,I understand that.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,444.042,445.193,--within minutes of stopping him--
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,445.193,446.813,They arrested him for something else.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,454.079,461.714,"--I don't think that... just as the Court has said in previous cases, in Florida versus Royer, there's no precise time limit."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.714,463.286,"Well, would they have kept him for an hour?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,463.286,465.607,"I think that would be excessive here, Your Honor."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,465.607,466.839,Could they have kept for 15 minutes?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,466.839,470.031,Probably 15 minutes would have been justifiable.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.031,474.232,Do you think they could have kept him under surveillance while he was in his car for 15 minutes?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,478.675,480.616,"No, and I think that that fact is totally irrelevant."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.637,491.124,"Well, if they can tail the man who's abiding by the law while he's driving through the street for the same period of time it takes to get the information, why isn't that preferable?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,491.124,496.578,"--If they had enough officers to make sure that they weren't going to lose track of him, that might be one way to proceed."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,506.025,509.175,"Well, they made him put his hands up on the car and they pulled a gun on him."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,509.175,512.057,Which is clearly permissible under Pennsylvania versus Mimms.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.008,519.402,"Well, it's not the same as Pennsylvania against Mimms, because that man had violated the law in the Pennsylvania case."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,519.402,520.942,--That man had made a traffic violation.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.183,540.086,There's a different legal justification?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,542.868,551.313,"--The officers here, Your Honor, were not relying on having seen him commit a traffic offense, having seen him do anything else wrong in their presence."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.366,561.48,And on their own inability to keep him under surveillance for the time to determine whether the warrant was outstanding.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,561.48,563.501,Because he was in a moving automobile.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,563.501,563.982,Right.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,563.982,565.371,That's correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,566.292,569.634,"Well, wasn't there testimony that ""he took off""?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,569.634,570.974,"--Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1984.83-1330,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,572.316,574.867,You just said a minute ago that he wasn't violating the speed limit.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,577.95,581.172,--There's no testimony as to how fast he took off.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.17,594.399,"Well, it's clear he did not violate the law--"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,594.399,594.669,That's correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,594.669,595.731,--or that surely would be in the record.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,595.731,596.362,That's correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,603.155,605.809,"Well, when you take off, how fast are you going?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,605.809,610.471,"Well, my car doesn't take off too fast."
1984.83-1330,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,615.874,618.018,"Then you wouldn't say he was taking off, would you?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,618.018,618.556,Pardon?
1984.83-1330,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,618.556,621.688,Isn't 55 miles an hour?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,621.688,628.684,"You have to start at zero, Your Honor, and then it depends on how rapidly you can accelerate."
1984.83-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.684,647.006,"Ms. Oberly, would it make any difference in this case if the St. Bernard police in fact didn't have enough information to justify a reasonable Terry stop?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,647.006,649.057,"Yes, Your Honor, that would be critical."
1984.83-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,684.032,696.7,"And if the St. Bernard officers did not have sufficient information in their possession to justify issuance of the flyer, you would suggest the evidence should be suppressed, is that right?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,696.7,713.421,"Under this Court's ruling in Whiteley versus Warden, that would be the result, unless... and we don't contend it's present in this case, but the exception would be if the Covington officers had somehow prior to the stop developed their own information to justify a stop."
1984.83-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,724.256,749.384,"Do you take the position that the St. Bernard police could properly ask another police department to detain the Respondent until they got there for something like that, or are you just asking this Court to determine that a Terry stop can be made long enough to determine whether there is a warrant outstanding?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,749.384,757.739,"For this case, we only ask that you determine the latter, that the Terry stop may be made long enough to determine if there's a warrant outstanding."
1984.83-1330,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,757.739,771.528,"Well, are you suggesting, then, that we're to decide this case on the premise that the stop by the Kentucky officers was only until they had time enough to find out whether an arrest warrant had issued?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,771.528,773.25,"That's correct, and that's the uncontroverted arrest."
1984.83-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,773.25,774.31,In other words... I see.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,778.533,781.585,"There was no interrogation, Your Honor, by the Kentucky officers, except to--"
1984.83-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,781.585,785.428,"No, I'm trying to get at what your position is as to why they stopped him."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,785.428,791.993,--They stopped him... the uncontroverted testimony is they stopped him solely to find out whether there was an arrest warrant.
1984.83-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,791.993,793.703,And that's what you want us to decide--
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,793.703,794.194,That's correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,794.194,795.223,--if it was an admissible stop?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,795.223,795.994,That's correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.994,801.918,But they didn't stop him as a source of information as to whether there was an arrest warrant.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,801.918,802.449,No.
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.116,834.889,"Well, Ms. Oberly, the flyer asked the police to stop this man, didn't it?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,834.889,836.351,"Yes, it did."
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.351,840.874,"And based on just reasonable suspicion, I suppose."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,840.874,841.444,Correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.106,844.817,"Well, I know, but--"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,844.817,845.848,--we're willing to submit it--
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.848,848.079,--the officer who issued it didn't even think he had probable cause.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,848.079,849.501,--His testimony is conflicting.
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,849.501,849.519,Yes.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,851.953,852.421,Correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.421,854.384,So they asked another police department to stop him.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,859.095,859.887,For questioning.
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.887,860.648,Right.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,860.648,868.032,But the Covington officers who made the stop had no intention of detaining this fellow for questioning.
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.032,868.382,All right.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,877.639,882.381,"They could not and would not, according to the testimony, have done that."
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.381,882.832,Why would you say they could not stop him?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,882.832,893.35,"Because they would have known, upon finding out that there was no warrant, that the St. Bernard... that the initiating department, the St. Bernard police, did not have probable cause."
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.35,898.193,"Well, I know, but I thought your point was they had reasonable suspicion to justify a stop."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,898.193,900.233,To find out whether--
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.233,909.88,I would think you... I thought your position was that the people who issued the flyer had reasonable suspicion to justify a Terry stop.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,909.88,910.29,--That's correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.29,912.802,"And if they had encountered the man first, they would have stopped him."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,912.802,914.624,"That's correct, and they could have."
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,914.624,917.546,Why couldn't the people who received the flyer do the same thing?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,917.546,919.266,They could have... well--
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.266,921.067,"Legally, under your position."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,921.067,928.873,"--They could have stopped him long enough to call the St. Bernard police or called the computer people and say, is there a warrant."
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.172,930.853,"Well, I know that."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,932.215,935.068,--The answer comes back no... and I'm trying to follow up on the question.
1984.83-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,954.729,959.231,You say the St. Bernard police also could have made a Terry stop.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,959.231,960.152,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.83-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,960.152,963.996,"But now, they knew that there was no warrant, because the warrant would have been obtained by them."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,965.916,969.419,To ask... what they wanted to stop Respondent for was for questioning.
1984.83-1330,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,991.883,994.985,The Covington police could have done the same thing in your view?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,994.985,1000.181,"Yes, except the problem here is that the Covington police wouldn't have known what to question him about."
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.133,1004.012,"Yes, but that isn't a legal argument."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1007.565,1007.945,--That's correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.266,1015.729,Suppose the St. Bernard police had said: Please ask him the following two questions.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1018.991,1023.014,"--Yes, if they'd been given specific... that's an entirely different situation."
1984.83-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1029.939,1033.871,How long after the stop did they observe the gun?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1033.871,1037.584,"From the record, it appears that it was within three minutes."
1984.83-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1037.584,1038.165,How long?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1038.165,1039.514,Three minutes.
1984.83-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1051.603,1053.215,"Now, was he out of the car?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1053.215,1053.636,Yes.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.185,1129.384,"Ms. Oberly, if you're summing up, does the record tell us... because these words ""took off"" create an impression that may be inaccurate, does the record tell us the length of time between when the vehicle started to move and when it was stopped?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1129.384,1131.175,"It does not tell us precisely, Your Honor."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.022,1152.869,"And as I remember it, the magistrate indicated that one of the officers said there had been no violation, no speeding in violation of law that he observed before stopping him; is that right?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1152.869,1154.239,That's correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.836,1168.02,"So should we judge the case as though the words ""took off"" merely meant they have started the vehicle in motion?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1168.02,1173.083,"That is not the way I would judge... it's not a common sense reading of the words ""took off""."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.083,1174.942,"Well, what do you interpret them to mean?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1174.942,1185.461,"I interpret it, in the context of a police radio transmission, that one officer says he sees the suspect, the suspect saw him and immediately took off, as an indication of flight."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.76,1193.145,"If it were an indication of flight, isn't it almost a certainty that they would have violated the speed limit within two minutes?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1193.145,1197.058,"--I'd like to be able to say yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.6,1211.057,The thing that puzzles me about the Government case is that it sounds as though the stop was necessary to prevent the man from getting away from the officers.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1211.057,1211.397,Correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.397,1212.759,And I don't know if you're really arguing that or not.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1227.158,1229.389,If you have sufficient officers--
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.389,1239.296,"And if you're only trying to find out if there was a warrant outstanding, I don't understand why a competent officer couldn't just keep the car in surveillance while he radios the station and says, tell us whether there's a warrant out for him."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1239.296,1242.907,"--Your Honor, if you have sufficient officers that may all be possible."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.907,1243.278,Even one.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1243.278,1250.634,"With one car at this point, who seeks the vehicle take off... I can't tell you how fast that was because the record doesn't say."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1264.251,1269.627,Why would it be necessary to order him out of the car while they check with the... asked about the--
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1269.627,1278.972,"For the officer's own safety, because the wanted bulletin that they were relying on said consider these men armed and dangerous, and the Covington officers knew from... they knew this Respondent."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.844,1282.374,"--I understand that, but couldn't they park their car--"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1282.374,1283.426,They knew he was armed and dangerous.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.426,1284.784,--Where were the two cars parked when they stopped him?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1284.784,1286.767,Two cars?
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.767,1288.058,The police officer's car--
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1288.058,1289.69,"The police officer wasn't parked, so far as I know."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.09,1294.432,"--But I mean, when he stopped the other vehicle, his vehicle also came to a stop, I assume."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1294.432,1295.103,"Right, correct."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.103,1297.122,"And where were the two cars, next to one another?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1303.076,1311.312,I don't think that having the officer sit in his car ensures that the suspect's car is also going to remain immobile and stay where it is.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.312,1314.434,"You don't think so, with the lights flashing and the police car--"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1314.434,1317.857,"Not given what they knew about these suspects, not at all."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.713,1408.455,"--Well, that's really not quite right, because if they would advise whether there's a warrant outstanding that would decide whether or not they could stop them."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1418.984,1424.677,"And we're in the middle ground, where they needed a very brief period of time to find out whether there was a warrant."
1984.83-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1441.588,1450.023,Why in your view can't the second police department do anything the first police department could do if they were there on the ground?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1450.023,1452.397,I hope that I haven't said they couldn't.
1984.83-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1454.637,1457.289,I got an implication that you negated that.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1457.289,1471.937,"--My position is that, if the first police department has the requisite reasonable suspicion or probable cause, as the case may be, for the action that it would take if it had been the acting department, the second department can take the same action."
1984.83-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1471.937,1477.04,Haven't we in one case said that the knowledge of the one policeman... it was a case out in Wyoming.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1477.04,1478.993,"Whiteley versus Warden, Your Honor."
1984.83-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1478.993,1488.308,"The knowledge of one policeman is the knowledge of all, and the second one may act on what the first man tells him just as though he knew all of the things the first man did."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1488.308,1495.644,"That's correct, and the only caveat to is that the information known to the first department has to be adequate, has to be either reasonable suspicion or probable cause."
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.644,1500.345,"If you take that position, then the second officer must have known there was no warrant outstanding."
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1503.848,1505.25,"No, if he doesn't know--"
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.25,1507.361,"If he knows there's no warrant, you would agree he could not stop him?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1507.361,1507.932,--No.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.174,1543.004,To find out what they're presumed already to know?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1543.004,1544.875,--No.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.263,1560.525,Are they or are they not presumed to know there was no warrant outstanding?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1560.525,1563.547,I don't see how they can be presumed to know that.
1984.83-1330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1563.547,1566.5,Then they are not presumed to know everything that the other office knows.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1566.5,1571.222,They're presumed to take any action that the first department could take.
1984.83-1330,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1578.358,1584.421,So you're saying the presence or absence of a warrant really isn't material to your position?
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1584.421,1592.025,"That's correct, because what we're relying on here is an investigatory stop, which obviously does not require a warrant."
1984.83-1330,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1592.025,1603.974,"And if all that the first jurisdiction had was reason to make an investigatory stop, would that be sufficient for the second jurisdiction to rely on?"
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1603.974,1606.017,"Yes, that translates."
1984.83-1330,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1606.017,1612.019,Because there's no way you can tell from the flyer exactly the basis for the issuance of the flyer itself.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1612.019,1613.11,That's correct.
1984.83-1330,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1613.11,1616.303,I just don't see any relevance to the warrant argument.
1984.83-1330,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1616.303,1621.746,The warrant argument addresses a wholly different set of facts which we don't have in this case.
1984.83-1330,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1649.905,1653.996,Mr. Drennen.
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1653.996,1657.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:"
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1777.549,1791.45,"Mr. Drennen, would you concede that the St. Bernard police could have made a Terry stop of the Respondent in their jurisdiction on reasonable suspicion, even though no warrant had issued."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1791.45,1792.93,"--No, I would not concede that."
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1794.352,1794.683,All right.
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1812.225,1814.243,And he would have the freedom to leave.
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1814.243,1815.505,Yes.
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1815.505,1817.576,But we're not dealing with that particular case.
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1817.576,1822.989,"All right, but I'm asking you to suppose for a moment that the St. Bernard police could have made a Terry stop."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1828.663,1834.75,"No, I don't believe they can, because you have to permit the defendant to leave."
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1856.452,1860.065,"Well, I'm asking you about the stop, not the content of the questions."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1860.065,1864.717,"--Well, that's correct, and if you look at the stop, would the St. Bernard police have stopped him in the same manner that the Covington police did?"
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1893.386,1900.201,"Well, I suppose the testimony is that an officer saw a gun in the open door of the vehicle."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1900.201,1901.212,That is correct.
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1901.212,1904.854,And that provided the justification for a further search.
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1904.854,1905.343,That is correct.
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1905.343,1907.186,Within three minutes.
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1907.186,1918.353,"I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, if you read the transcript, the transcript was that's how long it took the officers to get there, not necessarily how long it took all of this to transpire."
1984.83-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1932.883,1935.623,"The flyer said he was armed and dangerous, did it not?"
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,1935.623,1937.095,--It also said pick him up and hold him.
1984.83-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.329,2022.812,"Well, Mr. Drennen, I think the Court of Appeals took a little bit different view of these facts than you're now stating."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2033.829,2039.102,That was the testimony that Officer Coke elicited before the district judge.
1984.83-1330,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2048.829,2053.752,"Well, we're not hear to parse through minute factual details in the record."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2059.064,2069.562,"That is right, and our position is that, though their wording is somewhat inconsistent with the actual findings as I would see them, their finding is correct."
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2215.507,2225.564,"Do I understand you correctly that if a warrant is outstanding in St. Bernard, everything that happened here would have been all right?"
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2225.564,2233.939,"--I believe if a warrant had been issued for the man's arrest, the Covington police have no option but to arrest that person based upon that warrant."
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2367.547,2371.948,But that information they got a little bit after they found the gun.
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2371.948,2378.784,"To be exact, Justice Marshall, it took nine months to find that flyer."
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2378.784,2385.678,"No, I'm talking about when they picked him up, when they found out that there was no warrant."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2389.171,2391.502,"No, that is not correct, Justice Marshall."
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2398.686,2403.721,"I said that the other side didn't, St. Bernard, did not have a warrant."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2406.923,2408.223,St. Bernard knew--
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.223,2411.085,Before or after they found the gun?
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2411.085,2414.217,--Maybe I'm confused by your question.
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.611,2420.652,When?
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2421.363,2423.875,"No, five months after he was stopped, they got a warrant."
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.875,2426.364,I'm talking about five months before.
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2447.95,2449.8,I need to know which department.
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2449.8,2450.681,Sir?
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2450.681,2452.021,Are you asking about Covington?
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.628,2463.999,"Well, that's not according to the testimony I read."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2467.361,2470.844,"That is correct, and it was an ongoing situation."
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.876,2475.406,"Well, let's take it easy."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2478.879,2479.78,That is correct.
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.78,2484.342,"Two, they found out there was no outstanding warrant."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2484.342,2485.994,"That is correct, through the despatcher."
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2485.994,2487.314,"Three, they found the gun."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2487.314,2488.596,That is correct.
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2488.596,2490.867,"Now, have you got all three of those situations--"
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2490.867,2492.189,That's how I see it.
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.189,2493.368,"--Timewise, what was first?"
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2493.368,2497.392,The officers first called in to the despatcher.
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2497.392,2498.023,Right.
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2498.023,2499.392,And maybe here is where--
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.392,2500.414,And what was second?
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2500.414,2503.036,"--It depends on what you mean by ""verify""."
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.379,2511.49,Are you taking the position you don't understand what I'm saying?
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2511.49,2514.382,"Apparently not, because as I see it--"
1984.83-1330,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.382,2515.444,"Well, forget it."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2515.444,2515.914,"--No, no."
1984.83-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2558.52,2564.294,"Mr. Drennen, can I ask you a question if I'm not interrupting your answer?"
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2607.133,2612.707,"No, I don't think in any way, shape or form that's more than just a momentary inconvenience."
1984.83-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2612.707,2613.037,But it's a stop.
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2613.037,2619.472,"It is a stop, but their purpose was not to arrest or to hold; it was solely to advise an individual of something."
1984.83-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2628.425,2629.617,"No, I'm saying pulling a car over, pulling a car over."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2629.617,2637.201,"--or stopping him and pulling him over and saying: Mr. Hensley, St. Bernard has issued a flyer, they want to talk to you, blah, blah, blah, and he looks in and sees the gun."
1984.83-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.267,2648.44,So your whole attack on this is based on getting him out of the car and drawing the gun?
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2648.44,2664.661,"And it's whether or not, in addition to that, whether or not there are specific and articulable facts that that officer, when you look at what he had and what he knew... and in the Whiteley-Warden case, there was a warrant."
1984.83-1330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.445,2676.007,But you've conceded they could stop the vehicle even though there were no warrant and everybody knew there were no warrant?
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2676.007,2676.988,That's right.
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2685.336,2701.645,"Well, Mr. Drennen, your argument seems to turn, at least in part, on the thoughts in the mind of the Covington police officers who made the stop, rather than on objectively examining what they did and what happened."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2721.818,2724.069,I'm not asking you to look inside the officer's head.
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2734.057,2749.336,"Well, if the officer could legitimately have made a brief stop, as you just indicated to Justice Stevens, and that objectively is what had happened here at the time the gun was seen, then don't we stop there?"
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2749.336,2751.537,--No.
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2824.615,2838.195,"Well, but suppose we agree with you that the St. Bernard police could not properly ask another department to make an extended detention of someone until they arrive."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2857.166,2865.771,"No, I don't perceive that as being all right, because he has to be... whatever his conduct for being where he is has to be based upon some proper information."
1984.83-1330,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2872.757,2879.94,"Well, suppose part of the flyer is properly set forth information and part isn't, and he ignores the improper part."
1984.83-1330,1,22188,edward_g_drennen_ii,,2881.332,2886.385,"--Yes, I do, because I don't think the officer can pick and choose what he wants to be insulated against."
1984.83-1330,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2935.158,2937.441,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Oberly?"
1984.83-1330,2,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2937.441,2952.492,"Briefly, Your Honor, the case seems in the last hour to have gotten somewhat confused by a lot of different factual situations, and I would just like to reiterate our two main points, which I don't think depend on all the hypotheticals."
1984.83-1330,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3009.549,3010.961,"Thank you, counsel."
