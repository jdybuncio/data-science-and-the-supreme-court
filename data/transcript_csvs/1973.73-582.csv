1973.73-582,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.375,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-582, City of Pittsburgh against Alco Parking."
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,50.14,54.73,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-582,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,200.787,210.429,"In that connection Mr. Lynch, could the city have prohibited private operation of parking lots anywhere in the city?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,210.429,227.027,"The City of Pittsburgh does not have health powers, so from the standpoint of health in terms of fumes or things in that nature, no."
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,236.939,239.528,That is location and the site?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,239.528,240.3,That is correct.
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,240.3,242.656,And ingress and digress and that sort of thing?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,242.656,243.393,That is correct.
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,243.393,245.97,"But that is all, but they do not prohibit?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,245.97,250.726,The City of Pittsburgh; I do not think in the exercise of its police powers.
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,270.104,274.473,"How about zoning coordinates Mr. Lynch, are there any which prohibit --"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,274.473,278.779,The City of Pittsburgh can control parking by proper exercise of the --
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,278.779,280.84,That is prohibit commercial parking in section -
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,280.84,282.781,"Yes, sections, certain sections, yes sir."
1973.73-582,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,282.781,300.276,"Getting back to my question, could the city in view of the fact that it is in the business and the authority is in the business, could the city have remove from private enterprise, the operation of any parking facility in the City of Pittsburgh?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,300.276,311.458,"No, I do not think that the City of Pittsburgh has on its face any specific power to totally prohibit parking in the Pittsburgh, in the city unless it would --"
1973.73-582,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,311.458,314.635,Are we talking about State Law?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,314.635,315.141,"No, the City of Pittsburgh --"
1973.73-582,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.141,323.985,"What about the question, is the federal constitution in that city from forbidding private parking lots within the city limits?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,323.985,326.828,"No, I do not think the federal constitution would."
1973.73-582,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.828,340.962,"And so assisted say, if Pennsylvania constitution or statutes prohibit themselves permitted Pittsburgh to do this, to prevent entire private parking lots, you would think the federal constitution was committed?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,340.962,346.442,"No, I do not think it would."
1973.73-582,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,346.442,352.134,"Mr. Lynch, the city itself operates parking lots, does it not?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,352.134,355.904,"The City of Pittsburgh operates a small number of lots, yes sir."
1973.73-582,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,355.904,383.398,"Suppose it to have been proved that the principal purpose or a purpose of the city was to put the private lots out of business so that the public city owned lots would be able to make a higher rate of profit, would that give you any trouble constitutionally?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,383.398,389.626,"I think, there might be a problem there Your Honor, but that is not the issue here."
1973.73-582,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,506.141,514.19,"Mr. Lynch, I have feeling that your answers in that last dialog at least confused me."
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,536.223,537.398,No.
1973.73-582,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,537.398,541.637,I think you gave an ambiguous answer perhaps that you did not intend earlier on that.
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,541.637,544.83,No.
1973.73-582,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,546.814,549.45,"Mr. Lynch, one more question there."
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,563.051,576.368,"When the rate was set for the first time at 10% in 1962 effective for the year of 1963, the revenue measure was challenged."
1973.73-582,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.467,615.328,Is there any evidence in the record at all as to whether this tax could be passed on or was being passed on?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,615.328,618.414,That raises one of the second basic issue in the case --
1973.73-582,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.414,619.809,"Alright, we will get to that."
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,619.809,633.844,"-- Your Honor and that is the issue assuming that judicial inquiry is proper, do the facts show that property was taken without due process of law."
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,689.234,696.354,"Is there a spread, a very large one between what the private lots charge and what the municipal operated --"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,696.354,708.601,"There is on the average in many cases, the rates being charged in the publicly own garages are lower than the rates being charged in the private garages."
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,708.601,711.671,Much lower or?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,711.671,721.983,"Well, there is a whole range of rates from whether it is for a half hour to an hour to all day, so that we can say in generally they are lower."
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,721.983,725.116,"Yes, and this has always been so?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,725.116,726.548,Yes.
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.548,738.278,And have the rates for the private lots gone up in larger percentage than the rates for the publicly operated lots?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,738.278,741.089,There is nothing in the record to show that.
1973.73-582,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.755,782.869,"Mr. Lynch, that is a factual question, isn't it on which the Commonwealth Court found a particular way and certainly, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania did not upset that finding."
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,786.408,802.54,But we have an issue here Your Honor which deals with the Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution and you are free to examine the facts yourselves to determine whether or not there has been a constitutional violation.
1973.73-582,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.54,805.651,Even strictly historical fact?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,805.651,808.342,"Yes, because the -- I do not think it is fact."
1973.73-582,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,825.565,833.125,"No, I agree with you on that, but then the very next, in a parenthetical expression right after they say that in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania."
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,845.597,858.263,"Yes, I think you are Your Honor because that goes to the constitutionality of the ordinance, which is being tested as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and this Court has permitted that in prior cases."
1973.73-582,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.263,869.339,Even if it work can passed on and they’re appointing (voice overlap) finding in any company without business or was forced out of business?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,869.339,874.362,The record does not indicate that one company has gone out of business.
1973.73-582,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1334.124,1339.127,Does the City of Pittsburgh have any income tax levied down the people who work there?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1339.127,1346.976,1% -- it has a 10% occupation tax on non-residents and a 1% tax on residents.
1973.73-582,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.976,1349.274,What is the 10% occupation tax on?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1349.274,1350.468,"Excuse me, $10.00."
1973.73-582,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.468,1351.571,"Oh, $10.00."
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1351.571,1353.104,$10.00 occupation tax.
1973.73-582,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1355.677,1364.678,Do you have any comment about the curious provision as to making the authority taxable in the ordinance?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1368.6,1369.163,Yes Your Honor.
1973.73-582,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1369.163,1371.635,What is the status of that litigation?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1371.635,1372.792,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-582,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1408.51,1412.263,Is not that just another pocket of the city?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1412.263,1415.515,"No, Your Honor, it is not just another pocket of the city."
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1446.853,1455.324,"So I guess Mr. Lynch, the private parking group brought the litigation, which invalidated the tax against the authority?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1455.324,1456.246,Right.
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1456.246,1457.619,When was this?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1457.619,1463.716,That litigation was commenced about a year-and-a-half ago and the Commonwealth --
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1463.716,1466.073,What was the rate at that time?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1466.073,1466.89,20%
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1466.89,1468.787,And the authority was paying 20%?
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1468.787,1475.362,The authority was paying 20% and operators operating on behalf on the authority were paying 20%.
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1503.964,1509.388,"Well, but you still have to pay it or would have to pay it, if you prevail?"
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1512.34,1513.835,The 20% tax in this case if we prevail?
1973.73-582,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1513.835,1515.005,Yes.
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1515.005,1518.345,Yes Your Honor.
1973.73-582,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1518.345,1521.954,Is that other litigation final now that's --
1973.73-582,0,39734,ralph_lynch_jr,,1521.954,1538.373,There is a petition for certiorari pending in Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
1973.73-582,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.373,1540.9,Mr. Boreman.
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1540.9,1544.557,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1626.459,1639.469,"Mr. Boreman, is that in the context where those holdings in the context of the parking authority itself being subject to the tax or was this after the invalidation of the taxes --"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1639.469,1642.625,Let me explain that Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1677.539,1681.115,Do you think the 15% tax was unconstitutional too?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1681.115,1681.549,I beg pardon?
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1681.549,1684.617,"When it was 15%, do you think that was unconstitutional?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1684.617,1690.584,"I think it would be, Your Honor, yes, if the fact show, but we think this record shows and what I propose to discuss --"
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1690.584,1691.982,How about 10%?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1691.982,1695.846,"There, I think there might be a proper --"
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.846,1699.844,What about -- was the parking authority subject to the same tax or wasn't it?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1699.844,1706.375,"Yes, let me explain that, Your Honor because I am counsel in the case which invalidated the parking for these, some of these same plaintiffs, but there are others."
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1742.43,1744.252,Every one of them lease to a private operator?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1744.252,1744.806,Yes Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1744.806,1745.225,Everyone?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1745.225,1746.587,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1808.406,1810.054,Why can’t you pass it on?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1810.054,1810.942,I beg pardon sir.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1810.942,1813.252,Pass the tax on?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1813.252,1816.918,"The tax cannot be passed on for a several reasons, Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1839.233,1843.547,"Now, might he be operating some of parking authority unto a lease as well as independently?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1843.547,1845.531,"Yes, Your Honor, yes Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.804,1874.03,How many more spaces could you use right now?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1874.03,1874.703,"Well, the --"
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1874.703,1877.359,"Is that 4,000 figure correct?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1877.359,1879.071,It is a misleading figure Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1879.071,1881.166,But is it correct?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1881.166,1883.518,"Well, I am not being an expert on this subject, I cannot say --"
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1883.518,1886.957,"Well, is there anything there to contradict it in the record?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1886.957,1888.61,There is no actual testimony.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1894.869,1896.146,It is in the record?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1896.146,1896.978,It is in the record.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1897.238,1899.435,And there is nothing in the record to the contrary?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1899.435,1907.666,"No Your Honor because there is no expert testimony that contradicts and I would not want to contradict that, but I would want to explain it Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.457,1923.515,What it is the best figure we have so far?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1923.515,1925.137,"Yes, Your Honor but it is the --"
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.137,1928.149,What else do we have to go on except the best we now have?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1928.149,1931.439,"Well, I think it needs -- it requires and deserves explaining Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1933.456,1936.724,"Would you explain the way of the facts, I will listen."
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,1936.724,1937.796,Good.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1998.19,2004.51,I do not know of any parking authority or any place in the plain world is filed 24 hours a day.
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2004.51,2004.688,That is right.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.688,2006.906,"So, that is not in this case?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2006.906,2007.845,That is right Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.845,2014.074,"But only thing we have in this case about passed it on is that your people would say, “we cannot do it.”"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2014.074,2020.29,And the Supreme Court found that they did not have to do it in the Commonwealth Court would find that they cannot do it.
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.726,2211.724,Is it your position that the city violates the constitution when it simply imposes the gross receipts tax that has the result of reducing the number of customers for parking lot spaces?

1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.952,2230.855,How many public parking spaces were there that's run by the authority?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2230.855,2231.912,"6,000."
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.912,2233.879,And how many total in the city?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2233.879,2239.374,"In the downtown section of the city which is where the concentration is 24,000 all together."
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.532,2261.507,"Well, I suppose it means that the tax would probably might guarantee as the price got higher and higher that the spaces in the authority and lots would always be full?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2261.507,2271.837,"If the private operators were compelled to increase their rates, which they cannot do because if they do, they make the competition with the parking authority that much worse."
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.837,2278.316,"Well it cannot get any worst in 5 or 6,000 places, full places"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2278.316,2278.469,"Yes, it can."
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.469,2281.18,But it can reduce the number of cars that come into park?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2281.18,2282.065,"Yes, it can Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.363,2287.842,But it has not happened though?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2287.842,2289.074,"Yes, it has happened Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.074,2301.134,"Yeah, but that isn't what -- I would suppose that it is the reduction of the number of people who want parking spaces that would get to you pretty fast."
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2310.295,2315.123,"No, but we do not have that statistic, Your Honor, but we do have one statistic in the record."

1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.921,2355.975,Were they always full?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2355.975,2357.016,-- on page 640.
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.639,2369.813,"So, their spaces were going begging too to some extent?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2369.813,2370.977,Yes Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2372.54,2378.176,"When Myer’s tried to raise its rates at the time, as I understand you when the tax were 15%."
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2378.176,2378.943,Yes.
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2378.943,2383.199,Were the public authority lots are also paying the 15% tax?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2383.199,2383.819,Yes Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2383.819,2384.473,At that time?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2384.473,2384.665,They were.
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2384.665,2386.548,Did they try to raise it?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2388.154,2389.614,"No Your Honor, they did not."
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2411.807,2423.055,Do you agree with your friend that there is nothing in the federal constitution to prevent Pittsburgh from taking over all of the parking?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2423.055,2424.099,I agree.
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2424.099,2424.76,"You see, public utility --"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2424.76,2430.893,I agree on one basis that that is an actual condemnation and I would say that constitutionally they would have to pay damages.
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2433.068,2434.454,"Well, I do not mean taking them over."
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2444.814,2447.588,I would say that that is itself is a taking.
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2447.588,2453.373,But do you think it was at the taking when the Eighteenth Amendment was passed and saloons went out of business?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2453.373,2459.523,"That Your Honor comes under the category of cases I think Your Honor is quite familiar, the obnoxious substance cases."
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2479.076,2481.918,"Well, isn’t the liquor business a legitimate business now?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2481.918,2487.037,It is now because of the Eighteenth Amendment I think but possibly before.
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2522.445,2526.393,Was it the taking when it was 15%?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2526.393,2527.629,I think it was Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2529.528,2531.534,There was no complaint then?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2531.534,2535.039,"Well, the tax only lasted a year."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.307,2593.027,What is there in the record that show to use your language that broke the camel’s back?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2598.047,2598.558,Yes Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2601.514,2604.802,Which one shows that the camel’s back is broken?

1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2642.796,2645.572,And that shows for all of your clients?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2645.572,2646.338,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2651.073,2655.645,"I thought you had several thousands of this, where is your 46?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2655.645,2661.042,"Several thousand parking spaces Your Honor, 46 locations, 17,000 spaces."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2661.042,2664.905,How many spaces -- how many locations do you have?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2664.905,2671.694,These 46 are the total of the total locations in the downtown area of Pittsburgh.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2671.694,2674.153,And you're just about bankrupt?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2674.153,2682.661,"Yes, it shows a gross of $8 Million and on the basis of that $8 Million with the parking tax at 20%, there is a loss of $270,000."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2682.661,2683.188,Yes.
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2683.188,2687.095,And the figures in 1969 show that on the basis of $7 million --

1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2692.664,2693.232,Yes.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2693.808,2695.827,Passing the tax on.
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2695.827,2696.487,Yes Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.626,2716.432,Why don't you make them raise their rates?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2718.999,2721.532,"Well Your Honor, I wish that that was easy as you --"
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.532,2723.491,You are not arguing equal protection at all.
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2728.009,2729.013,I want to say that under this --
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2729.013,2730.083,Is that right?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2730.083,2730.926,I beg your pardon?
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2730.926,2733.247,You are just arguing confiscation here?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2733.247,2733.712,No Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.061,2745.476,That is not confiscation.
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2745.476,2745.909,"Well, --"
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2745.909,2747.841,Listen again --
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2747.841,2748.788,Part of the --
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2748.788,2753.031,"All I am saying is that is your only point, you are not arguing equal protection?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2753.031,2754.05,Oh and that is right Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2758.889,2776.938,"Mr. Boreman, the figure that has been mentioned here and I think it is in the opinions of the Court is that 71% of the parking spaces available are privately owned and operated, the city having 29%."
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2776.938,2777.912,25%.
1973.73-582,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2777.912,2778.649,25%?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2778.649,2780.454,And there is 4% scattered around the small operates.
1973.73-582,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2780.454,2781.668,Right.
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2788.454,2790.426,"No, not the last 10 years."
1973.73-582,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2817.756,2827.18,Is there an exhibit that shows the dates of the introduction of the government owned parking facilities?

1973.73-582,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2845.366,2846.406,That is (Voice Overlap)
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2846.406,2849.07,That commences on page 616 of the record.
1973.73-582,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2849.07,2859.286,616?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,2859.286,2876.425,"It is quite a lengthy study and I cannot put my figure on the exact spot where it gives the number of parking authority garages but Your Honor, I do not think we have placed in the record all of them because since this case was tried, there are several new ones."
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.486,3069.608,"So you think, I suppose you would think it would a taking also of City of Pittsburgh if it didn't operate any parking lots of is own, simply imposed a minimum schedule of parking fees in order to limit the entry of cars into the downtown area and they put the minimum price that are high enough so that people wouldn't pay it?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3069.608,3070.599,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3074.834,3080.101,"Well, suppose that they just bar it all downtown parking?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3080.101,3083.035,As a police power regulation?
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3113.572,3125.088,"But as far as they are exposed, they do it to -- see to it that people come in the center of town on a publicly owned bus system or subway system or some such reasons as that?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3125.088,3128.948,I think there they would have to pay compensation because that is a resource activity.
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.388,3155.706,"As long as the tax in this case at first at least was on, until you managed to get it invalidated, was on the city activity and on the private activity also?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3155.706,3156.724,On the parking authority?
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.724,3157.546,Yes.
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3157.546,3158.213,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.213,3169.243,"But wait a minute, wait a minute and I am sure before the tax went on, the rates were disparate also because you say that the parking authority has an advantage?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3169.243,3169.927,Yes.
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3169.927,3180.26,"Now, if they put a level tax on, the two remain disparate but they are both are suffering the burden to that extent."
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3181.951,3186.47,"But the parking authority does not, there are other advantages which enables it to charge lower rates."
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.47,3187.989,But that was too before the tax went on?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3187.989,3190.522,Yes and would still be the truth if they did what you say.
1973.73-582,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3190.522,3201.861,But why would you say that the government resource is enhanced if they tax both the city and the private?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3201.861,3210.597,"Because by reason -- because number one this tax is so excessive and number 2 by reason of the other advantages, we still cannot compete."
1973.73-582,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3219.733,3223.743,But they always had that and they never put this special tax on it.
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3226.155,3231.181,"Yes but now -- but they always didn't have a 20% tax, now what --"
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3231.181,3232.945,Were they always full?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3232.945,3233.279,Beg your pardon?
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3233.279,3235.6,Were the public parking lots always full?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3235.6,3236.544,No Your Honor.
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3238.766,3245.173,They are always full in certain peak hours just as yours are full in certain peak hours?
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3245.173,3246.654,"Generally, yes."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3246.654,3255.929,"So, how is the fact that they do not pay you they are not going to their (Inaudible), there is no room in there from 12 to 2, am I right?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3255.929,3257.106,That maybe right so that --
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3257.106,3260.767,"So, I am going to lose from 12 to 2 if you raise your rates from 12?"
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3260.767,3263.897,"Your business does not just go on for 2 hours a day Your Honor, it goes along for 24 hours."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3263.897,3267.346,"Well, that is 2 hours I am talking about."
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3270.863,3272.996,"Well, how much could you raise if the record shows that --"
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3272.996,3274.619,"I do not know, that's your problem."
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3274.619,3276.604,"Well, the problem has been solved Your Honor."
1973.73-582,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3276.604,3277.323,You do not want to say --
1973.73-582,1,34142,leonard_boreman,,3277.323,3278.953,The problem has been solved in a month.
