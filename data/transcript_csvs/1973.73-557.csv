1973.73-557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.812,"We will hear arguments next in 73-557, Jenkins against Georgia."
1973.73-557,0,34896,louis_nizer,,35.904,38.426,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.767,943.475,"Mr. Nizer, can I ask -- I believe, let’s assume you’re correct in saying that under Miller, a movie would not be obscene unless and it was “hard core” or let me assume that it’s “hard core”, whatever you might mean by “hard core”."
1973.73-557,0,34896,louis_nizer,,952.544,955.131,"It would end the case there quite right, Mr. Justice White."
1973.73-557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,955.131,968.846,But there’s hardly any room then for a local standard could be whatever the local standard might be but if a work didn’t happen to be “hard core” the work wouldn’t been obscene.
1973.73-557,0,34896,louis_nizer,,968.846,969.649,That is right.
1973.73-557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.039,975.966,"And the “hard core” standard, if that is the standard is a national standard, is it not?"
1973.73-557,0,34896,louis_nizer,,975.966,976.088,Yes.
1973.73-557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.088,977.742,It’s a First Amendment standard.
1973.73-557,0,34896,louis_nizer,,977.742,978.405,Right.
1973.73-557,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.054,1005.44,"Well, again I just suggest that if it’s “hard core” pornography and it is that Miller limits obscenity definition to the argument about national and local standard, you are beside the point."
1973.73-557,0,34896,louis_nizer,,1005.44,1006.371,Yes.
1973.73-557,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.465,1177.967,"Why is that argument any stronger, Mr. Nizer, than the argument that the producer ought not to be compelled to tailor his product to the perhaps vagaries of 50 different states."
1973.73-557,0,34896,louis_nizer,,1177.967,1195.359,"If this Court would recognize a review of its consideration as to a national standard which is what your question, Justice Rehnquist implies to me, we would not be unhappy."
1973.73-557,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.62,1205.748,"You are having rejected the national standard, how much force is there in the argument that although we can see we have to do it for 50 different states, we shouldn’t have to go beyond that."
1973.73-557,0,34896,louis_nizer,,1205.748,1220.956,"Great force in that the vulcanization of this issue of submissions to 78,000 potential divisions as against 50 states seems to me to be great in difference in degree."
1973.73-557,1,42835,tony_h_hight,,1850.397,1855.651,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
