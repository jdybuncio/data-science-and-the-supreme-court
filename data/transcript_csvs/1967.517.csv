1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,383.556,384.621,Yes sir.
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.0,389.979,"Yes, tell me was this a jury trial?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,389.979,392.104,"No sir, to a judge."
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,397.376,431.825,"Well, is there anything in the record which indicates that the -- accepting the Supreme Court's holding that this is a New York Times case, is there anything at all to indicate whether or not in reaching the judgment on what basis the trial judge raised it, did he set -- did he hold anywhere that he -- on your motion after Times was decided, I reconsidered this, I apply the New York Times rule, I say there is evidence of reckless disregard?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,431.825,434.384,"Yes sir and his reasons for judgment, I am --"
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,434.384,434.944,Where is that?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,436.142,442.927,"So, on page 25 of the writ, it would be in --"
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,442.927,444.038,On this appendix?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,444.038,444.864,"Yes sir, it's -- I'm trying to give it to you now."
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,444.864,447.952,Yes.
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,447.952,454.789,He did say it in there.
1967.517,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,454.789,461.1,Is it in the brief of the petition for certiorari?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,461.1,466.944,(Inaudible)
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,466.944,469.995,"The reasons for judgment at page 141 of the record, is that it?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,469.995,477.629,"141, I believe those are the initial reasons sir yet they're not the ones considering the --"
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,477.629,478.852,"154 then, would it be?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,478.852,479.556,Yes sir.
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,479.556,483.762,I see.
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,483.762,485.911,"In the reason it starts at 154, correct sir."
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,511.684,514.986,"Well, I'm just trying to get this in focus."
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,514.986,515.581,"Yes sir, well that --"
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,515.581,524.451,"As I understand it then he did say, ""Well, I'll look at this evidence in light of the New York Times rule which I must apply."""
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,524.451,524.947,Yes sir.
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,524.947,536.838,And I -- and then he analyzes it from 157 and 158 and he said this satisfies the New York Times rule and what's your position that that evidence could not possibly satisfy the New York Times rule?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,536.838,557.295,"No sir, we say it's -- it satisfies it but what he says when he comes down to the application of the New York Times he says that the -- it does apply but yet that we find there is actual malice in that there was a reckless disregard or whether this was true or not that St. Amant recklessly disregard what was truth."
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.457,576.381,So your point here -- you're -- you answer Mr. Justice Brennan yes?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,576.381,576.473,Yes sir.
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.473,582.479,"And you're answering yes and say that whatever evidence arisen, this record didn't amount to reckless disregard?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,582.479,583.455,That's correct sir.
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,603.369,611.201,"Well, what if the -- what if his informer had been a known lawyer, a notorious lawyer?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,611.201,616.286,"I think and known to him and that would be knowledge of falsity and he would be liable, yes sir."
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.286,618.865,"Oh, not knowledge of folly, he didn't actually know the same --"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,618.865,619.211,"No, he'd have --"
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,619.211,624.119,Suppose he just knew that -- he would've had enough suspicion of the source of it.
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,624.119,626.381,"Then, possibly he could not sit on --"
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,626.381,628.805,"But he had never seen or heard to this fellow before, did he?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,628.805,630.465,"No sir, he had, he knew the man."
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,650.544,656.544,"Well, I know but that doesn't mean much -- I don't suppose -- what if he got the affidavit from Partin?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,656.544,660.347,I think it would have been -- with Partin with his notorious background that he knew about he may (Voice Overlap) --
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,660.347,662.081,"Well, he's a union official."
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,662.081,662.942,I beg pardon.
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.942,664.279,He was a union official?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,664.279,670.575,I don't know whether he was at that time or not but let's take that this -- I say it parallels the Times case entirely.
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.724,677.488,"Yes, but who brought the ad to the Times?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,677.488,678.101,I beg your pardon sir?
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.101,680.304,Who brought the ad to the New York Times?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,680.304,683.61,Other people than the people that were being sued at that -- they were also --
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.61,684.721,And who were they?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,684.721,686.109,I forget the exact people (Voice Overlap) --
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.109,687.734,Were they known to the Times?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,687.734,689.411,I beg your pardon sir?
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.119,694.495,"Yes, but from whom?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,694.495,695.745,From other people --
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,695.745,696.902,People they knew.
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,696.902,697.593,Right.
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.985,739.416,So that anybody who gets an affidavit from anybody else with scandalous charges is in about third person may publish it and freely.
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,739.416,747.053,I think then as this Court said the burden is upon the party that brings the suit to show that they acted with malice not even hatred.
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.053,769.191,"Well, I know but the party who brings the suits says this does amount to reckless disregard when all you've done has taken an affidavit from some person, this contains a scandalous charge against a public official and that fellow just, ""Well, I've got it from somebody and he signed an affidavit that I'm not reckless at all if I publish this."""
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,769.191,784.646,"I say that falls within the rules that's set out and clearly been said by this Court and -- these cases, the Butts case, the Walker case and there is that it is not just that is possibly negligence but negligence does not constitute malice."
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.368,804.06,But that isn't even malice under New York Times?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,804.06,809.395,"If I say that I'm doing it strictly to hurt you, yes sir and I'm only doing it because I want to hurt you."
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,809.395,810.636,What if it's the truth?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,810.636,813.394,"Oh, that's the only exception to the rule."
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.674,818.24,I know but what if he has -- what if it --
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,818.24,819.476,"If it's a truth, he can say it."
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,819.476,830.864,What if it isn't the truth and -- but do you think it would be changed in this case in these facts if the fellow testified that I did it because I hated him although --
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,830.864,831.096,No sir.
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,831.096,835.133,-- I certainly thought they were true?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,835.133,837.115,No sir.
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,939.027,954.055,"Well, I guess we don't -- I guess this really for us narrows down to the single question whether there was evidence upon which there could have been -- a finding could be made that this was done with reckless disregard or whether it was true or false."
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,954.055,954.471,That's the entire --
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,954.471,956.469,Concededly it false?
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,956.469,958.081,No sir.
1967.517,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.081,958.402,"Yes, but perhaps (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,958.402,960.61,"Well, for our purposes that it's false, isn't it?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,960.61,961.256,Yes.
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,961.256,963.198,"And that's -- it's that narrow issue, isn't it?"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,963.198,964.316,Yes sir.
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,986.49,988.816,"What -- well, can that make any difference for our purposes --"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,988.816,988.858,"No, no."
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,988.858,990.687,-- your Supreme Court has said --
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,990.687,990.956,They have (Voice Overlap) --
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,990.956,1005.394,"-- and this action is an action governed by the New York Times rule, we find that the rule was satisfied because it was enough evidence upon which a finding could be based that this was false and it was altered in uttered disregard or whether it was true or false --"
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,1005.394,1005.543,That --
1967.517,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1005.543,1006.145,-- or reckless disregard.
1967.517,0,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,1006.145,1009.384,That simply the entire case.
1967.517,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1017.215,1019.219,Mr. Kleinpeter.
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1019.219,1022.088,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.236,1342.182,But the trial judge did rule specifically on the New York Times point?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1342.182,1346.353,The trial judge had a New York Times decision completely in front of him Your Honor.
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1346.353,1347.865,And he mentioned it?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1347.865,1350.321,"He mentioned it name, yes sir and he concluded --"
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1350.321,1358.046,"Well, do you see any issue for us to decide in light of what your Supreme Court has said?"
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1358.046,1358.21,"No sir, I don't --"
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1358.21,1364.177,Is there anything for us to decide but whether this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the New York Times test go about --
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1364.177,1365.641,"Yes sir, I think you should decide (Voice Overlap) Mr. Justice Brennan."
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1365.641,1366.983,There is something more than that?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1366.983,1367.111,Yes sir.
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1367.111,1367.768,Yes.
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1367.768,1372.067,"Well, I have never conceded and I do not concede now that this man was a public official."
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1372.067,1372.948,"Oh, I see."
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1372.948,1375.147,He was not one of those individuals --
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1375.147,1375.482,I see.
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1375.482,1379.525,"-- so related in the hierarchy of government that they had a particular interest and yes, he was just (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1379.525,1383.267,"In other words, that's also a federal question that on the facts we might review?"
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1383.267,1384.108,Yes sir.
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1384.108,1384.642,I see.
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1384.642,1391.601,I have never concede although now in the trial court they found that he was a public official based on state statutes.
1967.517,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.601,1396.092,And -- but in your -- but your Supreme Court said he was a public official for the New York Times purposes.
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1396.092,1399.221,"Yes sir, I'll only let you know why the Supreme Court said it does so."
1967.517,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.221,1400.856,"Yes, I know, I know, I read it."
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1403.166,1405.58,They just said that he was a deputy who would take the place of the sheriff --

1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1405.804,1406.227,-- and he was going (Voice Overlap) --
1967.517,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.227,1410.202,-- what would you think the sheriff -- would you think the sheriff would be a public official?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1410.202,1411.32,"Oh, I don't think there would be any."
1967.517,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.902,1415.669,The sheriff?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1415.669,1417.094,Yes sir.
1967.517,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.094,1424.44,"And the -- and your court said, well the deputy sheriff is -- when a sheriff isn't around he's a sheriff."
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1424.44,1428.808,"Well, that's a big assumption because he was just a captain, sir."
1967.517,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.793,1436.937,"Everybody on the force was a deputy, was everyone on the sheriff's staff called a deputy?"
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1436.937,1438.248,"Yes sir, everyone's a deputy."
1967.517,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1453.701,1455.526,He was a captain of what?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1455.526,1464.229,He was a captain on the -- he held the rank of captain in the sheriff's office for the past East Baton Rouge in charged of the uniform division.
1967.517,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1465.017,1466.886,Do you say he is not an official?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1466.886,1467.87,Sir?
1967.517,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1467.87,1469.253,You say he's not an official?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1469.253,1476.263,"I personally say he is not a public official no sir because he -- no one has any particular interest in his, he doesn't deal with money --"
1967.517,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1476.263,1479.335,"Although, talking about what he deals with, he's a deputy sheriff."
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1479.335,1494.684,"He could be an officer, a public officer, yes sir but he such an officer that the public has such an interest in his particular job it would make him a public official within the Rosenblatt and the Times case."
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1515.602,1522.362,"Well, isn't a captain of the uniform police at least a public man."
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1522.362,1525.055,I guess he's a public man just like a lawyer would be sir.
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1525.055,1531.618,"Well, if he is didn't in the Butts cases, didn't we apply the New York Times test to the public man as well as to the public official?"
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1531.618,1537.775,"You applied it in the public man, to Butts but you upheld the -- affirmed the decision --"
1967.517,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1537.775,1537.928,I know but the --
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1537.928,1540.174,-- of the Fifth Circuit and then associate it.
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1705.58,1708.082,But he wasn't a public official?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1708.082,1711.191,"I say personally, may it please Your Honor."
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1711.191,1717.317,What would be your criteria that you would urge upon us?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1717.317,1732.198,My criteria sir would be this that if this man occupied a position that he is a public employee or public officer and that his position was such that the public as you said in Rosenblatt case have such a particular interest.
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1753.309,1754.739,And all the sheriffs?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1754.739,1755.664,And all the sheriffs.
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1760.722,1766.339,"Well, aren't these an appointed official that are more important in some elected officials?"
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1766.339,1766.827,Yes sir.
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.827,1769.356,"So you can use that as a criteria, can you?"
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1769.356,1771.992,"I can turn on that, yes sir."
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1771.992,1781.371,So you don't think anybody in the sheriff's office could be a public official except a sheriff?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1786.244,1787.469,"Well, I don't mean that, no sir."
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1791.525,1793.369,Would you make it major?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1793.369,1795.845,"Who have -- they have majors, lieutenant colonels, they have a sheriff --"
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1795.845,1799.345,Why would you draw a line?
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1799.345,1802.593,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I just have to tell you I don't know."
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1805.596,1806.544,Because (Voice Overlap) --
1967.517,1,39722,robert_l_kleinpeter,,1806.544,1807.924,-- I have deep personal interest in this.
1967.517,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.193,1825.346,A very good answer.
1967.517,2,40462,russell_j_schonekas,,1912.195,1913.781,I don't see any need for rebuttal.
1967.517,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1919.625,1920.298,I see.
