1982.81-1945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.98,We'll hear arguments next in Pacific Gas and Electric Company against State Energy Resources and Development Commission.
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,63.52,67.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,206.537,212.0,"Well, could I... you mentioned a statute that was recently passed."
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,212.0,213.346,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,213.346,222.467,"Now, would that be... is that statute arguably dispositive for one side or the other?"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,222.467,224.623,It is in our view.
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.979,233.993,And contrary to the... contrary to the Court of Appeals.
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,233.993,236.524,"--Well, the Court of Appeals had no opportunity to consider--"
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.524,237.07,"Oh, I know."
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,237.601,237.959,--Yes.
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,237.959,239.679,--But it's contrary to their judgment.
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,239.679,240.552,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.338,265.147,Should the case be remanded then to let the California court take a look at that new legislation?
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,265.147,265.911,Well--
1982.81-1945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,265.911,267.537,In CA 9--
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,267.537,282.312,"--Your Honor, it seems to us that the case can be disposed and ought to be disposed of by this Court taking account of that statute as well as the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; but I take it that would be a question for the Court to decide."
1982.81-1945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.918,299.49,"--Do we have a copy of that in the material you have filed with the Court, Mr. McDonough?"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,299.49,304.691,"A copy of the statute, I'm informed, was sent to the Court by the Solicitor General last week."
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.691,306.115,"Yes, it's only 60-some pages long."
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,306.115,308.065,"It is a lengthy statute, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,309.363,312.269,"But your position is that you don't need that statute at all, I take it."
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,312.269,344.475,"Well, our position is, Your Honor, that it... it stands as a reaffirmation of the view of the federal government's responsibility for and willingness to accept responsibility for and deal effectively with the problems both of the disposal of radioactive waste on a schedule set forth in the statute and pursuant to procedures described in the statute, and that it also deals extensively with the question of interim storage of waste--"
1982.81-1945,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,344.475,348.222,"And yet, Mr. McDonough, if the statute had not been enacted, you'd still be here, wouldn't you?"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,348.222,349.423,"--Indeed, I would, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,349.423,352.032,You'd rely then only on the '54 statute.
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,352.032,353.015,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.015,356.236,In a sense you came before it was enacted.
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,356.236,358.326,"Yes, indeed, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,423.83,429.811,"But the only role of the states in that statute is in the selection of the permanent disposal site, isn't it?"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,432.591,433.09,Yes.
1982.81-1945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,434.763,436.448,That really doesn't have much to do with the issue before us.
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,436.448,438.385,"--No, I think it does, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.099,456.94,"Well, California's just saying we want to wait until we know what the federal solution is."
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,456.94,457.86,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,472.698,476.648,And it also made it rather clear that the final federal answer won't be available for several years.
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,476.648,478.239,"Well, the final federal... that's right."
1982.81-1945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.239,487.831,"And the question here is whether... can the states say we want to wait until that answer is... I'm not suggesting one way or another, but I don't really see that that bears on the preemption issue that we have before us."
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,487.831,510.212,"Well, Your Honor, what our position is with respect to the disposal of nuclear waste, that the federal government has assumed responsibility for that, has set out a procedure to be followed to reach that end, has set a target date of January 1, 1989 for the licensing of the first disposal facility."
1982.81-1945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,515.648,522.455,"And the question... one of the questions here is whether California can say we want to wait until January 1, 1989 before we okay any more of these plants."
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,522.455,523.395,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.801,524.612,That's the question.
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,524.612,525.47,"--Well, all right."
1982.81-1945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.811,742.771,"I understood respondents' contention to be, Mr. McDonough, that your contentions had been kind of like perhaps Christmas trees in parallel rather than in series; that it was the combined effect of each and every one of these statutes that caused you to be uncertain, your client to be uncertain as to whether he could go ahead and build."
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,752.799,753.298,Yes.
1982.81-1945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,966.134,970.49,"Mr. McDonough, may I ask you a question before you sit down?"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,987.313,989.391,"--Yes, Your Honor, in several respects."
1982.81-1945,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1000.399,1006.522,Can it decide that it wants a nuclear plant or does not want a nuclear plant?
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,1006.522,1007.243,No.
1982.81-1945,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.969,1032.98,Could it pass a statute saying we will not have any hydroelectric plants in this state; we'll use only coal-fired plants?
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,1032.98,1034.714,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe it could."
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.57,1131.582,"Well, you... I take it if the state... if there's an application to the state commission for building a new coal plant--"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,1131.582,1132.05,Yes.
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.05,1149.902,"--And the commission says sorry, but we don't need any more power plants in this state, the fact that another entity comes in and applies for a state permission to build a nuclear plant, even though it's licensed by the federal authority, the state could still keep that plant out."
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,1149.902,1150.698,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.351,1163.32,And you say that... and you say that that kind... you say that that kind of an economic decision is not involved in this case.
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,1163.32,1164.989,"--Not involved in this case, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.989,1171.252,"You say the state's statutes are safety statutes rather than economic statutes, aren't you?"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,1171.252,1176.579,"What we're saying is whether... first we say yes, they are safety statutes."
1982.81-1945,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1187.482,1204.035,"Could they say, Mr. McDonough, no, maybe we could use one, maybe we need one, but this is just going to cost too much, and the possible burden on the state's economy is so great that we'll not allow that plant to be built?"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,1204.035,1208.473,"We say they can do that, Your Honor, if they do it, again, in a nondiscriminatory, evenhanded way."
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.248,1229.979,"Well, what if they say well, we think the... we think they can dispose of nuclear waste safely, but it's going to cost so much and escalate the cost of electricity so much that we're just not going to have a nuclear plant?"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,1229.979,1234.837,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that if they make an... a fair determination."
1982.81-1945,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1240.242,1242.691,"Well, what did... did they do more than that here?"
1982.81-1945,0,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,1242.691,1249.004,"--Well, they... no, they did not do more than that here."
1982.81-1945,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1279.506,1292.983,Mr. Claiborne.
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1292.983,1295.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1945,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1426.839,1447.798,"Well, Mr. Claiborne, doesn't that just, in one sense, just mean that the utilities can know when one of the conditions that the state wishes to impose will be met so they can plan on saying well, we'll assume the federal deadlines will be met, so we can target... we know when we will also meet the state condition, which is there must be permanent storage in existence?"
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1447.798,1469.054,"Justice Stevens, in the meantime they must wait because they cannot proceed further without certification from the California commission which is not permitted under its law to give that certificate until not merely Congress has indicated that the problem will be solved, but that the problem has been solved."
1982.81-1945,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.054,1469.507,Right.
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1469.507,1475.583,"And that the federal commission has approved that solution, and indeed that a site has been selected."
1982.81-1945,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1761.125,1767.792,"Well, can the states just say nuclear power plants cost too much, and therefore we don't want them?"
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1775.603,1794.875,"--Justice O'Connor, California has not... had California said and been able to sustain the proposition that it was, in effect, for the time being banning nuclear plants because they were going to produce rates for their consumers that were too high, there would be no quarrel with that."
1982.81-1945,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1811.978,1812.742,"Well, the state is--"
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1812.742,1813.694,But they've done something quite different.
1982.81-1945,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1813.694,1816.474,"--Well, the state is arguing they've done just that, aren't they?"
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1816.474,1817.195,No.
1982.81-1945,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1817.835,1819.676,In subsection (4) in the act?
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1819.676,1836.686,"--I think the state has to concede that since the moratorium is only effective until such time as a federally-approved disposal system is in existence, they're not concerned that power plants per se produce electricity at too high a rate."
1982.81-1945,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.171,1933.896,"Mr. Claiborne, may I ask you one question about your interpretation of 24.2, the California statute that says that no nuclear fission thermal power plants shall be permitted land use in the state until after the permanent storage condition has been met."
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1940.19,1942.611,"I take it neither, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1945,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.611,1943.064,Neither.
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1945.111,1946.687,I think that is so.
1982.81-1945,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1950.251,1950.891,--I understand.
1982.81-1945,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1950.891,1953.952,--A prerequisite to building it.
1982.81-1945,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1953.952,1964.449,Mr. Tribe.
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1964.449,1966.446,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1945,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2054.956,2062.081,How long will it be before a plant of this kind in this situation could be completed after the certificate is issued?
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2062.081,2064.733,"--It could probably take a dozen years, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1945,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2064.733,2071.904,"Well, then isn't... doesn't that allow quite a bit of time to resolve some of these problems?"
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2071.904,2075.402,You mean how long until a nuclear plant that they seek to build?
1982.81-1945,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2092.192,2104.671,"Well, if they thought... if the petitioners here can't satisfy the federal regulatory authority on the safety, they'll never have a plant in operation, will they?"
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2104.671,2121.853,"But the point is, Mr. Chief Justice, that the federal concern is, as you say, precisely safety; and they can satisfy federal authorities who have decided that while the search for a storage and disposal solution goes on, it may be safe to keep licensing plants."
1982.81-1945,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2151.652,2165.145,Isn't the worst that could happen... isn't the worst that could happen for the investors of the... in this kind of an enterprise that they might have a lot of ghost plants on their hands if they can't satisfy the safety requirements?
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2165.145,2169.817,"--I'm afraid, Mr. Chief Justice, the ghosts will haunt the people of California, not just the investors."
1982.81-1945,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2169.817,2171.568,How do the people pay for this plant?
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2171.568,2192.824,"Through higher rates that are forced upon them for substitute electricity; that is, if it were really assured in advance somehow that only the shareholders in the utilities would end up suffering when cost interruptions... when service interruptions occur when shutdowns are ordered, we'd have a very different nuclear industry in the United States."
1982.81-1945,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.911,2216.361,"Well, can't California count on its own state utility commission to follow state policy and to set its face against this passing on of costs?"
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2216.361,2228.403,"--Well, of course, I suppose if the entire system of California were restructured so that it were made bindingly clear in advance that in no circumstances would costs be passed on, we'd have a different case here."
1982.81-1945,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2238.756,2241.115,"But in California they could do it by referendum very easily, couldn't they?"
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2241.115,2246.036,"Well, California by referendum, as Massachusetts could do, could say we're waiting until the problem is solved."
1982.81-1945,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.487,2250.755,But couldn't it by referendum prevent them from passing it on?
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2250.755,2259.766,"--But... I suppose it could prevent by referendum at this point from passing it on, but then when they confront bankruptcy and come back to ask for help, we'd face a different situation."
1982.81-1945,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2262.122,2263.856,But I mean that--
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2263.856,2265.494,We want the electricity.
1982.81-1945,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2265.494,2267.354,--The state is not... the state is not helpless.
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2267.354,2273.96,One of the things that we think the state has a clear right to do is wait until the problem is solved before making the commitment.
1982.81-1945,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2290.778,2292.233,That's a legislative argument.
1982.81-1945,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2292.233,2296.058,The legislative argument was resolved by the legislature--
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3659.771,3661.397,"Yes, if I may, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3794.199,3803.445,"Well, Mr. McDonough, that suggests that the federal government has given nuclear power a kind of preferred position over coal generation and hydroelectric."
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3803.445,3825.374,"I think what it has done is to... Congress, it seems to me, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, very clearly said back in 1954 and has continued to say we believe that the best interest of this country in the long range will be served by having nuclear power in this country, and we are going to do everything we can do to bring it about, do everything we can do to encourage the private sector to get in and stay in."
1982.81-1945,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3878.869,3883.786,"Well, that certainly... that certainly is forcing to a certain extent down somebody's throat, isn't it... together we will have--"
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3883.786,3884.207,--Yes.
1982.81-1945,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3884.207,3884.835,--Nuclear power.
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3884.835,3885.708,I think it's clear--
1982.81-1945,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3887.241,3891.363,Who takes the responsibility for... who takes the responsibility for shutdowns?
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3891.363,3892.221,I beg your pardon?
1982.81-1945,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3892.221,3894.377,Who takes the responsibility for shutdowns?
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3894.377,3895.485,Of the nuclear plant?
1982.81-1945,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3899.5,3903.295,"In... in sort of an indemnity agreement, or how do they do that?"
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3903.295,3908.777,"Well, you mean respecting whether a particular plant should be shut down at a particular point in time?"
1982.81-1945,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3908.777,3913.072,And say there's a very substantial business interruption cost as a result of it.
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3914.932,3921.007,"Well, I take it either the shareholders or the ratepayers or both bear the cost."
1982.81-1945,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3921.007,3922.067,But not the federal government.
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3922.067,3923.475,"Not the federal government, no."
1982.81-1945,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3943.358,3945.121,But it takes none of the investment risk.
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3945.121,3947.714,"--It doesn't take the investment risk, no, Your Honor."
1982.81-1945,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3962.926,3977.047,"Well, Mr. McDonough, hasn't the Ninth Circuit looked at the California law and said... said as we understand this law, California has economic concerns about nuclear power?"
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3977.047,3978.907,"Yes, I believe the Ninth Circuit has."
1982.81-1945,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3980.498,3984.716,"Well, do we know more about the California law than they do, or must we act like we do, or what?"
1982.81-1945,3,30071,john_r_mc_donough,,3984.716,3994.305,"--Well, I think that we have brought the question here, and it seems to me now that the case is here on writ of certiorari, the question now is for this Court to decide whether it agrees with the Ninth Circuit."
