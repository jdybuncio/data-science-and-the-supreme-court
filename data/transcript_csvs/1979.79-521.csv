1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.85,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Consumer Product Safety Commission and others against GTE Sylvania.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,14.864,17.941,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.373,406.638,"Well, could I ask I we -- if we agreed with you, do we just reverse or is there anything open on remand?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,406.638,407.638,"Yes, we think that --"
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.638,409.747,You think the FOIA question is open on the (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,409.747,410.443,That's right.
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,410.443,413.972,Okay then.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,413.972,430.802,"Now, the statute provides that when the Commission proposes to release information from which the public could readily ascertain the identity of a particular consumer product and the manufacturer or a labeler of that product, the Commission must follow four procedural rules."
1979.79-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.013,488.634,"Are you referring now, Mr. Buscemi to the language of 6 (b) (1) itself or to the regulation?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,488.634,492.672,"Language of 6 (b) (1) itself, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.465,544.705,"Before you get to that, you concede that this interpretation is one of the so-called Skidmore versus Swift & Company-type of interpretations where the Commission has not been granted the authority to fill in blanks."
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,551.604,552.009,That's right.
1979.79-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,569.05,606.155,"But it -- it's not as if the -- if Congress had authorized the Commission to define particular items or to make rules and regulations pertaining to disclosure which would have taken it outside of the Swift and Skidmore type of regulation and into the -- simply, is it rational type of thing where you -- which you frequently find where Congress has left the Commission to the -- left the Commission the job of filling in blanks which it didn't want to fill itself."
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,606.155,618.135,"No, I think the critical consider -- consideration here is Congressional intent, although the Commission is certainly authorized to promulgate regulations to explain how it's going to interpret and apply the statute."
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.851,806.195,Are you -- are you suggesting that that's the only precaution that the Congress took?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,809.918,812.561,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, the retraction is only one of the --"
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,812.561,812.6,Well --
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,812.6,814.876,-- four requirements in --
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,814.876,815.356,"Well, you -- you (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,815.356,816.206,-- Section 6 (b) (1).
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.206,821.456,-- so much that I -- I got the impression you were suggesting this would -- this took care of everything.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,821.456,822.437,"No, I didn't mean to do that."
1979.79-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.918,905.225,"But Mr. Buscemi, don't you think that in Chrysler Corporation last year, we recognized some difference between agency materials generated by the agency and materials on the possession of the agency which had been furnished by outside suppliers?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,905.225,915.768,"Well, that maybe so, but it does not in any way detract from the distinction between the FOIA release and the release at the Commission's initiative that I'm trying to -- to make here."
1979.79-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,968.064,971.849,And not otherwise exempted.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,971.849,980.967,"Well, the exemptions under the FOIA merely give the Commission discretion to make the decision as to whether or not to release them under the FOIA."
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.776,1009.572,"You mean it hasn't been decided that the -- that the standing alone, the FOIA exempts it?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1009.572,1009.964,That's right.
1979.79-521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1012.457,1014.096,The Commission has decided that.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1014.096,1014.569,Excuse me?
1979.79-521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.569,1015.503,The Commission has made the (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1015.503,1017.492,"Well, the Commission has but I mean by either of the --"
1979.79-521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1017.492,1017.552,Yes.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1017.552,1018.247,-- courts below.
1979.79-521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1018.247,1019.043,Right.
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.043,1022.425,"But the question is, is whether some other statute exempts it."
1979.79-521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.425,1023.21,Right.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1023.21,1029.747,The question is whether the procedures mandated by Section 6 (b) (1) must be followed in this context.
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.747,1039.008,"Well, do you think that it's -- so you think you must argue the FOIA to -- into an -- in order to interpret 6 (b)?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1039.008,1039.123,Well --
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.123,1041.186,Like your doing?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1041.186,1043.69,The Commission has received FOIA requests.
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.343,1066.529,But you seemed to be arguing because of the policy of the FOIA and -- and what it's trying to do with it -- that -- that there is on how you should -- should construe (6) (b).
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1066.529,1072.769,"Well, the reason for discussing the FOIA is merely to point out that the statute is completely different from the Consumer Products Safety Act."
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.448,1083.894,What was 6 (b) trying to do?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1103.041,1112.197,"Well, the purpose is to keep inaccurate information from being distributed by the Commission at its initiative and with its approval."
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.102,1136.579,"(Voice Overlap) yes, but you would think the Congress would intend the Commission, although it -- if it -- if it wanted to put its informator on it that it would have to have a hearing."
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1148.442,1148.538,"Well, it's not a question --"
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.538,1154.004,And -- and use subpoena power to gather inaccurate information and then turn it over to anybody.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1154.004,1162.008,"Well, it's not a question of what the Commission wants to do, the FOIA request must come in and the Commission is compelled under the FOIA to release the information."
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.008,1163.83,Why you're arguing the FOIA?
1979.79-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1165.561,1167.814,Which gives the subpoena power.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1167.814,1170.757,"Well, 6 (b) doesn't give the subpoena power, that's elsewhere in the statute."
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.4,1178.671,"Well, if you want to talk 6 (b) why don't we just stick to it?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1178.671,1179.093,Well --
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.093,1182.518,"And as -- and I'd -- again I ask you, what was 6 (b) trying to do?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1186.725,1200.535,"It was trying to keep inaccurate information from being distributed by the Commission at its own initiative and with its approval, with the intention that the public -- and -- should rely on it."
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1200.88,1206.561,But -- but never mind any other -- any other kind of distribution under the FOIA.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1211.478,1219.607,"Well, sir, Section 6 (b) does not direct the Commission to collect information and distribute it under the FOIA."
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1227.349,1231.995,But you don't say this is that -- that this isn't a public disclosure that's at issue.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1231.995,1239.089,We say that a response to an FOIA request is not a public disclosure of information within the meaning of Section 6 (b) (1).
1979.79-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1239.089,1253.726,The subpoena power is what enables the Consumer Safety Products Commission to have all these supplier -- information in its hands in order to respond to an FOIA request.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1253.726,1254.502,That's right.
1979.79-521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.061,1270.699,"Well, now have 6 (b) (1) in it."
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1270.699,1271.28,Well --
1979.79-521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1271.28,1281.775,"Mr. Buscemi, assume that the -- this consumers agency has made a study and it's concluded that this microphone is dangerous."
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1297.832,1298.665,That's absolutely right.
1979.79-521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1299.865,1301.506,Does that seem right to you?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1301.506,1313.788,"Well, I think there's a major distinction between letting it out under the Consumer Products Safety Act with the Commission's imprimatur on it telling the public, “Rely on this, don't use that kind of microphone.”"
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1324.397,1337.336,Do you really think when it gets on to the public that any significant fraction of the public would know whether it did or did not have some kind of approval of the Commission?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1337.336,1344.406,"Well, I think that there is no vouching for it by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in any representation that there was."
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1349.523,1356.855,"Yes, but when that cat is out the bag, how many people are going to make that kind of analysis of where it came from?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1356.855,1357.164,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1357.164,1358.072,Which Government agency?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1358.072,1372.776,"-- if you simply look at the information that's at issue in this case, we're talking about accident reports, many of which were submitted to the television manufacturers by individual consumers, hand written letters, very brief type letters, my television exploded, my television caught on fire."
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.333,1403.841,"But when Congress authorized the Commission to withhold release under certain circumstances, then you're really arguing that in another act, Congress went in the other direction."
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1403.841,1410.342,"Well, the FOIA exceptions have some application in this context, but they have not yet been adjudicated in any way."
1979.79-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.692,1430.925,And they were --
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1430.925,1431.309,Those --
1979.79-521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.309,1434.213,"-- rejected by the Commission here, were they not?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1434.213,1440.294,The Commission has found that this material is not exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA.
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.755,1468.722,"Mr. Buscemi, do we know whether the accident reports are accurate or not?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1468.722,1469.603,"No, we do not."
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.603,1474.448,"Well, if they're inaccurate, would they be misleading?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1474.448,1476.456,"Well, it depends what you mean by misleading."
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.16,1489.627,Would the -- would the requesters have the legal right to republish them?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1489.627,1490.572,Yes.
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.572,1495.582,And is there not a danger that that would be misleading if they're inaccurate?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1495.582,1497.596,"Well, there is a danger that it would be misleading --"
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1497.596,1503.59,"Another question I just thought to happen at the same time, this case had been going on for about five years, isn't it?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1511.097,1516.721,"Well, because, Mr. Justice Stevens, there are over 7600 accident reports involved in this case."
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.721,1516.883,Yes.
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1516.883,1522.906,"And -- and that is one of the points that I'd like to address just briefly, there're enormous practical problems involved here if it --"
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.906,1524.529,In knowing whether their accurate or not?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1524.529,1531.905,"In going out and finding each individual consumer who submitted a report, checking his television or her television, making certain that the reports happened and so on."
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.905,1537.539,"So there is a substantial risk of inaccuracy and therefore of deception, is there not?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1537.539,1554.308,"Well, there is a disclosure, first of all, not to the public at large and not with the Commission's approval, and there is no risk that anyone will think that that Commission puts its imprimatur on these reports, because the Commission has not done so."
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.308,1561.62,Do you think it makes much difference to the consumer who reads -- reads some publication that there are 4000 accidents of certain description?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1569.035,1569.137,I think that may --
1979.79-521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1569.137,1570.616,-- there a danger of deception there?
1979.79-521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.616,1576.965,"Well, that's -- that's true of all -- all material turned over by -- in accord with the FOIA, isn't it?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1576.965,1576.98,That's correct.
1979.79-521,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1576.98,1578.446,FBI reports and for the records and files and everything else?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1578.446,1579.594,Precisely.
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1605.124,1614.842,"You haven't mentioned if -- or if you did I missed it, the matter of the definition of what is a TV accidents?"
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1614.842,1615.512,Well --
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1615.512,1620.416,Did the -- has the Commission got a regulation defining what they mean by a TV accident?
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1620.416,1621.828,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, the Commission does not --"
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1621.828,1623.932,-- and I think that --
1979.79-521,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1623.932,1635.347,That is precisely why the Commission proposed to attach a disclaimer to the release of information stating that there were different recording and collecting procedures followed by the different manufacturers.
1979.79-521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1648.415,1652.045,Very well.
1979.79-521,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1657.686,1662.005,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.725,1714.615,"Is that partly related, Mr. Segal, to the -- the lack of the definition of what is a TV accident?"
1979.79-521,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1714.615,1728.063,"Your Honors, one of the big problems here is, Mr. Chief Justice, that the industry begged the Commission to define what a TV-related accident was."
1979.79-521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1765.877,1768.177,Or if you stumbled over walking across the room.
1979.79-521,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1768.177,1768.686,Yes.
1979.79-521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.67,1967.372,"In -- in republishing, what might be released under FOIA?"
1979.79-521,1,18058,bernard_g_segal,,1972.497,1977.189,"Indeed, the -- no agency is permitted to request that or require it."
