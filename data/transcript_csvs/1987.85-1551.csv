1987.85-1551,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We will hear argument first this morning on No. 85-1551, Alan Karcher v. Jeffrey May."
1987.85-1551,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,11.639,14.591,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.85-1551,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,133.565,137.703,"In New Jersey, is that a full-time job, Mr. Lee?"
1987.85-1551,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,137.703,140.737,"I honestly don't know, Justice Blackmun whether it is or not."
1987.85-1551,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,140.737,141.887,"In some states, it isn't, of course."
1987.85-1551,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,141.887,145.272,I do not know whether it is in New Jersey or not.
1987.85-1551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.272,159.032,"Mr. Lee, wasn't it reasonably clear from the record that Mr. Karcher and Mr. Orechio appeared in their official capacity?"
1987.85-1551,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,161.318,163.436,They did intervene in their official capacity.
1987.85-1551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.353,174.726,"And they no longer hold the offices that they held at the time they intervened as Speaker and President, respectively; is that correct?"
1987.85-1551,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,174.726,178.613,"At the time that they intervened, they did hold those offices, yes."
1987.85-1551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.613,180.562,"Yes, but they no longer do."
1987.85-1551,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,180.562,181.897,They do not at the present time.
1987.85-1551,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,182.731,189.151,"And why, under our Federal Rules, are not their successors automatically substituted?"
1987.85-1551,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,189.151,197.824,"Necessarily, under the rules apply... do not apply by their own terms to legislative officers."
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1614.959,1626.082,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.85-1551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.887,1698.678,"Well, let us assume that the intervenors had said both as Speakers of the House and as individual legislators, you wouldn't be making... you still would be making the argument there is no standing."
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1698.678,1706.534,"We would certainly be making the argument that if his sole status today is as individual legislator, then he lacks--"
1987.85-1551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.534,1713.188,"Because I don't... I suppose we have authority to consider him as an individual legislator, whether he intervened that way or not."
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1713.188,1722.544,--His sole status in this litigation is as a representative of the body.
1987.85-1551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1728.548,1729.565,Who said so?
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1729.565,1733.617,This Court said so in Bender v. Williamsport.
1987.85-1551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.617,1736.219,"Well, we could say something else, too, I suppose now."
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1736.219,1743.207,"That is certainly possible, Mr. Justice White."
1987.85-1551,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.207,1750.063,"I suppose we could reconsider the motion for an intervention here by somebody else, too."
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1750.063,1752.846,"That is certainly possible, Your Honor."
1987.85-1551,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1756.383,1757.033,Yes.
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1760.169,1772.326,There was a motion for intervention here filed by Mr. Lee on behalf of a teacher and student in New Jersey.
1987.85-1551,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1774.261,1775.994,"Yes, but not by the present Speaker of the House."
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1781.332,1798.044,"The present leadership of the New Jersey Legislature, both the Speaker of the Assembly and the President of the Senate have notified the Court that they do not wish to prosecute this appeal and they have instructed their counsel to withdraw the appeal."
1987.85-1551,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1901.861,1918.704,"--Mr. Cantor, under New Jersey law, does a presiding officer of a House and the Legislature, is that person able to bind the entire Legislature for purposes of making it a party to a suit?"
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1918.704,1923.625,"The answer to that is, yes, Justice O'Connor."
1987.85-1551,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.451,1945.723,And you think that his intervention made the entire legislative body that he represented a party?
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1945.723,1952.877,"--There is no question that that was the understanding of everyone involved in this litigation, including the District Court."
1987.85-1551,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1952.877,1956.179,And what do you point to in New Jersey law for that authority?
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,1956.179,1956.712,Okay.
1987.85-1551,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1996.989,2005.679,"So, you take the position that the real intervening party was, in effect, the whole Legislature?"
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,2005.679,2007.179,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.85-1551,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.088,2056.659,You say that the Speaker has the right to represent the Legislature.
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,2056.659,2057.609,That's correct.
1987.85-1551,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.609,2058.944,The Legislature wasn't sued.
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,2058.944,2062.913,They intervened after--
1987.85-1551,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.913,2064.682,"Well, where did they get right to intervene?"
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,2064.682,2079.691,"--They made a motion and they were granted intervenor status after the Attorney General of the State, who was representing the Commissioner of Education, determined not to defend the statute on the basis--"
1987.85-1551,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2079.691,2081.057,That should have been the end of the case.
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,2081.057,2086.678,"--He determined not to defend the statute, but the statute was still enforce."
1987.85-1551,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2091.332,2092.265,But it wasn't against the Legislature.
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,2092.265,2095.617,The original suit was not against the Legislature.
1987.85-1551,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2095.617,2099.855,"So, how come the Legislature has a right to be represented?"
1987.85-1551,1,37045,norman_l_cantor,,2099.855,2116.281,"Because in other instances, this Court has indicated, such as in Diamond v. Charles where the Illinois Legislature was present to defend the abortion statute even though they were not originally named."
1987.85-1551,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3447.491,3450.443,"I also have that many comments, Your Honor."
1987.85-1551,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3650.841,3652.959,"Mr. Lee, your time has expired."
1987.85-1551,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3652.959,3653.476,--I am sorry.
1987.85-1551,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3656.476,3658.143,The case is submitted.
