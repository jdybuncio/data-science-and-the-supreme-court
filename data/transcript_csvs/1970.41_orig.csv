1970.41_orig,0,37748,paul_w_brown,,152.278,154.073,It seems to me that here we must.
1970.41_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,154.073,155.717,(Voice Overlap) what’s the applicable law?
1970.41_orig,0,37748,paul_w_brown,,155.717,164.943,It seems to here it hasn’t occurred to me that we could apply in this case anything except the common law of the State of Ohio where the nuisance occurred.
1970.41_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,164.943,167.17,So you are claiming under a federal statute?
1970.41_orig,0,37748,paul_w_brown,,167.17,169.558,"No, we are not claiming under a federal statute."
1970.41_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,174.727,177.071,"Well, you aren’t stating a federal cause of action?"
1970.41_orig,0,37748,paul_w_brown,,177.071,185.587,"We are not stating a federal cause of action, we are filing this under the common law of the State of Ohio and addressing our complaint as was done in these other two cases --"
1970.41_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.587,190.004,Did the complaint say that the defendants have violated the federal statute?

1970.41_orig,0,37748,paul_w_brown,,196.12,197.689,A common law --
1970.41_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,197.689,203.538,A federal forum to have adjudicated a cause of action under Ohio law?
1970.41_orig,0,37748,paul_w_brown,,203.538,209.866,"Right and our right to do so, arises from the Constitution and from these two cases and only from that."
1970.41_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,209.866,214.446,Do you think we’re obligated to apply Ohio law?
1970.41_orig,0,37748,paul_w_brown,,214.446,229.686,I think you're obligated to apply Ohio common law with regard to whether or not this constitutes a nuisance and I think you're obligated to apply Ohio common law with regard to questions of damages which may arise in the case.
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1609.345,1613.33,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.41_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.24,1647.158,Do you see any doubt about our discretion to parties being it was the last resort to anything (Inaudible)?
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1647.158,1651.103,"No, I find none and I think one thing that might have been mentioned."
1970.41_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1720.938,1735.15,"Mr. Strauss, just for a moment, where do we get our discretion to refuse to hear a case that is within our original jurisdiction, what is the theoretical basis for that?"
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1735.15,1744.097,I Suppose what we’re speaking of here is the case that's not only within this Court’s original jurisdiction but also within the original jurisdiction of another court --
1970.41_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.097,1745.251,Yes.
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1745.251,1770.685,"-- that when the Court’s jurisdiction is exclusive and original, the Court quite properly could be said not to have jurisdiction but when it believes that there’re may be a remedy in another court something on the order of Doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens at which I think quite appropriately takes into account the other responsibilities that this Court has and its --"
1970.41_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1770.685,1772.052,Sort of an abstention doctrine?
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1772.052,1785.297,"That’s right, its capacity to sit as a finder of fact which is called on to be and on the other side you do have the aspects that Mr. Brown was speaking of its appointment really as a court before the state and you do have one of the States (Voice Overlap)."
1970.41_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.297,1791.434,Sort of like an adversity action when it’s proper to abstain staying even though there’s jurisdiction?
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1791.434,1796.533,Somewhat similar to that I think the considerations are different.
1970.41_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1796.533,1811.103,Would it not be more perhaps like the abstention doctrine applied or state courts have jurisdiction and precisely the same range of remedy?
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1811.103,1812.673,I'm not sure I follow the question.
1970.41_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1812.673,1826.664,"Well, in three-judge court cases that come here frequently, we sometimes sustain as we did last year in Reetz against Bozanich when there was a challenge to the Alaska statute."
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1826.664,1828.385,"Well, I think there one has --"
1970.41_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1828.385,1837.313,But we have jurisdiction as Justice White suggested that we remanded the state court because there was a possible remedy there.
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,1837.313,1843.037,I think there one has certain considerations of federalism which are quite important.
1970.41_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2351.221,2354.633,"Then you would say of course it’s up to Ohio, do you?"
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2362.75,2364.394,"In Canada, excuse me."
1970.41_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2364.394,2366.346,Oh!
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2366.346,2367.886,So far as enforcement to the judgment --
1970.41_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2367.886,2370.346,That’s in terms of territorial jurisdiction?
1970.41_orig,1,38336,peter_l_strauss,,2370.346,2373.945,That’s right.
1970.41_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2810.358,2814.28,Thank you Mr. Strauss.

1970.41_orig,2,31826,john_m_moelmann,,3201.295,3203.844,"Yes, it’s in that."
1970.41_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3203.844,3208.732,Where did you say it is?
1970.41_orig,2,31826,john_m_moelmann,,3208.732,3215.696,It’s in the document that Mr. Justice Stewart had in his hand there.

1970.41_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3447.752,3450.163,"Well, what's the --"
1970.41_orig,2,31826,john_m_moelmann,,3450.163,3450.872,I really don’t know.

1970.41_orig,2,31826,john_m_moelmann,,3452.304,3458.844,There are a lot of fish there Mr. Justice Douglas wrote on the subject maybe he could tell you about.

1970.41_orig,2,31826,john_m_moelmann,,3474.753,3475.569,That’s right.
1970.41_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3475.569,3475.965,"Well, is there any --"
1970.41_orig,2,31826,john_m_moelmann,,3475.965,3489.504,But there are a lot of problems and this is the subject and which Mr. Justice Douglas wrote that is creating this problem one of which is the phosphates that are continuously dumped in the Lake Erie.
1970.41_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3512.494,3516.882,"But Ohio state hearing, they closed this for awhile."
1970.41_orig,2,31826,john_m_moelmann,,3516.882,3519.683,They had it closed a short while and they reopened it.
1970.41_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3525.897,3526.937,Why?
1970.41_orig,2,31826,john_m_moelmann,,3526.937,3537.344,"Well, apparently they seem to develop a greater amount of methyl mercury in their tissue than the other fish."
1970.41_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3537.344,3540.188,"So, they (Inaudible) prohibit the fishing of walleyes?"

1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,3958.052,3961.383,They are biological specimen Mr. Justice White.
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3961.383,3962.0,Biological specimen?
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,3962.0,3963.348,Preserved in alcohol.
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3963.348,3964.978,And they now tested them?
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,3964.978,3971.863,They’ve tested them and found mercury present in the flesh of those fish in the quantities that I gave the Court.
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3971.863,3973.36,"So, those are recent test of this?"
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,3973.36,3974.528,Recent test.
1970.41_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4230.782,4233.971,May I ask you what -- how that applies?
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4233.971,4234.768,How that applies?
1970.41_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4234.768,4236.682,Yes.
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4236.682,4269.716,"It is my submission to the Court that the State of Ohio can legislatively and can administratively and can judicially take action against the polluters with its all jurisdiction and if they do, then the standard that they adopt with respect to their own polluters becomes the standard that we can comply with and I would say to the Court that we comply with the standard which is much higher than the standard which the State of Ohio expects of its own residents and citizens."
1970.41_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4401.692,4422.601,"Can I ask you, do you mean that if what was being done in Canada undoubtedly abuse the waters, it made life changes for people in the United States that this country would have no power to enjoin?"
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4422.601,4446.793,"I would say Mr. Justice Black that the action would be one which should take place between two sovereigns and short of making war, there's no way in which the courts can enforce the injunction."
1970.41_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4446.793,4449.456,Are you talking then about the enforcing that?
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4449.456,4480.574,I'm simply stating as a matter of principle that if the resident -- if a national of a foreign sovereign and as resident in the other country and if the order of the Court would infringe upon by that be I submit in conflict with for example if the courts of Ontario were to say that as a matter of necessity it was an importance to them that the industrial complex in Sarnia be maintained because of the labor forces that would be employed there.
1970.41_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4490.834,4497.043,And nothing would be done even though people would be killed?
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4497.043,4499.822,"Well, nothing is a rather exclusive word."
1970.41_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4499.822,4502.19,I’m assuming -- just assuming.
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4502.19,4510.055,I would respectfully submit that the proper course would be to resort to diplomatic action between the two countries long before anybody be -- is killed.
1970.41_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4510.055,4514.183,"I gather, it would be the only jurisdiction, you think it would exist?"
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4514.183,4516.609,I believe that is the state of the authorities.
1970.41_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4516.609,4525.173,"I suppose that’s another way of saying that the Court has no jurisdiction can enter in an injunction, is that your point?"
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4525.173,4528.379,"Yes, and I’d like to come to that further Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.41_orig,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4596.688,4605.827,Would the International Court of Justice have a jurisdiction in the dispute of the United States and Canada on this matter?
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4605.827,4607.933,I'm sorry I cannot answer Your Honor’s question.
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4702.295,4731.138,"Mr. Outerbridge, I take it under your submission if Ohio proceeded against one of its own companies to keep it from polluting Lake Erie that there would be some indispensable parties in that action namely the Government of Canada and Ontario wouldn’t be the same -- wouldn’t you have the same problem there, anyone who tampers at Lake Eire is immediately concerning a foreign government?"
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4731.138,4737.945,"Mr. Justice White, I think you're right with this submission I would make to you.("
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4739.183,4742.425,The question is whether you're right?[Laughter]
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4742.425,4753.045,The submission I made to you is that the process -- it’s totally impossible to enjoin one polluter if you don’t enjoin them all.
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4753.045,4754.829,"So, in Ohio --"
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4754.829,4756.405,They must all be before the Court.
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4756.405,4768.724,So that Ohio would be completely without power to move against one of the companies in Ohio which is polluting like here?
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4768.724,4777.75,"No, with respect you can move for a simple injunction with respect to anyone of these companies, in any jurisdiction."
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4779.144,4780.803,Including your company?
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4780.803,4790.113,"Yes, and Ontario, you could enjoin Ontario in Ontario, you could enjoin any company in Ohio in Ohio, you could enjoin any company in Michigan in Michigan."
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4796.97,4803.223,"So, the injunction side of this case, your argument does not go to the injunction side of the case in terms of indispensable party?"

1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4808.513,4809.985,Not to the prohibitory injunction.
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4809.985,4811.296,That’s rather significant course.
1970.41_orig,3,28645,ian_w_outerbridge,,4811.296,4821.501,Not to the prohibitory injunction except if I may just add this that there is no point in making a mandatory order if you can’t stop.
1970.41_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4821.501,4822.168,I understand.
