1996.95-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.119,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-1521, United States Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs v. Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers, Inc.--"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,13.601,17.534,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,108.723,153.232,"Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you to clarify at the outset what the Government's position is with respect to the statement by the respondents that the respondents requested the State Department to seek from the Hong Kong Government an extension of the undertaking to process these people to cover the proceedings on remand, and that the Department refused, so that a remand would force the Hong Kong Government's undertaking to lapse and would likely subject respondents to immediate forcible repatriation."
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,153.232,157.634,"Justice Ginsburg, I'm afraid there must have been some confusion."
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,212.301,236.324,"I took that to be what you represented to this Court in your motion to join... in your response to the motion to join additional parties, because there you said that the Government obtained insurances from the Hong Kong Government that both the Lisa Le plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in this case would not be forcibly repatriated during appellate and Supreme Court proceedings."
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,236.324,236.815,Right.
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,236.815,244.281,So am I correct in saying the appellate proceedings would encompass whatever happens in the Lisa Le case in the D.C. Circuit?
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,244.281,246.943,On remand through January 31.
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.363,248.483,And this case on remand.
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,248.483,249.454,--And this case on remand.
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,279.805,290.421,"But your view is... your representation is that it's January 30 or the termination of proceedings here and in the D.C. Circuit, whichever is earlier?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,290.421,291.252,--That's correct.
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,291.252,293.402,The January 30 date or the termination of proceedings?
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,293.402,294.524,That's correct.
1996.95-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.524,297.066,"That has been asked for, or that has been received?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,297.066,298.255,It was requested--
1996.95-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.255,299.657,It was requested.
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,299.657,300.939,--and received this morning.
1996.95-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.581,304.93,"Well, if we--"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,307.411,308.071,Yes.
1996.95-1521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,308.071,314.587,"And if we were to vacate and remand, would you have objection to the D.C. Court entering a stay based on those terms?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,314.587,322.872,"A stay in this case, a stay is not necessary because no injunction was ever entered in this case."
1996.95-1521,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.537,335.1,"But if we were to vacate and remand, what would the situation be?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,335.1,352.33,"--The situation would be, pursuant to these representations, Hong Kong would not involuntarily repatriate anyone in this case or the Lisa Le case before January 31 unless the case was earlier terminated."
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,352.33,357.134,"The D.C. Circuit had not earlier entered a stay, is that correct?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,357.134,363.829,"In the Lisa Le case it did, because the district court in the Lisa Le case had entered injunctions based on the panel's ruling in this case."
1996.95-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.215,386.615,A stay of what?
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,389.467,389.695,"No, a stay--"
1996.95-1521,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.695,392.059,"--I think our writ doesn't run that far yet, does it?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,392.059,392.857,--Right.
1996.95-1521,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,419.124,426.46,"Mr. Kneedler, as long as we've gotten into facts, may I ask you about the Government's position on one other factual issue which I'm not sure of?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,491.864,495.457,"Well, the... let me explain it this way."
1996.95-1521,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,507.384,510.577,Does the CPA cover anything other than Vietnamese refugees?
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,510.577,512.525,It also covers Laotians.
1996.95-1521,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,512.525,513.047,Laotians.
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,513.047,531.308,"But in Hong Kong it's true the vast majority, in fact virtually all of the migrants subject to the CPA in Hong Kong are from Vietnam, but the... this was... this is a situation in which, in fact, there are no other aliens similarly situated to those covered by the CPA."
1996.95-1521,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,542.005,545.629,"You're saying the class, save for Vietnamese and Laotians, is an empty class."
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,545.629,553.984,"Well, yes, because the CPA was entered into to address a migrant crisis that was itself country-specific, and it--"
1996.95-1521,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,553.984,568.784,"Right, but I think if I understand your answer, it is there are no refugees from other countries than Vietnam and Laos in Hong Kong who have been screened out and who are applying for immigrant visa status."
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,570.895,572.237,"--Under the CPA, that's correct."
1996.95-1521,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,572.237,573.647,"Well, not under the CPA."
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,573.647,573.977,I--
1996.95-1521,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,573.977,575.219,Regardless of the CPA.
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,579.139,588.305,--I frankly cannot represent whether there are people from other... from other countries besides Vietnam and Laos.
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,589.667,591.468,This class includes only those people.
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,591.468,591.828,--Yes.
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,591.828,596.41,"The CPA doesn't apply, and you wouldn't be following that with respect to--"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,596.41,596.69,Right.
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,596.69,597.942,--nationals from any countries--
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,597.942,598.293,That's correct.
1996.95-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.387,665.411,--So the CPA arose as a result out of massive migration of Vietnamese and Laotians--
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,665.411,665.841,That's correct.
1996.95-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,665.841,666.633,--and not anybody else?
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,666.633,699.685,"That's correct, and it was that problem the CPA addressed, and we think it would be odd indeed if the United States in its conduct of foreign relations, where it can treat different nations differently for legitimate foreign policy concerns, could not also treat the nationals of those different nations differently depending on the circumstances that have arisen in the bilateral or unilateral... I mean, multilateral arrangements, and also just in the real world taking account of what has caused the outflow of migrants."
1996.95-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,705.879,730.255,"Mr. Kneedler, in the proceedings below, as I understand the record, the Government argued that there was discrimination against Vietnamese nationals but it could be justified on a rational basis, and as I understand the argument made by the Government now is, there was no discrimination at all."
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,755.581,782.479,"Well, in... going to the second one first for the moment, the... we did argue that... I think the argument that respondents make is that we did not argue that the question of consular venue is separately addressed and exclusively addressed by 8 U.S.C. 1202(a), which says that a person shall apply for a visa in such locations as the Secretary shall prescribe by regulation."
1996.95-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,832.512,835.152,How about the discrimination point?
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,835.152,866.105,"In the lower court we argued that this was... that this was not discrimination, at least that's my understanding, and also that... but beyond that the position here that this... that... I don't know if one calls it justification, or it's not discrimination, that you can look at it either way, that discrimination is a conclusion that encompasses whatever justifications may be offered for the policy, or that it's not discrimination in the first place."
1996.95-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,954.522,956.912,Let me ask you one more question.
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,980.989,982.539,They did.
1996.95-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,982.539,988.644,--Constitutional arguments and other things that haven't been addressed by the Court and that might not be covered by--
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,988.644,989.265,Right.
1996.95-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1046.512,1051.397,"--Mr. Kneedler, the respondents here have sought only injunctive and declarative relief, haven't they?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1051.397,1052.008,That's correct.
1996.95-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.008,1053.898,They did... they've not sought damages.
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1053.898,1066.718,"No, that's correct, and we think it's clear, quite aside from this legislative history making clear that this was intended to apply to this very situation, the usual principles governing prospective relief would make clear that it's effective prospectively."
1996.95-1521,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1066.718,1077.113,"Well, the respondents have come back and said, oh, but we also want reparative injunctive relief looking to the past."
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1078.993,1123.244,"Well, not entirely, because it would seem to us that any injunctive relief in this case would direct the Secretary of State to provide for the issuance of visas in Hong Kong in the future, and that's the very reason why prospective relief cannot be granted if it would be in conflict with a new statute, and the conference and House reports on this legislation say that it was just intended to clarify the fact that the Secretary of State has unreviewable authority to establish visa venue rules, so it's clear that Congress was ratifying the Secretary's interpretation of the statute and intended to maintain the status quo."
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1154.874,1169.844,"Mr. Kneedler, with respect to the two issues that were not decided by the D.C. Circuit, they haven't been considered, and you concede that they are--"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1169.844,1170.415,--Right.
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1170.415,1187.809,"--in the case and would be ripe for consideration, but the case... this case and Lisa Le both raising the same questions but going on different tracks are somewhat confusing, disorderly."
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1200.204,1201.606,Excuse me.
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1218.549,1223.084,Currently you have a panel in this case and an en banc court in Lisa Le.
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1223.084,1223.862,"Right, that is correct."
1996.95-1521,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1477.821,1495.143,"Mr. Kneedler, are you aware of any case that... where questions such as these were raised below, not touched there, and where this Court responded to them as... not as a court of review but the only court to pass on them?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1495.143,1498.204,--Not specifically.
1996.95-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.857,1554.632,"May I just ask one question, Mr. Kneedler, is it still the Government's primary submission, though, that we should simply GBR at this time, rather than addressing these issues?"
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1554.632,1555.754,"--Yes, that would be our--"
1996.95-1521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1555.754,1556.435,It is.
1996.95-1521,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1556.435,1556.935,--That's our primary submission.
1996.95-1521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1556.935,1558.375,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1560.585,1572.694,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1521,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1601.404,1607.361,"What is the relief... if you were to win on the first issue as you have described it, what would your relief be?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1607.361,1621.893,"Well, the relief that we would suggest, Justice Souter, is relief... reparative relief, relief that could, insofar as is possible, restore plaintiffs to the position that they would have been in were it not for the Department's illegal conduct."
1996.95-1521,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1626.084,1632.269,"Well, do you concede that if the statute in fact was intended to be retroactive, that relief would be impossible?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1632.269,1667.422,"--If the statute was intended to be retroactive, that relief would be impossible, but there's nothing in the language of the statute indicating any retroactive intent, and under this Court's decision in Landgraf, a new law cannot be applied retroactively to conduct predating its enactment if that conduct was illegal, so the new law cannot reach back and render lawful conduct that was unlawful at the time that conduct was... took place, and certainly we are... respondents are entitled to relief that would remedy the effects of the illegal conduct."
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.422,1686.376,"But what you're asking... you still haven't gotten the final judgment in this case, and what you're asking for is some sort of a declaration or injunction that the Secretary may not require repatriation from Hong Kong in order to process visas."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1709.462,1723.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, first just to clarify the type of relief that we're seeking, we're seeking an order mandating the processing and the expeditious processing in Hong Kong of our clients' visa applications, not an order that would have anything to do with enforceable repatriation, per se."
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1723.912,1736.859,"But if under presently enforced law you're not entitled to that, the fact that you might have been entitled to it a year ago is something that a court ordinarily won't recognize."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1736.859,1760.227,"Well, certainly, were the statute to be one that prohibited this Court from issuing an injunction or from granting the... granting respondents the relief they're seeking, then that would be correct, but the situation here is that respondents had a substantive right to be... to not be discriminated against--"
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.227,1761.948,"Well, what do you mean by a substantive right?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1761.948,1768.702,"--Well, we had... at the time we had an expectation, a reasonable expectation that we would not be discriminated against in the issuance of a visa."
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1775.294,1780.97,"Well, that's true if you're seeking damages, but just... your whole effort here was prospective."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1780.97,1790.715,"--The principle of nonretroact... of the principle concerning retroactivity applies, as I understand it, regardless of the type of relief that's being sought."
1996.95-1521,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1803.695,1815.131,"But I think you have conceded that we don't have that power if, number 1, you are not seeking damages, and you're not, and number 2, the statute is in fact to be applied retroactively."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1824.989,1829.711,"Justice Souter, that's correct if the statute were to be applied retroactively."
1996.95-1521,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1829.711,1833.254,So everything turns on the retroactivity of the statute.
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1833.254,1834.424,But Mr.--
1996.95-1521,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1834.424,1843.83,"And why should that be decided in the court of appeals where normally the first cut at an issue like that is, of course, not taken in this Court?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1843.83,1847.123,"--Well, I would say that there are two reasons in this particular case."
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1872.47,1882.185,"Mr. Wolf, the D.C. Circuit was prepared to hear the Lisa Le case en banc on September 19 and deferred that only because the proceeding was pending here."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1889.03,1892.863,"Well, it's uncertain how the D.C. Circuit would handle this case."
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1898.856,1916.348,"Under what possible scenario would they send it back to the district court when it is the decision of the three-judge panel that is the problem, not the initial... the district court was just following the orders that the three-judge panel gave."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1916.348,1930.548,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, that gets me to the next point about why a remand would be inappropriate in this case, and that is is that nothing about the change in statute alters the fact that the Department's conduct was illegal at the time that conduct took place."
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1938.995,1943.717,D.C. Circuit was poised to litigate it en banc.
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1943.717,1946.489,--The D.C. Circuit was poised to litigate it--
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1946.489,1959.498,And the fact that the cert petition was granted and heard doesn't make what the D.C. Circuit was intending to do any less appropriate than when the D.C. Circuit ordered it.
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1959.498,1982.503,"--Well, for the same reasons, Justice Ginsburg, that it may be improvident for this Court to retain the certiorari petition as we indicated in our supplemental brief, it may also be improvident for the court of appeals for the D.C. Circuit en banc to retain... to consider this case yet again on all of the issues--"
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1982.503,1982.973,Why yet again?
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,1995.462,2012.503,"--It was a signal that the Court viewed it as a serious question, as this Court's granting of certiorari is such a signal, but for the same reason that this Court might want to relinquish this case, the D.C. Circuit en banc could do well the same."
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2013.952,2015.674,"Mr. Wolf, I have an unrelated question."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2085.913,2095.61,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, we were not clear, based on that statement about whether or not the representation would include representations made on... would include the situation on remand."
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.808,2130.763,"Before alleging to this Court that it would cause immediate repatriation, do you not think it would have been appropriate to let us know that the Government had something quite... said something quite the contrary, had represented to this Court that no one was going to be repatriated pending the proceedings here and in Lisa Le?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2130.763,2138.279,"--Well, as I indicated, Justice Ginsburg, we believed there to be some ambiguity, significant ambiguity in that statement."
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2150.175,2167.038,"It was described in rather definite terms that the Department refused, and that the... that would cause... I mean, you didn't put anything... you didn't indicate to us that anything was at all ambiguous."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2167.038,2170.0,I did not understand it at the time to be ambiguous.
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2181.737,2200.1,"This is not ambiguous, but you just said to me that, well, you thought that that might be the problem, and you were well aware that the Government had already represented to this Court that no one would be repatriated until this Court and the D.C. Circuit were completed, proceedings were completed."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2200.1,2211.317,"--As I said, as I understood the representations at the time, they only applied to the Supreme Court proceedings and the appellates court in Lisa Le, and if it may have been my misunderstanding, I would apologize for that."
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2244.938,2272.767,"Well, Mr. Wolf, supposing somebody comes into court and says, up until 1994 I was entitled to receive a certain amount of money as a pension, but I realize... this is 1996... now Congress has said that that no longer obtains, but I just want a declaratory judgment that I might have received it had I applied in 1994, now, would a court grant that sort of a thing?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2272.767,2293.61,"--Perhaps not, but in this particular case, taking your hypothetical, if the person had applied for pension benefits in '94, been denied on illegal grounds in '94, and then in '96 the law changed, the individual would still be entitled to receive the pension benefits for '94, or injunctive order granting the benefits."
1996.95-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.61,2309.8,What would be the possible conceivable meaning of the Congress' provision that the new statute applies to all cases filed after a certain date?
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2313.322,2315.924,"No, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.924,2318.946,How do we know what cases the new law applies to?
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2318.946,2320.608,The new law states what it states.
1996.95-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.755,2335.147,"But there's an effective date provision for the legislation too, isn't there?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2335.147,2337.428,"--There is an effective date provision, that's correct."
1996.95-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.428,2337.888,And what does that say?
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2337.888,2341.762,There are various different effective date provisions.
1996.95-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.343,2346.715,How does this one read?
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2346.715,2382.298,"I'm not sure, Justice Scalia, whether there's a... we checked, and I didn't recall seeing a default retroactive provision, but I believe the statute becomes effective on the date that it is enacted for... as the default provision, and to that degree it is certainly the case that should the Department today institute a policy refusing to process visa applications on... and discriminating in that process on grounds of race, nationality, or sex, then a person would not be able to obtain relief and would have no right to obtain relief."
1996.95-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2382.298,2399.361,"I had thought that it had said all cases filed after a certain date, in which case your argument wouldn't make any sense, because that obviously means, regardless of what the situation might have been on the facts, if your case is filed after a certain date, the new law applies."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2400.761,2415.411,"This partic... in our particular case, what... the important retroactive event is the Secretary's determination, refusing to process immigrant visa applications at a time when he was required to do so."
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.437,2439.927,"Yes, but I have a little trouble with the language because your basic position is, as I understood the briefs correctly, is that 1152(a)(1) should be construed as a limitation on the authority of the Secretary."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2439.927,2442.508,"Section 11... yes, that's correct."
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.508,2449.043,"But then as amended it says, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary, so forth and so on."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2459.229,2483.996,"Well, I would say that the answer to that question, Justice Stevens, is provided for in Roadway Express, where the... this Court stated that the fact that a statute may... the Congress often enacts statutes that purports to interpret what a provision means and tells a court how to interpret what a provision means, but that does not make the statute any the more retroactive than any other type of congressional enactment."
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.996,2491.302,"No, but you're still asking us to construe a statute in a way directly contrary to the way Congress has told us we should construe it."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2491.302,2495.192,"Well, with respect to what happened before--"
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2495.192,2497.494,It doesn't say... there's no time limit.
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2501.807,2516.337,"--Well, I'm asking... what I'm saying is that in Roadway Express the Court specifically adopted a very similar type of statute that informed the Court as to how the statute should be construed."
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2525.653,2528.456,"Mr. Wolf, are you saying there is no such thing as a clarifying amendment?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2565.999,2569.701,"--Which, Justice Ginsburg, is exactly what happened in Roadway Express."
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.735,2575.756,Did you cite Roadway Express in your papers?
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2575.756,2577.005,--Yes.
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2579.619,2580.829,In the supplemental brief.
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2663.422,2681.885,"Taking the first of your... taking the first part of your question first, as this Court indicated in Rusello, the interpretations of a future... of a new Congress are hazardous grounds upon which to base interpretations of a previous Congress."
1996.95-1521,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2730.127,2741.764,"My point was not that, but rather that the statute applies prospectively and would govern the issuance of prospective relief."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2741.764,2757.904,"The... well, this Court has also held in numerous occasions, Justice O'Connor, that if Congress wants to take away a remedy, that it also must do so expressly, and again, there's nothing about section 633 that takes away a remedy."
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.053,2779.472,"Well, but if you take the surrounding legislative history it's perfectly clear that Congress intended to disapprove the decision of the court of appeals in this case, is it not?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2779.472,2795.661,"--Well, even in Roadway Express the Court mentioned... stated that even if Congress disapproves of a previous opinion, that doesn't mean that it's retroactive, and the only expressions of legislative intent that we've seen really are two statements of Congressmen who are opposed to the bill, which also this Court has--"
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.661,2797.233,Which you cite in your brief.
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2797.233,2800.064,--Which the Department cites in its brief.
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.064,2803.908,"Well, I thought you cited it in your brief, too, didn't you at footnote 13?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2803.908,2807.999,"Oh, that was a letter previous to the enactment of the bill."
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2808.6,2821.56,"Where you say, having recently become aware of the obscure provision 45 Congressmen, including 13 Members of the House... sent a letter to the President August 1 expressing the view that the court of appeals' interpretation of 1152(a)(1) was correct."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2821.56,2823.852,"--Mm-hmm Well, that's correct."
1996.95-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2957.636,2966.425,"In order to tell whether there's been discrimination, don't you have to first determine whether the two people are similarly situated?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,2971.817,2983.265,"--Well, it seems to me that the statute places race, sex, and nationality as a category, and therefore that... therefore you cannot dis... you cannot differentiate between races, between genders."
1996.95-1521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.536,3015.898,"But do you think when Congress passed this statute, did it have in mind refusing to allow the State Department to carry on the ordinary country-by-country distinctions that it makes in conducting foreign policy?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3017.547,3019.38,"--Well, Justice Breyer--"
1996.95-1521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3019.38,3021.411,"But I mean, is there any evidence that it did?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3021.411,3025.422,"--Justice Breyer, there's no specific legislative history of this provision."
1996.95-1521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3028.775,3029.666,"Well, all right, it says what it says."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3046.887,3052.54,"--Well, I... the language says what it says, and the courts should construe the language as it says it."
1996.95-1521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.291,3064.909,"Well, if it says what it says, wouldn't we normally assume that what it had in mind was the kind of discrimination forbidding that kind of discrimination that did exist in Korematsu--"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3064.909,3065.55,"--Well, in--"
1996.95-1521,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.55,3073.725,"--but not the kind of discrimination that is consistent with ordinary foreign policy, treating one nation differently from another?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3073.725,3082.96,"--It seems doubtful to me, Justice Breyer, because the statute prohibits discrimination, and discrimination is a different concept than the rationalization for the particular conduct at issue."
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.696,3094.428,May I ask you just a factual question?
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3106.136,3109.098,If a Vietnamese was not a boat person?
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.098,3109.749,Yes.
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3109.749,3113.031,"Well, there are a number of Vietnamese who came by bus, and--"
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.031,3115.391,"No, say he's lived there for the last 20 years."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3115.391,3116.042,"--Oh, certainly."
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.244,3121.215,"No, not a boat... I say, a Vietnamese."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3126.17,3143.932,"--Well, Justice Stevens, if you take two people, two nationals in the same circumstances, one a Vietnamese who has been denied refugee status, one French who have been denied refugee status, the French person can walk into the consulate, get their visa, the Vietnamese person cannot."
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.463,3153.518,But are you assuming the French person is also... came as a... was one of these migrants on the... in this... one of the boat people?
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3153.518,3159.851,"Well, Justice Stevens, I can't see how the fact that somebody came by boat or by plane would--"
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.851,3163.305,"Well, it's whether he comes within the terms of the CPA or not."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3163.305,3170.66,"--Well, with respect to the CPA again, that issue seems to me to go to the rational basis, to the justification for the conduct, not to the classification of the conduct."
1996.95-1521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3170.66,3173.943,"Well, but the classifica... the class does not include all Vietnamese."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3179.366,3186.78,"Yes, but with respect to the same subcategories of other countries, such as the same subcategory of French, the Vietnamese would be treated differently."
1996.95-1521,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3195.035,3199.908,"But Mr. Wolf, doesn't... haven't you already shown why this is worlds different from Korematsu?"
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3228.968,3258.888,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, actually, as I recall in Korematsu and Hirabayashi, at at least one particular time the classification only applied to Japanese on the West Coast who were rounded up and placed into relocation centers, so the fact that it didn't also apply... might not have also applied to Japanese on the East Coast would not have rendered the classification there any the less discriminatory, so in terms of the issue of whether this is discriminatory, there really should be no question."
1996.95-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3315.407,3325.363,"Well, it would certainly encourage more people to come out if they know once they get in Hong Kong, where they have safe refuge, they can apply for a visa to the United States from there."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3328.506,3329.237,"--Well, Justice Scalia--"
1996.95-1521,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3329.237,3330.559,--to discourage people from coming out.
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3330.559,3340.743,"--Justice Scalia, that gets directly to my point, that the Department seems to be confusing the justification for its policy with the issue of whether or not the policy is a discriminatory one, and--"
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3340.743,3347.408,"Isn't there something to what Mr. Kneedler said, that you know, discrimination in one sense... you say someone has a discriminating taste."
1996.95-1521,1,21664,daniel_wolf,,3365.143,3386.066,"--Well, it seems to me that it's a line, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that this Court has drawn in numerous cases in the equal protection context, in the context of numerous statutes that prohibit discrimination, and in view of... Congress certainly was aware of how this Court interprets the meaning of discrimination when it passed the statute in 1965, and there's no reason to interpret this statute--"
1996.95-1521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3386.066,3386.917,"Thank you, Mr. Wolf."
1996.95-1521,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3389.869,3394.674,"Several points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1521,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3432.077,3457.064,"But Mr. Kneedler, to the extent that this is like a venue provision where you can have this processed, if Congress changes a venue rule while a case is in a tribunal, I assume the case would not have to be dismissed at midstream, that unless Congress said otherwise, the venue that was proper when the case was initiated would stay."
1996.95-1521,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3457.064,3463.998,"But that would be... that would I think be not upset... I mean, again, that would be a question of statutory construction, it would not be a question of an injunctive action."
1996.95-1521,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3660.127,3661.189,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1996.95-1521,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3661.189,3661.522,Thank you.
1996.95-1521,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3661.522,3662.455,The case is submitted.
