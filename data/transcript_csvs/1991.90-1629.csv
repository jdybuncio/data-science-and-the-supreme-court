1991.90-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1629, United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.--"
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,51.449,55.051,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,62.073,72.262,"Mr. Seamon, before you get started, don't our rules provide that briefs should have a summary of the argument?"
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,72.262,74.381,--That's correct.
1991.90-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,74.381,78.85,Is the Solicitor General's office subject to those rules?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,78.85,80.202,"Yes, I believe it is."
1991.90-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,80.202,86.356,Where is the summary of argument in your brief?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,86.356,91.51,"It is lacking one, and that is an oversight for which I apologize the Court."
1991.90-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,91.51,92.293,Would you say that again?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,93.26,97.497,That was an oversight for which I apologize to the Court.
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,250.712,253.949,"May I just get one factual thing straight, Mr. Seamon?"
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,253.949,254.349,Yes.
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,254.349,257.901,I gather you didn't make the sovereign immunity argument in the district court.
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,262.453,263.388,That's correct.
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,263.388,267.423,So you in fact learned that there was an available sovereign immunity argument.
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,267.423,273.777,I don't think that the Government was aware the availability of the argument before then.
1991.90-1629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.01,337.37,Do you think the requirements for a clear statement are the same in waiving Federal sovereign immunity as they are for finding abrogation of a State Eleventh Amendment immunity?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,337.37,343.174,They are very closely similar and have been described in virtually identical terms.
1991.90-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.101,394.856,"Of course, the incompatibility you describe only exists if you assume that the judgment of the court was based upon the rationale of the plurality opinion."
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,415.653,417.805,"No, there is nothing strange about that, Your Honor."
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,468.921,470.522,May I just be clear on what you just said?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,483.68,487.318,Let me be clearer than I perhaps was.
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.301,520.871,"And the Clean Water Act citizen suit provision, in your view, is an example of such a situation."
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,520.871,527.209,I'm citing the Clean Water Act provision as an example of where Congress is drawing a distinction of Congress' recognizing--
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,527.209,531.347,It's a different rule for the Federal defendant against a State defendant.
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,531.347,534.299,"--It's recognizing that there may be a different rule, and perhaps--"
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.299,538.751,"Well, I think you said there was a difference and that's an example of the difference."
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,538.751,541.886,"--If I did, I wasn't being clear enough."
1991.90-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,555.295,566.901,"Mr. Seamon, the lower courts found, did they not, that the IRS knew or should have known of the transfer's voidability?"
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,566.901,572.305,"It made the latter finding that the IRS should have known that the 20,000 dollar--"
1991.90-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,572.305,574.023,On what did they base that finding?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,574.023,584.98,"--They based that finding on a notation on the 20,000 dollar check stating that the remitter was Swiss Haus, Inc., which was the doing business name for Nordic Village."
1991.90-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,584.98,588.532,"And yet you don't mention that at all in your brief, do you?"
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,588.532,590.884,We... I don't believe we state that in the brief.
1991.90-1629,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,593.92,599.84,"Well, it seems to me it's critical of the lower court's finding, and I'm a little surprised that you haven't mentioned it in the brief."
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,599.84,606.561,"--Your Honor, we stated that in our petition to make clear all of the issues that were presented at the lower court."
1991.90-1629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,854.569,864.108,Well now you make a distinction between the power of the trustee to void a transfer and the power to sue for recovery of money.
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,864.658,865.294,Yes.
1991.90-1629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,874.733,878.352,And the transfer section is section 549?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,878.352,881.487,"Yes, regarding postpetition transfers like this one."
1991.90-1629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,881.487,895.163,And do you think that a transfer could be voided by the court against the Federal Government if none of the trigger words appear in 549?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,895.163,897.613,"No, I don't think that's so."
1991.90-1629,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,909.471,913.775,And you think 550 applies even though none of the trigger words are in 549?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,913.775,915.275,That's correct.
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.05,982.085,"May I ask you, Mr. Seamon, under your theory they can't recover the money."
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,993.393,1006.535,"I think I would need to know more facts, but I believe that yes, because that would be the situation, essentially in Whiting Pools, where there was seizure and restraint of tangible property."
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.156,1017.858,What if they seized a suitcase full of money?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1017.858,1020.377,Then I do not think that--
1991.90-1629,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.377,1022.81,"They get the suitcase, but not the money?"
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1022.81,1028.281,--Cases start to get hard when you talk about identifiable funds.
1991.90-1629,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1069.608,1075.362,"Mr. Seamon, may I ask you a question which may well be answered in Hoffman, I just don't remember."
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1084.05,1102.762,"The Court did address that phrase in Hoffman, and if I'm recalling it correctly, said that that indicates that 106(c) is in fact a waiver of sovereign immunity, but doesn't answer the question of the extent to which sovereign immunity has been waived."
1991.90-1629,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1102.762,1105.983,It's just insufficiently specific.
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1105.983,1107.266,That's correct.
1991.90-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1181.114,1192.755,"Is there any explanation, Mr. Seamon, you think (c) was... 106(c) was added after (a) and (b) were already in place in the congressional--"
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1192.755,1193.189,Yes.
1991.90-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.189,1194.957,--why this was added?
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1194.957,1211.733,"Yes, to refer to the legislative history, it indicates that 106(c) was added primarily to resolve a conflict among the circuits, and that conflict had to do with the availability of declaratory relief rather than monetary relief."
1991.90-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.353,1372.156,"Mr. Seamon, do you have any idea how it occurred to anybody to draft (c)(1) that way?"
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1382.278,1390.551,It's part of... it stems from the fact that 106(c) was added after all of the rest of the code had been drafted.
1991.90-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.551,1398.807,"No, but I mean why wouldn't you just name the sections instead of, you know, saying a provision that contains these, what you called trigger words."
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1398.807,1400.374,It may well be--
1991.90-1629,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.374,1402.009,I've never seen a provision like that.
1991.90-1629,0,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1402.009,1402.709,--Nor have I.
1991.90-1629,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1591.432,1593.551,"Very well, Mr. Seamon."
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1599.038,1604.357,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1665.997,1670.467,"This was not a case that was approached to court below, was it?"
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1670.467,1676.455,"To please the Court, this has been argued in this case from the original complaint."
1991.90-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.471,1678.657,"Well, you haven't answered my question."
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1678.657,1684.025,"--The answer is no, the Sixth Circuit decided the case on a sovereign immunity issue."
1991.90-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.025,1687.227,"Well, it decided the case based on its construction of the statute."
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1687.227,1687.596,That is correct.
1991.90-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.596,1692.298,And that it didn't decide the case based on the argument you are now making.
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1692.298,1693.916,It didn't reach that argument.
1991.90-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1693.916,1696.216,"Well, all right, but it didn't use that."
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1705.907,1706.49,It would.
1991.90-1629,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.957,1709.176,You didn't cross appeal.
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1709.176,1709.909,"No, we did not."
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.605,1785.442,"What do you think is the closest case from this Court that supports your position, Mr. Sicherman?"
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1785.442,1788.544,"If it please the Court, we had the Far East Lines."
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.9,1802.202,You're saying that is the closest case that supports your--
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1802.202,1804.138,That is the closest I can come.
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.609,1838.327,"--Yes, I'd asked you about cases from this Court."
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1839.977,1841.013,"--It's the closest I can come, Your Honor."
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1841.013,1841.929,--And it's from this Court?
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1841.929,1842.279,Yes.
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.796,1845.048,State Bank is a case from this Court?
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1845.048,1847.083,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.737,1932.154,The property.
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,1936.575,1948.365,"No, Your Honor, money... if it were my pen, my pen might be identifiable, although this cheap Papermate pen I'm sure there are many of."
1991.90-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2039.625,2049.998,"--Would it make any difference whether the Government was on notice or not if you're relying on the theory of, what do you say, restoration to the estate as something that belongs to it?"
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,2049.998,2056.504,"It said... I would say, Your Honor, if we rely on the theory of restoration, and the Government had knowledge."
1991.90-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.859,2074.215,"Well, you'd have a stronger equitable claim, but it wouldn't be any stronger as far as the doctrine of sovereign immunity is concerned."
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,2087.023,2109.036,"--The court below, trial court and the district court, felt it important to determine that the Government knew, because under section 550 of the Bankruptcy Code there are provisions where there's a third-party transferee... let me rephrase that, Your Honor."
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.628,2188.055,"Mr. Sicherman, don't you think that your reliance on Bull against United States may be somewhat limited by our later decision in the Dalm case?"
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,2188.055,2188.805,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.805,2194.208,Which said that really Bull just applied to equitable recoupment in tax cases.
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,2194.208,2198.01,"Yes, Your Honor, that is a serious problem."
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.682,2210.634,"What you're saying is it may not be very close, but it's the best you can do?"
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,2210.634,2227.53,"I hate to use the expression standing in these chambers, but it's kind of like horseshoes, Your Honor, that's as close as I can get on that point."
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.782,2818.648,"Mr. Sicherman, I think the basic argument you're up against here, as you probably realize, is that since (a) and (b) specify quite limited bases in which sovereign immunity is waived, how can you read (c) in its much broader language to constitute an across the board waiver?"
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,2828.437,2830.705,"Some do and some don't, Your Honor."
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2837.942,2839.877,But you've got to make us aware of it.
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,2839.877,2841.513,--I'm trying.
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2851.552,2855.504,"Well, it's not necessarily a question of going too fast, but you only have half an hour."
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,2859.975,2860.875,I am getting right at it.
1991.90-1629,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2860.875,2861.425,Okay.
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,2865.879,2881.171,"What I'm suggesting, simply put, is the correct reading would be to recognize that 106(c) is a waiver of sovereign immunity wherever the trigger words appear."
1991.90-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.956,2984.306,"Mr. Sicherman, can you tell me something?"
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,3013.891,3015.125,Except as provided--
1991.90-1629,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3015.125,3024.097,What is the... how could (a) and (b) possibly be an exception to what is done in (c)?
1991.90-1629,1,36707,marvin_a_sicherman,,3024.097,3038.756,"--My hypothetical of a Government contract claim, Defense Department contract, had nothing to do with any section of the code where the word creditor, entity, or governmental unit applied."
1991.90-1629,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3205.831,3210.302,"I have three points to make, and I can make them briefly."
1991.90-1629,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.325,3251.879,Are we free to accept his argument here?
1991.90-1629,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3255.414,3263.52,"--Even if you thought that, I think that inasmuch as it wasn't raised below, I doubt that the Court should entertain it at this point."
1991.90-1629,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3263.52,3270.257,"The question to whether we should, would it change the judgment below if we accepted his argument?"
1991.90-1629,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3270.257,3275.828,"The judgment below, in my mind, can't be defended as an exercise of in rem jurisdictions."
1991.90-1629,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.828,3277.378,"No, but that's not my question."
