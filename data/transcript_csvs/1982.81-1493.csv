1982.81-1493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.885,We'll hear arguments next in the Gillette Company against Miner.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,9.23,13.891,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1493,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,34.221,35.321,"Excuse me, Mr. Miller."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,39.641,41.474,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1493,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,41.474,42.391,How do we know that?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,49.763,61.638,We have a final judgment on the question of Illinois' capacity to assert jurisdiction over the non-resident class members under the Fourteenth Amendment.
1982.81-1493,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,77.897,82.349,But we don't know whether actually a class will be certified as broadly as you just stated it.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,82.349,82.899,No.
1982.81-1493,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,109.432,115.753,"Well, I'm just wondering whether we have to address that issue until we find out that's what the Illinois court's going to do."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,115.753,129.08,"It is inconceivable to me, Justice Brennan, that there is any issue left open with regard to the question of the applicability of minimum contacts and the power of the State of Illinois to assert jurisdiction."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,129.08,130.146,How about the class action?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,133.282,145.672,There has been a mandate by the Illinois Supreme Court to the Illinois Trial Court to consider this question of manageability under the laws of the other 49 states of the Union.
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,145.672,149.743,"Well, I suppose one of your answers, Mr. Miller, might be that the Court granted certiorari."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,149.743,151.426,Yes.
1982.81-1493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.426,156.497,And perhaps a response would be that only four Justices are required to grant certiorari.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,166.169,167.705,"Well, I--"
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,167.705,170.74,"But as long as four want it granted, they're supposed to decide it on the merits."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,170.74,172.609,--I think--
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,172.609,173.942,That's the full four anyway.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,173.942,177.411,--I think you've covered all the possibilities now.
1982.81-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,178.762,182.38,"Yes, but no one raised the final judgment question at the certiorari stage."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,189.718,207.596,"Let me simply add that the last four cases that this Court has heard involving questions of state court jurisdiction... Shaffer, Kulki, Woodson, and Rush... have all come to this Court on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction."
1982.81-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,207.596,231.563,"But the difference is that in each of those cases the entire litigation might have terminated depending on how this Court decided the issue, whereas here it really is not even certain that there will be a class any broader than the Illinois residents, because it's theoretically possible that a judge sitting in Cook County might decide that all other states have different rules or they're enough different that he doesn't want to fuss around with anything except an Illinois class."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,231.563,232.097,Yes.
1982.81-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,266.82,274.24,"Yes, I agree with that, but it does seem to me possible that the trial judge could say well, there are no other laws quite like ours."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,279.461,282.83,"It is theoretically possible, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1493,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,349.557,355.461,"But as you argue on the merits, this case is the most extreme that has arisen."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,355.461,356.211,Absolutely.
1982.81-1493,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,395.186,396.871,"Why Minnesota, do you know?"
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,396.871,398.421,"--Yes, yes."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,462.313,465.682,The class... is the class frozen in any sense now?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,471.752,472.152,No.
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,474.002,474.621,It is?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,474.621,476.738,--The promotion has ended.
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.923,486.761,What about those who would claim they would have applied but for some theory?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,486.761,494.099,--I think one would be hard-pressed to make that claim four years after the promotion.
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.476,549.8,"Mr. Miller, how... I suppose the real parties in interest here are the members of the class, if it's certified."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,565.56,577.182,--This Court in Hanson and Denckla allowed Florida defendants to assert a lack of jurisdiction over a Delaware trustee.
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.182,580.836,Wasn't that an indispensable party situation?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,580.836,582.036,"Yes, it was."
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,582.036,585.772,Which would go to whether the Court had jurisdiction over the case.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,593.643,602.233,"With great deference, I would argue that there are very few people more indispensable to an action than the plaintiffs."
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,666.723,673.377,"--But under the Illinois court order they would be given notice, as I understand it."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,673.377,674.043,They will be given notice.
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,674.043,674.827,And they can opt out.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,674.827,680.781,"But if I might just pursue the standing point for a moment, they have no notice at this point."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.089,721.941,"Well, that's just a typical class action suit."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,728.178,729.729,"Yes, yes."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,729.729,732.331,"Well, that would... the same thing would be true of all of those people."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,732.331,737.217,I do not think that is as clear.
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.217,739.002,"Well, they can opt out and take advantage of it."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,739.002,747.925,"They can opt out, but if they opt out, my understanding of the Illinois opt out law is that they cannot then take advantage if they opt out."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.925,755.447,"Well, do you think Gillette would really, if it lost the case, really defend against another party in the same position?"
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,755.447,761.268,It's very hard to speak to that issue at this point.
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,761.268,762.551,"Well, I don't think it's hard to speak to it at all."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,762.551,795.989,"The fact remains, Justice White, that the theory of the Hanson and Denckla standing point is equally applicable in this situation because those Florida defendants were making exactly the same point with regard to that indispensable Delaware trustees: unless you get him in now or determine that he can't be brought in now, we are subjected to this litigation and a threat of second litigation."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.989,796.608,Right.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,806.547,807.797,"In its own behalf, no."
1982.81-1493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,807.797,809.499,I am right.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,809.499,810.816,You are right.
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,810.816,818.621,Could a plaintiff from Montana then come to Illinois and file an action against Gillette for the lighter?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,818.621,821.223,"In the Illinois court, yes."
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,821.223,821.739,Yes.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,825.108,835.816,A group of plaintiffs volitionally can accede or consent or seek out the jurisdiction of the Illinois courts.
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,835.816,843.303,So are you basically saying that due process allows an opt in procedure but not an opt out procedure?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,843.303,859.847,"I think if the State of Illinois chose to pursue its consumer protection policy by enacting a statute that provided a mechanism of inviting non-resident class members to opt in to an Illinois action, that would be constitutional."
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,877.726,880.095,Even under the notice and opt out procedure.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,880.095,904.226,"I think what this Court has decided in an unbroken line of cases from International Shoe is that in the absence of minimum contacts between a state and a party, that state cannot assert jurisdiction under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1982.81-1493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,904.226,908.178,But weren't those all minimum contacts required on behalf of the defendant?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,908.178,912.963,"Yes, yes, except conceivably the Mullane case."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.569,1002.021,"Mr. Miller, after all, there would be notice and an opportunity to opt out."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1008.025,1009.46,"--No, I do not."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.793,1022.35,"I'd certainly have to say that because you have just said that if there was consent, if they voluntarily came into Illinois, it would be quite all right."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1022.35,1044.05,"--I think that is right, but I think the Court's opinions, particularly the last four opinions, have been absolutely clear in drawing distinctions between three elements... among three elements of due process: jurisdiction, notice, and an opportunity to be heard."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.608,1065.729,"Suppose there was proof that a person hadn't... a person had notice, and he decided not to opt out?"
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1065.729,1070.45,--I do not see how the State of Illinois could bind that person.
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1072.85,1082.073,"He could say... he could sit right there and say well, if it turns out well, that's fine; if it turns out bad, I'll sue him anyway."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1082.073,1089.827,--The author of Insurance Corporation of Ireland one year ago said--
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.827,1091.429,I thought you would get to that.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1092.862,1104.236,--Made it very clear that an individual who feels there is no jurisdiction in the tribunal may simply ignore the proceedings.
1982.81-1493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1104.236,1107.188,"He does so at some risk, of course."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1107.888,1114.842,"He does so at some risk, but not much risk if it is true that there is no jurisdiction."
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.842,1118.162,They can't bind him just by his failing to object.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1118.162,1123.9,I do not see how the State of Illinois can write me a letter in Massachusetts and say
1982.81-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.835,1129.804,Either speak up or be stuck.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1129.804,1131.62,--That's right.
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1153.3,1166.31,What about our decision last term in Underwriters National Assurance Company where a state court exercised jurisdiction in what amounted to a class action involving people in other states?
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1166.31,1216.141,"That is one of the many, many cases that have come to this Court that are in appearance multi-state class actions; but when one looks at the facts of each and every one of those cases, each and every one of them, one discovers that either there's a clear satisfaction of minimum contacts or there is an entity created by the forum, which decisions as far back as Pennoyer and Neff make clear the forum can adjudicate and make decisions about rights and liabilities, or there's a fear that there will be conflicting judgments resulting from sequential actions."
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1251.963,1266.073,"What if these, instead of inexpensive Cricket lighters we have $10,000 value widgets, and the suit were brought in the district court, federal district court in Illinois?"
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1271.44,1274.142,And we're assuming diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1274.142,1274.676,Right.
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1274.676,1299.894,"Under the decisions of all of the circuits, according to language in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland case, the existing jurisprudence under the Irian-Thompkins doctrine strongly suggests that a state-city-university has no further jurisdictional reach than the courts of the state in which it's in."
1982.81-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1364.569,1369.473,But I take it your answer is the federal district court wouldn't have jurisdiction either--
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1369.473,1370.523,That is correct.
1982.81-1493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.406,1448.556,"--Well, Mr. Miller, you used the word ""substantial risk"" in the argument you just made, and I suppose that conveys your idea that we can't foresee exactly what would happen if an Illinois judgment including claims on behalf of some plaintiffs from out of state became final, and Gillette paid off on it, and then another complaint was brought by someone who had accepted the offer in another state."
1982.81-1493,0,16545,arthur_r_miller,,1458.078,1481.277,"With deference, Justice Rehnquist, I think it's most prudential to maintain the unbroken line of minimum contacts cases, because that way and only that way are you likely to get states respecting each other in terms of jurisdictional acquisition."
1982.81-1493,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1610.843,1615.714,Mr. Atkins.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,1615.714,1619.316,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court:"
1982.81-1493,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1765.076,1767.511,"Well, what do you think we ought to do with the case, Mr. Atkins?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,1767.511,1785.556,"--I think, Your Honor, that this Court should dismiss the petition as improvidently granted and leave the Illinois Trial Court to determine this case, move on with this case, and have faith and reliance in its state court, because I think that that's where it belongs."
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.773,1793.294,"Well, do you... do you suggest there's not a final judgment or just that we should dismiss it as improvidently granted?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,1793.294,1805.017,"--I suggest that with respect to... it may be a final judgment with respect to the issue before the Illinois Supreme Court, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's right for review--"
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.017,1805.553,"Right, right."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,1805.553,1806.553,--Of the issue that has been raised.
1982.81-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.687,1873.244,"Would settlement of this particular class action by Gillette in the Illinois action really solve Gillette's problems, if Mr. Miller is right and the problem is later suits in other jurisdictions?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,1873.244,1876.546,"--I think it would, Judge, for this reason."
1982.81-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1913.838,1916.69,"Now, that just doesn't make any sense at all to me, your answer."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,1927.046,1928.296,--That's correct.
1982.81-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.94,2003.61,"Well, are you saying... would your position be different if the individual claims were say $2,500 each instead of $7.95 each?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2003.61,2004.312,No.
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.845,2034.315,"But, Mr. Atkins, do you get to the settlement posture till you know what the class is?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2034.315,2045.373,"We get to the settlement posture, Judge, in my... in my experience at the time that we do notify, which sometimes is the same time."
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.373,2047.823,"But before you notify, you've got to certify a class."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2047.823,2048.491,That's correct.
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2048.491,2052.11,"And then you send out a notice and you know who opts out, and then you start talking settlement."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2052.11,2052.793,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.793,2055.995,"And I'm just wondering, you've got an $8.10 claim here."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2059.53,2061.23,"That's... that's pretty close, Judge, right."
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.23,2066.434,"And if that's true, I'm just wondering how many mailings back and forth you can afford and have anything left."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2066.434,2084.145,"As a practical matter, Your Honor, you've put your finger on a situation where the number in a class are important from an economical viewpoint that was recognized in Standard Oil."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2094.37,2097.22,And each one has a maximum recovery of around $8.00.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2097.22,2098.088,"That's right, Your Honor."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2098.088,2105.059,What's the economic justification for that kind of a lawsuit in the federal courts under any circumstances?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2105.059,2107.344,"We are in state court, Judge, in this case."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2107.344,2108.811,In state or federal courts.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2108.811,2117.716,"As far as judiciary concern, I suppose that if you... if you cheat people a little bit but do it a lot that you can go by free."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2127.007,2128.257,Suppose you... suppose you prevailed on everything.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2136.446,2143.017,"We have figured that out, Judge, and it's something in the neighborhood of over $5.00."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2143.017,2144.719,Five for each one of them.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2144.719,2145.219,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.219,2148.171,And the rest will be going where?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2148.171,2159.376,"Well, if our class includes everyone who does not opt out, then it would apply to everyone with respect--"
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2159.376,2165.18,"Well, the rest of it's going to the lawyers, is that not so, and to the expenses of litigation?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2165.18,2172.719,--There is administrative expenses and there are judicial expenses that go into any class action litigation.
1982.81-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.642,2182.908,You say judicial expenses.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2184.594,2185.194,No.
1982.81-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.129,2188.462,You mean attorneys' fees.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2188.462,2189.029,Yes.
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2260.242,2272.985,When... when there is a communication with the potential members of the class is there any obligation to tell them what is the maximum recovery that they can possibly anticipate?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2272.985,2280.238,"Normally in my experience you indicate the parameters of the lawsuit or in the settlement, what the terms of the settlement."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2284.042,2295.398,Do you tell the individual who's reading the letter that the maximum that you can expect to get if you respond to this and join the class is $4.83?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2295.398,2300.968,"To be perfectly fair you would come pretty close to trying to tell them that, because the judge--"
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2300.968,2301.92,--Not tell them.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2301.92,2315.912,"--If I might say, because just as was brought up before, lawyers' expenses in the case, administrative expenses may not wholly have been determined at this juncture, so you can't wholly note."
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.969,2330.885,Do you enclose a return envelope with a stamp on it?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2330.885,2336.17,It depends on whether there is claims in the case or there are not claims in the case.
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.17,2347.276,"Well, if you're... you're circulating a class of plaintiffs with an $8.00 claim do you put in a return envelope or not?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2347.276,2350.144,In an opt out procedure probably not.
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2350.144,2354.512,"Well, it's going to cost him a few cents anyway to opt out."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2354.512,2355.846,That's correct.
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.846,2356.446,Twenty cents.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2357.196,2359.212,That's correct.
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.212,2360.564,F-e-w.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2373.539,2386.881,"Well, one of the things that... differences in terms of the class action that we have pointed out is that costs are not normally assessed against absent class members--"
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2386.881,2392.202,"But maybe they're not normally, but can you say for certain that they would not be in a particular case?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2411.414,2430.993,"--I think that you have again addressed, Your Honor, a management problem, and whether or not they even should be certified; because if there are certain differences with respect to the laws of an individual state, these are some of the problems that may come up in a case that--"
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2430.993,2435.878,But perhaps... what I'm suggesting is there may be differences that don't surface at the outset.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2448.336,2463.262,--The flexibility of a class action device would be able to permit either a subclassing with respect to that or even a carving out with respect to that class.
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2463.262,2480.407,"I understand that, but the reason I mention those examples, what is the... in Illinois what is the practice with respect to telling a person who has a decision to make, shall I opt out or not, as to whether or not he might be subjected or costs and so forth?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2481.342,2487.163,It's been my observation that he is not told because the state of the law is such that he does not have those expenses.
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.948,2495.584,--Is it settled in Illinois that he is not responsible for discovery and not responsible for cost?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2495.584,2496.785,"That's my understanding, Your Honor."
1982.81-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.409,2689.56,"I understood Mr. Miller to concede quite frankly that none of our cases had applied the contacts rule to plaintiffs, but I would think that maybe that's because up until now you have had real live plaintiffs as opposed to class action plaintiffs, and that if a real live plaintiff comes into a forum and sues somebody, certainly he has waived any right he had to challenge jurisdiction."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2698.249,2707.77,"I understand that, Your Honor, that that particular issue with respect to absent class members had not been adjudicated before."
1982.81-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2742.694,2763.691,"Well, he's also lost his right... supposing he recovers the magnificent sum of $5.00 in the class action you're bringing for him in Illinois, and supposing he's in Oregon and Oregon has a statute that says anyone who is imposed upon the way you say Gillette imposed on these people shall have a right to recover actual damages plus $1,000 punitive damages."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2846.844,2851.796,"Well, I think--"
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2851.796,2866.639,"Suppose the case... suppose the... the... suppose the case goes to... goes to trial and there's a judgment against the class, a judgment in favor of Gillette."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2878.613,2890.421,"--Well, I think that that is what Professor Miller is saying would happen, and I'm suggesting that we don't know at this juncture."
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.421,2891.337,You don't know what?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2891.337,2911.299,"I don't know whether or not if when you say take the case on the merits in terms of deciding whether or not there's been a due process violation because of... relative to the absent class members, and you decide what, Your Honor... I'm not sure I understand the questions."
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.299,2921.689,"Well, if we... is part of our deciding whether there's a denial of due process the question of... is part of that question whether or not absent class members would be bound."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2921.689,2926.907,"Well, I think that they would be bound under the... under the Illinois decision."
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.907,2929.693,"Well, what if they wouldn't be, would there be a denial of due process?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2929.693,2942.001,"Well, I think that you run into the full faith and credit situation with respect to the validity of the Illinois court making a decision that... that would affect them."
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.612,2966.134,"Well, I'm just wondering, perhaps Gillette would win no matter how this case comes out."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2966.134,2966.934,They may.
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2966.934,2980.894,"At least if we decided that there's no denial of due process because the absent class members would be bound, then they wouldn't be subjected to the possibility of double judgments."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2985.446,2991.25,"Well, I don't think there's any question that they would be bound under the Illinois decision at the present time."
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.25,2992.952,There is--
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2992.952,2993.885,Assuming... assuming--
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2993.885,2994.885,--There's no question.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,2994.885,3001.189,--That we go through the adequate representation requirement which is essential to the due process in a class action.
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3007.711,3019.0,"Again, under Illinois law and Gillette prevails can it tax costs against the 168,000 or all those who joined?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3019.0,3021.75,They can tax costs against the represented party.
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.75,3023.666,Just the ones in Illinois.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3023.666,3025.035,"That's my understanding, yes."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3025.035,3026.735,How about on counsel?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3026.735,3029.07,As far as counsel's concerned?
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3029.07,3029.62,Yes.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3029.62,3030.204,I don't believe so.
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3030.204,3037.426,Is there any authority under the state laws to tax costs against counsel?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3037.426,3043.247,"I'm not particularly aware of that, Judge."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3043.247,3053.102,Or to tax counsel fees against... can they tax counsel fees of the prevailing party against the members of the class?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3053.102,3060.891,"For... for... under certain situations which I suppose are gross violations, they may be able to."
1982.81-1493,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3060.891,3069.128,"In other words, under the American rule as distinguished from the English rule there is no such authority in most of the states, is that right?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3069.128,3070.163,"That's my understanding, Judge."
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3120.696,3130.635,"Let me interrupt you there, Mr. Atkins, for just a... it would be unworkable because nobody's apt to spend 20 cents for a postage stamp to opt in to a case like this and take the trouble to send it in?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3130.635,3144.211,"--The experience has been, I think in terms of the commentators as well as the courts, in the manual for complex litigation we're talking about federal as well as state, that it would not... that people would not do that."
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3170.112,3174.064,"But the purposes of the class as a whole, it's better... it's kind of an inertia."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3188.324,3191.442,I would... I would--
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.442,3194.061,And isn't it almost a certainty that there will be no opt outs in this case?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3194.061,3197.846,"--I would have to go along with that assessment, Your Honor."
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.846,3200.882,So that it's kind of a... it's almost a charade in a way.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3220.878,3231.567,"Well, I think because the flexible standards of due process which is central to this case, that also has to be put into the mix in terms of whether or not a proposition a constitutional law is--"
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.567,3233.102,"--They're not giving up very much, you're saying."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3236.054,3237.354,"--Well, I... I... I didn't say that."
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3237.921,3239.44,"Well, but that's the other side of the coin, I suppose."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3239.44,3242.458,--I say that it should work for all people.
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3284.619,3289.272,"Well, the practical assumption, I guess, that underlies the... the approach to the case is that the plaintiff is going to win."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3294.39,3297.342,"There have been class actions where plaintiffs have lost, Your Honor."
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.342,3298.408,"I know there have, but I'm not sure that--"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3298.408,3299.608,I've been involved in them.
1982.81-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.608,3300.294,"--Yeah, well--"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3308.864,3322.79,"Well, that changes the... what you're suggesting, Your Honor, is changing Rule 23 with respect to the federal court and applying those to states or the entire country."
1982.81-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3345.156,3347.406,"Well, that's really up to Illinois, isn't it?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3347.406,3348.775,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1982.81-1493,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3414.817,3431.762,"Mr. Atkins, do I get your position clearly that if there are any due process rights of these non-resident class members, Illinois satisfies them simply by the opt out procedure?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3431.762,3433.964,"Not simply, Your Honor."
1982.81-1493,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3433.964,3434.414,What else?
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3434.414,3435.731,I think that that's part of it.
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.778,3509.262,"Well, you wouldn't suggest, would you, that... that Illinois consistently with the Constitution could require Gillette to pay $8.00 times 168,000 in the court for distribution among class members, and at the same time concede that many of those members who did not opt out would not be bound?"
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3509.262,3516.249,"Well, if... are you talking about an adjudication or are you talking about a settlement, Your Honor?"
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3516.249,3517.866,I'm talking about an adjudication.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3530.675,3531.708,That's correct.
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3531.708,3541.899,"And if that's wrong, Gillette, it seems to me, has some due process claim of its own, not just for absent class members."
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3541.899,3551.589,"Well, Gillette could... Gillette could argue the... you're talking about Gillette's arguing their own due process rights?"
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.589,3552.322,Yes.
1982.81-1493,1,38562,robert_s_atkins,,3555.44,3557.107,The double liability in terms of--
1982.81-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.107,3557.74,"Yeah, double jeopardy."
