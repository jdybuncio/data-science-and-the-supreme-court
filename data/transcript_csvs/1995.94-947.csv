1995.94-947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.26,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-947, National Labor Relations Board v. Town & Country Electric."
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,18.766,23.721,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.052,160.862,"Is it your position, Mr. Wallace, that if a person does not come within any of those exemptions and is ""hired"" he is therefore an employee?"
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,160.862,167.467,"Well, that is the conclusion that the Court reached, and it is our--"
1995.94-947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.467,169.69,I asked what your position--
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,169.69,248.331,"--Our position is that he is therefore an employee unless there are reasons, in interpreting the National Labor Relations Act, why an implied exemption should be found, a question for the board to address initially, and the only example in which this Court found an implied exemption was the case of NLRB v. Bell Aerospace which involved managerial employees, and the Court in reliance upon the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act and its overruling of this Court's decision in the Packard case by adding to this list of exemptions supervisors has... that Congress had relied on the notion that managerial employees would be excluded sort of a fortiori from supervisors, and that the board had always, while not holding them not to be employees, had always placed them in separate bargaining units from other employees."
1995.94-947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.331,263.21,"--What about an employee who fills out a job application, is hired, and yet his only purpose is to get into the plant so that he can blow it up?"
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,269.177,280.941,If he applied for a job that he was seeking where he would be working for wages under the supervision of the employers--
1995.94-947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.941,281.081,Yes.
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,281.081,285.285,--he would be within the statutory definition of employee.
1995.94-947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.707,288.257,So he... that person is an employee.
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,288.257,291.72,--That doesn't mean that he has to be hired.
1995.94-947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.72,295.633,"Well, suppose he... the company, not knowing this, goes ahead and hires him."
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,295.633,302.208,Then he's subject to all of the company's work rules and duties of loyalty.
1995.94-947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.121,322.122,But isn't that a--
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,322.122,325.094,--protects applicants from discrimination in hiring.
1995.94-947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.094,331.101,"--Isn't that Exhibit A, what I'm talking about, of inconsistent loyalties?"
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,342.22,360.322,"This is... of course it would be a breach of duty, whether it would be because he wanted to do it of his own volition or whether because of loyalty to some other group."
1995.94-947,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,461.131,461.552,"Mr. Wallace, why--"
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,461.552,461.872,--of other kinds to try--
1995.94-947,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,461.872,462.643,--Mr. Wallace--
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,462.643,463.505,--to carry on their operations.
1995.94-947,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.505,478.935,--why wouldn't the same reasoning that you've just explained to us for the strike exception apply to the person who is under an agreement with the union to walk out when the union blows the whistle?
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,480.918,529.448,"Because while that is a rule of the voluntary organization, section 7 of the act protects the right of workers to have voluntary organizations, including their right to make reasonable rules of conduct for their members, but you're talking about a future contingency, and when the time comes, under this Court's decision in Pattern Makers and the rationale of this decision, each individual can decide for himself whether he will in fact adhere to the union rule--"
1995.94-947,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,529.448,530.209,"But that's different, Mr. Wallace."
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,567.755,573.661,"--He would definitely qualify as an employee, although the rationale of Sunland might apply."
1995.94-947,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,613.939,617.041,"But one can be an employee for one purpose and not the other, isn't that--"
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,617.041,620.184,"It's possible, but they are an employee--"
1995.94-947,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.184,624.518,"--For example, let's take these employees, and there's an election."
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,638.438,642.94,"--He's an employee, but that doesn't mean that he's entitled to vote."
1995.94-947,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,650.386,654.34,What is the provision in the statute that entitles someone to vote in a union election?
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,654.34,656.099,--I don't recall.
1995.94-947,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,660.173,668.548,"If it uses the word employee, someone might not be an employee for that purpose, although would be an employee for another purpose."
1995.94-947,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,671.31,672.071,"--Well, the board has always held--"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1617.905,1623.537,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.688,1673.31,Why is that inconsistent with the duty of the employer?
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1682.937,1683.217,--That's correct.
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1683.217,1703.453,"I can understand if you have a duty to two employers with respect to the same act, you have a problem, but his duty to the employer related to one act, his duty to the union related to other acts, namely, his off-duty time in which he would be hire... be recruiting people to the union."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1705.095,1711.088,"Your Honor, the... in the first place, the conduct was not limited to off duty."
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1712.688,1713.389,"Well, wait."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1718.385,1718.585,--No.
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1718.585,1719.864,--use his--
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1719.864,1726.38,"In the first place, that distinction is only material if that person is an employee within the meaning of the act."
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.325,1733.635,--Right.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1733.635,1735.648,--they are not entitled to the protection of the act at any--
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.648,1736.009,I understand.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1737.489,1738.661,--The--
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.661,1759.975,"Are you saying, then, if the identical arrangement were made between someone who was already hired by the employer, somebody who's on the job, then becomes a paid organizer for the union in addition, that that person at that point would lose employee status?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1759.975,1769.011,--I believe it would be a question of whether or not that person had agreed to subject themselves to the control of the union just like--
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1769.011,1774.384,"Same thing... same thing, except it's someone who is already on the payroll."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1774.384,1774.574,"--Yes, ma'am."
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1774.574,1777.056,In every other respect it's the same.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1777.056,1777.336,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1799.499,1800.69,Let's not talk in the abstract.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1825.208,1841.68,--I would submit that if that person had subjected themselves to the control of the union and had similar... had obligations similar to those that were imposed by the salting resolution in this case that would give the union primary control over what the person did--
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1841.68,1858.14,"Let's take the salting resolution out of it, and just have the compensation for organizing the shop, using... within the rules of shop using free time and lunch breaks."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1858.14,1871.991,--I think that would be very much like the conflict of interest that a lawyer would have if they were trying to suspend their representation of one client to represent the opponent for a meeting or for a hearing.
1995.94-947,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.332,1883.031,"Well, you're basically saying that even under those circumstances, the person could no longer be an employee within the meaning of the act."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1885.434,1887.994,--If they accepted the... submitted--
1995.94-947,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1887.994,1903.225,"Well, what about a striking worker who accepts union... follows the union order to strike, accepts benefits from the union, and so forth, not an employee under your theory."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1903.225,1905.378,"--I disagree, Your Honor."
1995.94-947,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1918.585,1937.007,"Well, how about the rank and file employee who is a union member, and who has already agreed in advance by being a union member that if the union requires him to strike, he will, and furthermore, if the union provides benefits during a strike, he'll take them."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1937.007,1939.67,I don't... I believe that that's an entirely different situation.
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1951.879,1960.994,"Well, in any case, I take it your answer, earlier answer that it's the failure to limit his activities to off-duty time, I take it you withdraw that answer."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1963.217,1963.986,"Your Honor, I didn't mean--"
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1963.986,1978.108,"--because... well, if I understood... I thought your answered Justice Ginsburg by saying, what if the employee comes... is already hired, the union says, we'll pay you money to organize during the lunch breaks and the off time."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1984.381,1984.681,--That's correct.
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1984.681,1984.901,Okay.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,1999.623,2002.867,"As long as that agency relationship and control exists, yes."
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2002.867,2005.856,"Right, so it's got nothing to do, then, with on-time or off-time."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2005.856,2006.017,Correct.
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.017,2006.887,Why is that so?
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2012.88,2020.467,"If they are acting within the consensual relationship of the collective bargaining relationship, that's--"
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.467,2022.687,"But they're doing work for the union, aren't they?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2022.687,2026.861,"--That's true, but that is normally covered by the collective bargaining relationship."
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.309,2051.19,"It seems to me that the theory of the act is that there's no inherent incompatibility between obligations to the union and obligation to the employer, and I don't know how to make the act work without adopting that--"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2051.19,2056.103,"--I think that the distinction is based on, going back to the definition of employee."
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.897,2076.377,--Why is it inconsistent?
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2080.01,2081.552,"--It is, because--"
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.552,2093.17,"If the union's telling him to sabotage, you know, the machinery he's working on, yes, that's inconsistent, but the union's not directing his work as to what he's doing for the employer."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2093.17,2104.978,"--In the first instance, Your Honor, I believe that the motivation of the employee differs from the motivation of this... these union agents."
1995.94-947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.896,2122.191,"Well, so all employees of General Motors are really concerned whether the employer likes them or not?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2122.191,2124.462,"No, Your Honor."
1995.94-947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2124.462,2132.748,"That's not an ordinary attribute of industrial employment, is it, is concern that the employer like you?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2132.748,2133.469,No.
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2154.502,2158.693,"But you could say that about anybody who has a second job, whether it's with the union or not."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2166.94,2178.409,"--But I think that because you're having them focus on simultaneously doing and serving conflicting interests, I think it's that simultaneous conflict--"
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2178.409,2180.411,But why is it necessarily--
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2184.981,2185.442,"--Yes, sir."
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2185.442,2189.676,"Even if the employer never... it's true if the employer doesn't know about it, too?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2189.676,2190.057,Yes.
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.057,2191.997,If the guy never was an employee.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2200.145,2206.53,"He never had been employed under the National Labor Relations Act because of that conflict, and that also points out the fact that he could very well--"
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.53,2210.713,"Is it essential to your position that the conflict be with the union, or... say it was a competitor."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2210.713,2212.313,--It's the same conflict.
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.313,2215.455,And what if he promised his wife he'd quit as soon as she told him to.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2219.929,2226.273,"I don't have a good answer for that, Your Honor."
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2226.844,2227.525,It seems to me it would be the same.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2257.225,2286.536,"I would submit that frequently it is the purpose of the union to have the organizer fired, so that they can file unfair labor practices, because if they can get the National Labor Relations Board to find that the employer is a violator and that there is substantial monetary damages, they can much more effectively and much more quickly get what their goal is, which is a labor agreement, than they can if they go through the democratic processes of the act."
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2286.536,2291.519,They're not going to do that very effectively if he is plausibly fired for bad work.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2291.519,2297.462,"Well... well, that may be true, that's what happened in this case."
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2297.462,2300.826,"They want him to do good work but be obnoxious, isn't that--"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2305.277,2306.148,I don't think so.
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2306.148,2306.479,No?
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2306.479,2312.923,I think that in this case there was substantial evidence that he did work poorly.
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2315.253,2317.024,And that would have been cause for discharge--
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2317.024,2317.745,--Well--
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2317.745,2319.866,--and that's a question of fact.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2319.866,2333.807,"--And the... the NLRB ruled against the employer, as they generally would in this sort of a case where there's an overt organizer, because they would say that the employer is discriminating on the basis of known union activity."
1995.94-947,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2333.807,2346.494,"Well, Mr. Pease, presumably the employer could make a broad policy in hiring people that the employer won't hire anyone who has a second job."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2346.494,2350.116,"That's true, Your Honor, but--"
1995.94-947,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2350.116,2352.409,This employer didn't have that rule.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2352.409,2352.6,--That's correct.
1995.94-947,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2394.477,2396.708,I'd like to clear up just one small point.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2403.323,2404.775,"No, Your Honor, I didn't."
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2404.775,2435.255,"Suppose you had somebody who was a zealous union person, didn't take a penny because he was just so devoted to the union, doesn't want to take anything from the union treasury, doing the same thing that this person did, undertakes the job, said union, I'm going to use all my free time to proselytize for you, does that person lose employee status?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2435.255,2437.216,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so."
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2453.849,2456.17,Why can't you be an unpaid agent?
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2456.17,2458.229,You could be.
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2458.229,2461.763,"Well, then the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question would be different, wouldn't it?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2461.763,2462.914,But I think there has to be the--
1995.94-947,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2462.914,2464.594,This is a zealot.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2470.33,2471.501,--It has to be a contract.
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.501,2476.545,Even if the contract is a peppercorn or nothing at all... a zealot with a contract.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2476.545,2476.855,I believe--
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.855,2477.607,Then you'd change your answer.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2477.607,2477.887,--Yes.
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.887,2478.398,Okay.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2479.139,2479.977,Yes.
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.977,2484.702,Okay.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2487.063,2510.049,"I believe that the... under the Darden case, that this Court has held that when Congress uses a circular definition of employee, they intend to incorporate the law of agency into that definition, and I think that's what they did in this case."
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2510.049,2517.193,"What do you find in the law of agency that contradicts... I mean, the Restatement?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2534.704,2534.965,That's correct.
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2534.965,2541.049,"And you say here the one does involve... but you leave out the fact that it says, as to one act."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2546.184,2555.849,"I believe that the concept there, though, is if that is a pervasive... if it is a general control that is being exercised by the union--"
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.849,2564.367,"So long as it's not a control over the act that he's doing from the employer, for the employer... what control does the union exercise over the act that he is doing for the employer?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2564.367,2566.918,"--Okay, there are several areas of control."
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2586.872,2588.983,He has no obligation to the employer to stay.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2599.661,2603.983,"--That's correct, but they're exercising their free will in making the change."
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.819,2618.674,"So long as it's not an order from the union that causes him to violate a duty to the employer, I don't see how that changes his employee status."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2618.674,2624.079,I don't... I believe that it's because it's contrary to the interests of the employer.
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.87,2712.721,Would you tell me about the Sunland case?
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2721.039,2729.914,"--It was that the employer had no duty, they did not specifically say that they were not employees, but I believe that the analysis is the same analysis that I'm urging."
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2731.674,2733.915,--Let me also clarify one thing in my own mind.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2744.586,2750.819,"No, I... the Phelps Dodge case, I think that if they would have been a bona fide employee as--"
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.819,2752.47,If they'd been hired.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2752.47,2754.16,"--If they were employed, they would be bona fide applicants."
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2756.714,2757.723,So it's the same rule as to both groups.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2757.723,2757.873,Yes.
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.873,2758.163,Yes.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2758.163,2758.614,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.614,2766.799,"But it is the Government's position that you not only... well, you cannot refuse to hire these salts."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2768.781,2769.38,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-947,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.38,2776.125,That going in you shouldn't... you can't turn down the other seven just because you know that they're union salts.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2776.125,2778.058,That is my understanding of their position.
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2778.058,2790.527,"Well, what is your position on whether any deference is owed to the NLRB in defining a term used in the NLRA?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2792.55,2802.037,I believe that the board is due deference when their interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the policies of the act.
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2829.082,2833.336,But you said that employee is not self-defining.
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2837.23,2847.726,"--I believe that by including a circular definition, they did intend to include the law of agency into the definition of employee, and I--"
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2847.726,2852.567,"Is there room for... any room for interpretation, or does the word employee have a plain meaning?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2852.567,2876.226,"--I do believe there is room for interpretation, and I believe that Congress did intend to expand on the law... on the law of agency by adding the language that it's not limited to an employee of any particular employer, because I think they wanted to include employees in several different... with several different employers in an industry."
1995.94-947,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2876.226,2880.957,"So your position is, there's room for interpretation, but this particular interpretation is unreasonable."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,2880.957,2917.762,"That's correct, and I believe... one of the reasons that I think it is is that when Congress went on to explain in the definition of employee, they said that it included individuals who were out of work, or whose work ceased because of a current labor dispute, or an unfair labor practice, and who had not obtained regular and substantially equivalent employment, which implies that there are other situations which would not be included, and it seems to me that what it does is, it shows that they were trying to take... retain the core."
1995.94-947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2990.619,3002.477,"How again do you think the board is partial here, as opposed to being neutral between organizing and nonorganizing?"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,3002.477,3013.425,"Well, I think that what they're doing is, they're giving their stamp of approval in requiring the employer to put the union on the employer's crew."
1995.94-947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3036.402,3042.407,What if some person who seeks employment wants to try to decertify the union?
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,3061.14,3071.237,"--Well, I think the issue would only come up if this person was acting on behalf of some third party and there was an agency relationship--"
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.237,3072.119,"A rival union, perhaps."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,3072.119,3072.857,--I'm sorry?
1995.94-947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.857,3074.78,"A rival union, perhaps."
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,3074.78,3077.895,"That's true, very possible, and that is a point I would like to make."
1995.94-947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3269.212,3272.965,"That requires a thoroughly obnoxious organizer, I guess--"
1995.94-947,1,32458,james_k_pease_jr,,3279.44,3287.485,"But the problem is, Your Honor, that frequently the objective is not to organize in the classical sense."
1995.94-947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3351.247,3353.047,"Thank you, Mr. Pease."
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3355.201,3356.36,Thank you.
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3356.36,3381.118,"Mr. Wallace, before you even start, I have... the one thing that sticks in my craw a little bit about this case is not the necessity of treating this person as an employee, that's fine, but the inability not only not to fire the person knowing that he's on the union payroll, but even the inability to refuse to hire the person knowing that he's on the union payroll."
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3400.652,3402.963,Well--
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.963,3406.756,"What would make it unlawful to refuse to hire him, or to fire him, for that matter?"
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3406.756,3420.025,--8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) protect against coercion or intimidation in the exercise of the rights--
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3420.025,3421.747,--the rights guaranteed in section 157.
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3421.747,3421.917,--Right.
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3422.648,3424.869,Does that include the right to be employed by a labor union?
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3424.869,3436.768,"Well, it includes the right to participate in the union and to comply with its voluntary rules, so--"
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3436.768,3437.278,He has no problem with that.
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3437.278,3438.53,--long as the member wants to do that.
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3438.53,3439.632,He has no problem with all that.
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3443.297,3448.809,Organizational activity is an important part of a union's functions.
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3448.809,3449.961,I have no problem with that.
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3451.693,3454.733,"Well, that is--"
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3454.733,3458.777,"You want to conduct organizational activity, you know, God bless you, but I do not want a worker who is on the union payroll."
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3458.777,3459.127,--That--
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.127,3461.939,It seems to me a perfectly reasonable position for an employer to take.
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3461.939,3474.757,"--It may be a reasonable position, but it is a position that interferes with the union's ability to conduct its protected activities."
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3482.772,3483.773,"That's a separate question, though, from whether he's an employee."
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3483.773,3484.363,That's correct--
1995.94-947,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3484.363,3484.513,Once he's hired.
1995.94-947,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3484.513,3495.061,"--it is a separate question, as the Sunland decision illustrates, but the board made its views on that question quite clear in this case."
1995.94-947,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3584.889,3585.105,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
