1989.88-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.293,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-805, Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health."
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,11.762,15.213,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.559,249.18,What about the clear and convincing evidence standard that's required?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,249.18,276.686,"Your Honor, the clear and convincing standard of proof here does, in fact, provide for an ability... since the parents are not going to be represented at the hearing, the state has decided not to turn this into an adversarial type process, so the state is not represented, and there needs to be in this nonadversarial ex parte type of proceeding some way to assure a reliable result in the outcome."
1989.88-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.686,277.983,"Well, what test do you apply?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,280.919,281.559,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.681,329.32,And what about the risk of erroneous deprivation?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,329.32,337.271,"Your Honor, it is the state's position that the risk can only here be borne by the minor since she is the only party involved, based--"
1989.88-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,337.271,342.878,"But it increases the risk of erroneous deprivation by increasing the burden of proof, of course."
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,342.878,345.017,"--That is correct, Your Honor, and--"
1989.88-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.017,349.718,"And you have an unsophisticated minor, presumably, trying to handle these things."
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,353.217,363.23,"--Your Honor, the minor is here under the statute represented by counsel so is aided in her presentation before the court, and there is an ability to present."
1989.88-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,380.331,385.095,And what evidence would suffice to meet the standard of clear and convincing?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,385.095,396.294,"--Your Honor, it is the definition of clear and convincing evidence under Ohio law that it's more than a mere preponderance but not to the extent of such certainty as beyond a reasonable doubt."
1989.88-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,417.098,421.752,"Well... well, what kind of evidence does the minor adduce to show maturity?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,421.752,429.483,"--Your Honor, I... I would posit that the minor would simply be able to tell her side to the judge."
1989.88-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.371,443.041,"Well, what sort of factors do you take into account if you're a judge in order to tell if the minor is mature or not?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,443.041,455.331,"--I think the ability to answer questions, how well the minor is able to articulate what her particular concerns are if it is a best interest question."
1989.88-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,473.762,477.948,"Can... can you tell us how long these hearings usually take to determine, say, maturity?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,477.948,491.537,"Your Honor, specifically, the statute provides for the juvenile level to be heard within the fifth... by the fifth business day but as soon as possible, but no later than the fifth business day."
1989.88-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,491.537,494.456,I... I meant how long does the hearing itself take?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,494.456,494.706,The time?
1989.88-805,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.187,941.323,"Ms. Eppler, is the... is the state arguing that you need not have a bypass procedure at all for just a notification statute, where consent isn't required?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,941.323,943.089,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.399,950.288,"And you have addressed that in your brief, I take it?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,950.288,950.773,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.754,961.347,As compared with... or contrasted with a consent?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,961.347,962.378,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,977.402,984.103,Would that be the state's position if the notification requirement were to both biologic parents?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,984.103,986.929,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.6,999.378,May I ask about the notification?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1007.796,1008.983,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.983,1012.606,And not by any... what... what is the justification for that limitation?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1024.602,1036.363,"Your Honor, specifically, that is provided for the physician to provide notification to the parent to properly protect the minor's health interest here."
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.292,1062.226,"In other words, one of the justifications for this statute is to give the physician information that the state thinks the physician needs?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1062.226,1067.413,"--Yes, Your Honor, to allow that physician to maximize information, to--"
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.413,1072.161,"Well, if the physician thought the information was necessary, the physician could always call up and ask for it; that's clear."
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1077.69,1079.19,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.828,1091.138,The protection being that the physician might not realize that there was information out there that he or she ought to get?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1091.138,1091.996,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.358,1133.573,"Well, then, is that one of the factors that the judge has to take into account in the bypass procedure, whether there is need for the transmittal of this kind of information?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1133.573,1140.696,"No, Your Honor, because in each instance the requirement of the statute does have the physician directly communicating with the parent."
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.696,1144.553,"Well, not if the... not if there's a bypass authorized?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1144.553,1146.303,"Oh, that... yes, Your Honor [inaudible]."
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.303,1149.864,"And does it... how, in the bypass procedure, do you protect this state interest?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1154.549,1158.673,I... I don't believe that is a question that is directly addressed by the bypass procedure.
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.595,1162.827,It's just... is it a relevant consideration in the bypass procedure?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1167.904,1171.309,"--It is not laid out for in the statute, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.593,1217.633,"So you're... the justification for... for the particular procedure that Ohio has is not just to enable the minor and the parent to make an informed decision, but also to be sure the doctor acts wisely?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1217.633,1225.13,"In essence, Your Honor, but it is the minor's health that is the particular state interest that is articulated."
1989.88-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.409,1233.97,"Well, is the reason for the parents' participation primarily to protect the minor's health?"
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1233.97,1238.531,"--And encourage parental involvement in the decision-making of the minor; both, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1428.86,1440.777,"Ms. Eppler, it isn't altogether clear to me why that question has to be decided, in view of the fact that the state has decided to have a bypass procedure."
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1440.777,1442.121,"You are correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1452.74,1454.287,But not necessary--
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1454.287,1454.74,That is correct.
1989.88-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1454.74,1455.27,--to the decision?
1989.88-805,0,39175,rita_s_eppler,,1455.27,1456.489,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.522,1494.317,"Thank you, Ms. Eppler."
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,1507.25,1512.388,Either that or grow.
1989.88-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1898.141,1900.843,"Is there no right to counsel, here?"
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,1900.843,1902.232,--Your Honor--
1989.88-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.232,1910.682,Will there be a lawyer under the scheme who can address the pleading question on... on behalf of the young woman?
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,1910.682,1916.414,"--Most probably not, Your Honor, at the point that the complaint is filed."
1989.88-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1916.414,1919.194,Can it be amended after it's filed?
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,1919.194,1932.736,"It would appear that under Ohio civil rules, if a lawyer, once appointed, in appearing at the hearing moved the court for such an amendment it would be possible."
1989.88-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1941.342,1944.216,"But under Ohio law, normally it would be granted."
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,1946.777,1947.574,--That's correct.
1989.88-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1947.574,1948.043,Yes.
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,1948.043,1949.322,"The judge would have that discretion, but--"
1989.88-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1949.322,1957.631,"I mean, it just... it strikes me that the argument is a bit strained that the pleading requirement is particularly onerous."
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,1957.631,1989.823,"--Well, the view that it's onerous, Your Honor, is based on the view that there is no justification for throwing up a barricade or an obstacle to a minor coming into the court and being able... without getting a lawyer and without knowing about amendment, be able to present her case in a meaningful way to the judge."
1989.88-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.186,2063.168,"Ms. Sogg, can I ask you a question about Ohio law?"
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,2099.059,2101.387,"Yes, Mr. Justice, she can."
1989.88-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.387,2103.339,She has... she has a right to do it without--
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,2103.339,2131.187,"Not by statutory law, Your Honor, but Ohio, as many if not most states in the Union, have case law that establishes what is known as the mature minor rule, and that permits a minor to give consent for any medical procedure, whether emergency or not, if there is a determination that that minor is mature enough to do so."
1989.88-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.187,2133.936,--Of whatever age?
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,2133.936,2137.357,"Actually, of... in fact, that is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2273.661,2290.013,"It would be quite consistent with our cases, wouldn't it, to say that the state may encourage people to come for drug counseling, suicidal tendencies, but need not encourage abortion in the same way?"
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,2290.013,2329.997,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor, and as a matter of fact, Appellees... Plaintiffs have never disputed the fact that parents, loving parents, can play an important role in the guidance of vulnerable, immature children who benefit from... from that guidance, and have recognized that this Court has indicated that certain health care areas ought to involve, wherever possible and appropriate, a loving, supportive parent."
1989.88-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2491.666,2494.79,"Well, not necessarily."
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,2497.852,2499.694,"It could be, certainly, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2757.246,2760.37,"Why is that, Ms. Sogg?"
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,2772.053,2793.638,"The fact is, Your Honor, that this Court has held in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, in Goss v. Lopez and in a number of other cases that where a state need not choose to create an entitlement, it can choose not to do so."
1989.88-805,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2803.54,2807.976,"What is the entitlement that the state has provided here, in your view?"
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,2807.976,2820.83,--The state has provided a property interest for the minor in exercising her right to avoid hostile or harmful parental involvement.
1989.88-805,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2820.83,2830.56,"Well, property... what case of ours do you think comes closest to say that the state has provided a property interest by enacting this procedure here?"
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,2830.56,2833.652,"I believe Goss v. Lopez, Your Honor, comes the closest."
1989.88-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.037,3129.752,"Ms. Sogg, I'm... I'm... I'm... I... you went by me on the mature minor's First Amendment rights."
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,3141.826,3142.763,That's correct.
1989.88-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.763,3154.882,"I assume a parent, even a parent of a mature minor, can prevent that minor from publishing a newspaper if the parent says I don't want you to public the newspaper, no matter how mature the minor might be--"
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,3154.882,3156.803,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3156.803,3157.178,--isn't that so?
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,3157.178,3159.177,I... I... I think that--
1989.88-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3159.177,3161.583,"I mean, we are talking about minors, mature or not?"
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,3161.583,3161.927,--We are indeed.
1989.88-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.899,3198.099,"Rights we just do limit at 18, I mean--"
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,3198.099,3198.615,That's correct.
1989.88-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3198.615,3203.847,--or at least permit the parents to exercise control over.
1989.88-805,1,35084,linda_r_sogg,,3203.847,3204.644,That's correct.
1989.88-805,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.334,3240.661,"Thank you, Ms. Sogg."
1989.88-805,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,3242.644,3244.705,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3297.246,3297.793,Excuse me.
1989.88-805,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,3305.385,3307.227,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-805,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.828,3408.234,Claiming a technical battery against the physician?
1989.88-805,2,39175,rita_s_eppler,,3408.234,3411.794,"--That is correct, Your Honor; for technical battery, assault and malpractice."
1989.88-805,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3611.387,3612.012,"Thank you, Ms. Eppler."
