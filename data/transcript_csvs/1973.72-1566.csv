1973.72-1566,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.579,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1566, Granny Goose Foods against Teamsters."
1973.72-1566,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,33.613,36.218,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.72-1566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.659,319.657,When you say that the judge by denying the motion to dismiss or to dissolve thereby continued the order in effect.
1973.72-1566,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,324.925,330.268,"Well, I think there are two points to be made here."
1973.72-1566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,401.587,423.46,"But I'm -- my reading on the record and you may certainly correct me if I am wrong, is that the Union’s basic position on the motion to dissolve, was that Sinclair against Atkinson prevented the continuance of this restraining order, not as a matter of discretion, but simply because of the Norris-La Guardia Act."
1973.72-1566,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,443.655,454.185,"Your Honor, the choice rest entirely with the Union as to which argument it wish to present on a motion to dissolve the restraining order."
1973.72-1566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,478.377,489.567,"But of course, even if they have never made any motion, it’s still fair to say they would have had the opportunity to defend their rules, give them the authority to come in and move to dissolve a temporary restraining order."
1973.72-1566,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,497.405,520.482,"Your Honor, in this case, the issue that was relied upon by the Court of Appeals in vacating the contempt judgment was the fact that Section 527 in the California Code of Civil Procedure apparently imposed some sort of 20-day limitation on the duration of State Court Orders."
1973.72-1566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,561.42,566.185,"Yes, under California law that this type of proceeding taking place in the state court --"
1973.72-1566,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,566.185,566.295,That’s right.
1973.72-1566,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,566.295,570.725,It would have converted the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction.
1973.72-1566,0,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,570.725,579.455,It would have continued the restraining order in effect and the domination of whether or not it was a restraining order or preliminary injunction would be a relevant for contempt purposes.
1973.72-1566,1,20553,duane_b_beeson,,1136.766,1141.979,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.72-1566,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.693,1210.506,"I am not sure that it’s relevant, but do you disagree with your friend who says that Union was represented at the preliminary stage and that they were invited to participate and when the order was entered, is that about what he said?"
1973.72-1566,1,20553,duane_b_beeson,,1210.506,1213.73,"Yes, that is what he said and essentially, that is quite happened."
1973.72-1566,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1257.029,1282.138,I suppose this is what it’s common in many as trial courts such as the trial judge is dealing with ex parte injunction at least wants to be alerted to possible factors that might lead him to call a hearing before issued.
1973.72-1566,1,20553,duane_b_beeson,,1282.138,1288.206,That they will be and I think that is particularly true in labor dispute cases.
1973.72-1566,2,26175,george_j_tichy_ii,,2814.204,2817.895,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1973.72-1566,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2844.941,2846.089,Where do we find that in the appendix?
