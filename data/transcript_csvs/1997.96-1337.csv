1997.96-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.067,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1337, the County of Sacramento v. Teri Lewis and Thomas Lewis."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,9.346,12.959,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1337,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,53.047,58.511,"May I ask you a question right at the start, please, Mr. Cassidy?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,96.615,101.608,"Justice O'Connor, no, we do not concede that a negligent claim would support a violation of substantive due process."
1997.96-1337,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,102.81,119.529,"Well, do you concede that on the facts in this case, the police pursuit case before us, that the only inquiry is what standard to apply, because there would be a substantive due process violation?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,119.529,131.068,--The petitioners in this case have asserted that the proper question presented is whether or not... what... the proper legal standard to be applied in a claim for substantive due process.
1997.96-1337,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.783,141.245,But that's not the position taken by the county.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,141.245,146.386,"Upon reflection, I would agree with that position as asserted by amici."
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.14,155.563,So what am I supposed to do?
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,177.799,180.441,Justice Scalia--
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,180.441,186.575,Do I pick grossly negligent conduct because that's the closest to not having a substantive due process violation at all?
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,186.575,187.924,"--Well, no, Your Honor."
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.898,210.601,"Well, I certainly thought that's what this case was about when I first read about its facts."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,217.274,218.065,And I would--
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.065,228.773,"Lo and behold, I read this thing and it's somehow a substantive due process violation put in a whole different category of constitutional analysis, and the city just goes along with that."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,239.298,254.369,"--I believe that the courts of appeal have analyzed the case law involving police pursuits under substantive due process violations, or alleged violations, but if this Court then looks--"
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.369,256.069,Certainly nothing in this Court has.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,256.069,267.986,"--Correct, and if this Court were to look at the recent Mays opinion out of the Seventh Circuit, perhaps, and upon reflection by petitioners we would submit that that may be the correct analysis."
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.482,307.063,"I certainly... you know, you cannot expand the First Amendment, for example, by saying, well, this doesn't violate any of our First Amendment law, however, we think this was a deprivation of liberty under the Due Process Clause, apart from the First Amendment."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,308.983,310.716,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.716,311.754,Why should we do it for the Fourth?
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,311.754,330.198,"Upon reflection, petitioners would submit that it should not be so expanded, and that perhaps the analysis by this Court in DeShaney v. Winnebago is the correct analysis, that in fact, if this Court were to allow the claim for substantive due process to go forward, it would substantially disrupt the political process."
1997.96-1337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,342.706,350.41,But could you not have a high speed chase that wouldn't involve the Fourth Amendment?
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,387.797,406.036,"Justice Ginsburg, although that specific type of circumstance has not been decided by this Court, the Fifth Circuit in the Checki v. Webb case did take that approach, and therein lies the basis for the analysis that potentially there could be such a claim."
1997.96-1337,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,428.262,449.086,"Well, do you... if we assume for the sake of argument that this is properly a substantive due process case and not a Fourth Amendment case, are we supposed to take the case on the assumption that on at least one of the two alternative standards that has been proposed here there is a substantive due process violation?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,454.238,456.991,No.
1997.96-1337,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,464.376,465.538,"So it's not merely a question of, he didn't know which."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,477.927,485.069,"Well, 1), if you assume--"
1997.96-1337,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,485.069,503.773,"Because usually we don't get wrapped around problems of qualified immunity unless we are at least assuming that now there's a violation, so that's why I want to know whether you are conceding that now, on at least one of these standards, there would be a substantive due process violation."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,503.773,504.364,"--No, we are not."
1997.96-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,516.091,526.219,"I suppose you take the position that there was... a) there was no violation, but b) if you should find a violation, there was nonetheless qualified immunity."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,526.219,527.728,That's correct.
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,527.728,532.53,Why wasn't this case disposed of on the basis of qualified immunity?
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,547.681,560.44,"Well, in fact, Justice Scalia, petitioners would heartily agree, and in fact the district court did dispose of this matter on behalf of Deputy Smith with respect to the qualified immunity issue, and we believe correctly did so."
1997.96-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.543,755.157,"May I ask, on the political process, is it correct that in California the officers are immune for this kind of conduct, even if it's... no matter how gross?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,755.157,761.642,"--You are correct, Justice Stevens, in that the individual officer is immune."
1997.96-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,765.265,767.947,"In other words, the city might be held liable."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,767.947,768.267,Correct.
1997.96-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.267,771.319,"On a respondeat superior type of approach, or--"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,771.319,771.889,That's correct.
1997.96-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.916,817.951,"--Now, in this case did the plaintiff sue the county, too?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,817.951,818.412,Yes.
1997.96-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.412,819.081,On State law grounds?
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,819.081,819.551,Correct.
1997.96-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.551,820.022,Yes.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,820.022,843.167,"And a portion of that was dismissed at the district court level and a portion of that was reserved, specifically whether or not the county of Sacramento would be immune from liability under the vehicle code section that provides for the adoption of an appropriate pursuit policy as well as the issue of whether or not it was an accident that resulted from the operation of the suspect's vehicle in this case."
1997.96-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.494,896.571,"Well, of course, we don't ordinarily say that if there's... when we're trying to interpret a provision of the Constitution that the public ought to have some input on it."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,907.43,941.964,"But indirectly, Mr. Chief Justice, we do that through our State legislatures, and that is precisely what this Court has looked to to see whether or not States would adopt and should adopt appropriate laws to govern these types of situations, and that's what the Court referred to in Collins, directing to leave this to the area of the local representatives, rather than an interpretation of the charter of the Government for this entire country."
1997.96-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,946.015,959.505,"But I think Collins first evaluated whether or not there was a substantive due process violation and said no, and said, therefore this is left to the political process."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,967.52,974.075,I understood that was the analysis in the Collins case.
1997.96-1337,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,990.717,1010.419,"Well, we do it if we first conclude that it is not arbitrary, that whatever the State action was that caused the injury was not arbitrary in the sense of just being beyond the realm of reason as something the State might choose to do, or a governmental actor might choose to do."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1041.55,1050.845,"Well, I believe that the initiation and continuing of high speed pursuits are not arbitrary, at least in most circumstances."
1997.96-1337,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1050.845,1059.98,"They may be unwise, but they are not, as it were, so totally beyond the realm of reason as to rise to the level of a substantive due process violation."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1059.98,1060.921,I believe that's correct.
1997.96-1337,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1070.719,1087.509,"Now, how do you distinguish those... and I... I know I'm mixing apples and oranges here, but how do you distinguish those, your position there from the analysis that occurs in an unreasonable force situation under the Fourth Amendment?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1115.228,1131.859,"Well, because I believe that, in terms of the Bill of Rights and specifically the Fourth Amendment, that those are directed toward guaranteeing certain minimal levels of safety, whereas the Fourteenth Amendment is essentially the residual provision."
1997.96-1337,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1140.113,1158.987,"But would it be fair to say that the force cases are all cases in which there can be, or could have been, or was an apprehension in the first place, and it's clear that by no stretch of the imagination was the force necessary to accomplish the object?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1160.717,1162.309,"--Well, that would be true, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1337,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1162.309,1170.464,And in this case it isn't correct to say that by no stretch of the imagination the speed was unnecessary to catch the person.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1171.944,1184.723,"--Well, that is true, and that we are still in the realm potentially of the show of authority, as opposed to the actual means put in motion to cause the apprehension."
1997.96-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1184.723,1190.786,"Well, Mr. Cassidy, doesn't the Fourth Amendment itself speak in terms of unreasonableness?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1190.786,1192.349,"Correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.349,1198.491,So that that would supply the standard for the Fourth Amendment but perhaps would not supply the standard for some other analysis.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1198.491,1199.953,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.953,1211.501,"Do you know of any case under substantive due process in which the deprivation in question was negligent, or even grossly negligent?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1211.501,1212.433,No.
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1212.433,1216.143,Or even shocking the conscience but not intentional?
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1216.143,1218.937,"Under the Fourth Amendment, or Fourteenth?"
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.937,1220.898,Under the substantive Due Process Clause.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1225.469,1230.454,"I'm sorry, I... is there any case law--"
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.454,1242.352,Your argument concedes that if it shocks the conscience it doesn't matter if the officer did not intend to deprive this individual of his life.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1242.352,1244.012,--Correct.
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.012,1255.87,"Do you know of any other substantive due process cases where there has been a negligent, even grossly negligent deprivation of life that was held to violate substantive due process?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1255.87,1261.133,"I don't know that we concede that it should be something less than intentional, so--"
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.133,1265.486,"You don't make the argument anywhere, and I... you know, I was--"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1265.486,1266.586,--I believe--
1997.96-1337,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.586,1268.158,--surprised not to see it made.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1268.158,1284.688,--I believe we did state that it would be necessary in the context of adopting the shocks-the-conscience standard that that be aligned with the need for intentional and deliberate conduct in order to support a violation for substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.
1997.96-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1284.688,1291.894,"Well, is what you're saying that conduct which is not intentional very likely would not shock the conscience?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1298.997,1299.869,That's correct.
1997.96-1337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.977,1335.001,"Why couldn't there... so I'm thinking about it possibly a little differently, some things that you say."
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1348.39,1348.901,Correct.
1997.96-1337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1348.901,1353.043,And there's a second category where they behave in ways that shock the conscience.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1388.356,1389.548,Well--
1997.96-1337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1389.548,1392.279,What should the standard be there?
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1434.096,1438.509,--I believe that third area should be handled by the States under the States--
1997.96-1337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1438.509,1439.55,So even if a person--
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1439.55,1440.391,--process and should not be--
1997.96-1337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1440.391,1454.82,"--Even if a health officer, for example, intentionally murdered somebody under color of law, it didn't shock the conscience but it was awful, it doesn't violate the Constitution even if the State provides no remedy?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1454.82,1460.134,--I have difficulty finding that that perhaps would not shock the conscience.
1997.96-1337,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.373,1463.226,You're going to expand the shock-the-conscience category.
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1465.217,1471.911,"--That may also be a claim under the Fourth Amendment, because that person effected a seizure of that party."
1997.96-1337,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1529.319,1531.6,"How about an individual instance, like Checki itself?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1540.306,1542.578,--I believe Checki is an illustration.
1997.96-1337,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.889,1562.71,"May I ask just one quick question, please, before you sit down?"
1997.96-1337,0,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,1574.179,1584.445,"Because I believe that this Court has previously addressed that question regarding the show of authority in the Hodari case, and there is no seizure, and that was confirmed by this Court's opinion in Brower."
1997.96-1337,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.756,1588.358,"Very well, Mr. Cassidy."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1590.118,1596.522,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.921,1627.605,"Well, it sort of begs the question to call this lethal force."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1637.76,1642.471,"--The... well, I think in this case--"
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.471,1646.866,It was at most an irresponsibly speedy chase.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1646.866,1647.557,--Well--
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1647.557,1651.718,"Was there any indication that there was an intent to kill anybody, to apply lethal force?"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1651.718,1679.196,"--Well, actually, when you look at the end of the accident itself, the police officer during his deposition will not even concede that he hit the individual, that... you'll see on page, I think it's 106 of the appendix, that here is an individual who is ejected, or stands up in the center of a two-lane highway."
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.809,1702.622,"If that's the case you shouldn't worry about the shocks-the-conscience standard, then."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1709.687,1710.496,"Well, I think--"
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.496,1711.618,That certainly shocks my conscience.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1711.618,1712.659,--It certainly shocks mine.
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.255,1740.807,"Was that true after our opinion in Conner v. Graham, as well as before?"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1761.52,1772.066,"Oh, yes, and... I mean, there are legions of cases, and some of them use shocks the conscience, and some of them use reckless disregard."
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.077,1775.008,"Those are two quite different concepts, aren't they?"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1784.154,1789.998,"--Well, I think it connotes reckless intent, which is, you know--"
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.998,1793.329,"Well, reckless intent is a... kind of is an oxymoron."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1796.803,1805.589,"--Well, I think there is... that's exactly the point that's presented here, and I would like to make one more point when I say, about the Fourteenth Amendment."
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1826.153,1836.54,"Well, if you... if, as you say, you can persuade a jury that the police officer just did this intentionally, as Justice Scalia says, you will win under any standard."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1843.052,1846.194,"--No, I disagree."
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.048,1867.449,So what did the Ninth Circuit decide was the standard?
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1867.449,1868.781,--Reckless disregard.
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1869.58,1876.094,"Yes, but that still is not your case, where the police officer simply guns the motor--"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1876.094,1876.675,Well--
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1876.675,1878.946,"--sees this guy standing there, says, I'm going to kill him."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1878.946,1881.457,"--No, the person didn't gun the motor."
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.991,1885.431,Just coasted in and intentionally--
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1885.431,1890.443,"--No, no, you don't coast with 166 feet of four-wheel-lock skid."
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.71,1902.442,"--Well, he wished that, and he wasn't exactly an innocent bystander."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1912.419,1913.958,Right.
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.958,1923.415,So there was some reason to believe that the reason they were both fleeing was that they were... if found together were in violation of their parole for grand theft auto on some other occasion.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1923.415,1924.396,It was joy-riding--
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.396,1925.566,Joy-riding.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1925.566,1926.147,--for Philip Lewis.
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.147,1926.728,"Well, whatever."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1926.728,1942.619,"But from the position of the officer, that... there was... they didn't know these kids at all, and when they were perceived originally they were walking the motor cycle between the two police cars."
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.058,1962.462,"They didn't realize that the police, when they turned the lights on, were trying to stop them."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,1962.462,1979.722,"--There is no indication that Officer Smith, who did this incredibly reckless act, even knew that Philip Lewis or Brian Willard saw the lights."
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.464,2016.137,And how... which was necessary to catch up to the motor cycle.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2018.148,2029.657,"At that point... I asked him specifically, because, he said, they accelerated away quickly, and I said, what does that mean, you... oh, at a high rate of speed, he said."
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2101.192,2105.125,"Well, we're here to talk about what standard should be applied in determining these cases--"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2105.125,2105.576,"Well, that's--"
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.576,2108.067,--and whether or not the Ninth Circuit was correct.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2112.74,2142.809,"--Well, I actually like the opinion in Collins, because it seems to me to indicate that Collins is a situation in which the Court is willing, if the conduct, no matter what it is... no matter what it is... is so egregious that it shocks the conscience, that means to say that I--"
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2142.809,2143.58,"Well, that's not what the court of appeals held, was it?"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2155.109,2155.66,"--Well, Collins--"
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2155.66,2161.657,"In Collins we used, of course, reckless indifference, but that was just to get over the Monell liability problem, not the substantive problem."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2167.648,2168.9,--I am defending the Ninth Circuit analysis.
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2172.433,2182.597,"Did you think it was correct under Collins, despite the fact that they used the second prong test, municipal liability, to determine the first question, whether or not there was a substantive violation?"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2182.597,2189.263,"--Well, I think they just determined that the same test should apply for municipal liability as applies for the underlying violation."
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2189.263,2193.696,But that's quite... exactly contrary to what the Court held in Collins.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2193.696,2200.53,But Collins is a particular case that doesn't present the issues that this case presents at all.
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2204.524,2210.137,"But Collins is an interpretation of the substantive Due Process Clause, and it uses the shocks-the-conscience test."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2229.12,2263.301,"Well, I... what I was saying is that Collins to me, reading Collins indicated that when you're dealing with noncore fundamental issues such as life, and here it's a failure to train, and you're dealing with nonspecifically governmental entities, like a sanitation department, which could be anything, there is a desire not to expand at all the Fourteenth Amendment into areas--"
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.301,2269.005,"But there was no question in Collins whether or not a governmental official was involved, and I'm not sure--"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2269.005,2269.336,"--No, but--"
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2269.336,2284.195,--I know of any authority for the proposition that depending on whether or not you're a police officer or some other municipal employee the standard of... under the Due Process Clause differs.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2285.655,2287.457,"--Oh, I think it does, and it should."
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2287.457,2288.258,--What is the... what case do you have for that?
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2288.258,2304.708,"I don't... to me the Collins case specifically is... says that this is not the kind of governmental function that the Fourteenth Amendment was normally designed by the Framers to protect against, but in our--"
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.708,2307.12,Because the standard of shock-the-conscience was not met.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2308.502,2310.282,--I--
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2310.282,2318.156,We don't have different standards of liability under the Fourteenth Amendment depending on a whole range of different governmental officers.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2321.969,2325.812,--So is it the... I--
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2325.812,2335.798,"It seems to me that you're going to either defend the Ninth Circuit analysis or you're not, and if you're going to defend the Ninth Circuit analysis, then you have to ask us to alter the analysis that we used in Collins."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2335.798,2341.052,--I don't believe that the analysis in Collins applies.
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2364.799,2372.423,"Well, do you think that high speed auto chases are the sort of thing that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to address?"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2372.423,2373.305,--Absolutely.
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.123,2375.205,In 1868?
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2375.205,2380.427,"--Well, high speed automobile chases--"
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2380.427,2381.839,"Carriage chases, perhaps."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2381.839,2382.2,--Well--
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2408.957,2415.89,"Can I ask you, follow... you may not agree with what... my analysis, but assume it for a second."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2421.195,2421.964,Right.
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.964,2423.376,--so we're not talking about the Fourth Amendment.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2430.091,2430.971,Yes.
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2430.971,2433.852,I'd say there is a category of shock-the-conscience behavior.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2441.118,2441.939,Right.
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2441.939,2445.941,"--where a Government official, deprives a person of his life and the Constitution says you can't."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2470.196,2471.438,"Well, I--"
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.438,2483.374,"That is to say, can you recover from the municipality here under State law so that your client, if there was negligent or reckless or wrongful behavior, would be compensated?"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2485.447,2490.369,--I don't think it's as easy as yes or no.

1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2566.159,2566.569,Yes.
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2566.569,2568.312,--against the police officer--
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2568.312,2569.06,Yes.
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2569.06,2569.721,--and the county?
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2569.721,2571.464,I have unresolved all claims.
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2573.664,2577.038,"Well, there was a summary judgment at issue here."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2577.038,2577.388,--Right.
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2577.388,2578.357,That's what we're dealing with.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2578.357,2578.707,Right.
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2578.707,2585.051,"But with regard to the section 1983 claims only, isn't that right?"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2585.051,2585.512,No.
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2598.231,2598.82,Well--
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2598.82,2599.641,--One left.
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2599.641,2612.129,"--in any event, as I understand the situation, you have remaining for disposition in the lower courts claims of negligence or gross negligence against the officer and the--"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2612.129,2614.161,Not the officer any more.
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2619.165,2619.584,--To the county.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2619.584,2620.005,--Yes.
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.296,2632.252,Is it something like the Federal Tort Claims Act where the governmental body is substituted for the individual who may have been negligent?
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2632.252,2640.43,"Well, is it respondeat superior that exempts the officer, yes."
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2645.812,2647.423,"Judgment-proof, or--"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2647.423,2659.731,"--Well, the... no, not because of judgment-proof, but because of agreements that are reached between the entities and their employees."
1997.96-1337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2669.057,2682.705,"--May I ask you, if this case were analyzed under the Fourth Amendment rather than substantive due process, what do you think a proper disposition would be?"

1997.96-1337,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.375,2701.829,How would you get over the possible hurdle that there was actually no seizure here?
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2701.829,2703.121,"Well, that's the problem."
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.629,2740.925,Do you have any idea how many dangerous felons have been captured in high speed chases who would have killed more than 383 people?
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2740.925,2742.646,"--Well, there's no statistics."
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2743.297,2748.468,"I mean, it's all a cost-benefits analysis, isn't it, and I guess if the... you know... you can't really--"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2748.468,2756.713,"--I... you know, I think, though... I think that the notion of the Fourteenth Amendment is that there are certain arbitrary procedures."

1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2784.533,2785.054,--I think--
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2785.054,2786.212,--so we can instruct the Ninth Circuit--
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2786.212,2786.793,--I think--
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2786.793,2787.324,--whether it was correct or not.

1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2828.131,2828.551,--No.
1997.96-1337,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2830.171,2831.323,"--Well, there's always a known risk."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2831.323,2832.264,--That's true.

1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,2843.532,2844.433,Is it justified?

1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3005.697,3007.149,I believe it will.
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3007.149,3008.059,--You believe it will.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3010.85,3013.432,I've always believed it would.
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3026.541,3030.912,"The chases, if you're going into the statistics, they're very much contested in these briefs, and I'm not certain--"
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3030.912,3031.223,--Okay.
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.223,3031.633,--I mean--
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3031.633,3032.024,Okay.
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3032.024,3036.836,--One of the briefs of the municipalities says 300 a year out of the 2.2 million people--
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3036.836,3037.337,It's now 400.
1997.96-1337,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3037.337,3037.877,--All right.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3057.552,3075.794,"Well, I believe that it's related from the standpoint, is this a problem that rises to constitutional dimensions, and I think the Court should consider not only... if this were an isolated event, it wouldn't come to the Court's attention."
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3091.323,3096.877,Maybe they're fighting it because they think the Ninth Circuit was wrong and didn't follow our cases.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3096.877,3101.631,"--To be sure, but--"
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3101.631,3102.262,It's happened before.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3103.08,3111.996,--I hope that doesn't color the Court's... or give a jaundiced eye towards the Ninth Circuit.
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3135.173,3137.124,But we don't announce policy Mr.--
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3137.124,3137.555,--No.
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3137.555,3138.224,--You know--
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3138.224,3143.258,"All you have to do is say, we're not talking about an expansion of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1997.96-1337,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3189.286,3195.601,--And yet one of the leading cases that you rely on didn't show color of law.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3208.891,3219.348,"--Well now, again, that brought it out of, you know, normal perhaps Fourth Amendment type situations, but--"
1997.96-1337,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3219.348,3221.358,You think a car with lights on is worse?
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3222.901,3227.691,"--Well, I think it removes any question of whether it's under color of law."
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.691,3235.596,It also removes any question of whether the person fleeing didn't know he was fleeing from an officer trying to make an arrest.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3235.596,3236.067,Yes.
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3242.332,3248.827,It still bears upon the guilt of the police officer whether the police officer reasonably continued the chase.
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3248.827,3253.559,--When he... when he saw--
1997.96-1337,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3253.559,3263.776,"It may not make your client any more guilty, but it certainly makes the police officer more reasonable in continuing the pursuit, knowing that the person sees the police lights, hears the siren, and is fleeing."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3263.776,3281.418,"--Well, the problem that we have in all of these, and one of the things that we see constantly in the petitioner's briefs and the amicus briefs on his behalf is that there is a justification because you might catch other people."
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3340.727,3354.254,"Oh, but presumably most citizens know that if they violate the traffic laws and a police car attempts to stop them they should stop and yield to the authority."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3356.685,3357.877,That's exactly true.
1997.96-1337,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3379.453,3388.488,"Well, there was at least testimony here by the young man who survived that the decedent kept urging him to flee."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3388.488,3404.717,"There was a statement, not kept, but that the decedent said at one point, let's get out of here, in the beginning, contested."
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3404.717,3405.228,"Thank you, Mr. Hedlund."
1997.96-1337,1,37982,paul_j_hedlund,,3405.228,3406.099,Thank you.
1997.96-1337,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3406.099,3410.011,"Mr. Cassidy, you have 4 minutes remaining."
1997.96-1337,2,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,3410.011,3410.722,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1997.96-1337,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3430.975,3433.486,"Mr. Cassidy, I did want to call to your attention one thing."
1997.96-1337,2,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,3455.962,3469.359,"--Only to the extent the issues presented on the petitions for the writ before this Court were exactly the same question presented in the reverse, and this Court declined hearing--"
1997.96-1337,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3469.359,3473.994,Is a denial of certiorari an implicit approval of anything?
1997.96-1337,2,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,3473.994,3483.929,"--No, certainly not authority, Your Honor, but some indication that this Court has approved of that analysis as opposed to this Court's... the Ninth Circuit's analysis in this case."
1997.96-1337,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3483.929,3484.67,"Gee, I hope not."
1997.96-1337,2,42520,terence_j_cassidy,,3491.015,3492.525,"Accepted, Your Honor."
1997.96-1337,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3626.763,3627.814,"Thank you, Mr. Cassidy."
