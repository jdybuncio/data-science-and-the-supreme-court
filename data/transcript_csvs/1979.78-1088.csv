1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.157,"We will commence -- we will resume at 1 o’clock with Kissinger against the Reporters Committee and consolidated case, and counsel may take their place at the table before we return."
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,38.982,42.774,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,142.171,145.85,You are speaking of the White House period?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,145.85,164.048,"Both of the White House period, Mr. Chief Justice and of the State Department, both periods, always retained in personal files within his office, never part of either the White House files or the State Department files."
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,184.035,188.336,"Mr. Ginsburg, how do you know there were omissions or how does anyone know they were omissions?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,188.336,198.842,Simply by the affidavits that are in file in this record by those that have examined the notes and we have the affidavits in the record in this case.
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,198.842,202.725,"You mean there are some things that were said on the phone, but are not on the notes, is that what you are saying?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,202.725,207.776,There were some things that are said in the notes that are said to be not accurate.
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,207.776,209.955,"Well, I know but how about omissions, you said there were omissions?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,209.955,211.696,And omissions --
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,211.696,214.946,"So, there were some telephone conversations that were not noted?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,214.946,222.964,There were some telephone conversations that were not taken although almost all as the affidavits in this record show were taken.
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,222.964,228.448,"Well, were these omissions deliberate or inadvertent simply because of the difficulties involved?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,228.448,230.284,"Both, Your Honor."
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.92,338.296,All of them of course were subordinates of Dr. Kissinger while he was Secretary of State?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,338.296,340.214,"All of them were subordinates, Your Honor."
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.565,346.399,"But nevertheless, really has anything to do with your primary argument, does it?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,346.399,349.218,"It does not, sir."
1979.78-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,380.042,385.33,"Mr. Ginsburg, is a legal adviser an appointee of the Secretary of State or of the President?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,385.33,393.706,"He is appointed by the President, sir and confirmed by the Senate and is a respected member of the bar of this Court."
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,546.893,549.89,Was the librarian -- was the librarian a party to the action?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,549.89,564.482,"The librarian was named as a party to the action, although of course, he is not an agency under the Freedom of Information Act and of course, neither is Dr. Kissinger as an individual, but the Court of Appeals affirmed."
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,597.163,620.919,"Whatever the determination of the State Department may have been, wouldn’t your argument really be the same as if you just eliminated that middle language and said does the FOIA cover and impose a duty upon the State Department to not to withhold and to deliver records that it does not have?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,620.919,632.145,"I make a point simply to avoid the problem in order to clarify the issue Mr. Justice Stewart that there was proper relinquishment, whatever it was."
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,632.145,633.862,But whether or not it was proper --
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,633.862,633.945,Yes.
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,633.945,634.711,-- wouldn’t your argument be the same?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,634.711,639.174,The argument would be the same and I think that is clear that the Act does not apply in these circumstances.
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,639.174,642.55,That was your arguments --
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,642.55,646.168,But our primary submission and this is a submission with which the Government agrees --
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,646.168,659.154,"Mr. Ginsburg, when this agency makes a determination before any demand is pending or when a demand is made that particular material is not an agency record."
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,665.625,676.359,"There is -- It’s the issue, Mr. Chief Justice of -- of course, not all documents in the hands of agency are records."
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.668,723.214,These are then not agency records even if they were still at the State Department?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,723.214,723.363,Oh!
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.082,755.275,"Conversely, even if they were once “agency records,” there is no obligation to turn -- well the State Department to turn over something that may be once might have been an agency record, if it does not at the time of the request have possession and/or control of it, is that --"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,755.275,755.558,That is correct.
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.558,757.213,Is that also your argument?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,757.213,758.902,"I wouldn't say that is all of our argument, that's the central portion --"
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,758.902,760.397,That’s central portion of your argument?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,760.397,762.063,"Yes, that is, sir."
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,762.564,764.888,"That is of course your entire argument, but that’s also your argument?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,764.888,765.993,"That is also our argument, yes, sir."
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.993,780.495,"But you would say as my brother Stewart has asked you that even if the records were in the possession of the State Department at this time or if these papers were in the possession of the State Department, they would not be subject to the Act because they were not records?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,780.495,781.857,That’s exactly right.
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,788.112,792.277,"You don't make the possession argument in your brief, do you?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,792.277,793.217,Possession?
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.217,797.664,"I mean, you say they aren't records subject to --"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,797.664,797.903,We are making the point that --
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,797.903,806.71,"-- subject to production and hence it is irrelevant to you whether they are in possession of the State Department or not, at least it is irrelevant for that argument?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,806.71,818.971,"Well, the possession argument comes into this argument simply because these notes are presently in the hands of the Library of Congress and to secure them is not simply a ministerial act of obtaining them from the bailee."
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,826.001,827.99,Is not a lawsuit under the FOIA?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,827.99,829.021,"No, sir."
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,829.021,830.06,"I mean, that’s your submission?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,830.06,832.876,"That’s absolutely, yes."
1979.78-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.797,898.407,"Mr. Ginsburg, let me go back just a minute to the point you just made."
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,934.957,938.131,"I think not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,984.615,991.702,"Whatever they were, could -- was Dr. Kissinger's gift to the Library of Congress irrevocable?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,991.702,993.837,"It was irrevocable, under a deed of trust."
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,993.837,999.228,But he could not individually carry out a command to get them back?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,999.228,1000.673,Certainly not.
1979.78-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1008.735,1016.011,"Well, what if Dr. Kissinger had given the entire records of the State Department to the Library of Congress?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1016.011,1019.271,It would have been a problem –
1979.78-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1019.271,1023.318,Would that have been irrevocable?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1023.318,1023.811,"No, sir."
1979.78-1088,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.482,1062.093,"Well, if they are not records, you never get any further, do you?"
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.093,1062.54,That’s right.
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1062.54,1062.738,Oh!
1979.78-1088,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1088.148,1096.376,"On that point, Mr. Ginsburg, I take it that the case would be the same if instead of saying the Library of Congress they were in Dr. Kissinger's basement?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1096.376,1098.509,If they were in Dr. Kissinger's basement as personal property --
1979.78-1088,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.509,1100.321,It would be the same case?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1100.321,1105.307,-- which of course he could have done at any time --
1979.78-1088,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.307,1110.988,And really so the fact that they are in the Library of Congress rather than in his possession is legally irrelevant?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1110.988,1113.546,I don't think it’s legally irrelevant except in the sense that -
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1113.546,1115.596,"In that argument, it is argumentative?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1115.596,1115.746,To this --
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1115.746,1116.88,"They are not records, wherever they are."
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1116.88,1118.513,That's right.
1979.78-1088,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.513,1123.31,But to what argument would it make a difference whether they are in the Library of Congress instead of in his possession?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1123.31,1128.856,There is no way in which Dr. Kissinger can just reach over to these notes and bring them back into --
1979.78-1088,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.856,1132.548,"Yes, but he is not the agency, as you make a very good point."
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1136.029,1139.204,And nor has the State Department any control over the Library of Congress.
1979.78-1088,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.204,1144.276,"Right, so if they are with him instead of the Library of Congress, it would be precisely the same legal question?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1144.276,1146.717,"It would for this purpose, yes."
1979.78-1088,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1146.717,1158.277,"I take it, Mr. David Ginsburg, that your case for all purposes rests on the proposition that these, I will call them materials rather than records, are Dr. Kissinger's personal property?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1158.277,1161.547,They are indeed and they were so determined by the department.
1979.78-1088,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1161.547,1175.842,"And that being the case, I take it the record does not show any income tax effect upon his turning them over to the Library of Congress?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1175.842,1177.505,The record doesn't show that.
1979.78-1088,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1182.629,1183.307,Yes.
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1183.307,1190.662,"No, sir, the record doesn't show that, but I can assure the Court that there is none."
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1190.662,1192.24,Was any available?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1192.24,1192.701,I beg your pardon?
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.701,1194.945,Was any available at the time he made the gift?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1194.945,1196.227,Not to my knowledge.
1979.78-1088,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1196.227,1202.49,It may well not have been available under the current version of the code?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1202.49,1206.906,That issue was not here and I don't believe it is part of this case.
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1206.906,1223.783,"What -- Mr. Ginsburg, I take it that your argument does go so far as to say that at no time was any of these -- was any one of these papers a record for the purposes of the FOIA."
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1227.86,1230.678,"Exactly right, that is our argument."
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1230.678,1236.815,And before any extracts were made for the purposes of the files?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1236.815,1240.432,"Yes, they were not created for the purpose of records."
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1253.611,1257.964,"The fact is that is why he created them, so that he wouldn't have to tell anybody?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1257.964,1258.739,Exactly right.
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.739,1281.393,"Well then -- It seems to me that’s an argument for saying that these papers at least until they have been extracted, to extract the -- to take out the materials relevant to the State Department business, that were critical to the State Department business, would be records."
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1281.393,1296.464,"No, records do not become records until they are so determined by the -- there is no question in this case, there cannot be a serious question in this case as to the fact did Dr. Kissinger create an adequate record of all of the --"
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.464,1311.801,"Well, Mr. Ginsburg, you emphasized the fact that Dr. Kissinger went through the procedure that the legal adviser suggested, namely why don't you go through these notes of yours and make sure everything is taken out of them that should have been taken out?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1311.801,1312.908,But the State --
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.908,1315.386,And he proceeded to do that.
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1320.58,1339.371,"I think fundamentally that was the position also of the legal adviser, that the records were made as a consequence of the calls that were made immediately after or the file memoranda that were made immediately after the calls were made, and they were put into the records of the department."
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.371,1344.885,"So, your position really is fundamentally different from that of the United States?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1344.885,1346.519,We differ only --
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.519,1348.042,"Well, there’s quite a difference."
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1357.261,1361.869,The position of the United States as I understand it -- Mr. Alsup will be here in a moment --
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.869,1362.307,Yes.
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1362.307,1374.454,-- is that it depends on the United States' interpretation of the legal adviser's memorandum.
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.58,1451.843,"But if the Secretary of State is talking on the telephone and making agreements or making plans or making proposals that his colleagues ought to know about, he should communicate them and he has one of two ways of doing it, I suppose."
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1471.447,1472.698,He has done his job --
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1472.698,1478.135,"Well, I know, but he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't do either, if he didn't communicate, if he chose --"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1478.135,1479.591,If he did [Voice Overlap] he would be in violation of the State Department regulations.
1979.78-1088,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.591,1481.548,Yes.
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1506.623,1525.25,"There is a moment of time at which those -- the moment between the time when the records -- when these notes were made and before they were turned over to anyone, it is conceivable that there was some issue, but that issue is not in this case."
1979.78-1088,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1546.047,1559.821,"Even if one assumes that these are agency records, don't you also argue that these petitioners or the plaintiffs below have no private cause of action under the FOIA?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1559.821,1560.876,"I do indeed, sir."
1979.78-1088,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1560.876,1562.024,Are you going to address that?
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1566.733,1567.806,I am running out of time.
1979.78-1088,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1567.806,1570.279,It is a very substantial additional argument.
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1570.279,1570.81,It is.
1979.78-1088,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.81,1571.843,That is your first argument.
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1573.424,1574.722,It is indeed.
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1683.133,1687.275,"And if there is no such action, that is the end of the case, isn't it?"
1979.78-1088,0,20879,david_ginsburg,,1687.275,1693.04,"That is the case in our view, and I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."
1979.78-1088,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1693.04,1714.191,"Very well, Mr. Ginsburg."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1717.047,1720.041,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.761,1758.911,"Is this because, Mr. Alsup, that material that is not in the possession and control of an agency cannot by definition be an agency record?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1761.766,1762.783,Correct.
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1762.783,1763.782,And that is --
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1763.782,1768.351,It’s a combination in response to a comment that Justice Stevens made.
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1780.326,1788.107,"In the previous case, you didn't bend that to my brother Stevens' suggestion."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1795.808,1796.019,Well --
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1796.019,1797.227,Do you take a different position in this case?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1797.227,1798.797,No.
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1834.074,1840.82,"Well, in the last case, you did see a very real need to it or you wouldn't have used that against the United States Government would hardly make that argument unless it felt they needed to?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1840.82,1847.422,"Well, we do make the further distinction concerning whether or not a document is a record under the Federal Records Act."
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1847.422,1848.562,Whether it used to be a record.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1861.028,1867.316,"Well, with the modification or not even modification with commerce that I have made up, we accept that statement."
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1867.316,1881.726,"He had an alternative, your colleague had an alternative that they could not be commanded by anyone to give up the possession or something that didn’t possess even assuming it was a record?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1881.726,1882.23,That’s correct.
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1882.23,1883.526,That was his alternative argument?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1883.526,1886.906,I believe that is correct.
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.893,1971.232,May I just ask one question because I did think there was a difference in your theory in this case and the other.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,1983.293,1983.765,No.
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.5,1991.251,"Well, let’s take in to two steps."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2006.817,2013.857,"That is a difficult question and I know we have stumbled over perhaps, but let me answer it this way."
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.938,2018.656,I understand -- that’s what I understood your argument to be so that’s why I am --
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2018.656,2021.425,I think that is clear to everyone that agrees we are making that argument.
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.425,2022.46,Right.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2022.46,2037.326,"We also think that the word “withholding” and “made available” lend meaning to what Congress meant by agency record which appears in that same sentence, and therefore, it’s conceivable that the Court might also hold at least the same documents [Voice Overlap] are agency records."
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.326,2039.443,I know that it is conceivable we might hold.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2062.851,2072.757,"Alright, if they are records within the meaning of the Federal Records Act, they remain Federal records within the meaning of the Federal Records Act even though they are at the Library of Congress."
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.106,2074.641,That doesn’t answer my question.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2074.641,2075.33,"I know, I know."
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.264,2081.386,Yes.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2081.386,2093.963,"I have to say that I think that our argument is that they are not records within the meaning of the FOIA, even though I do not think the Court needs to reach that issue because of the clear availability of the word “withhold.”"
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.963,2097.158,[Voice Overlap] Then why do you make all this long argument about the Federal Records Act?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2097.158,2097.577,"Well, because --"
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.577,2100.435,Your whole argument is completely unnecessary to your position?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2100.435,2101.76,I disagree with that.
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.03,2121.755,"If we accept the argument of the United States Government made in a previous case, it is a matter of definition under the FOIA, nothing can be an agency record, it’s not in the possession and control of the agency then that is the end of this case, isn’t it?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2121.755,2122.104,That is correct.
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.104,2126.937,And that’s the very argument that the Government made on the last case and you are shying away from it in this case.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2126.937,2128.124,"No, no, absolutely not."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.124,2129.98,Then why didn't you just answer that --
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2129.98,2131.633,"Well, I think --"
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.633,2144.06,"That – it’s easy, it would be easy, whether they were they ever were records or whether they are still records then for purposes of the Records Act, they are not for purposes of the FOIA because they are not in the possession and control --"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2144.06,2176.161,"Well, if I may, we clearly argue and I think I haven't said this very well, but we are clearly taking the position that whether or not it is a record under the Federal Records Act or under Justice Stevens' possibility that agency records mean something special in the FOIA, if the agency does not have possession and control --- wait, let me finish this, if the agency doesn't have possession and control, there is no violation of the FOIA."
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2184.29,2186.373,"Mr. Alsup, you have two right separate reasoning."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2192.59,2202.115,"Well, I don't think I am able to give much clearer answer than what I have."
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.5,2206.86,Right.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2206.86,2208.121,And you agree with that.
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.069,2235.24,"But you are saying that issue does not depend on whether or not they are records within the meaning of the Federal Records Act, and yet you have argued at great length the meaning of the Federal Records Act, as though, and I had the impression from your brief that that would be dispositive in this case on the issue of whether or not they were records within the meaning of the FOIA, but apparently I was wrong?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2235.24,2238.936,"Well, no."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.884,2297.631,"Well, your colleague in the previous case argued that it wasn't an agency record --"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2297.631,2298.228,That's right.
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.228,2308.213,"-- now because it wasn't in possession and control and he says, let's forget this no withholding business or at least just use the withholding to shed light on what is in an agency record?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2308.213,2308.743,Well --
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.743,2319.779,"That is what Mr. Geller said, but his bottom line was that this is not an agency record for FOIA purposes, that was his bottom line."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2319.779,2319.904,Well --
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.904,2325.658,"Yours is, you say now we don't even have to think about whether it is an agency record, if you are not withholding it?"
1979.78-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.658,2334.262,"Well, there is nothing inconsistent between those two positions, between saying (a) I choose to answer it, and (b) you don't have to answer it?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2334.262,2336.255,"Well, that's correct."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.462,2367.501,"He certainly suggested to us that if we agreed with him, we should approach the case and the words you use would be talking about what is an agency record and your conclusion would be if you agreed with him, this is not an agency record."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2368.991,2374.046,"Well, I don't disagree with that submission."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.046,2377.228,Good.[Laughter]
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2377.228,2398.82,"Well, with the Court's permission, I would like to address the question of whether or not these were or were not records under the Federal Records Act because that was the question which was of great concern in the courts below and they concluded that they were records under the Federal Records Act."
1979.78-1088,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.318,2418.993,"That is 44 U.S.C. 3301, on page 5 of your brief?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2418.993,2419.612,That's correct.
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2431.728,2441.137,"Mr. Alsup, we interrupted you a great deal and I hesitate to do it again, but just to aid my understanding of your argument, we do not reach this issue if we accept your first argument, is that correct?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2441.137,2442.963,That's correct.
1979.78-1088,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2449.427,2449.656,Right.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2449.656,2452.034,That would be the end of the case.
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.081,2639.936,"What would make them property, the fact that government employees and government materials went into their construction?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2639.936,2640.777,Not principally.
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2669.882,2691.348,"Well, it is said that Mr. Truman, when he was President, dictated every night a diary of the day's events and assuming that was done and it was also said that he frequently referred back to these things with respect to conversations he had had with Cabinet officers or various other people."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2702.641,2711.471,Not necessarily and in some cases a nice question would be presented whether or not something like that was made within the scope of employment.
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2728.65,2732.618,My question assumed that there could be a mix in these.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2760.93,2761.725,Not necessarily.
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2767.562,2768.359,This is not a letter.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2769.585,2771.637,"Well, I am sorry."
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.197,2781.075,"Well his conversation with the Attorney General or Secretary of his Cabinet would surely be within the scope of his employment, wouldn’t it?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2781.075,2795.389,"The conversation itself would be, but whether or not in the late hours in the evening if the President dictates the tape about that day’s events that’s not necessarily within the scope when the President’s role as President."
1979.78-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2811.564,2816.958,You do not accept the -- an opinion of the legal adviser?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2816.958,2821.568,With respect to the question of whether or not these were personal property when created.
1979.78-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2855.678,2861.67,I understood you are going to say you felt the agency should make this decision rather than the courts.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2861.67,2862.42,That’s correct.
1979.78-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2862.42,2869.819,And the agency in this case said it through its legal adviser seems already to admit it.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2877.869,2880.797,"Well, let’s take an extreme -- more extreme case."
1979.78-1088,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2881.048,2882.145,Let’s take this case?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2882.145,2890.578,"Well, I think I can answer that by saying what if Dr. Kissinger had given all of the records of the State Department to the Library of Congress."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.635,2921.999,Well what about this case?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2926.913,2936.71,"So far as this record discloses, the State Department has not made a final determination whether to bring a retrieval action for the recovery of the notes and that is correct."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.71,2939.632,"Well, has it asked for them back?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2939.632,2945.838,It has not asked for them back.
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.13,2953.486,"Well, I’ll put it this way; do you think that you are representing the views of the State Department Head?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2953.486,2955.489,Yes.
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2955.489,2966.474,Which means that the statement -- the State Department through you is asking these notes be reviewed in the hands of the Library of Congress to see if they have been fully extracted?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2966.474,2967.532,No.
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2993.676,2995.897,Seek to return or just get them extracted?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,2995.897,2999.279,"Well, it might have either alternative."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.279,3000.869,What’s your position on that part?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3000.869,3013.126,The State Department specifically would like to reserve both possibilities and we don’t take the position as to whether -- in this case as to whether or not these are or are not records.
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3013.126,3037.742,"Well, I think it’s rather important you take the position because for purposes of Freedom of Information Act, if all this State Department interested in, is making sure they’ve properly extracted and the official business is taken out of them, they have copies of it, that doesn’t mean at all that the papers need to be returned, does it?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3037.742,3039.133,"That’s, that is correct."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.133,3047.72,"Because I take it your position is that once they get back to the State Department, they are FOIA papers."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3047.72,3049.355,Once they were back --
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.355,3050.61,Yes or no?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3050.61,3051.115,That’s correct.
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.633,3057.211,I think it makes quite a difference on what position you take for purposes of this lawsuit?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3057.211,3060.528,"I -- Mr. Justice, the problem is this."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3074.343,3088.276,"Well, I know but there’s always -- if they want to sample them, and they do sample and which they are now doing and they decide that they should be reviewed and further extracts made."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3093.718,3097.168,"Not necessarily, that might be done at the Library of Congress."
1979.78-1088,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3097.168,3103.491,"In which event, they never would be your FOIA papers except to the extent they were extracted?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3103.491,3105.484,That is correct.
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3105.484,3110.201,"Now, you referred to these negotiations that are going on, discussions whether or if anyone uses it."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3110.201,3139.189,"Well, at the time of the District Court’s order an agreement was filed with the Court which advised the Court that federal parties were making an inspection of the a limited sample of the notes at the Library of Congress and that they, therefore, would make a decision at some point in the future when that review was completed as to whether or not the State Department felt that any of these were records and would therefore seek the return."
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3139.189,3142.88,Is it possible that we dispose of the issues in this case?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3142.88,3144.384,It would not dispose.
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.339,3162.759,"Mr. Alsup, I just want to make one thing -- call one thing to your attention."
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3183.172,3186.988,All records within the meaning of 3301 which are in the possession and custody of --
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.988,3187.695,No.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3206.334,3208.324,"Now, I don’t think that’s a fair construction."
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3217.128,3217.896,Withholding?
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3217.896,3223.971,"Of withholding and of whether -- well, perhaps we didn’t make it as clear as the oral argument now should --"
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.971,3227.749,"May you now suggest, we should not accept this as a literal statement of your position?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3227.749,3237.584,"Well, it’s the second of our argument, that we meant to say about that, that of course, that applies only to those records which are in the possession and control of the --"
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3237.584,3243.589,So your first argument was you don’t have to decide what agency records are because in all events there has been no withholding.
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3254.004,3256.827,"Well, rather than --"
1979.78-1088,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.827,3260.596,"You really want to withdraw this concession, in other words?"
1979.78-1088,1,43803,william_alsup,,3260.596,3275.469,"We will stand by whatever we said in our brief, so I don’t want anything I have interpreted to be a concession from the statements that we have made and either our Forsham brief or the Kissinger brief."
1979.78-1088,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3280.645,3283.179,Mr. Dobrovir.
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3283.179,3287.006,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1088,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3316.54,3320.173,"Well, perhaps the first question is whether there is private cause of action available here."
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3321.89,3327.872,"I will address it now in response to your question, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1088,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3373.445,3389.406,"Well, surely at that time the Attorney General of United States or acting independently or the Administrator of GSA, operating independently perhaps could have commenced the lawsuit, you agree on that?"
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3389.406,3390.064,He could have.
1979.78-1088,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3416.24,3417.097,He is the --
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3417.097,3417.895,The controversy --
1979.78-1088,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3417.895,3421.52,"The Archivist is the subordinate of the Administrator of GSA, is he not?"
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3421.52,3422.644,"Yes, he is."
1979.78-1088,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3499.515,3502.633,And you said there was an additional basis?
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3502.633,3505.648,"With respect to the Archivist, that was the only basis."
1979.78-1088,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3612.017,3634.157,"Mr. Dobrovir, suppose I am Secretary of State and I have a file in my office in which I keep copies of correspondence to personal friends, which I have written saying, no, I can't come out and visit you this week, but maybe two weeks from now, and it is separate from State Department record transactions and other things."
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3636.551,3641.235,"No, sir, those are personal records, by your description of them."
1979.78-1088,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3724.496,3729.743,"There are a lot of Presidential Libraries that are in trouble, aren't there?"
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3729.743,3734.025,The Presidency has always been considered a different animal.
1979.78-1088,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3785.013,3793.078,"Mr. Dobrovir, you are down to a little more than one minute and we haven't heard very much about the private cause of action, at least I haven't."
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3793.078,3796.442,"Well, I will -- it’s as simple as this."
1979.78-1088,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3833.966,3850.101,"Do you think this situation meets the criterion of something enacted, especially for the particular class of people seeking the information?"
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3850.101,3854.034,"No, the statute was enacted for the benefit of the public at large."
1979.78-1088,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3873.444,3874.97,May I just clarify one thing.
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3879.312,3879.402,"No, sir."
1979.78-1088,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3879.402,3882.368,You merely claim that your rights under the FOIA give you the right to bring this action?
1979.78-1088,2,44448,william_a_dobrovir,,3882.368,3895.296,"That's right, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.78-1088,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3895.296,3900.23,Mr. Sussman.
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,3900.23,3904.844,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1088,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3988.927,3996.359,"The relevant test is not whether or not they are records but whether or not they were called “agency records,” you agree with that, would you?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,3996.359,3997.154,Oh!
1979.78-1088,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4001.361,4007.187,"Your argument is the same, but they were agency records and remained agency records if they were wrongfully removed from the agency?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4007.187,4008.705,That is absolutely our argument.
1979.78-1088,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4008.705,4009.841,That’s your argument?
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4009.841,4015.439,Our argument is that the Act on its face applies the agency records.
1979.78-1088,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4058.199,4069.675,"Well, what if one makes a demand under -- on an agency for a record which doesn’t fall within any of the exemptions, but which was destroyed lawfully under the Federal Records Act?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4069.675,4072.529,Then I think the Act no longer applies --
1979.78-1088,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4072.529,4075.142,"Let’s say it was stolen, quite unlawfully --"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4075.142,4075.881,"Well, then the Act would apply --"
1979.78-1088,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4075.881,4077.568,But it simply isn’t there?
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4079.839,4082.27,"Well, the agency quite obviously should not --"
1979.78-1088,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4082.27,4085.642,"It was stolen and taken to Timbuktu, how can the agency possibly comply?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4085.642,4102.084,"The agency cannot produce what it does not have and if the document is physically unavailable, if there is no physical way that the agency can retrieve the document and provide it to the FOIA requester, then obviously it is not withheld."
1979.78-1088,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4105.143,4109.037,And so how can anybody withhold something that he doesn’t have?
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4109.037,4120.731,"Well, I think the word “had” has to be construed broadly and I think this is an important point."
1979.78-1088,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4207.936,4216.196,"Do you mean, on the 18th of January they were already in the possession of the Library of Congress, were they not?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4216.196,4220.22,"They were already in the possession of the Library of Congress, that's true."
1979.78-1088,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4220.22,4236.798,"Well, if he demanded them their return, could he secure their return in his individual capacity after he had made the gift which the government says is an irrevocable gift, as Ginsburg did?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4236.798,4240.642,"I think, Your Honor, he could have done it in either capacity."
1979.78-1088,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4263.709,4268.736,"Well, is that a fact, that someone did advise him that they were no longer --"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4268.736,4269.505,"Well, nobody --"
1979.78-1088,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4269.505,4271.375,"The facts are just the contrary, haven’t they?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4271.375,4289.334,"Well, he was advised by the legal adviser that they were not, but I think the question we are looking at right now is the question of withholding and the question of whether an unlawfully removed document is within the power of an agency to retrieve."
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4339.328,4360.033,"What if the library -- what if he said those very words to the librarian and the librarian said, “I am awfully sorry, but I think you are ill-advised right now, and you gave these to us, we are going to keep them until the Court tells us to give them back?”"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4360.033,4360.519,Oh!
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4360.519,4376.668,"Could Mr. Kissinger, as Secretary of State or Mr. Kissinger either as Secretary of State or personally have the -- would he under any relevant statute have a cause of action against the State Department, I mean against the state library?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4376.668,4380.626,I think that -- let me answer the question in two ways.
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4391.419,4393.63,Through whom?
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4393.63,4394.484,Through the Attorney General.
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4394.484,4394.887,I know.
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4402.926,4403.638,"That's true, but --"
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4403.638,4406.147,And the Attorney General would have to agree with him.
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4406.147,4407.2,The Attorney General would --
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4407.2,4416.209,"So, I am not sure I understand your position that these records are retrievable just at the request of the State Department, as a matter of fact, they aren't?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4416.209,4419.06,"Well, let me re-frame it slightly."
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4436.575,4443.141,But the law says that a party to get them back if they are illegally possessed by somebody else is the Attorney General?
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4443.141,4455.329,"But we don't even need to reach that question because short of bringing a lawsuit, there are actions that the State Department could have taken, but didn't take in this case to procure the return of the notes."
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4458.727,4464.408,The question is now though is whether the State Department is withholding any records?
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4464.408,4465.72,"Well, I do believe that --"
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4465.72,4478.061,"Isn't it, and if the only way you can get the records is to win a lawsuit, first convince the Attorney General to sue and then to win it, are they withholding records now?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4478.061,4489.177,I think that the State Department is withholding records if it has failed to take all steps within its power to procure the return of those records.
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4489.177,4494.071,"So what -- if you on that basis, if you win, what’s the judgment?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4494.071,4494.601,"Well, the judgment --"
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4494.601,4496.764,"What do you order, turn them over?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4496.764,4513.958,The judgment I think is precisely the judgment entered by the court below and that is an order to the State Department to go out and to repossess from the Library of Congress to the extent of the library is willing to provide the documents and the transcripts.
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4513.958,4514.791,Alright.
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4520.841,4522.848,"I would, that’s exactly what I would do."
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4522.848,4526.452,"And if the library said awfully sorry, then you would go to the Attorney General?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4526.452,4540.452,"I would certainly do that and I would do that not only under the Freedom of Information Act, I would do that under the Records Act itself because the Records Act imposes a mandatory duty on the part of an agency to retrieve unlawfully removed records."
1979.78-1088,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4540.452,4549.001,The Attorney General is the enforcer of that and there have been all sorts of cases deciding what is or is not owned by a person.
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4557.693,4563.667,"If there are no Freedom of Information Act requesters, the issue is left to the Attorney General, but if --"
1979.78-1088,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4563.667,4565.205,"Well, would that make any difference?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4565.205,4596.065,"Well, it should make a difference for this reason, that independent of what is or is not done, under the records statute citizens have a private cause of action under the FOIA to obtain records, and we submit that cause of action, to records which are covered by the Act and are not within the exemptions, that cause of action should not and cannot be conditioned on whether the Attorney General does or does not choose to exercise his prosecutorial discretion."
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4596.065,4611.344,Are you suggesting that an FOIA suit could be used to secure judicial review of every single decision by an agency to dispose of a non-record record once it thinks that it has served its purposes.
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4626.911,4644.249,"Let me say that I think that 9,999 of every 10,000 such suits would be frivolous because it would be very clear that the record-keeping decision of the agency was a lawful one and that the documents was removed lawfully."
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4644.249,4649.412,"So your answer is yes, that’s exactly what an FOIA case could be used for?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4649.412,4664.361,"That's right, but I don't think that that is a result that we ought to be fearful of or concerned about because there is a very clear and very comprehensive statutory framework for removing documents from public to private property and if --"
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4664.361,4666.785,And for retrieving them?
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4666.785,4680.481,"And for retrieving them, but I come back to the point I made before and that is that we’re not only concerned in this case with the Government's record-keeping decisions under the record statutes."
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4732.155,4745.68,"Well, the other opt if you wouldn't want to be bound by the Attorney General's decision, perhaps you could get judicial review of his decision, that doesn't mean you shouldn't have to seek his decision first?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4745.68,4751.822,"Your Honor, I would submit that there is no reason why you would have to go to the Attorney General first for --"
1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4751.822,4755.088,"Well, the normal rule is to exhaust your administrative remedies?"
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4755.088,4758.658,I don't think that we are talking about administrative remedy here.
1979.78-1088,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4793.464,4801.68,Was any request ever made of the Attorney General to get into this matter that you are aware of?
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4801.68,4815.052,"Not by the FOIA requesters and I can't speak with absolute authority about the State Department, I believe that it also never made a request."
1979.78-1088,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4815.052,4817.932,Nor GSA?

1979.78-1088,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4825.166,4846.141,"Of course, I suppose that the Department of Justice, which is headed by the Attorney General, has a position in this lawsuit that is directly contrary to yours that this isn't an FOIA -- that this isn't any longer the business of an FOIA lawsuit in the posture of this case."
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4846.141,4867.214,"That is indeed their position and I would submit that if there were a judicially created duty on the part of the State Department to seek the return of these records, the Justice Department might be somewhat more sympathetic to our problem."
1979.78-1088,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4914.889,4915.884,"No, not yet."
1979.78-1088,3,40415,robert_m_sussman,,4915.884,4916.693,It is not?
1979.78-1088,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5052.626,5059.852,"You have a few minutes left, Mr. Ginsburg."
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5061.624,5063.592,Three minutes.
1979.78-1088,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5138.969,5163.683,"Do you think there would be a difference possibly, Mr. Ginsburg between the authority of the Attorney General to pursue records and retrieve them by replevin and the obligation of the State Department to deal under the Act with records of papers that they no longer possess?"
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5163.683,5185.957,"I think there is no doubt that if the Attorney General's authority was invoked under the Federal Records Act and the claim was both by the Administrator of General Services and the Attorney General referring these and the Secretary of State referring the issue to the Attorney General, he has plenary power under the Federal Records Act to pursue the matter."
1979.78-1088,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5193.491,5205.059,"And that would still have to be decided whether, assuming they were owned by the State Department, and therefore, properly back in State's possession, whether they were agency records under the FOIA."
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5205.059,5209.396,"That would still leave that issue to be determined, Your Honor."
1979.78-1088,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5270.965,5291.803,"Mr. Ginsburg, is it correct under your submission that say, an agency became aware of an pending FOIA request before it was filed, that the person who had custody of all the records that might be the subject of the request could simply take them home and keep them until after the request had been filed and then they would avoid compliance."
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5291.803,5295.075,"We’ve considered that problem, Your Honor."
1979.78-1088,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5313.904,5316.351,If there was a lawless removal?
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5316.351,5318.071,And the person was aggrieved.
1979.78-1088,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5319.663,5331.553,"So your opponent here argues that that is in substance what happened here, and I am not saying he is right, but he argues that there was a lawless removal and they were in effect put in the basement of the people rather than kept and so how is the case different?"
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5331.553,5331.692,Oh!
1979.78-1088,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5334.428,5336.015,There is no central issue?
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5336.015,5340.674,"Under the facts of this case, it’s clearly not a lawless removal."
1979.78-1088,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5341.739,5347.743,"But, do we have to -- the question really is do we have to decide whether or not it was a lawless removal?"
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5361.951,5383.195,"Well, Your Honor, it seems to me that the remedy -- the only possible remedy that could be invoked that this is an issue conceivably for amendment of the statute, but the only possible remedy that could be invoked presently under the law as we know it would be the equivalent of a review under the Administrative Procedure Act if one could show injury, if one could show damage of some sort and that there was a basis for --"
1979.78-1088,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5383.195,5388.677,"There would be an FOIA cause of action, that’s your submission, whether removal was lawful or lawless?"
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5388.677,5390.295,Under the FOIA.
1979.78-1088,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5390.295,5393.302,Under the existing FOIA.
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5394.782,5395.51,It would be.
1979.78-1088,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5395.51,5402.566,"And if that is true, then there is no -- if you are correct, then there is no need to inquire whether or not the removal was lawful or lawless?"
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5402.566,5403.308,"Exactly right, sir."
1979.78-1088,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5403.308,5409.342,"So that would be up to the Attorney General and it would be a discretionary act, would it?"
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5409.342,5411.185,This certainly would be our submission.
1979.78-1088,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5419.416,5424.73,"Mr. Ginsburg, I don't mean to prolong it, but I also don't want to leave with a misunderstanding of your position."
1979.78-1088,4,20879,david_ginsburg,,5436.743,5437.729,"That is my view, sir."
1979.78-1088,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5437.729,5437.944,Yes.
1979.78-1088,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5439.803,5440.76,Thank you gentlemen.
