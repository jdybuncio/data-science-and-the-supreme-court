1984.83-1935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.824,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in the Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation v. the Secretary of Labor.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,23.18,37.589,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the Alamo Foundation was an outgrowth of the activities of Tony and Susan Alamo in the Los Angeles area of California."
1984.83-1935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,166.556,175.162,"Mr. Gean, how many persons are affected by the holding in this case in the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,175.162,182.601,"Directly, Your Honor, with the Foundation, there are approximately 300 persons who are called associates."
1984.83-1935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,191.523,197.277,"How many in the whole pattern, the whole program?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,197.277,207.283,"Your Honor, this is a pentacostal group and it is quite common among pentacostal groups to not keep records of membership."
1984.83-1935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,208.835,209.985,I'm not speaking of members.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,214.572,222.309,"Those would be, Your Honor, the some 300 that are pastors and evangelists, and that is all that would be affected directly."
1984.83-1935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,241.139,246.174,"Well, in round numbers, how many people?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,248.543,251.578,"I would say hundreds of thousands of people, Your Honor."
1984.83-1935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,287.687,294.174,I had the impression there were a great many more people directly involved than 300.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,294.174,299.043,"--Well, also it swings, Your Honor, around the 300 associates who are pastors and evangelists."
1984.83-1935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,377.309,385.665,"Well, are they engaged in the production of goods, or are they engaged in evangelistic missionary type of work?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,385.665,388.634,"Your Honor, their activities are religious."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.283,445.639,"Mr. Gean, does the Act apply to other employees of churches who are paid salaries?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,449.091,454.928,"I think that's a well-established law, Your Honor, and I think it does, and I think rightfully so."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,461.432,466.3,"Has the Act been applied to the salaries of ministers, do you know?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,466.3,477.007,"--Well, it certainly has been applied to many people who are involved in church-related activities, such as schools, nurseries, where they are paid a wage."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.007,485.213,How about a minister who's paid a wage to serve his particular--
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,485.213,491.951,"Your Honor, I cannot tell you offhand that there is such an application of the Act to ministers."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.951,495.319,"--If there were, is it invalid in your view?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,495.319,496.819,"Yes, I think it is."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.819,498.437,How about the income tax?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,508.377,514.614,"Your Honor, if it was a salary, I wouldn't think so, if it is in truth and in fact a salary."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,514.614,526.354,"Well, does this case come down then to a question of whether the board and room and other benefits is the equivalent of a salary?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,529.39,532.508,"Your Honor, I believe that that would be one of the aspects."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,575.418,577.687,I don't think I understand your point.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,600.885,609.158,"--If it's received with the expectation that that is compensation, I think it probably would apply."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,609.158,612.693,Even though they were working for a church?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,612.693,618.847,"Yes, unless it is clear that this is part of their religious practices."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,653.97,658.838,Is that because of the free exercise clause that you make this argument?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,658.838,660.124,"Yes, Your Honor, that's one of the reasons."
1984.83-1935,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,660.124,679.185,"And then how do you distinguish United States v. Lee, where this Court held that the Amish employers were not entitled to the exemption for the Social Security Act payments, even though it was a direct conflict with their religious practices and beliefs to pay it?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,679.185,686.255,"Your Honor, I am not for certain about that particular case, and I don't recall all of the facts that's in that particular case."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,732.136,738.624,"Mr. Gean, before you go on, the associates operated several businesses."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,741.842,743.694,"--Well, Your Honor, we call them activities."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,744.478,750.198,"Well, they were gasoline stations, clothing stores, grocery stores."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,751.348,752.334,--Cafes or restaurants.
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,752.334,753.067,--Restaurant.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,753.067,753.55,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,753.55,758.287,Did they compete with other businesses engaged in the same activity?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,758.287,784.003,"Yes, there was some competition, but primarily those organizations, those entities which I call activities and which you might refer to, commonly known as business or commercial activities, they are conducted primarily to provide for the clothing, the housing, the food, the transportation and communication of the members."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,785.838,791.359,"If a member of the public generally walked into the restaurant, would he or she be served?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,791.359,792.142,Yes.
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,792.142,796.678,Or in any of the other stores or business I suppose?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,796.678,798.864,"Not any of the others; no, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,798.864,802.066,Which would not serve the public?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,802.066,808.136,Uh the--
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,808.136,815.706,"Well, you said some are never in the business of serving the public."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,817.325,817.942,"--Yes, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,820.61,821.744,The record keeping business?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,821.744,822.896,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,829.882,830.3,Yes.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,830.3,848.344,"So I would say I'll have to change that statement, Your Honor; that there was some activity on the part of that particular Southwest Business Management which was for record keeping, but ordinarily it was for the church members or for these associates."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,852.665,853.248,Yes.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,859.902,865.823,"At first, Your Honor, there was some eight employees that are called outside employees by the District Court."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,865.823,867.425,--Are they covered by the Act?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,867.425,867.825,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,879.232,882.184,Not a single outside non-associate person?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,882.184,898.61,"Other than at the very beginning of their utilizing these activities, primarily for the purpose of providing shelter, food, transportation, clothing, for the associates."
1984.83-1935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,898.61,905.8,Are we to understand that these 300 people you described earlier are the people who run all these business enterprises?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,905.8,907.1,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.061,929.263,I notice a motel is included.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,933.131,936.952,"The motel, Your Honor, is one in Tippi, Arizona."
1984.83-1935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,958.465,962.15,What about the company that lays concrete foundations?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,962.15,995.621,"Your Honor, that particular organization, the Alamo Quarries, the Alamo Ready-Mix which I believe you have reference to, and those other similar type building activities, or as might be referred to as business practices, were conducted for the purpose of providing the housing, the schools, the training places, the churches of the Foundation."
1984.83-1935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,995.621,1000.691,And took no outside business?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1000.691,1003.56,"I cannot tell you that, Your Honor, that they did not take some."
1984.83-1935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1004.293,1008.995,"Well, was it in competition with other construction companies?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1008.995,1019.219,"--Your Honor, if a church member wanted some activity on the part of the Alamo Concrete, I believe that they did some."
1984.83-1935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1027.207,1042.717,I think you answered the Chief Justice that all these businesses there seem to be almost a dozen of them were carried on by these 300 associates?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1042.717,1043.017,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1051.905,1056.04,"But now, these ventures were over four states, weren't they?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1056.04,1060.594,"Your Honor, they are in I believe there is four states."
1984.83-1935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1064.63,1066.515,And all of this by 300?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1066.515,1066.965,Sir?
1984.83-1935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1066.965,1070.217,All of this work done by just 300 associates?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1070.217,1070.5,Yes.
1984.83-1935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1088.679,1094.249,"Incidentally, what was the advertising that Hartford Advertising provided for those ventures?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1100.153,1105.123,That was one that was done for other persons.
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.504,1139.008,"--Mr. Gean, to what extent were these people paid cash compensation?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1141.793,1143.995,"No, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.995,1152.333,"Well, what about I'm just looking at the District Court's finding Gerald Rich, the payroll ledger indicates that Mr. Rich was paid $8 an hour for all hours worked and so forth."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1153.417,1169.562,"Your Honor, those were the eight employees that were involved at the beginning of the Foundation's activities that were ceased prior to the time that the District Court heard this matter, and it was agreed that those parties were employees."
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.133,1207.985,Those people aren't involved in this case?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1208.685,1210.603,"Not at this time, Your Honor."
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.047,1233.636,"Just so I understand, the District Court described 16, I think, different people at 31 to 34 of the Appendix for these services."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1242.072,1242.408,No.
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.693,1247.76,I see.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1250.445,1262.47,"The associate, Your Honor, is a synonym for those persons associated with the Foundation as pastors and evangelists."
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1262.47,1269.391,--But what portion of their work was devoted to economic ventures and what portion to religious activities?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1269.391,1271.825,It is their statement.
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.181,1284.151,Even running the restaurant is solely of a religious nature?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1284.151,1284.568,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1332.363,1343.603,"Mr. Gean, those 18 people who are employees, did any of them subsequently become associates?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1343.603,1345.372,"Your Honor, not that I know of."
1984.83-1935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1345.372,1348.324,"But if they did, then they wouldn't be covered, according to you."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1348.324,1349.224,They wouldn't what?
1984.83-1935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1349.224,1356.661,"They wouldn't be covered, according to you, if they were associates."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1356.661,1360.715,"Your Honor, they were paid a wage."
1984.83-1935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1363.334,1367.203,"But if they became associates, they wouldn't be paid wage--"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1367.203,1368.436,"Well, that would have to be seen."
1984.83-1935,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1390.484,1397.988,"--Who decides whether A, B, and C are employees or associates?"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1397.988,1408.696,"Well, I think the attitude, the desire, and the belief of the individual has a great deal of control over it."
1984.83-1935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.932,1605.24,"Mr. Gean, does the record show with respect to these 300 people a typical number of hours per week--"
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1605.24,1605.84,"No, sir; it does not."
1984.83-1935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.84,1607.706,--that any of them put in on the Foundation activities?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1607.706,1610.225,"No, sir; it does not."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1610.225,1615.096,"Mr. Gean, everyone has to have some cash."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1624.551,1630.103,"Well, in Alma, Arkansas, Your Honor we have buses."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1630.103,1633.321,--You're not suggesting that the associates never had any cash?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1633.321,1633.973,"No, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1634.873,1636.09,Where did it come from?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1636.09,1645.297,"It comes from the Foundation and from the other members of the Foundation who work, or the church members who contribute to the pastors and evangelists who go out for the purpose of spreading the gospel."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1645.297,1649.582,So the church did pay some cash to associates.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1649.582,1651.468,"Your Honor, it was not pay."
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1651.468,1652.218,"Well, it was given."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1652.218,1657.938,It was for the purpose of paying for their expenses and conducting the religious activities of the Foundation.
1984.83-1935,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1669.746,1672.632,Does the record show the amount of cash paid to associates?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1672.632,1673.398,"No, sir; it does not."
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.984,1677.852,May I ask you one question about the remedy?
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1681.738,1694.378,"Your Honor, if this Court decides that these people, these associates, must be paid the sum of $19 million which the Secretary of Labor says is due--"
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.378,1696.663,I didn't read the decree to require that.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1697.663,1699.015,"--No, sir; the decree does not require that."
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.015,1702.4,It requires they give notice to them of the amount that they would have a right to claim.
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1702.4,1704.833,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1935,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.768,1711.07,"If your description of them is correct, I would assume none of them would really claim the money."
1984.83-1935,0,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,1711.07,1714.438,--I believe that's true.
1984.83-1935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1788.92,1791.786,Very well.
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,1802.994,1829.645,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, first if I may, just to clear up a number of questions that were raised, the Congress quite specifically stated and I referred in note 10 of our brief that wages includes the cost of board, food, lodging, and similar benefits."
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1877.978,1885.898,"Well, if the associates are, as alleged, professionals, why are they not within the scope of the exemption?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,1888.35,1891.652,--They may be professional ministers.
1984.83-1935,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2014.912,2024.535,"Mr. Fried, do you know what the situation is with respect to the commercial businesses operated by the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2024.535,2025.735,--I do not.
1984.83-1935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2030.273,2040.712,"How about, Mr. Fried, the monks who run the Christian Brothers winery, an order of monks--"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2040.712,2045.199,"Well, that's a complicated matter which I would be glad to--"
1984.83-1935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2045.199,2046.766,--And how about the Trappists?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2047.616,2048.568,--Who make jams and jellies.
1984.83-1935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2048.568,2050.235,--Make jams and jellies.
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2050.235,2060.208,The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that those activities constitute unrelated business activities.
1984.83-1935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2065.41,2067.712,Which one?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2068.898,2072.433,"--The monks, monks who are engaged in extensive farming enterprises."
1984.83-1935,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2088.893,2103.885,"--May I ask you also I should know the answer to this, but I don't Roman Catholic sisters who are nursing nuns, are they exempt because they are professionals or are they taxable?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2103.885,2113.677,"--In 1968, the Act was extended further to cover specifically schools and hospitals."
1984.83-1935,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.94,2141.158,"Well, here, what about income tax in this case?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2141.158,2146.462,"Do you mean income tax of the business, Your Honor, or income tax of the associates?"
1984.83-1935,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2146.462,2147.914,Either.
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2149.848,2164.773,"The Petitioners state, and for the first time in their reply brief cite Section 512, stating that this was determined to be unrelated business income."
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2238.222,2244.226,"Mr. Fried, I didn't understand your response to Justice Blackmun's question about the nuns."
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2251.649,2254.933,"As professionals, they surely are not."
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.933,2258.802,You mean no nurse is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2258.802,2259.485,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.17,2272.376,You mean any no hospital paying a nurse need to observe the minimum wage laws?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2272.376,2274.228,"Because nurses are professionals, Your Honor."
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.228,2276.578,"Just as a class, they are exempt?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2276.578,2278.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1935,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2278.28,2289.238,"Does that extend not only to registered nurse, but licensed practical nurses and some of the subcategories?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2289.238,2291.654,I would have to conjecture.
1984.83-1935,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2293.587,2293.97,Orderlies?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2293.97,2299.074,Orderlies surely are not professionals.
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2302.426,2315.352,How about employees of Salvation Army thrift stores that are undergoing rehabilitation and who receive room and board?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2315.352,2344.103,"I think the question of rehabilitative services is a difficult one, and the Portland Terminal case is very important in this regard because if the employees are working for their own benefits and the Portland Terminal care spoke, if I may quote from that case, accepting the unchallenged findings here that the railroads which was the putative employer received no"
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2374.039,2384.763,"Well, in this case, in your view, does it turn on whether the associates had the expectation of compensation in the form of room and board?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2388.715,2389.515,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2406.208,2408.393,What testimony supports that in your view?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2417.515,2436.31,"Well, there is considerable testimony from the former associates and of particular importance is Ann Elmore who's a present associate, chosen by Petitioners as a representative associate, who said, and I quote:"
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2524.518,2535.409,"So in your view, then, the monks making wine or jams and jellies would be equally subject to federal Fair Labor Standards Act."
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2535.409,2545.448,"To the extent to the extent that they are not professionals, administrators, or managers, they would indeed."
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2547.183,2551.519,What makes one a professional?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2551.519,2554.704,--The exercise of a recognized profession.
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.704,2556.356,Like making jelly?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2556.356,2562.327,"I would not, myself, extend it to that extent, but I'm not--"
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.327,2566.195,Or like operating a retail store?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2566.195,2572.7,"--Operating a retail store would surely not be a case of being a professional, but it might render a person a manager."
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.7,2576.152,"Well, somebody who one of these people were that's what they working in, a retail store."
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2576.152,2580.021,"Well, if they were sales persons, then they would clearly be covered."
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2642.612,2657.704,"Well, Mr. Fried, how about youngsters, young people who go to summer camps for the handicapped in the summer, and they expect to get room and board for volunteering their services at the camps to help handicapped children?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2661.358,2670.548,There are specific exemptions for summer recreational works.
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.548,2672.714,"In the Act, or in your--"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2672.714,2673.483,In the Act.
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2688.326,2691.695,--And what section do we look to for that?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2691.695,2696.313,That I believe is Section 213.
1984.83-1935,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2699.567,2702.835,"And that's in the Appendix someplace, is it, or not?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2705.371,2709.323,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1984.83-1935,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2709.323,2712.791,"Mr. Fried, the YMCA runs boys' camps all over the United States."
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2757.637,2759.006,I think that's a very difficult--
1984.83-1935,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2759.006,2760.189,"He doesn't get paid, by the way."
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2763.141,2788.691,"--It's a difficult question, and what distinguishes it and distinguishes it most importantly from the case we have here is that group leader, first, does not work in a commercial enterprise in competition with other commercial enterprises which are forced to pay the minimum wage, and it is one of the specific purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act to... and I quote here:"
1984.83-1935,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2816.441,2827.814,"Mr. Fried, do you agree with Mr. Gean that the record simply doesn't speak as to what the typical number of hours per week put in in Foundation activities was by these 300 people?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2827.814,2829.466,The record certainly does speak.
1984.83-1935,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2861.053,2876.813,You don't think it makes any difference to the legal outcome of this case whether the typical member of the 300 put in four or five hours a week and had a full-time outside job as opposed to being employed only by the Foundation?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,2876.813,2916.704,"It would in at the extremes, Your Honor, but I think it's very important to recognize in this case that though Petitioners repeat that their businesses did not run at a profit... and they say this again and again, even though that statement is unsubstantiated by anything but Mr. Alamo's testimony... they also say that the extensive non-commercial missionary work of the Foundation had as a principal source of support these commercial businesses."
1984.83-1935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3029.893,3030.61,Wait.
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3043.887,3049.005,That is a computation which is still in dispute and is not final.
1984.83-1935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3050.457,3052.091,Is it in the record here?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3052.091,3067.752,--That statement is in the record and is based on a computation by the Secretary which the Court of Appeals has directed the District Court to recompute and not to take as binding in any sense.
1984.83-1935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.954,3080.81,"Mr. Fried, can I ask you... do you think the Portland Terminal case would have been decided differently if the trainees were given room and board during the week of training?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3080.81,3092.618,"I think that would not lead to a different outcome necessarily, because of the language which I have already quoted, ""accepting the unchallenged findings""... I am quoting from the case here..."
1984.83-1935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.162,3116.733,"But the benefit, if you accept your opponent's view of the case, the benefit was entirely a benefit to this religious mission that they carried out; was it not?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3128.807,3133.942,We would vigorously contest the conclusion that there was no profit here.
1984.83-1935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3160.675,3163.977,"Well, didn't he testify the whole enterprise was not profitable?"
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3163.977,3166.077,"He so testified, but he also testified--"
1984.83-1935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.077,3171.198,"And you didn't contradict that with any evidence, even though his records are available to you."
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3171.198,3171.681,--Your Honor--
1984.83-1935,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.681,3172.733,As I understand the record.
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3175.869,3212.358,"--The testimony I believe contradicts itself because if what happens is the non-commercial enterprises... and they were extensive... supported in part from the revenues of the businesses, then it must follow that the businesses produce revenues, produce revenues in excess of their expenses, because otherwise I fail to understand how they could have served to support the non-commercial enterprises which were, as we said, extensive."
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3212.358,3223.85,Do you dispute the position that these associates were engaged in their own rehabilitation?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3223.85,3226.202,We don't dispute that.
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3264.308,3267.193,You think that supports your position?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3267.193,3267.91,--I beg your pardon?
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.91,3271.878,"You think that fact supports your position, rather than the other side, I take it."
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3271.878,3275.782,"I think it's a factor that helps, Your Honor."
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.782,3284.387,And your position also doesn't really depend on whether these businesses made a profit.
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3287.089,3296.445,"If they didn't make a profit, which we think is inconsistent with the Petitioner's own claims, it would be irrelevant, because we don't know why they didn't make a profit."
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.445,3296.762,--Yes.
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3298.897,3300.097,It would indeed.
1984.83-1935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.553,3319.977,And do you think your position as you've expressed it here and in your brief defends the rationale of the Court of Appeals in all respect?
1984.83-1935,1,18942,charles_fried,,3319.977,3325.648,"We have no substantial quarrel with the rationale in the Court of Appeals, Your Honor."

1984.83-1935,2,39329,roy_r_gean_jr,,3487.985,3491.854,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1935,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3543.603,3546.655,"Your time has expired, Mr. Gean."
