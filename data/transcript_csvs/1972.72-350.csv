1972.72-350,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.001,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-350, United States against the Tax Commission of Mississippi."
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1452.047,1455.64,May it please the Court.
1972.72-350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.769,1711.558,"Well, Mr Wright, do you -- is it your position that the State could compel purchasing from the State?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1711.558,1718.065,"Indeed, it could and this option was granted to the retailers for their benefit, for their convenience?"
1972.72-350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.065,1724.628,Are there any cases -- is there any case that you would cite in support of that statement?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1724.628,1758.486,"We had cited the Yosemite, the Collins against Yosemite Park case, which held exactly that as far as California’s excise tax is concerned, but I will get to that case later on, I want to describe here first how the Mississippi system operates and then I will describe how the federal policy operates, because after you see how the federal system and state system perform, I don’t think you will find any conflict that would force you to reach the constitutional issue."
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1819.09,1822.676,But the distillers don't keep that money?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1822.676,1823.644,I beg your pardon.
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.644,1827.497,"The distillers don't get that money, right?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1827.497,1832.81,"No, what they get is the privilege of selling liquor in Mississippi."
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1839.017,1844.24,And what does Mississippi give either to distiller or the club?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1844.24,1846.186,It gives the distiller two things.
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1861.359,1864.373,But all Mississippi wants is the $17?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1864.373,1864.649,"Well, I don't --"
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1864.649,1866.409,Anyway they can get it?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1866.409,1880.185,"I am pointing out that the 17% is a gross profit margin that in itself is that -- the profit of the State gets, a difference between the 17% markup."
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1880.185,1889.786,"But the liquor doesn't go through any State official, nobody in state does anything for this liquor at all, right?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1889.786,1892.383,Not with the physical liquor.
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1893.723,1895.698,Other than to accept the money?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1895.698,1901.833,"Well, I have to give, they don't keep track of it and they do not get the money from the military."
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1914.562,1914.827,"Well, who --"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1914.827,1918.575,Those are protests made by the clubs to the suppliers.
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1918.575,1926.93,"Well, do I assume that the distillery is any different from any other corporation that pays all taxes through the purchaser, don't they?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1926.93,1927.621,Precisely.
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1927.621,1928.909,And that's what they do here?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1928.909,1929.824,Yeah exactly.
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.824,1933.196,And the distiller is a conduit for your taxes?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1933.196,1936.963,Well it isn't -- I am pointing out it doesn't have to be a tax.
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1936.963,1940.289,"You ain't paid the distiller for collecting it for you, do you?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1940.289,1942.418,It’s a wholesale markup.
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1946.71,1949.484,Because it doesn't cost him anything?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1949.484,1962.348,"Well it costs -- it is a possible arrangement for him, but I want to point out that the burden is his, it is imposed on him, the markup obligation."
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1964.444,1964.822,If he can --
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1964.822,1970.759,And that there is no more of a burden on the clubs than any other state excise tax or --
1972.72-350,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1970.759,1977.432,"Now if a distiller sues you or raises a lot of noise, would you still buy whiskey from him?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1982.464,1989.431,"I am not suggesting that there was no compulsion on the seller not to comply with Mississippi’s law, there is."
1972.72-350,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1998.009,1999.298,Mr. Wright?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,1999.298,1999.734,Yes.
1972.72-350,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1999.734,2001.448,Excuse me sir.
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2004.315,2006.597,I don't believe so.
1972.72-350,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2010.816,2015.725,"I am not talking about liquor, but do you have a retail sales tax in Mississippi?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2015.725,2020.019,"There may be one, I don’t think it's significant in this context."
1972.72-350,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2020.019,2029.778,I am just wondering whether a sales tax is collected from commodities sold in an army post exchange on one of these bases?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2029.778,2045.473,"No it's not all state taxes are exempted, the military clubs are exempted from all state taxes, that's the same sentence in the regulation that imposes the market exempts from all state taxes."
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2258.517,2262.979,Let me ask you a question that somewhat like Mr. Justice Powell’s question.
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2267.95,2269.287,"I really don’t know, I assume they probably might have --"
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2269.287,2272.515,"Well, they probably do, almost everybody does."
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2272.515,2273.219,Yes.
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2273.219,2288.032,"Now can they tax, I am not concerned about whether they do or not do, assert that Mississippi has a right to -- the power to tax cigarettes with the state tax that are sold in the exchanges."
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2288.032,2289.989,I assert nothing as to cigarettes.
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2328.988,2333.881,Do you have any -- do you have any Indian reservations in Mississippi?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2333.881,2336.079,"I couldn't say, I --"
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2336.079,2337.786,I am just trying to get out some of the same things that you were --
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2337.786,2339.258,It's possible.
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2339.258,2340.035,-- talking about before.
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2349.818,2361.864,The State has -- I think the state's power to regulate staffs of the border of the end play that any of them as far as what happens on the base.
1972.72-350,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2598.026,2603.073,Mr Wright what was the situation before 1966?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2608.275,2609.732,"In theory, but not in fact."
1972.72-350,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2609.732,2612.756,"Well, but in law it was."
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2613.885,2615.37,In law it was a dry state.
1972.72-350,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2615.37,2619.648,And were the -- was liquor sold on all of these military bases?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2619.648,2626.793,"That I can't tell you, but the stipulation doesn't cover the pre 1966 activities."
1972.72-350,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.755,2638.852,The stipulation doesn't show --
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2638.852,2642.67,This is simply not part of the record that you have here.
1972.72-350,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2642.67,2653.849,"Well, I wondered what the situation was because of my -- on the problems at least so far as these -- some of these bases are not holding federal enclaves?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2653.849,2655.538,Well they are all federal enclaves.
1972.72-350,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2691.024,2691.47,Twenty-first Amendment.
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2691.47,2692.69,-- which annotated the cessions.
1972.72-350,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2692.69,2701.118,"And until 1966, Mississippi chose to exercise its power under the Twenty-First Amendment by having absolute provision."
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2701.118,2702.36,"Right, and that --"
1972.72-350,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2702.36,2709.302,And I wondered what the situation was on these bases during that period with respect to the sale of liquor either by the drink or by the bottle?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2709.302,2720.645,I can't tell you but I would suspect that there was liquor on the bases as there was nearly everywhere else in Mississippi on merely the bases.
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2720.645,2725.051,"Let's lay aside the fact, what is your view of the power?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2731.15,2769.413,"I think its more identical question than the one we have here because I think it's clear that when you have a state trying to control what happens on the base, conduct on the base, you have entirely different question than you do when all state wants to do is to control the distribution of liquor to the base, which is what you have in the case here, and then this was also involved in the Yosemite case, but this brings me to what I take are the two decisive cases of this Court in this area."
1972.72-350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2776.358,2782.313,"I know, but it seems to me that that regulation you are talking about is permissive."
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2788.619,2791.147,It never did require them to seek the lowest price.
1972.72-350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2791.147,2804.032,But I don't know how you can say that it's the conflict from the United States is not asserted a right to buy liquor free of any state imposed markup?
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2804.032,2806.965,This suit clears the conflict unquestionably.
1972.72-350,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.277,2827.311,"You say that the United States, awfully sorry we just wanted to entertain the lawsuit because you just brought your lawsuit?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,2827.311,2844.769,"Well, even if you regard it a conflict as present, I think your decisions, the Court’s decision in Ohio against Helvering and in Collins against Yosemite Park decides this case in favor of Mississippi."
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3064.883,3075.01,"Well Mr. Wright, your analysis of the Yosemite case would seem to equate the concession error with an instrumentality, does it not?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,3075.01,3079.501,"Yes, I think he clearly wasn't an agent of the Park Service."
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3079.501,3088.485,And you make no distinction on the other factors in Yosemite about the consent of the --
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,3088.485,3104.971,"No, I think clearly if there is a constitutional prohibition against California’s taxing sales of liquor into a Federal Enclave, then nothing California could do by its statutes where they give it the right to do it."
1972.72-350,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3104.971,3109.894,"Well, the United States could consent to California's doing it, could it not?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,3109.894,3111.437,"Well, I think it was held as to that conservration --"
1972.72-350,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3111.437,3113.777,"Well, could it; my question would be, could it?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,3113.777,3114.444,They could.
1972.72-350,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3114.444,3117.449,"(Inaudible), and did it not?"
1972.72-350,1,40806,robert_l_wright,,3117.449,3118.994,"In that case it did, yes."
1972.72-350,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3254.43,3255.151,Thank you.
1972.72-350,3,40806,robert_l_wright,,3466.202,3468.601,"Your Honor, I give you this one citation that I thought it was my last point."
1972.72-350,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3468.601,3470.922,You may -- you may give us the citation.
1972.72-350,3,40806,robert_l_wright,,3470.922,3480.7,"All I have is this should have been included in my belief, it's a senate report on the Buck Act, which was passed in 1940."
1972.72-350,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3500.327,3503.089,Case is submitted.
