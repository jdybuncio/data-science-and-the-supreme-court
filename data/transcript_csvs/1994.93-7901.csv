1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.887,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-7901, Lloyd Schlup v. Paul Delo."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,57.919,62.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.069,169.772,What evidence was introduced at trial against Mr. Schlup?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,169.772,183.169,"The evidence at trial was two identification witnesses, a officer who was the one opening the cell block for lunch, and another one on the uppermost tier in the housing unit."
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.724,192.085,"Well, what was the other... on the basis of their observations?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,192.085,192.656,Yes.
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.656,195.558,They said that they had seen him stab the person?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,195.558,196.199,Correct.
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,211.14,225.287,"Well, wasn't there some evidence that, I think it was, Eberle called the guards out of the cafeteria, or at least told Peoples to do that, some 10 to 15 minutes after the disturbance?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,228.389,232.844,"You can make that inference from the evidence, but it would be a false assumption."
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,249.564,252.429,"Well, the fact that someone else could have made the call doesn't mean that Eberle didn't."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,252.429,256.5,"That's true, but the question here, Your Honor, is who made the first call?"
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.176,287.701,This sounds very much like the kind of questions juries resolve every day.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,294.825,318.099,"--Your Honor, in this case there was key evidence withheld from the jury that completely stripped the videotape of its probative value, and that was the evidence of a witness who said that he picked up the telephone and called base within 30 seconds of Arthur Dade hitting the ground, and if that's so, then Mr. Schlup was in the dining room at the time."
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.099,319.741,You say this was withheld from the jury?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,319.741,322.372,It was not presented to the jury.
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.372,322.883,Oh.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,323.823,325.145,Pardon me?
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.145,326.327,Why not?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,326.327,339.353,"The defense lawyer could have, had he done a reasonable investigation, found this evidence, and I think there's a question of whether or not that fact was disclosed to the defense attorney."
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.287,349.12,"Well, are you saying defense counsel was incompetent, that he didn't have proper assistance of counsel?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,349.12,354.804,That is one of the constitutional claims that underlies the showing of innocence.
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.304,357.285,Was that claim made earlier?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,357.285,358.256,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.256,359.747,It was made in a prior habeas?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,359.747,362.138,It was made in a prior habeas with absolutely--
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.138,362.708,And you want to make it again?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,362.708,363.96,"--Yes, this time--"
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.96,368.983,"And if rejected this time, you would be able to make it again, if you come up with new evidence of incompetence, still."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,370.205,375.698,"--Your Honor, our position is that we can now prove that Mr. Schlup is innocent under--"
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,375.698,383.422,"But if you fail this time, as Justice Scalia says, if you come up with some more new statements or newly discovered witnesses, you say you could make the claim again?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,383.422,384.504,--Your Honor--
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,384.504,385.743,Do you or do you not?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,385.743,403.965,"--I would make... I would continue to make the claim because that's my role as an advocate for the client, but as a practical matter, Your Honor, at this point I think we have as much probative evidence of Mr. Schlup's innocence as we need to meet the standard that this Court--"
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,403.965,406.917,"Well, what is... do you want to show ineffective assistance of counsel?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,415.665,417.256,"--That is one, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,418.805,435.357,"Well, so far as ineffective assistance, that would almost put us in the position of advisory, wouldn't it, because the circuit has already said, we have looked at this issue and we are not going to change our mind; we have found that there was effective assistance of counsel."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,435.357,446.924,"Your Honor, I believe that... to me, that statement in the court below seems to be dicta, because the court said in another case in its opinion that we might get a different result under a different standard."
1994.93-7901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.8,460.192,"May I interrupt you, because there's another point I think we should be clear on."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,463.374,464.166,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,464.166,466.596,"Even if we assume Strickland was, Brady was not."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,466.596,467.277,"Correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,467.277,467.777,Okay.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,467.777,468.138,Correct.
1994.93-7901,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,468.799,469.187,It was--
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,494.886,500.891,"--Your Honor, in this case, Mr. Schlup's innocence functions as a door opener to get into court."
1994.93-7901,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.891,501.261,Fine.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,516.789,520.361,"Normally, the Court does require that, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,520.361,540.675,"All right, and you are saying that this is a successive claim, but shouldn't the standard employed be something greater than the cause-and-prejudice requirement, otherwise the two just are subsumed together?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,540.675,542.508,That's correct.
1994.93-7901,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.521,570.164,"And as to that, it ought to be something, some standard higher than merely cause and prejudice, I would think."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,570.164,576.128,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and the standard that we are asking to apply, the standard that this Court applies, is Kuhlmann v. Wilson."
1994.93-7901,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,577.29,586.386,"Well, that's part of the problem, because the Kuhlmann standard may actually be even a lesser standard than cause and prejudice."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,588.035,599.654,"--Your Honor, I believe it's clear from the Court's jurisprudence that the Kuhlmann standard is greater than the cause-and-prejudice standard, and I think McCleskey is a good example of that."
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,625.742,644.184,"What we're trying to find out here is which of two or perhaps three standards apply to this door-opener, as you refer to it and as Justice Ginsburg, the Kuhlmann standard, perhaps Murray v. Carrier, or perhaps Sawyer, all of which have stated the thing in somewhat different words."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,644.723,669.08,"That's correct, Your Honor, except that when the Sawyer standard stated... when the Sawyer decision stated the miscarriage-of-justice standard for death-penalty people, guilty people who were challenging a sentence, it specifically stated that that situation is distinctly different than an innocent person coming before the court asking for access to a court's enforcement of the Constitution."
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,674.893,686.671,"The Eighth Circuit held here that the Sawyer standard applied where the challenge was to guilt as well as where the challenge is to sentence, and that's the question you brought before us for review."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,686.671,687.302,--Correct.
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,687.302,694.776,"We should have two different standards, one for guilt and one for sentence, or whether Sawyer should be applied across the board."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,694.776,701.732,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I believe there are two different standards because there are two different situations."
1994.93-7901,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,701.732,711.808,"Well, Mr. O'Brien, didn't Sawyer apply its standard to both guilt and penalty phase challenges in that case?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,711.808,713.107,Your Honor--
1994.93-7901,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,713.107,714.91,"At least, the court's opinion said it did."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,714.91,719.792,"--It did apply it to a guilt phase standard, but not an innocence argument."
1994.93-7901,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,753.964,757.487,But you're not making a so-called Herrera-type challenge here.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,764.302,780.193,"--That's correct, Your Honor, because there is ample evidence that a reasonable attorney could have found... there were four or five people who were interviewed by corrections officers who said that they saw the murder, and this is not based on what counsel--"
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,780.193,789.49,"Of course, if we disagree with you that it's dictum in the circuit court's opinion, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim has been litigated and resolved, is that not correct?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,789.49,793.975,"--If you disagree with me, Your Honor, I believe that's probably correct."
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,795.583,798.195,"Incidentally, and was your Brady claim presented to the circuit court?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,798.195,801.19,"--Your Honor, the Brady claim was presented in the district court."
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,808.814,811.605,"My question is, was the Brady claim presented to the circuit court?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,811.605,815.388,"--No, Your Honor, and I don't recall if the ineffective counsel claim was presented."
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,846.858,859.917,"Well, I don't see... I suppose your argument also is that you wouldn't have to present the Brady claim in order, so long as it's still alive, to challenge the prior question of the district court's using the wrong gateway?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,859.917,860.518,That's correct.
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,863.43,869.554,"If it used the wrong gateway, then it would be sent back down for proper consideration of the Brady claim."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,869.554,871.354,"That's exactly correct, Your Honor, yes."
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.354,874.466,"So the Brady claim was still alive, but you didn't have to argue it in the court of appeals."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,874.466,874.957,Exactly.
1994.93-7901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,876.779,886.575,"Mr. O'Brien, going to the gateway standard, do you read Kuhlmann and Carrier as establishing or affirming equivalent tests?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,895.56,897.303,--I believe those are equivalent standards.
1994.93-7901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,901.554,909.812,"Is there a difference, at least as... taking the Carrier formulation, is there a difference between that and what might rise to the level of a Herrera claim?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,909.812,914.584,--Herrera is... yes.
1994.93-7901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,941.432,945.983,"But in any case, you'll settle for the Carrier formulation?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,945.983,948.705,"--I would settle for the Carrier formulation, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,948.705,956.732,"Isn't there going to be some awkwardness if we have two different standards, one for guilt and one for sentence?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,977.376,985.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, there is a phrase in your opinion in Sawyer that indicates that may be so, but I disagree."
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.988,1033.96,"But no matter how you come out, it seems to me, there is going to be an unavoidable complication if you have two standards, one for guilt and one for sentence, in a case like Sawyer, where the proof of arson was both an aggravating circumstance and an element of a crime."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1033.96,1051.264,"As I said, Your Honor, I believe that for Mr. Schlup's situation I think that it would not be too confusing, or too difficult, and there's always a cost involved in the exercise of habeas corpus jurisdiction."
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.133,1072.596,"Yes, but here we're talking about what standard are we going to require to prove innocence."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1086.267,1103.759,"Your Honor, I believe innocence of the crime and innocence of the sentence are two situations that require two standards, and this Court does not apply one uniform standard across the board whenever it devises a standard for harmless error, or prejudice, or in some other context."
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.975,1124.702,"Mr. O'Brien, whichever standard we use of the two, effectively there is no finality."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1140.401,1140.952,--Your Honor--
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1140.952,1143.433,That's contrary to what the common law used to be.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1151.797,1159.334,"--Your Honor, I disagree that having a miscarriage-of-justice standard will always frustrate finality."
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.389,1172.594,I don't understand how you can tell whether the standard is met without having a hearing on the facts of guilt or innocence.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1190.182,1196.877,"Your Honor, claims of innocence this strong are very rare, and I believe the circumstances that you describe would be very rare."
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.877,1199.298,"Regardless of how strong it is, you can't tell how strong it is until you have the hearing."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1199.298,1218.733,"There's a pleading standard, that I believe that the courts are capable of looking at pleadings and attachments and affidavits, as we did below, attached to the pleadings, that would allow the court to determine, on the basis of the pleading standard, whether or not this was a colorable claim that should be allowed to go forward."
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1218.733,1222.175,"They do it in motions, courts do it in motions for a new trial all the time."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1222.175,1246.519,"Yes, they do and, Your Honor, in this case, I believe in your observation in Sawyer you stated that in order to satisfy the Kuhlmann test a prisoner, in addition to the habeas, would have to tender to the court reliable, noncumulative, and admissible evidence, which we did with our petition for habeas corpus."
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1261.009,1263.914,"Mr. O'Brien, can I ask you a factual question that I don't quite understand--"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1263.914,1264.021,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1264.021,1264.492,--in the record?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1279.974,1280.164,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.164,1291.211,"Is that quote from his present affidavit, or is that from the interview with, the pretrial interview by the correction officials?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1291.211,1297.385,That quote is from a pretrial interview by the corrections officials about 3 days after the crime.
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.385,1300.426,And was that quote... he did not testify at the trial?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1300.426,1301.047,Correct.
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.047,1304.31,So that quote was not made a part of the record?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1304.31,1305.309,Exactly.
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.309,1307.182,"Now, was that quote made available to his counsel?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1309.843,1318.259,"The record is open to that, and the counsel... outside the record, the counsel cannot recall that quote being made available."
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1345.266,1346.528,No one except the corrections officers?

1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.549,1350.35,And then one other factual question.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1355.094,1370.342,"None whatsoever, and in fact control center officers say that it is not unusual at all that inmates would use that phone and make calls, and there's a speed dial process that is wired into one of two different control centers."
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1370.342,1372.856,"And one other question, then I'll be through."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1377.108,1378.149,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.946,1393.977,And your opponent contends in effect that he's lying in this particular statement.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1393.977,1394.638,"Correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.081,1428.962,Who was Mr. Green?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1428.962,1440.98,"--Mr. Green is the unit clerk in the housing unit who is the one who picked up the telephone and called the base when Roger Flowers ordered him to do so, and Mr. Flowers in a couple of points in this--"
1994.93-7901,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1440.98,1441.368,You say that.
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1447.032,1454.869,"--That's correct, and I believe... they have not introduced any evidence to show that Mr. Green did not make that call."
1994.93-7901,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1454.869,1459.771,Have you introduced evidence as to who received that call and what that person says?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1459.771,1474.801,"We have in the court below filed a Rule 60(b) motion with evidence that we discovered during executive clemency proceedings, and there is a corrections officer named Kerrs who received a call."
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1508.073,1513.997,Do you agree that it was Peoples that sent out the alarm that resulted in the police leaving the cafeteria?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1513.997,1515.079,"No, Your Honor, I do not."

1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1523.023,1527.055,"Well, what is your theory as to who could call the police from the cafeteria?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1528.497,1531.679,--Anyone with a telephone or a radio could make that call.
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1531.679,1533.669,Direct the police to leave?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1533.669,1534.911,Yes.
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1566.942,1568.231,"No, it doesn't seem to me that that's the point."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1571.714,1577.017,"--Correct, and was it Kerr or was it People?"
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.222,1603.106,You say that you were relying on depositions that were not available to the Eighth Circuit?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1603.106,1603.935,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.822,1614.403,So it had them at the time it prepared its opinion?
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1614.403,1615.284,"Yes, it did."
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.355,1647.335,"Is this the sort of arguments that Federal courts all over the country are supposed to hear, you know, recapitulating the sort of evidence that is ordinarily submitted to the jury on guilt or innocence in every one of these claims of actual innocence?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1647.335,1648.114,Your Honor--

1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1703.451,1736.721,"The ambivalence in the theory of your case, it seems to me, or the tension, is that you tell us that this is a most unusual case with compelling evidence of innocence, and yet you want us to adopt the lowest possible, or one of the lowest possible standards, colorable showing of innocence, and it seems to me if we adopt colorable showing of innocence then, as the Chief Justice indicates, this kind of inquiry, the most intrusive of all inquiries, relitigating the facts, is going to have to be done in every case."
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1736.721,1755.995,"Your Honor, the probability of innocence, I believe, is what the law is and what it should be, because a standard higher than that will not reach other innocent people, but Mr. Schlup's position is that we could prevail under any standard that is less demanding than Jackson v. Virginia."
1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1755.995,1758.987,You didn't prevail under clear and convincing in the circuit.

1994.93-7901,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.967,1774.568,"Well, you didn't prevail in the circuit under the clear-and-convincing standard, did you?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1774.568,1776.3,"--Not as applied in the circuit, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1776.3,1780.633,"Aren't you claiming that they didn't apply it, that in fact they applied Jackson?"
1994.93-7901,0,41834,sean_d_obrien,,1780.633,1781.874,Correct.
1994.93-7901,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.874,1785.147,"Thank you, Mr. O'Brien."

1994.93-7901,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1824.811,1827.233,"When did this crime take place, General Nixon?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1827.233,1830.344,--This crime took place in February of 1984.
1994.93-7901,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.344,1832.887,More than 10 years ago.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1832.887,1833.296,Yes.
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.296,1840.211,"You would agree, wouldn't you, that if Green is telling the truth, and if the officer... the new officer is telling the truth, then he is innocent?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1840.211,1841.941,"No, Your Honor, I would not."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.941,1842.702,You would not?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1842.702,1844.275,If Green is... if Green--
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.275,1850.897,"The officer who stopped him and frisked Schlup on the way to the dining hall, if he's telling the truth the guy has to be innocent."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1850.897,1852.019,"--No, Your Honor, I would not."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.761,1868.67,Right.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1868.67,1907.565,"--then you look at the videotape, and there is only 26 seconds between the time that that call was supposedly made by Green and the time that O'Neal comes into the cafeteria downstairs, and all of the evidence in this case shows it's impossible for O'Neal, the admitted murderer, who claims self-defense, to have stabbed, to have run down, as the uncontroverted evidence says, broken a window, thrown the knife out the window, come back, washed his hands, with other witnesses, including other corrections officers seeing him wash the hands, and go down to the cafeteria, if you hold Green's present statement as controlling, the murder never occurred."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.565,1911.499,"I'm saying as to when he made the phone call, not when the alarm went out."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1911.499,1916.631,"They are claiming, Your Honor, that it is contemporaneous, that somehow this phone call--"
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.631,1917.392,You're saying it has to be--
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1917.392,1918.782,"--is equivalent to a... excuse me, I'm sorry."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.782,1919.763,--You're saying it has to be more than 26 seconds.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1928.019,1933.621,"Your Honor, in no situation does this man have to be innocent, because the facts in this case are overwhelming."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1933.621,1935.304,What about Officer Flaherty's testimony?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1935.304,1936.724,Officer Faherty--
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1936.724,1937.835,"Faherty, whatever his name is."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1937.835,1938.276,--Excuse me.
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.147,1942.167,"No, but supposing what he's saying now is true."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1943.689,1944.471,--No.
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.642,1949.874,"Well, I understand."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1949.874,1950.856,Maylee and Flowers were.
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1956.447,1957.277,Right.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1957.277,1967.054,"He has broadened that time from 10 to 15 seconds, which he testified at trial, to now 4 to 5 minutes total for a period of time down there."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1985.567,1997.324,"But in Green's case, I take it your argument is not that the petitioner must be innocent if Green is telling the truth, but that Green couldn't be telling the truth because what he says is inconsistent with other evidence, isn't that your argument?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1997.324,1997.995,Yes--
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1997.995,1998.924,Okay.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1998.924,1999.595,--Justice Souter.
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1999.595,2014.546,"So if the evidence is going to be evaluated, and it were accepted, if Green were accepted and your argument for impossibility fails in the mind of the fact-finder, then the conclusion would follow that the petitioner was innocent?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2014.546,2019.027,"Yes, Your Honor, that is a possible analysis of it."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2031.427,2033.209,"Oh, no, I think I understand your argument."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2034.999,2035.339,Yes.
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2035.339,2050.629,Is it your theory of the case that time may have elapsed between the first notice to the base of a disturbance and the time that Peoples called for help?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2059.775,2064.408,The guards were prompted to leave the cafeteria by a call.
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2064.408,2065.029,What caused that?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2065.029,2065.94,The radio call.
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2067.09,2067.69,From whom?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2067.69,2068.851,We would--
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2068.851,2069.822,"I mean, your theory of the case?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2069.822,2071.981,"--Peoples, from the base."
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2071.981,2072.612,All right.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2072.612,2073.234,Under our theory--
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2073.234,2077.627,"And had he in turn received calls from, say, perhaps Green?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2078.987,2080.059,--Certainly it's possible.
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2088.204,2095.967,Was Green on a frequency that was different from the one that Peoples used to communicate to the guards in the cafeteria?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2095.967,2098.16,There's no evidence as to what frequency.
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2117.192,2117.743,To the base.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2117.743,2118.213,--to base.
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2129.851,2137.565,And there may have been a substantial delay between the time that call was made and the time the alert went out from base to the guards in the cafeteria?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2138.126,2139.157,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2150.905,2159.169,"Well, pardon me, is it your theory that the first time the base received any notice of an incident, that they called the guards in the cafeteria?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2159.169,2170.997,"--That was the deposition testimony of Peoples, who is very clear in saying that he received the radio call from Eberle, who had come up the steps, and that was the basis of his call."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.979,2253.932,Did he explain why he didn't put in this statement by Green if he had access to it?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2253.932,2255.003,"--No, he did not."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2255.003,2258.033,"Do we know that he read that statement, one way or another?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2258.033,2265.349,"The PCR motion and the statement by the counsel at that PCR motion would indicate that he had in his possession and ""reviewed"" all--"
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2265.349,2268.291,"Well, you say there are hundreds of depositions, a large volume of material."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2272.305,2272.764,--One hundred.
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.764,2276.777,And they wrote down what they said in those interviews?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2276.777,2277.707,One hundred individuals.
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.268,2278.736,I see.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2278.736,2279.207,They were all taped.
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.429,2285.812,"And he saw all that material, but you don't know whether he particularly focused on this statement by Green, do you?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2285.812,2287.094,"No, I do not know whether he did."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.094,2288.574,He didn't comment one way or another?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2288.574,2290.667,"No, he did indicate, and the trial court found--"
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2290.667,2290.938,That he had everything available.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2290.938,2291.806,--that he had it all.
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.806,2292.087,Yes.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2292.087,2299.623,"That it was all there, and it should be noted also that this was the third of the cases to be tried in a trilogy, and they had access to the trial transcripts of the first two trials."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.47,2314.863,"Let me ask your advice on one, or your help on one other word that I don't understand in the record."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2333.724,2340.399,"I'm not familiar with all the different jargon of the correctional officers in prison, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.819,2351.976,"He just, apparently... what I infer from it, I hope you'll correct me if I'm wrong, is that Basinger thought that was so improbable that he could have been at the head of the line, that he said, don't be parachuting on us."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2355.649,2360.732,"Your Honor, I don't know what the term means, and you're entitled to draw the inference you think is most appropriate."
1994.93-7901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2360.732,2368.676,"General Nixon, what is the status of the Missouri clemency proceeding?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2368.676,2381.046,"In this situation, Justice Ginsburg, a board of inquiry has been appointed, taken evidence, and is in the process of taking more evidence to present to the Governor of the State of Missouri."
1994.93-7901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2381.046,2384.368,So that's ongoing right now?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2388.341,2392.072,"Same status, yes, Justice."
1994.93-7901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2407.201,2409.685,That hasn't been stayed in any way because of this grant of cert?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2409.685,2411.936,There has been no stay in that whatsoever.
1994.93-7901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2432.519,2448.018,"And then my other question is, is it your position that the discussion of how strong this new evidence is is essentially academic because there's nothing behind the gate, and I'd like you to address that."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2464.079,2468.705,"Yes, Your Honor, we agree wholeheartedly that it is a gate that's tough to get through."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2498.361,2504.295,"Well, that may be right or it may be wrong, but that isn't what the appeal was concerned with, was it?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2509.871,2517.164,"--Yes, Your Honor, I would agree that the appeal dealt with the gateway issue, but the underlying claim of Brady was dealt with by that--"
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2517.164,2521.367,He's entitled to have an appeal on it if he gets through the door.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2521.367,2525.629,"--Yes, if he gets through the door, Your Honor, he's entitled... that's what the door gets him."
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2532.986,2536.626,But your position is that that has been reserved in the court of appeals?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2536.626,2538.979,"--Your Honor, I think--"
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2538.979,2544.843,"Your position is the petitioner has reserved the Brady claim in the court of appeals, in the event he wins on the standard point?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2544.843,2549.156,"--Yes, Your Honor, I believe that's what's behind the gateway, the Brady as well as the ineffective--"
1994.93-7901,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2549.156,2551.296,"And it's been preserved adequately in the court of appeals, in your view?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2551.296,2557.041,"--No, Your Honor, I'm not confident it's been preserved adequately in this particular matter."
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.439,2580.026,"General Nixon, do you, especially if we adopt the standard that you propose, do you really seriously think we're talking about a gateway here?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2606.103,2608.964,Your Honor--
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2608.964,2615.559,"It seems to me we either have to stop talking about gateways or stop talking about the high standard that you propose, one or the other."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2615.559,2618.481,"--Your Honor, I think that you can talk about both."
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.7,2654.235,"I would be astounded if that line held, really be astounded."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2654.235,2664.971,"I think another important point to make here in this case is that petitioner is arguing for two separate standards, and it doesn't make good sense from a policy or a precedent standpoint."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2695.982,2718.186,"But isn't it also the case that in any ultimate resolution of the penalty phase there is a kind of value judgment goes with it, that is made by the sentencer, which is different from the kind of factual discretion, or a discretion to find fact, which is the essence of the guilt phase determination?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2725.641,2738.239,"Justice Souter, I would admit that there is a subjective element to a jury making a determination between life in prison or death."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2739.05,2740.219,It's not merely subjective.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2742.863,2745.464,--Certainly.
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2745.464,2761.262,"I mean, at some point a determination must be made as to whether, for example, the aggravating circumstances and all the other evidence in the case merits a certain penalty or whether it doesn't, and that is a different kind of determination from the guilt determination, which in essence is what happened?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2761.262,2777.875,"That portion of it is, Your Honor, but the determination made under Sawyer of aggravating circumstance, of the objective proof necessary to prove an objective factor making someone eligible for the death penalty, is not, in your estimation, different from what's necessary to prove their guilt."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2777.875,2798.258,"That is in some cases going to be true, but the ultimate determination that has to be made in a Sawyer kind of case is a determination which must take into consideration the ultimate discretion to make a value judgment as distinct from the discretion to make a factual judgment."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2798.258,2798.979,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2798.979,2805.161,"And that's going to be true in every Sawyer case regardless of how the Sawyer case, particularly, is presented."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2805.161,2822.873,"Yes, Your Honor, unless you find that so narrow a holding of the Sawyer is that it just deals with capital cases just on the issue of death, but I think if you bring it to the context of penalty and guilt, and intermesh it into a system, that those same arguments are not strong."
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2822.873,2851.052,"General Nixon, you really, you don't want to quibble about the principle, you're just concerned about the standard, but you concede that, on a successive habeas claim, no matter how far down it may be, there has to be at least some possibility, under some standard, of reraising the claim of innocence?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2851.052,2855.624,"Yes, Your Honor, there would be some standard."
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.395,2857.947,What case of ours holds that?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2857.947,2865.952,"--One could argue the Sawyer standard, in dealing with successive and abusive, and setting a standard of clear and convincing, a case for that."
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.952,2876.028,"Well, what standard reaches a result that would not have been reached but for that possibility of being able to raise claims of innocence in subsequent habeas petitions?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2902.766,2905.68,"None that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2950.16,2951.381,"Excuse me, General."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2988.717,2991.398,"--One could read it that way, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2997.042,2998.762,Why is it--
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,2998.762,3000.965,"I don't mean hard to do, I just mean because... excuse me."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3000.965,3001.466,--Why is it difficult?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3015.915,3024.423,"I was relying... I was referring to the standard, Your Honor, not to the ultimate decision, which obviously they're fully capable of making, but the standard being so eerily close."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3024.423,3027.675,"Well, I was talking, one standard talks about reasonable doubt, one standard talks about innocence."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3034.358,3047.978,"If you draw that distinction, Your Honor, then it is much easier to come to the conclusion you did, but I would submit that the fair probability standard of Kuhlmann is difficult to ascertain, regardless of what words you put behind it."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3058.264,3062.127,"Well, the petitioner said that he would take the Carrier formulation."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3062.127,3064.909,"I appreciate that, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3064.909,3072.943,So your view on why that is not the one we should adopt is... why Carrier is not the standard we should adopt?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3072.943,3083.59,"It's that the Sawyer standard is better, Your Honor, and this Court upheld the Sawyer standard in Sawyer, and we argue that Sawyer applies already."
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.302,3137.846,"You think we should reward sand-bagging only when there's, what, compelling evidence of innocence?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3143.409,3143.409,"--No, Your Honor, I don't ever want to reward sand-bagging, and I think we should never reward sand-bagging."
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.409,3148.752,--draw that objection to the other standard.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3155.517,3161.5,"Well, Justice Scalia, I mean, we're arguing for the clear-and-convincing standard in this particular case."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3163.661,3172.607,Can you cite me to a case in which a lawyer ever said... I can't imagine a defense lawyer in a capital case withholding evidence of innocence because he might want to use it later.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3175.221,3188.722,"--In this case, Your Honor, the trial court, the district court, has held that the defendant themselves, himself, didn't present all evidence to his counsel, and therein the sand-bagging also--"
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.722,3189.332,Is that what you mean by sand-bagging?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3189.332,3190.422,"--Well, either one."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.422,3200.138,"I thought it was a tactical... sand-bagging referred to a tactical decision by a lawyer not to use evidence of innocence because he wants to use it later, and I just don't think it happens."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3203.911,3209.066,"I think the tactic does occur out there, justice."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3209.066,3214.928,Can you cite me a case in which any appellate court describes that having happened?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3214.928,3216.18,"No, Your Honor, I cannot."
1994.93-7901,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3216.18,3217.422,I certainly am not aware of any.
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3377.585,3379.157,"You're close, Your Honor."
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3396.348,3400.242,"And he was applying it to first habeas actually, wasn't he, in his article--"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3400.242,3400.663,I believe so--
1994.93-7901,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3400.663,3401.284,--Friendly?
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3401.284,3401.694,"--Your Honor, yes."
1994.93-7901,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3449.526,3454.398,"Though Kuhlmann doesn't apply to a first one, I take it Kuhlmann applies to the second, third, et cetera?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3454.398,3455.139,Yes.
1994.93-7901,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3485.109,3491.524,"Across the line, or were you conceding that the Friendly position is okay for the first habeas, but after that it's not?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3491.524,3493.674,"--Generally yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3506.674,3509.767,"But your concern, then, is not with the difficulty of the standard."
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3522.155,3525.057,That is one of the strong arguments for a high standard.
1994.93-7901,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3525.057,3533.342,"It's true, I mean, if the standard is too imprecise for round 2, it's too imprecise for round 1, and if it's okay for round 1, why isn't it okay for round 2?"
1994.93-7901,1,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3533.342,3537.325,"It's not precise enough, it's not high enough, and it's too close to the Strickland standard."
1994.93-7901,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3547.062,3548.578,"Thank you, General Nixon."
