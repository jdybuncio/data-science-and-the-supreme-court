1966.36,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.597,"Number 36, Duke Lee Lewis, petitioner versus the United States."
1966.36,0,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,16.003,19.614,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1617.106,1620.08,Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors.
1966.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1959.113,1962.077,Do I understand Mr. Spritzer you're not talking about the Fifth Amendment?
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1962.077,1962.682,Pardon?
1966.36,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1964.175,1965.248,Oh I misunderstood you entirely.
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1965.248,1973.648,I spoke briefly of the Fifth Amendment and then said that I don't see that there's any better Fourth Amendment contention.
1966.36,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1986.875,1997.669,"Well, would you mind repeating how you disposed of the Fifth Amendment point and if you stated it, I didn't follow you Mr. Spritzer."
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1997.669,2025.899,"Yes, I was arguing that one who makes a statement relating to the commission of a crime in the course of a face to face conversation, intending that the words he speaks and the acts he commits be heard and known to the other party is not being compelled to make an admission in the sense of the Fifth Amendment."
1966.36,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2025.899,2030.128,"Well, that's the waiver doctrine but it's a plenty kind of a waiver, isn't it?"
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2054.868,2057.547,"No, I wasn't speaking of it in terms of a waiver."
1966.36,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2063.478,2080.306,"Well, does -- you don't have to have a compulsion to invoke the Fifth Amendment, to you that is a very little, how can spies to invoke the Fifth Amendment, you don't have to have overt compulsion."
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2110.574,2118.443,There is no question that there is an element of deception in every conversation in which an undercover agent takes place.
1966.36,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2154.559,2157.048,"Well, that's the issue."
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2163.854,2171.851,"No, I am stating a position and I think I am supported by every case the Court has ever decided on this point."
1966.36,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2327.175,2331.255,"I have forgotten, in Trupiano, was there also an electronic device?"
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2331.255,2332.983,"No, there was not."
1966.36,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2448.098,2477.046,Do you think that you believe it makes any difference -- I know this was subject to debate between majority in dissent in Lopez and what is your view as to whether it makes any difference that a recording is made of this conversation between the government informer and the defendant?
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2477.046,2480.437,"Well, if it had been, none was in this case Your Honor I understand."
1966.36,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2480.437,2482.114,"Yes, it is."
1966.36,1,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2492.508,2519.522,"I would view that as a question quite separate Your Honor from the question of the legality of the entry and as to the admissibility of such a recording, the Government does indeed in those cases where the issue arises rely on the Lopez decision as was made there to Your Honor's in the Osborne case recently argued."
1966.36,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2749.959,2750.937,Mr. Klarfeld.
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,2750.937,2754.683,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.36,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2803.18,2806.346,"Well, just a minute Mr. Klarfeld."
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,2865.01,2872.058,"Well, before I answer Your Honor it's not clear on my mind as to how this government agent originally got into the house because, Your Honor --"
1966.36,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2872.058,2874.21,The crime has been committed.
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,2878.649,2879.422,Just investigating?
1966.36,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2879.422,2879.832,Yes.
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,2891.18,2892.82,"This is the neighbor, Your Honor?"
1966.36,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2892.82,2894.446,"The neighbor, yes."
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,2920.845,2942.259,"I'm afraid before I could fully answer the question Your Honor that I have to say that if the agent went there to investigate about something that happened across the way, he would not have, in my opinion serve probable cause at the outset, at the moment of going in to the house to make an arrest of this individual under those circumstances."
1966.36,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2947.968,2950.591,"Well, suppose he had to take the second illustration."
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,3006.96,3021.395,"Well, I feel under those circumstances, Your Honor if the occupant of the house knew when he invited this person into the house that this person was a government agent then he was dealing with him at arm's length and like in the Lopez case, he took matters into his own hands."
1966.36,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3027.593,3033.826,And your proposition really is something more than the unlawful entry on the house.
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,3047.923,3048.691,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.36,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3048.691,3052.579,And a disguise might create the necessity for the search warrant.
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,3052.579,3064.997,"Well, in part Your Honor but in this instance, I respectfully call Your Honor's attention, there was ample time and ample evidence to get this search warrant and the failure to do so under these circumstances is one of the thrust of the petitioner's argument, Your Honor."
1966.36,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.997,3086.57,"Well, I wonder that he did get the search warrant whether your problem really would be solved because the source of the probable cause to get a warrant is the agent's misrepresentation over the telephone when he talked to him on the phone and the invites him over because he really thinks he's an ordinary potential customer."
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,3104.091,3107.716,"Well, Your Honor, I agree with you in one instance."
1966.36,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3120.229,3123.497,"Well, yes but what if he relies on the phone call for the probable cause."
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,3137.831,3143.078,"Well, then the question becomes as to the sufficiency of the probable cause."
1966.36,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.078,3147.191,"The cause is sufficient, it just happens to be barred by the Fourth Amendment on your argument."
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,3147.191,3163.459,"I wouldn't say so, Your Honor completely because you see in addition to having personal knowledge the agent by making the phone call, he also had information from Ritchie Gold and this particular defendant had been a suspect for over a year prior to the time he went to the house, Your Honor."
1966.36,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3185.439,3236.598,"Mr. Klarfeld, if your position is sustained, would it not be possible for all of the narcotic violators of the country to operate in a building where they had established a bed and a dresser and perhaps a few personal articles and call that their home and then operate inviting people to come there and then do so with a feeling of absolute security that no one who came to that establishment and dealt with him could possibly be one who is going to involve him with the law."
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,3236.598,3253.913,"Mr. Chief Justice, to answer your question, if all the narcotics people were to confine themselves to a single dwelling this would be the greatest boom to the Government law enforcement agents because if the Government points out in their brief 90% -- that is prevalent and most of these sales takes place on the street."
1966.36,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3280.752,3281.345,Yes.
1966.36,2,41592,s_myron_klarfeld,,3285.069,3290.436,They could do that but it would be the worst thing in the world for him because they would get caught.
1966.36,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3290.436,3292.469,Very well.
