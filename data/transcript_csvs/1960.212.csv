1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,65.952,68.598,A Wherry housing project.
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,147.901,163.079,"Would you mind telling in greater detail the effect, namely, what it is before you get to the holding, what it is and who is -- what it is that was taxed against whom it was taxed?"

1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,750.282,768.118,"Mr. Iverson, your complaining here that this Wherry's interest attached at -- the base of the rate, the base rate of Wherry property is higher than the base rate of other taxable properties in Washington, isn't it?"
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,768.118,769.441,Different and higher.
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,769.46,784.043,"Now, since your Supreme Court interpreted the Offutt decisions the way it did, has there been any decision by your court that they wouldn't be equally applied at measuring throughout the non-Wherry interests?"
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,784.043,785.071,"No, there has not, Your Honor."
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,785.071,791.948,"Well, how can we tell that they haven't changed their mind and therefore, you've been treated, and tomorrow they (Inaudible)"

1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,791.969,807.078,What you're saying is that judged by the prior rulings of your statement reenforce the application for the -- the basis of taxation in this assessment of this case operates discriminatorily.
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,807.962,808.648,The Court did not --
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,808.648,815.304,"But non (Inaudible) that today, they wouldn't measure it by the same equal hand as non-Wherry property?"
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,815.304,819.387,The Court did not undertake to reverse any of those cases.
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,819.387,820.386,But it doesn't have to.
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,820.386,826.504,"The Court has, in fairly recent times, reaffirmed that long line of decisions."
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,826.504,830.479,What did they do with that in the case in which they applied Offutt?
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,843.517,847.437,"Well, I think those aren't exactly the words, Your Honor, but I think that's the effect of it."
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,847.437,848.615,"Well, I don't mean the effect."
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,848.615,848.742,I think what --
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,848.742,849.666,But that maybe --
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,849.666,859.804,"About what they said was that we are going to make this uniform throughout the country, and we feel that we are guided by the United States Supreme Court on this."
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,885.746,897.758,But you -- you candidly said a minute ago that it's applied to the same standard for non-Wherry property you couldn't make a claim of discrimination.
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,897.758,905.967,I think that's right but I don't think there's any question in the world that they never have and that nobody has contended that they're going to.
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,905.976,907.714,Did they here?
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,907.714,909.298,"Here, they certainly did."
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,934.357,940.306,But this isn't -- this isn't (Inaudible)

1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,941.154,944.01,"What we have here is the Ninth Circuit case, haven't we?"
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,944.01,945.745,That's what we've taken in this effort.
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,967.266,968.19,Where is that?
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,975.755,976.716,That's right.
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,979.12,979.664,Where are they?

1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1012.158,1013.867,"Well, I don't think the Court ever said that."
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1031.679,1032.57,I'm going to give you -- I've --
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1032.57,1033.699,-- in all of the cases.
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1033.699,1038.755,-- I've said what I said to give you a time to point us to that finding.
1960.212,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1038.824,1040.061,I would like to ask you a question.
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1046.474,1046.993,"Well, I think it is a matter --"
1960.212,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1046.993,1048.065,It's limited to one question.
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1048.065,1064.173,"-- I think it is -- as the matter comes up on the -- on the writ, it is assumed that the Circuit Court of Appeals was correct in making its finding that the -- that the discrimination did exist."

1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1075.715,1075.973,No.
1960.212,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1079.023,1089.959,"well, I didn't say we have, I say if we have brought in abstract questions which we don't have to decide in this (Inaudible)."
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1089.959,1137.092,"The -- the -- on page 354 of the record, the Court said, this is the Circuit Court, the trial court's further finding that a different method was used in (Inaudible) the Wherry Act leaseholds here and question is also correct likewise to be sustained as the Court's finding that the method used in assessing the Moses Lake leasehold resulted in a higher tax and would have been true in the case of a non-Wherry Act leasehold."
1960.212,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1184.906,1185.978,May I interrupt you again?

1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1382.944,1383.257,Well --
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1383.257,1384.523,The question whether it's raised.
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1388.519,1389.954,What happens to my client?
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1415.036,1417.651,You mean that this case was decided against it?
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1417.651,1418.4,"Oh, no."
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1421.526,1422.912,What tax now do you pay?

1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1431.076,1431.98,How much is this?
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1431.98,1434.309,"That runs to about $90,000 roughly, yes."
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1434.309,1441.85,What -- what would it be if they had assessed you on the basis that they assess other people who do not apply leaseholds (Voice Overlap) --
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1441.85,1457.608,"Had they assessed us on that basis it, probably, would -- would not run over about $10,000 because our -- our property, our actual value, our actual equity is -- is pretty small in here."
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1457.608,1467.121,"If I understand your claim, is it this, that in -- in the State of Washington, they assess only the equitable value to some --"

1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1468.382,1469.511,"Yes, of a leasehold."
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1469.511,1470.548,That's -- that's correct.
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1471.662,1472.502,I understood.
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1472.502,1479.838,Everyone else besides Wherry households -- Wherry leaseholders in assessing a lease.
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1488.12,1490.232,That is the value less the mortgage.
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1490.232,1490.706,That's right.
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1490.706,1491.531,What is the mortgage?
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1491.531,1492.094,The value?
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1492.094,1492.107,Yes.
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1492.107,1493.157,About $6 million.
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1493.157,1493.644,How much?
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1493.644,1494.803,About $6 million.
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1494.803,1495.915,And what's the --
1960.212,0,34631,lyle_l_iverson,,1495.915,1496.05,It's about --
1960.212,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1496.05,1498.899,-- what's the assess valuation that Washington (Voice Overlap) --

1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1547.179,1549.242,I disagree with Mr. Iverson.
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1562.004,1564.862,Was that the position you took in the Court of Appeals?
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1564.862,1566.821,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1566.821,1572.445,"In other words, you deny that they decided this on the right bench."
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1575.583,1576.22,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1577.637,1580.031,I'm not talking about that the -- I hardly said there was.
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1596.573,1606.914,"The court below merely stated that a different method of valuation was used for Wherry housing, and that they did not say that in such in dollars and cents, there was any discrimination."

1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1614.126,1614.635,That's right.
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1615.138,1618.662,Is that true?
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1620.824,1622.128,"No, we did not."
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1622.128,1622.632,You did not.
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1622.632,1623.959,Well --
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1623.959,1628.447,But why did they decide it this way if you deny that and the others asserted it?
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1628.447,1631.759,I cannot explain the reasoning of the Circuit Court --

1960.212,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1648.709,1649.377,Alright.

1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1664.05,1664.473,"Yes, we can."
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1664.473,1671.46,"I cannot understand how they possibly could decide this case if they did, if you had presented the argument you're now presenting."
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1671.46,1685.342,"Well, it appears to Grant County that the Court merely on its -- had so to speak on -- on the res judicata issue and since that would apply, they went on to the other matter."

1960.212,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1700.782,1700.99,I beg your pardon.
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1700.99,1717.078,Was there any evidence for them in any court to show what was the basis on which you imposed this in connection with Wherry housing? What was the basis on which you imposed if you claim this tax?
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1728.886,1730.488,"Generally speaking, that is right, Your Honor."
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1731.609,1733.875,You do that for homeowners?
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1733.875,1734.716,Yes.
1960.212,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1734.716,1735.804,You do it for everybody.
1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1735.804,1737.132,Yes.

1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,1925.009,1932.108,We do not want to do that in a Wherry housing because the improvements do not last in term of the lease.

1960.212,1,38039,paul_a_klasen,,2134.406,2149.563,"Well, because the Secretary of the Air Force, under Section 511, has claimed that they have offset the taxes by granting services which be -- would be covered under the taxes."
