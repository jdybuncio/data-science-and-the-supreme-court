2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.059,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 06-1265, Klein & Co. Futures v. Board of Trade of the City of New York."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,10.121,36.017,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A clearing futures commodity merchant, an FCM, such as Petitioner, has standing to sue contract markets and clearing organizations of contract markets under Section 25 (b)(1) of the act for their bad faith failure to enforce rules that are required by the act and by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,106.519,110.643,"Mr. Days, can I interrupt you there, and ask, if you would--"
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,110.643,111.205,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.205,133.775,--if you would define the transactions... the particular transactions on which you rely to come within that provision and what rules of the exchange or the clearinghouse do you say was violated?
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,133.775,160.419,"Justice Ginsburg, we view this as several subsidiary transactions that ultimately end in the consummation of the contract, but with respect to the rules that we have in mind... first of all Rule 6 (a) talks about... that can be found in the blue brief at 1a... that such contract executed or consummated by or through a member of such contract market."
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.417,288.073,You think you--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,288.073,288.464,I think--
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,288.464,302.222,"--You've talked about the transaction, but I also ask you, what were the rules that the Defendants violated, the rules of the statute?"
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,302.222,316.888,"--Well, it's... it is clear, as I indicated with respect to the rule of the contract market, that the clearing FCM is required to clear that particular order or contract."
2007.06-1265,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,352.748,353.404,I think--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,353.404,357.06,"The cause of action, we understand, requires that there be a showing of bad faith."
2007.06-1265,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,357.06,366.15,"--Is... I don't want to reduce the issue down to something too simplistic, but is there a rule that says don't lie, don't commit fraud?"
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,366.15,367.258,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.444,414.554,Am I... am I right that we really do not have to--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,414.554,414.849,Excuse me?
2007.06-1265,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,414.849,419.706,--Am I correct that we really do not have to determine that issue this morning?
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,419.706,420.642,What--
2007.06-1265,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,420.642,431.17,All we have to determine is whether it is possible for the Petitioner here to be within the class of those with standing?
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,431.17,431.514,--Absolutely.
2007.06-1265,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,431.514,432.014,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,432.014,432.701,"This is a standing case, sir."
2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,432.701,449.881,"Mr. Days, suppose that the exchange has a standard sort of nondiscrimination provision with respect to employment practices, and it... an employee asserts that she was discriminated against in the promotion review."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,452.725,453.27,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,472.576,482.618,"Well, I suppose the transaction would be her annual employment review that she alleges violated the exchange rule saying the exchange would not discriminate on the basis of sex."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,482.618,488.086,--I don't believe that that would be a transaction on or subject to the rules of the contract market.
2007.06-1265,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,497.971,512.061,"But suppose, to narrow that hypothetical, that there's a rule that you can't be an employee of the clearinghouse or the exchange if you have a conviction for fraud, and they don't... they're negligent and careless about enforcing that rule and that fraud causes the loss."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,519.681,529.943,"Well, the statute itself talks about the responsibilities of the contract market or the clearing organization."
2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,538.721,544.983,"So... so, the transaction has some substantive limitation that is derived from where?"
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,544.983,552.48,"Well, it's derived from the statute, if one looks at Rule 2(i) in the statute."
2007.06-1265,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.877,587.045,But in my hypothetical there is a transaction and there are actual damages... I'm reading from... from (b)(c).
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,596.65,600.008,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I want to focus on transaction."
2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,623.67,625.748,"Well, why aren't these ancillary rules?"
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,641.148,653.456,"Well, it is a broad definition, but it focuses on the process of the execution and consummation of the contract, not matters that are unrelated."
2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,666.249,671.279,These people... you mean the ones in our hypotheticals.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,671.279,671.996,That's correct.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.996,683.538,"Can I ask you... I find it difficult... I'm finding it difficult to follow the exact language on page 4a of the appendix, of (b)(1)(C)."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,703.765,704.061,Right.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.061,711.105,"Now, a clearing organization that doesn't enforce a bylaw properly or a rule or reg properly, which is what you're saying happened?"
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,711.105,713.886,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,713.886,715.151,The clearing organization got all mixed and it all--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,715.151,715.605,Correct.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,715.605,722.649,"--Now, they're liable for actual damages to a person who engaged in a transaction in a contract market."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,727.335,727.897,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,727.897,728.647,Not the clearing organization.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,728.647,729.724,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.724,743.281,And they're liable to that person for the actual losses that resulted from his transaction in the futures exchange... as such transaction.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,743.281,744.077,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.077,750.965,So what your claim... they were caused by the failure of the clearinghouse to follow its rules.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,750.965,751.371,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,751.371,764.194,"If they just read that, we have a case where the clearing organization didn't follow its rules the... my client engaged in a transaction over the futures exchange."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,764.194,764.694,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,764.694,768.756,And it was caused harm because the clearing organization didn't follow its rules.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,771.02,771.536,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,771.536,772.504,And that's what happened?
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,772.504,773.425,Correct.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,773.425,775.191,Did I understand that correctly?
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,775.191,775.862,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.652,791.355,Clearing organization.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,791.355,791.667,--clearing organization.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,791.667,794.025,"I know, but then the response I'm going to ask them is, so what?"
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,794.025,800.914,"Well, I think that is... ""so what"" is a proper response, I'm glad you said it rather than I, that--"
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,800.914,802.617,I know you're going to... but I--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,802.617,820.11,"--We have... we have, we think, standing with respect to a transaction that occurred on the contract market even if the Respondents' argument is persuasive that it didn't happen on the clearing organization or subject to the rules of the clearing organization."
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,820.11,827.637,It would be an argument for this case because that absence has been cured.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,833.635,834.635,That's correct.
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,834.635,840.258,--the list to registered entity and which does include clearinghouse.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,840.258,840.57,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,841.241,841.741,So--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,841.741,842.413,--Yes?
2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,842.413,852.144,"--The concern on the other side, I take it, is that it's not just limited to transactions on the exchange, but transactions subject to the rules of a contract market."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,883.959,890.566,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are limitations with respect to 25(b)(1)."
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,915.04,920.897,"--Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're going to be more favorable to this than I expect your opponent."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,947.825,948.793,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,948.793,953.511,"And so they said well, by odd fluke of fate, your clients didn't."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,972.566,973.877,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,974.455,974.862,He--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,974.862,975.393,--that is right.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,975.393,988.105,--He guaranteed through the clearinghouse the payment of the contract made on the futures exchange--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,988.105,988.495,That's correct.
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,988.495,990.87,"--which he didn't make, but he guaranteed it."
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,990.87,993.213,"Well, that's not correct."
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,993.213,994.274,He made it.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,994.274,995.915,"Well, that's not correct, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1265,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,996.79,999.133,He didn't walk on to the floor and make it.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1003.99,1005.739,"--Well, it's hard to know who walks on what floor."
2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1032.727,1033.306,No.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1060.951,1068.196,We don't argue that investors are barred from bringing suits under 25(b)(1).
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1075.054,1081.208,Didn't Judge Friendly refer to the FCM as a central player or a principal in--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1081.208,1081.911,Yes.
2007.06-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.517,1099.076,What is the transaction... what is the single transaction that you think brings your client within this language?
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1099.076,1099.701,"--Well, I mentioned--"
2007.06-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1099.701,1101.73,"What is the transaction, the guarantee?"
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1101.73,1112.32,--The one... the contract market requires that the clearing FCM clear a contract with one hour... assume the contract.
2007.06-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.55,1123.191,I'm not talking about what the rule is that was violated.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1136.279,1155.24,"Well, Your Honor, as indicated, the transaction is the process of assuming this contract and then going toward the clearing... clearing organization to clear it, and it's the clearing organization, setting the settlement price, which really dictates what happens on the clearing organization."
2007.06-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1159.816,1162.596,The transaction does not require two parties?
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1162.596,1163.94,"Well, there are two parties here."
2007.06-1265,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.94,1164.69,You have a one-party transaction?
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1164.69,1185.277,"There is a... we can view this as one sole transaction, as one transaction with a number of subsidiary activities along the process between execution and consummation, or one can view various transactions that ultimately end up with the consummation of the contract."
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1185.277,1185.978,--Why isn't it just--
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1185.978,1187.447,I don't think it makes any difference one way or another.
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1187.447,1201.863,"--the guarantee, the relationship between the clearing organization and the clearinghouse... the clearing organization has to give a guarantee and has to put up margin?"
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1201.863,1202.191,That's correct.
2007.06-1265,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1202.191,1206.72,So there is a transaction between the clearinghouse and the clearing organization.
2007.06-1265,0,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,1206.72,1207.579,"Oh, absolutely."
2007.06-1265,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1214.217,1217.357,"Mr. Days, we'll give you a minute for rebuttal."
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1217.951,1242.393,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For purposes of this case, the Court may assume that the word 25(b)(1) is limited to the purchase and sale of futures and options contracts."
2007.06-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1251.092,1253.171,Where... where do all of those assumptions come from?
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1262.463,1273.209,"--When I say ""assume"", I am saying that the Court need not decide at this point how far, if at all, beyond the core transactions that occur on contract markets the statute breaches."
2007.06-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1303.619,1308.648,"--So we have to figure out what was the core of Congress's concern and limit ""transaction"" in that way?"
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1308.648,1318.331,"I think the Court can at least start from the assumption that Congress referred to transactions on, or subject to, the rules of the contract market."
2007.06-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1324.704,1327.327,But they would be subject to the rules of the contract market.
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1327.327,1327.765,They would be subject to the rules.
2007.06-1265,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1403.409,1414.124,"What about the argument that if we accept your view of it, allowing the FCM to sue, then there could be multiple liability?"
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1414.124,1416.387,I think that's incorrect.
2007.06-1265,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1464.947,1477.427,"Well, when you began by saying we could begin... we could assume certain things, was it included in the things that we could assume... was it the proposition that the transaction was limited to a purchase or sale?"
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1477.427,1486.689,"A purchase or sale, although we would extend... I mean we would interpret the clearing process as part of the purchase or sale."
2007.06-1265,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1512.568,1519.129,Is that different from saying under the exchange rule the FCM is actually the party that enters into the trade.
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1519.129,1537.763,"I think it is a different thing and there are two different bases on which the Court could rule in our favor, that is, Rule 306(i)(2) of the rules of the exchange that were in effect at the time of these trades specified that... and that's reproduced, I guess, at page 14a of the blue brief."
2007.06-1265,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1627.01,1627.976,Mr. Stewart--
2007.06-1265,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1627.976,1633.257,Is that why the Second Circuit was wrong in saying it was just like a securities broker?
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1633.257,1633.945,Yes.
2007.06-1265,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1697.046,1701.153,"--Mr. Stewart, may I go back to the question of multiple recoveries."
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1753.366,1759.551,I'm not sure if I... if I fully understand the hypothetical.
2007.06-1265,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1759.551,1761.394,It may be that I don't understand how it works.
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1761.394,1768.641,"To answer a variant of it, I think there could be cases in which both the customer and the clearing FCM recovered something."
2007.06-1265,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1796.724,1800.91,"But in my hypo, the FCM is claiming damages because his business folds."
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1814.872,1818.371,If you assume that consequential damage is arising out of the loss of the business--
2007.06-1265,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1818.371,1818.668,Right.
2007.06-1265,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1819.34,1827.617,"--could be part of actual losses, then there would be no barrier to each party, the clearing FCM and the customer recovering what it actually lost."
2007.06-1265,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1846.876,1847.749,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1865.071,1879.362,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to return to the language of the statute, because I think it explains why the comments that Mr. Stewart started with are, in fact, compelled by the language of the statute."
2007.06-1265,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.066,1927.204,"Well, but under that reading they should have used the word ""and"" rather than ""or""."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1927.204,1928.829,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1265,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1928.829,1933.452,Or which is subject to.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1933.452,1948.461,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think what Congress was explaining there is it wasn't saying any transaction subject to the rules of a contract market, because that would be all of the Court's hypotheticals and discrimination and everything else, and the word ""on"" wouldn't be there."
2007.06-1265,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1978.184,1979.667,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,1992.255,1993.021,--Yes.
2007.06-1265,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1999.628,2006.735,"The fact that Congress put ""on"" in there and then followed it with ""or"" means you don't have to worry what ""on"" means if you're subject to the rules of the contract market."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2006.735,2008.921,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1265,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2025.632,2026.664,This is like ejusdem generis argument.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2033.599,2034.192,No.
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.876,2054.342,"But even if it's a term of art, do you contend that client was not engaged in a transaction subject to the rules."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2054.342,2054.81,"Yes, we do."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.21,2073.364,"What is the scope of the term ""transaction"" in your view?"
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2074.473,2082.533,It covers the trade... the contract that occurs at the pit at the moment... during open when one--
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.533,2092.404,"In fact between either the buyer or the seller and the clearinghouse, not the clearinghouse, the FCM or whatever?"
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2092.404,2096.559,"--Well, FCMs may or may not be involved."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2118.439,2120.892,And who are the parties to the transaction?
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2120.892,2125.797,"--The parties to that transaction are the buyer and seller, the customers, the people that the--"
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2125.797,2130.982,And the intermediaries are not subject to the transaction either though they are liable either for the purchase rights or the sale rights?
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2130.982,2131.669,--Yes.
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.669,2134.121,They are not parties to the transaction.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2134.121,2135.043,They are not parties to the transaction.
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2135.043,2136.996,But you can expose them to millions of dollars in liability.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2136.996,2140.119,"At the moment, Your Honor, they may not even be identified."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.994,2146.413,But they are subject to liability if the transaction doesn't... isn't consummated.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2146.413,2148.787,--Under the rules of the clearing organization.
2007.06-1265,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2149.224,2154.691,But the... the buy and the sell contract will be worth nothing if it isn't cleared.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2154.691,2167.858,"Well, it could... what the clearing process does after the... after that contract is formed is to eliminate, to provide a way to strip out the credit risk that ordinarily wouldn't be there."
2007.06-1265,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2167.858,2168.296,I know.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2177.775,2181.337,"No, Your Honor, we don't believe that the contract is a nullity."
2007.06-1265,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2198.829,2201.687,So they had to pick it up in an hour.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2201.687,2206.452,"Well, it has to be cleared in an hour to go through the clearing process."
2007.06-1265,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.452,2206.702,Fine.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2284.64,2286.452,"Well, let me first point out, Your Honor, it's not an unusual case."
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2328.624,2367.529,"Mr. Pincus, if your view were correct it would have been so easy for Congress to say ""buyers and sellers"" or even ""trade"", but it used a word ""transaction"" that you say has a special meaning in this context, but ""transaction"" appears all through the law and usually it's a term that has encompassing meaning, like in the Federal rules ""any transaction or occurrence"", and you would say that Congress has given it here this very constrained meaning."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2367.529,2370.232,"We do say that, Your Honor."
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2435.345,2438.359,Why didn't it just say sustained by a buyer or seller?
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2448.606,2454.259,"Well, because it... it would have to talk about--"
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2454.259,2462.425,"When everything else is the same, instead of ""a person"", just ""buyer and seller""."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2462.425,2470.781,"--Well, because then in the... several lines down it talks about actual loss and it would have to say buyers and sellers there as well."
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2471.359,2472.33,I don't know why.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2472.33,2476.11,"--Well, it would be referring back to buyer or seller."
2007.06-1265,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2510.143,2512.252,Where is the clear... there is no clear definition.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2517.235,2524.404,"--Well, there is no definition of transaction, Your Honor, but in the definitions of floor trader and floor broker, the phrase"
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2544.692,2551.876,Are they persons engaged in contracts subject to the rules... are they persons engaged in transactions subject to the rules?
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2551.876,2555.265,"--No, Your Honor, we don't... we don't think they are, because they are acting as--"
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.265,2556.984,Who are subject to the rules in your view?
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2561.091,2565.293,"--Well, certainly a floor trader is because that's someone who is trading for his own account."
2007.06-1265,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2578.179,2584.737,"Neither are they the person who can end up personally liable, and... I mean, they don't have... they are not subject to margin calls."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2591.501,2599.53,"Well, those people also have... well, the... the floor broker is not subject to a margin call."
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2605.934,2615.944,You recognize that the Second Circuit was wrong when it said that this FCM is just like a securities broker.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2622.41,2638.732,"Well, Your Honor, if that was all the Second Circuit said, I would agree with you that would be wrong, but the Second Circuit recognized that the... Klein here had a risk, a credit risk because it had backed up the credit of its customer, Eisler, and that's why in the lessons learned report that the CFTC--"
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2638.732,2639.732,But it's not just Klein.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2642.231,2645.261,--That is the job of the clearing member of what an FCM does.
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2645.261,2656.085,So that's not... not comparable to just a broker who executes my order for shares and gets a commission for it.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2656.085,2680.794,"No, Your Honor, but as the Second Circuit went on to note, the fact that there is a credit risk here, that Klein is taking a risk based on the credit of his customer Eisler... as the CFTC noted, there is nothing in the rules that require clearing members to only accept minimum margin, and it's the job of a clearing member to... to look into both the credit-worthiness of its customers and the risks of the various transactions that are open and demanding more margin."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2680.794,2688.151,"I was under the impression from the briefs, and maybe I'm wrong, that you did not defend the reasoning of the Second Circuit."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2688.946,2703.799,"Well, we don't... to the extent Petitioners claim that the Second Circuit based its reasoning on... on the imputation into 25(b) of the limitations in 25(a), we don't agree with that."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2703.799,2706.798,Which was the principal basis for its decision.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2706.798,2715.264,"But there was a second basis to its decision, which talked about the fact that Klein didn't engage in trading, and we agree with that basis because that's what we're arguing here."
2007.06-1265,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2715.264,2732.789,"Well, on that subject and you... your client obviously has an institutional interest in the case, assuming you don't prevail, is the government's theory much broader and more undesirable in your view than that offered in Klein brief?"
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2739.55,2743.299,"Well, it... it certainly would be better if the phrase"
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2829.827,2831.155,Mr. Pincus--
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2831.155,2831.7,And that's where--
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2831.7,2834.247,--Justice Kennedy was asking you about the government's position.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2857.379,2863.673,"--Yes, although obviously the parties haven't briefed the current law."
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2866.626,2868.359,That's what I thought your position was.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2870.124,2870.608,--No.
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2870.608,2871.468,--characterization.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2871.468,2871.843,No.
2007.06-1265,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2885.508,2893.879,"But you're saying that because a trade is on or subject to, the only thing that can be on or subject to is a trade."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2912.545,2916.794,Because... because trades are the only thing that fit those two criteria.
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2933.599,2934.896,But even if the--
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2934.896,2937.598,--that are the equivalent of trades but can occur off-market.
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2937.598,2944.189,"--But, Mr. Pincus, even if you limit it to the word ""trades"", it does not necessarily follow that the only parties to the trade are the original buyer and the original seller."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2948.234,2951.842,"I agree, Your Honor, and that's the second part of our argument."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2958.059,2959.434,Does it include this transaction?
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2959.434,2977.676,"--Well, we believe that it... there are... at the pit, again, that the transaction, the on transaction, the transaction that occurs on, is the open outcry transaction where, in this case, Eisler made an offer and some other floor trader accepted it, and that was complete there."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2982.331,2982.893,Why do you say--
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2982.893,2983.487,They come in later.
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2983.487,2985.909,--Why do you say that Klein had no role in it?
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2988.47,2989.564,It was a subsequent party.
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2990.953,2995.606,"Before it was completed he participated, he was... he functioned as a guarantor."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,2995.606,3004.073,"--Well, it was not... it need not be clear at the moment of that the trade is executed at the pit who the clearing member will be."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3005.853,3007.351,It was cleared by the time it was over.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3007.351,3009.898,"No... well, it depends what you mean by ""over"", Your Honor."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.097,3025.219,"There is no distinction between A and D, but before it can be consummated B and C have to play a role."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3025.219,3028.171,"--Well, that activity is over."
2007.06-1265,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.501,3074.045,"That's true, but is there any reason that the word ""transaction"" would have... serves a purpose by being so limited?"
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3074.045,3075.373,"It does, Your Honor."
2007.06-1265,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.373,3078.059,What... what Congress would Congress have wanted to do that?
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3078.059,3087.711,"In... because in the environment that Congress was operating just following this Court's decision in Curran, the focus entirely was on protecting investors."
2007.06-1265,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.711,3088.665,That's not a reason.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3112.561,3113.295,Because--
2007.06-1265,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3113.295,3114.873,And that also is linguistically possible.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3116.56,3117.825,--The harm that will--
2007.06-1265,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3117.825,3119.168,--if the second is chosen and not the first?
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3119.168,3123.244,"--The harm... two categories of harm: First, a lack of clarity."
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3136.63,3145.111,"But the only one that has this relationship that's different from an ordinary broker, the only one is the FCM."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3145.111,3161.666,"But that's true, Your Honor, but if the Court were to adopt a rule that says we're going to read ""transaction"" broadly, and so anyone who has anything to do with any aspect of the trade, either before it or afterward, is covered, all of these antecedent people, just in terms of the statutory language, are people who have a role."
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3161.666,3162.979,But they're not people who are at risk.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3180.862,3184.36,But it's hard to see in the language where Congress would have drawn the line.
2007.06-1265,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3193.934,3194.246,I got that.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3194.246,3194.574,--Okay.
2007.06-1265,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3194.574,3195.449,I got that when you said there were two.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3196.542,3200.51,"Well, let me just add to the... to the first that there are subsequent activities."
2007.06-1265,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3215.223,3220.377,The answer would be that those transactions are not subject to the rules of the exchange.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3220.377,3221.314,"--Well, they are--"
2007.06-1265,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3221.314,3226.795,They don't care what kind of arrangement the FCM might have with its bank.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3229.716,3233.356,"--But it has to have an arrangement, and that fact is a rule of the exchange."
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3233.356,3233.747,Is there some--
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3233.747,3234.012,So it depends what rule.
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3234.793,3235.84,--Mr. Pincus--
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3235.84,3237.214,--on the rule where we're not going to know what the answer is.
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3237.214,3251.691,"--The... the agency that's supposed to be the supervisor of this area, the CFTC, is taking the position that the government presented to us today."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3267.045,3277.635,"Well, I think it does have that concern, Justice Ginsburg, which is why Mr. Stewart said that the Court should sort of take this case on certain assumptions because, as he recognized, the theory that even the government put forward in its brief--"
2007.06-1265,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3277.635,3286.694,"I thought that what he was telling us was that, even if you assume that Klein has that, even if you've assume that."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3286.694,3304.764,"--Well, it's certainly their position that Klein has standing, but in terms of the consequences of a ruling by the Court that the statute goes beyond the core activity, I think the government's suggestion sort of shows that even the government is not sure, once you embark on that exercise, where the boundary line is."
2007.06-1265,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3309.107,3311.652,--I think you still owe Justice Breyer his second reason.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3311.652,3319.571,"I do, Your Honor, and the second reason is involved in the government's response to Justice Souter's question about multiple recoveries."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3370.02,3376.735,"Aren't there lots of situations in which a various... serious... harms a whole bunch of people, and they all recover?"
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3376.735,3380.905,"--There are, Justice Stevens, but this is a particular kind of industry."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.414,3409.676,"You would agree if the client had been trading on its own account with a scalper, it would have been able to recover for the... for its loss to itself; right?"
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3409.676,3410.612,"--Yes, if it had been trading for its own account."
2007.06-1265,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3410.612,3415.908,"If it's trading for itself and some for other customers, it only can recover half of those."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3416.641,3419.577,"Yes, it does, because Klein is a market insider."
2007.06-1265,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3458.343,3466.184,"Are there instances where multiple parties who are injured sue under state law, or is this generally deemed preemptive, or it just doesn't happen, or--"
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3466.184,3466.918,"Well, there are options."
2007.06-1265,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3489.018,3494.656,"Mr. Pincus, will you satisfy me on one point."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3507.59,3508.604,"--Well, it does."
2007.06-1265,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3541.966,3549.244,"Why wouldn't it have been enough to just say ""transactions on"" if that was their meaning?"
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3549.978,3556.412,Because then you wouldn't capture a category... because then Congress would have left out a category of trades.
2007.06-1265,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3584.76,3594.991,"But I take if... if your ultimate, let's say, policy reason for confining it to that is the... is the policy against multiple recovery."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3594.991,3595.616,Yes.
2007.06-1265,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3619.668,3622.87,"Their current argument is, basically, that's all Congress was thinking about."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3622.87,3624.493,--Yes.
2007.06-1265,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3624.493,3626.384,"But, as I understand your position, it's something more."
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3639.519,3639.769,Yes.
2007.06-1265,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3640.566,3641.237,Okay.
2007.06-1265,2,16723,andrew_j_pincus,,3641.237,3651.7,"Um, let me say a word about the rules and whether the rules are relevant here."
2007.06-1265,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3672.771,3673.443,"Thank you, Mr. Pincus."
2007.06-1265,3,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3674.957,3691.185,"Your Honors, Mr. Pincus has identified what he views as some temporal gap between the entering into a contract and the involvement of this... the clearing FCM."
2007.06-1265,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3752.224,3752.927,"Thank you, Mr. Days."
