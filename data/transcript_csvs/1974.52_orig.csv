1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,80.267,83.411,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.52_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,384.439,386.994,Where is Key Biscayne in that --
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,386.994,390.146,Key Biscayne is not on this map.
1974.52_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,400.877,406.813,The Key is almost part of the mainland I take it.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,406.813,408.729,This map is a trifle misleading.
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.263,475.022,"Mr. Jones, how would be the approximate length of a line, straight line drawn from the Dry Tortugas to Cape Romano?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,475.022,479.661,I think it's in the nature of the about a 100 miles.
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,483.881,485.246,Its nautical miles?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,485.246,489.797,30 nautical miles.
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,649.416,652.101,"Just at seaward, how much less?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,652.101,652.66,Pardon?
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,652.66,656.331,"Just at seaward, how much less?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,656.331,666.767,"Well, the continental shelf varies in width from as little as six miles to as much as I think 200 miles."
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1081.292,1084.074,"Mr. Jones, what's the lettering right about Straits of Florida?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1086.021,1087.536,"Yes, Florida Keys."
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1087.536,1090.758,Right.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1090.758,1103.92,We refer loosely to the Florida Keys sometimes as the entire chain of violence out the Dry Tortugas and sometimes only to those islands terminating here.
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1103.92,1105.637,Was the Key West?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1105.637,1106.972,Key West actually is right here.
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1106.972,1108.04,There.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1108.04,1115.312,And these are the Marquesas Keys and then the Dry Tortugas.
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.312,1129.609,We decided against you on the constitutional question would be -- have this issue as to where the Atlantic and the Gulf are?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1129.609,1144.033,"Well, if you decided against the United States in this case on the constitutional question, then you wouldn't have to decide the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Gulf, that's correct."
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1452.323,1460.837,Didn't Governor Kirk and the Florida Navy out once a few years ago have copped some foreign fishermen?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1460.837,1465.106,He may have but any such excursion was unsuccessful.
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.606,1588.388,"Mr. Jones, on the maps of the area, you have -- are they similar to your designation there, Florida Bay, you have there just the eastern most point or what are they, what do they show?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1588.388,1593.466,"The official maps, I frankly don't know."
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1614.828,1618.06,How about the --
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1618.06,1625.304,"The state of course calls the entire area out the wider, longer redline Florida Bay."
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1625.304,1631.559,"How about the -- yes, the official maps, the coast and geodetic survey --"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1631.559,1634.198,I don't think they designate a Florida Bay.
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.198,1636.701,You did -- there is such a thing as the Florida Bay?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1636.701,1646.402,"Well, as I say, it's loosely used and I don't know exactly what the designation would be or where."
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1651.574,1658.708,"You could be any of those, that's the reason I want to ask what, is it generally consider to be?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1662.818,1681.413,"Opposite, page 84 in the Special Master's opinion is a map in which the phrase â€œFlorida Bay appears immediately to the east of the line drawn by the Special Master."
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1710.473,1712.679,Who prepared this map?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1712.679,1714.553,That is a coastguard map.
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1714.553,1716.789,Coastguard.
1974.52_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1716.789,1718.264,Mr. Jones --
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1718.264,1720.08,-- superimposed or anything.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1720.08,1721.817,"That's correct, that's correct."
1974.52_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1727.733,1737.023,"Mr. Jones, has foreign fishing been allowed in the eastern most portion of this bay?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1737.023,1740.664,I can't answer that specifically.
1974.52_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1745.183,1746.997,"Yes, east of the redline --"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1746.997,1747.985,"Yes, it has."
1974.52_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1752.906,1755.269,That's been regarded as part of the high seas?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1755.269,1756.207,That's correct.
1974.52_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1756.207,1760.438,Can you indicated roughly with your point of?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1760.438,1793.659,"Actually, I think the -- I believe opposite page 94 of the Special Master's (voice overlap) I think so."
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1822.904,1828.347,"When you say territorial sea with to that map you just come out, just -- what do you mean?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1828.347,1834.632,That's the three-mile marginal sea claim by the United States as its territorial sea.
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.238,1842.088,That certainly doesn't seem to be just --
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1842.088,1842.438,That --
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.438,1844.841,-- within three miles from dry land.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1844.841,1845.65,"No, it is."
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1873.952,1893.866,"What's the distance from what the Government -- so as I gather natural shoreline in the Master's redline, much to that?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1893.866,1895.98,There is a scale on this map --
1974.52_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1895.98,1903.822,"Well, the Master is what appeared to be about the same as your 30-mile legend, does it not?"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1903.822,1905.75,"Well, let me try to determine this."
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1920.473,1921.146,Shoreline?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1921.146,1923.048,From the three-mile -- I'm sorry.
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1924.236,1935.521,From the shoreline to the Master -- where you drawn that smaller red line with the Master to making it a juridical bay.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1943.915,1948.706,"Well, this is -- again set forth on the map office at page 94."
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1948.706,1949.492,94?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1949.492,1955.79,"Yes, in the Special Master's report."
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1967.144,1971.985,And not where the Government's submission is that it should not belong to the three -- more than miles?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1971.985,1975.313,"Under the Government's position, there should be no juridical bay."
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1975.313,1977.21,"I know, but the marginal sea would --"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1977.21,1980.791,"The marginal sea should be only three miles from the shore, that's right."
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1980.791,1982.983,And the Master's line takes at six miles?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1982.983,1985.262,That's correct.
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.262,1988.396,"Well, but that -- wasn't an entirely accurate --"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,1988.396,1989.394,"No, that's right."
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2008.697,2012.719,Yes.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2012.719,2035.317,"But for reasons, I will discuss in a moment, we believe that the Special Master's finding the juridical bay was erroneous that before discussing that point, I wish to draw the Court's attention to the fundamental and clear legal error that the Special Master made in drawing the Submerged Lands Act to grant from the juridical bay closing line."
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.938,2076.094,"You're referring -- you say Louisiana 389, do you mean 339?"

1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.781,2077.507,389 --
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2077.507,2078.913,155.
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.913,2082.087,That would go what the second --
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2082.087,2089.71,"Well, actually that case, maybe a misnomer because it involved Texas."
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2107.727,2111.058,Mr. Justice Stewart's opinion in 384 U.S.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2111.058,2111.168,Oh!
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2118.624,2120.359,There's one involving it to the jetty.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2123.511,2126.004,But there was -- it involved the State of Texas.
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2126.004,2127.501,Yes.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2129.826,2130.256,That's what I --
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2130.256,2131.242,-- somewhat misleading the --

1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2134.466,2138.027,It was written by Justice Harlan was it?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2138.027,2139.263,I'm not certain Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.52_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2139.263,2141.696,"I'm not certain, but I think so."
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2141.696,2143.902,That's my understanding.
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.631,2159.268,"Why don't still go -- quite understand that the Government's point, do you think the -- whether that's a juridical bay or not --"
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2159.268,2163.987,"We believe that's irrelevant to the determination, the Submerged Lands Act grant."
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.987,2165.732,And you say that's generally true or --
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2165.732,2166.069,No.
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.069,2166.838,-- or just because of Florida?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2166.838,2167.794,Only in this case --
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.794,2174.86,"I had the understanding the generally, you would measure the marginal sea from the outer line of a juridical bay."
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2174.86,2175.796,That's correct.
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.547,2191.575,You think under the Submerged Lands Act that time is you do measure it from the historic boundary?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2191.575,2192.86,There's no question about it.
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.86,2194.577,I mean always?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2194.577,2194.715,But not always.
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.715,2196.769,If you measure it from there?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2196.769,2207.165,You would measure it from the current coastline if three miles from the current coastline was further seaward than three leagues from the historic coastline.

1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2319.384,2325.333,The principle is that it must be measured by reference to the historic boundary which is determined as of 1868.
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2325.333,2329.405,"And therefore, it cannot be measured from a line that the --"

1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2330.004,2330.93,-- Special Master do.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2330.93,2336.852,-- because that line was based upon the 1961 convention which first permitted 24-mile closing line.

1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2343.606,2344.901,That's right.
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2344.901,2347.516,And how is this different from the --

1974.52_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2409.178,2416.628,Would you indicate that again for me so that it's clear?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2416.628,2417.197,All of that --

1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.924,2547.299,I thought your first exception to the support of Special Master was that -- what should be the finding that --
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2547.299,2551.042,That discussion is at pages 14 and 15 of our opening brief.
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.042,2554.663,"And this is in support of the first exception, isn't it?"

1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2565.028,2565.807,That's true.
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2572.644,2574.937,Wasn't this argued before the Special Master?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2575.776,2575.914,No.
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.352,2604.025,Because I would have thought you would've -- you wouldn't be objecting to which as it in the first instance to his finding the juridical bay that -- to the --
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2604.025,2610.344,"Well, we also object to the existence of the juridical bay for the international legal reasons that we've set forth."
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.344,2614.653,It would only include on your present argument.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2614.653,2615.023,No.

1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.516,2634.58,But if it is irrelevant?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2634.58,2636.085,I would certainly hope not.
1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.085,2641.802,But the Special Master hasn't tested the points here.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2641.802,2643.277,Which point was that?

1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2673.02,2674.605,That's right.
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2674.605,2680.421,Was there any reason you didn't go back to the Master and asked him to reconsider?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2680.421,2688.087,"Well, the Special Master submitted the report to the Court and as a procedural matter."

1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2715.102,2718.276,"Well, I suppose he wouldn't have to."

1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.688,2863.591,I think it's what the Special Master has included that that's the boundary of the state.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2863.591,2864.777,That's correct.

1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2904.525,2907.908,He didn't encircle those in the same way.

1974.52_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.659,2919.076,Did you challenge that?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2919.076,2919.505,Certainly.

1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2929.921,2930.428,That's right.

1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,2986.451,2990.002,"Well, three miles to determine that territorial sea, yes."
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3015.827,3039.709,"What if the Florida Keys instead of running southwest from northeast to southwest, run from Cape Biscayne southeast so that there could be no question of a juridical bay at all, but they were still separated by the same water that they now are between Cape Biscayne and Key West."
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,3045.127,3045.766,Yes.
1974.52_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3053.239,3055.817,What is particularized?
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,3055.817,3066.427,"In our brief, we suggest that that the islands down to Upper Matecumbe Bay -- Upper Matecumbe Key might be so closely assimilated to the mainland just to be part of it."
1974.52_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3170.908,3175.187,This is another question that was not argued before the Special Master.
1974.52_orig,0,33866,keith_a_jones,,3175.187,3175.876,That is correct.
1974.52_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3189.022,3193.683,Very well Mr. Jones.

1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,3534.685,3538.246,Here is Key Biscayne and Cape Florida would be the tip right about here.
1974.52_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3538.246,3538.673,Right.

1974.52_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3712.619,3713.086,Right.

1974.52_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4096.934,4099.791,What's the portion of the total --
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4099.791,4101.009,"Of the shipping, of the fishing?"
1974.52_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4101.009,4101.805,Of the fishing.
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4101.805,4105.638,About half of the $16 million industry is located in that area.
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4124.386,4137.171,"Mr. Attorney General, the Government doesn't agree with you that you have permitted or not permitted fishing by foreign government."
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4137.171,4137.751,"Well, Your Honor --"
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4137.751,4141.385,"You say that the fact, but you agree that it's not the admitted fact, right?"
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4141.385,4155.898,"No, it's not the admitted fact, but I hope to get into some of the specific testimony which will point out that there has been an acquiescence by foreign governments in the sovereign exercise of jurisdiction by the state in that entire area over a long period of time."
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4155.898,4159.627,"Have you prohibited it, foreign governments from fishing?"
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4159.627,4160.832,"We have, whenever --"
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4160.832,4162.167,In what means?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4162.167,4180.814,"We have the marine patrol that polices that area that federal Government entered into a treaty with Cuba in 1957, and during the pendency of that treaty which we asked the federal government entered into a Cuba because there had been shrimping -- shrimping that was occurring in the Tortugas."
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4180.814,4184.845,Is there any shrimping going on there now by foreign government?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4184.845,4188.837,"Not to our knowledge, not to our knowledge."
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4188.966,4190.413,That's in the record?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4190.413,4190.962,"Yes, sir."
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4190.962,4191.462,I thought you said in the record --
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4191.462,4192.051,"There was two, two --"
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4192.051,4195.093,-- that you admitted that it had been going on.
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4195.093,4197.197,There were two Cuban fishing vessels that came into the area in 1971.
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4197.197,4205.772,I thought the Government said that in the record Florida admitted that foreign fishing was going on.
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4207.417,4210.209,"I don't think that statement standing alone is correct, no sir."
1974.52_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4231.991,4238.237,My only point is that if is that clear to you.
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4238.237,4245.85,"Let me comment if I may on United States versus California, of course, the overturning of that case is sought by the states in original 35."
1974.52_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4330.815,4339.893,"Mr. Attorney General, it seems to be -- just advance several different propositions and on your point that California isn't controlling."
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4373.472,4383.274,"Because we think that the facts in California are not identical, that it's a different situation that this Court never decided where the California had a historical boundary."
1974.52_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4455.065,4459.396,That's based in on the Submerged Lands Act?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4459.396,4470.803,"It is saying in effect that the Submerged Lands Act quick claim to the states confirm title but gave the states every right to come in and try to prove that they have a historical boundary, even if they went six leagues."
1974.52_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4661.428,4666.187,"And right there, not be a difference between northeast and northeastwardly?"
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4666.187,4668.503,Not when it says to go to a point Your Honor.
1974.52_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4668.751,4680.545,"Northeast is as you correctly say, a very definite course of 45 degrees, northeastwardly means more about 40 or --"
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4680.545,4681.324,"Well, excepts --"
1974.52_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4681.324,4682.45,More or less northeast.
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4682.45,4693.38,"Yes sir, except for the fact that the cross-examination for the Government's own witness, he testified that to him, that would mean a point between north and east and he said 45-degree angle."
1974.52_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4703.636,4708.983,But that means you think you have to start out north of east and not south of the east?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4708.983,4711.787,Yes sir.
1974.52_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4733.353,4738.81,Is a 45-degree call northeast from the Dry Tortugas bring you right out to Cape Romano?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,4738.81,4740.197,"Yes sir, it would."
1974.52_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5018.923,5024.292,Is your historic bay claim separate from your historic boundary claim?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,5025.5,5025.879,"Yes, yes sir."
1974.52_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5036.527,5038.543,That would be under the international convention?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,5038.543,5040.174,That's right.
1974.52_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5075.365,5079.854,"Mr. Attorney General, I don't understand if you're right on your historic bay argument."
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,5084.754,5092.388,"I think that if we're correct on that argument and you don't agree with us on the establishment of the boundary that we could, but we have considered."
1974.52_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5102.817,5106.65,But that's a historic bay?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,5106.65,5107.177,"Well, --"
1974.52_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5107.177,5108.343,That's your coastline --
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,5108.343,5110.147,"Yes, that would be our coastline if it is a historic bay."
1974.52_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5110.147,5113.331,And then you'd measured three leagues in that line would you?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,5113.331,5114.628,"Well, perhaps."
1974.52_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5119.252,5123.761,The statute wouldn't allow -- the 1953 law doesn't give you that?
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,5123.761,5127.901,I think it gives us either to the boundary or the three leagues which ever is greater.
1974.52_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5127.901,5128.198,That's right.
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,5128.198,5134.905,"And in this case, we get to the boundary which would be our coastline and that's the reason that I think we concluded that we couldn't get an additional three-league."
1974.52_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5134.905,5136.101,And I think you're right.
1974.52_orig,1,40503,robert_l_shevin,,5136.101,5136.728,Alright.
1974.52_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6014.8,6017.734,I believe your time is up Mr. Jones.
