1997.96-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.206,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-568, Joseph Oncale v. Sundowner's Offshore Services, Inc.--"
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,10.689,16.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.632,104.494,I thought this case involved a man.
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,104.494,105.456,"It does, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,154.419,155.671,Not necessarily.
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,186.101,195.298,"Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit has ruled categorically that if there is a male victim and a male perpetrator they do not look at the underlying facts or circumstances of the harassment."
1997.96-568,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,208.117,215.734,"But my point is, this was an all-male environment, too, and wasn't that... don't we have to take the decision in that context?"
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,235.148,241.373,"--That is correct, there was no other sex involved, but that factual determination is not the foundation of the Fifth Circuit's rule."
1997.96-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.095,262.49,"Well, as I understand, Mr. Canaday, you're not asking us to decide whether or not there was discrimination in this case."
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,269.225,273.67,"Your Honor, that's exactly correct, because my case was thrown out as a matter of law."
1997.96-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.621,290.374,"Well, what are you going to have to show if you prevail?"
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,295.528,308.228,We would prevail if the jury was instructed that sexual harassment is a cognizable form of discrimination based on sex.
1997.96-568,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.358,339.229,But title VII doesn't speak of sexual harassment or a hostile sexual environment.
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,349.287,357.953,"Your Honor, we would have to show that discrimination because of sex, as defined by this Court in the Meritor case, did in fact occur, yes, sir."
1997.96-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.953,368.459,"Well, suppose you had a case in which an uncouth supervisor tells very offensive and suggestive jokes to both sexes."
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,368.459,372.362,"Well, on the facts--"
1997.96-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,372.362,381.147,"Or, in your case, if we could change the facts a little bit, if almost the same conduct was perpetrated against both sexes by this supervisor?"
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,381.147,392.214,"--If it is the off-color, or the poor joke case, Your Honor, I believe the argument then would be, or the issue then would be whether or not the severity or pervasiveness of the conduct raised the level--"
1997.96-568,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,392.214,392.945,"Well, you know what I'm trying to say."
1997.96-568,0,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,392.945,393.156,"--Yes, sir."
1997.96-568,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,998.266,1008.645,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-568,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1008.645,1018.001,"Mr. Kneedler, will you please get into this question of what a plaintiff has to show when it's a same-sex situation, in the Government's view?"
1997.96-568,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1018.001,1018.702,--Yes.
1997.96-568,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1018.953,1020.805,Is there an element of discrimination?
1997.96-568,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1020.805,1021.056,--The--
1997.96-568,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1021.056,1023.237,And how can that be shown?
1997.96-568,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1023.237,1032.492,--The test under title VII is whether a person was treated in the way he or she was because of that employee's sex.
1997.96-568,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.174,1065.375,How can that possibly be involved in this case?
1997.96-568,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1070.61,1074.845,"Well, that... there's a difference between motive and treatment."
1997.96-568,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1114.304,1115.894,So it's a presumption?
1997.96-568,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1119.026,1119.286,--Yes.
1997.96-568,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1119.286,1123.72,But is there a presumption that this kind of conduct is discriminatory?
1997.96-568,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1124.271,1130.094,"Well, I think that the courts have assumed that it's because of sex, that there's something relational about sex."
1997.96-568,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1130.094,1133.427,"But the statute requires discrimination, and that's what we're puzzled--"
1997.96-568,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1133.427,1139.04,"The... what I was saying, though, is that it prohibits action because of sex."
1997.96-568,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1144.095,1146.376,"--Well, because of the sex of the victim."
1997.96-568,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1146.376,1146.987,"Yes, because of the--"
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1591.1,1594.583,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-568,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1646.971,1648.53,"Mr. Reasoner, can I ask you sort of a basic question?"
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1650.832,1651.383,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.383,1660.178,"Which I guess the basic test is, if this person would have been treated differently if he had been of the opposite sex, then that's a prima facie proof of discrimination."
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1660.178,1660.839,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.839,1671.605,"Would you agree that if the jury could reasonably infer from the set of circumstances that the same thing would not have happened if this person had been a woman, that then that would be the necessary showing of discrimination?"
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1671.605,1672.466,"I would not, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.466,1672.907,You would not.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1672.907,1688.879,"And if I might attempt to explain, I think that when you... that the Court extended the statute to say that sexual harassment can so affect the conditions of employment that it violates the statute, creates discrimination."
1997.96-568,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.307,1730.81,The statute doesn't say either women or men.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1731.801,1738.356,"--It says because of sex, Your Honor, correct, and I would interpret that to mean the two sexes, men and women."
1997.96-568,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1738.356,1738.617,Yes.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1752.906,1753.868,What I would--
1997.96-568,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.868,1756.129,I think that's how you answered me.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1756.129,1757.781,"--I think I did, too."
1997.96-568,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.243,1791.682,And supposing we disagree with that.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1798.461,1803.504,If Mr. Oncale would have been treated differently if he had been a woman?
1997.96-568,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.504,1813.889,"If the evidence were clear that the... that if a woman had been on the barge, that he would not have done this because he had a special interest in relationships with men, if that was clearly proved--"
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1813.889,1814.22,Your Honor--
1997.96-568,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.22,1818.264,--would that... why would that not be discrimination within the meaning of the statute?
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1818.264,1827.531,"--Let me suggest to you why I think that the statute should not be applied in that way, and three circuits have followed that notion."
1997.96-568,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.577,1861.554,But employers can discriminate because of sex without the discriminator having any particular sexual desires for the victim of the discrimination.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1879.707,1886.96,"--I... with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that is an overstatement of the Fifth Circuit's position, as I would understand it."
1997.96-568,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1905.733,1910.668,I don't know that we regard it as an extension of the statute to say that it covered sexual harassment.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1925.118,1943.691,"I think, Your Honor, what... Mr. Chief Justice, what I understood you to say in Meritor is that sexual harassment can be equivalent to discrimination if it is so severe and pervasive that it changes the conditions of employment, thereby discriminating against the sex being harassed."
1997.96-568,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.691,1956.45,"Well, sexual harassment directed in a discriminatory way against a victim, but certainly we didn't say that sexual harassment that was meted out equally to everybody is discrimination."
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1956.45,1968.578,"Well, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with that, and both in Meritor and Harris you were dealing with sexual harassment of women, very clear based on congressional findings... I mean, that there was a disparity."
1997.96-568,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.19,1977.904,But there were no findings at all in connection with the inclusion of sex in the 1964 acts.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,1977.904,1988.612,"--I would submit, Your Honor, that the Court can look to the Equal Pay Act of 1963, that there were extensive findings by Congress that there was a disparate treatment of women in the workplace."
1997.96-568,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2000.48,2000.721,Mr.--
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2020.252,2021.744,"I would, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.744,2022.836,Why is that?
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2033.414,2035.394,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2035.394,2042.467,"So why isn't it possible that a homosexual or nonhomosexual man, irrespective, could discriminate against another man on the basis of sex, and so could a woman?"
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2042.467,2045.94,"Well, I think... you're using the word discriminate."
1997.96-568,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.94,2046.36,Yes.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2048.732,2049.042,There's--
1997.96-568,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.042,2054.675,"--as they think they are, how could you have a circuit that has a rule that says they're not possible under the statute?"
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2054.675,2056.538,"--I don't think it does, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.451,2063.033,"Well, if we think that's what they held, I guess we'd have to say that's wrong."
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2065.156,2065.877,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2065.877,2066.376,Yes.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2073.0,2073.331,Well--
1997.96-568,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2073.331,2076.152,--decide what it is this statute really means.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2076.152,2076.443,--I--
1997.96-568,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2076.443,2084.289,"And in that context, do we consider at all the EEOC guideline on this?"
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2113.739,2119.552,"--No, and the EEOC flatly argues, Your Honor, if you look at their brief they want to include it all."
1997.96-568,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2132.149,2135.0,I just read you the EEOC guideline--
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2135.0,2135.531,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2135.531,2138.292,"--on sexual harassment, or harassment, however you pronounce it."
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2138.292,2138.613,Yes.
1997.96-568,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2138.613,2144.059,"Now, does that... do we rely on that?"
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2146.41,2146.81,I--
1997.96-568,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2146.81,2148.911,--in how we interpret this statute?
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2148.911,2160.391,"--I think they're entitled to deference only insofar as the Court finds them consistent, and they're not entitled to a Chevron-type deference, as this Court has made clear, only insofar as you find them consistent and persuasive."
1997.96-568,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.972,2164.232,Excuse me.
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2165.984,2167.895,"--That is my understanding, Your Honor."
1997.96-568,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.895,2171.118,"Well, what's the basis for that understanding?"
1997.96-568,2,27894,harry_m_reasoner,,2171.118,2174.671,If I might... I don't recall your case.
1997.96-568,3,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,3277.409,3290.386,The Fifth Circuit held that same-sex harassment is not cognizable under title VII.
1997.96-568,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.186,3308.488,"The statute doesn't make unlawful same-sex harassment, or any harassment."
1997.96-568,3,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,3313.102,3314.524,"--Yes, Your Honor, and this Court--"
1997.96-568,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3314.524,3317.593,So you don't want us to say that same-sex harassment is actionable.
1997.96-568,3,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,3320.815,3322.077,--Sexual discrimination.
1997.96-568,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.077,3324.398,--If and only if it constitutes sexual discrimination.
1997.96-568,3,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,3324.398,3327.09,"Yes, sir, as set forth in the Meritor case."
1997.96-568,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3327.09,3328.261,Which you say it always does.
1997.96-568,3,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,3328.261,3328.532,I--
1997.96-568,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3328.532,3330.473,And your opponent says it never does.
1997.96-568,3,37047,nicholas_canaday_iii,,3330.473,3330.683,"--No, sir."
1997.96-568,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3360.902,3362.034,"Thank you, Mr. Canaday."
