1998.97-2045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.522,"We'll hear argument next in No. 97-2045, South Central Bell Telephone Company v. Alabama."
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,29.935,32.351,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-2045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,230.833,231.983,"Mr. Evans, may I just--"
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,231.983,232.583,--Yes.
1998.97-2045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,232.583,246.86,"--ask to... I... I take it, from what you've said so far, that... that Justice See on the Alabama Supreme Court who spoke before on the nine... that his position is essentially right."
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,247.326,248.326,"Yes, exactly right."
1998.97-2045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.134,420.871,"--Mr. Evans, do you think the... the Congress could cut off this Court's appellate jurisdiction, say, just in Commerce Clause cases?"
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,420.871,426.442,"I... I don't know the answer to that, and it's clearly not something we need to worry about at the moment."
1998.97-2045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.832,439.701,But it can reverse our Commerce Clause decisions.
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,439.701,440.034,That's for sure.
1998.97-2045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.602,501.442,"In any of those cases, was the new argument that we rejected an argument to the effect that we have no jurisdiction?"
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,501.442,515.951,"There are cases, Justice Scalia, in which... at least two cases in which the Court has recently said that if a State does not raise an Eleventh Amendment argument, it need not be considered."
1998.97-2045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.251,520.336,Is that because that may not be a jurisdictional argument?
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,520.336,521.236,"--Well, that's right."
1998.97-2045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.804,553.29,I think you have to make that point because... I think you have to make that point because if it is strictly speaking a jurisdictional--
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,553.29,553.59,Yes.
1998.97-2045,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.59,569.933,"--point, not only do we have to entertain it if... if the respondent raises it here for the first time or the petitioner, indeed we have to entertain it on our own, even if he doesn't raise it here for the first time."
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,569.933,571.133,I... I fully agree.
1998.97-2045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.133,580.408,"Well, there's some earlier Eleventh Amendment cases, aren't there, Reed Detective and that Indiana case, that say it can be raised here for the first time?"
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,580.408,586.662,"It can be raised here for the first time, and I'm not suggesting anything to the contrary, but it needs to be raised properly."
1998.97-2045,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,618.783,622.485,"Mr. Evans, what are the two cases you were saying where we had done this before?"
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,622.485,646.433,"The case called Knowles, K-n-o-w-l-e-s, which was decided earlier this term, footnote 2, which refused to consider an alternative argument presented for the first time in the merits brief and not in the brief in opposition, and El Al Airlines, which again was not preserved in the... where the argument was not preserved in the merits brief, and that was in footnote 10 of that decision."
1998.97-2045,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,646.433,649.052,"Well, I don't see why... why is it inappropriate to raise this?"
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,673.834,678.737,"And I'm not... Justice Breyer, I'm not asking that they do... that the respondents have any obligation to do that."
1998.97-2045,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,680.523,680.873,--Yes.
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,680.873,681.339,--they can.
1998.97-2045,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.497,696.116,And also to give notice to the amicus.
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,696.116,697.366,"And to the amici, absolutely."
1998.97-2045,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.366,704.972,"And that's why we have it in our rules, that if you want to bring it up, put it in the brief in opposition and not for the first time in the respondents' brief."
1998.97-2045,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,704.972,706.272,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.97-2045,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.941,711.176,"Very well, Mr. Evans."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,712.059,723.266,Mr. Chief Justice... excuse me... and may it please the Court:
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,792.697,801.283,"Mr. Cooper, may I interrupt you with this point to read from a unanimous opinion 9 years ago with which you are no doubt familiar."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,817.876,819.895,"--That is accurate, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,825.465,836.106,"May I ask you also as an anterior question, do we take it that you are not pursuing any of the... the questions that were in... raised originally?"
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,851.699,854.049,"--Justice Ginsburg, that is accurate."
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,887.955,897.394,"But so, if we don't... if we don't accept these new arguments you're presenting today, then you agree that we must reverse the... the judgment."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,897.394,908.119,"--Unless some member of this Court can think of a different argument, Justice Ginsburg, for upholding the Alabama Supreme Court's decision, that is accurate."
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.523,951.029,"Of course, we've changed our rules on what the brief in opposition has to include since the City of Tuttle... Oklahoma City against Tuttle I think."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,951.029,961.836,"--If... if the... if this is not a jurisdictional point, if this issue doesn't go to jurisdiction, then the Court could certainly exercise its discretion not to reach the issue."
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,969.257,970.776,I don't understand your rule actually.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,990.238,991.79,"--Not at all, Justice Breyer."
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.29,993.156,Then this rule doesn't cover it.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,993.156,996.191,"--Well, this... this... the element--"
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,996.191,997.008,Is that an argument?
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,999.143,1001.843,"--Oh, it's... it is absolutely our argument, Justice Breyer."
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1035.398,1049.326,"Well, a better practice under rule 15 under the previous part of the rule, two sentences previous as to what Justice Breyer quoted, is for you to notify the Court what issues are properly before us, including jurisdictional issues."
1998.97-2045,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1049.326,1051.959,You don't think you can just lay back--
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1051.959,1054.375,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-2045,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1054.375,1056.827,--from the standpoint of good practice and not tell us about jurisdictional issues.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1056.827,1057.411,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1081.894,1082.894,I understand.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1082.894,1102.356,"And with all due respect, we maintain that this Court actually doesn't have discretion in a jurisdictional argument that is waived... that is asserted to the Court to... to not reach the issue."
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.973,1106.759,"Mr. Cooper, this is... this is the problem, as I see it, with fair notice."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1135.862,1146.467,"--Your Honor, all I can say is that the issue, again, goes to jurisdiction."
1998.97-2045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.185,1210.243,"If... if it is a jurisdictional objection based upon sovereign immunity, which is what you assert, right, the Eleventh Amendment being a reflection of sovereign immunity, sovereign immunity is normally waivable, isn't it, by the sovereign?"
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1217.064,1230.24,"--Your Honor, sovereign immunity can be waived, but this Court's decisions have clearly stated that sovereign immunity must be waived in the most unequivocal way, that--"
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1230.24,1236.56,Not this particular situation of... of appellate review by the Supreme Court.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1248.951,1251.736,--You're referring to McKesson?
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1251.736,1252.336,Yes.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1252.336,1267.079,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, since that case was decided, the Seminole Tribe case has been decided, and four members of this Court characterized the reasoning in McKesson as being specious, particularly in light of the Seminole Tribe case."
1998.97-2045,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1267.662,1271.447,They were also the same four who would find Federal question jurisdiction here.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1271.447,1295.413,"--Yes, Your Honor, but if there is Federal question jurisdiction, if... if... if the Eleventh Amendment does, indeed, bar a Federal question case, that is, a case as in Seminole brought by a citizen of the State against the State, then the Court's analysis... or the dissenting Justices' analysis in Seminole Tribe, it seems to us, is precisely correct."
1998.97-2045,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.413,1304.455,"Well, of course, those... those who agreed with the majority position did so on the assumption that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1314.726,1329.186,"Might as well, Your Honor, and it may well be that here my argument is focused more specifically on the five members of the Court in the... in the majority in Seminole Tribe."
1998.97-2045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.166,1352.935,"You don't challenge the Cohens case itself, I take it."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1352.935,1354.637,"--No, not at all, Your Honor."
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1382.335,1397.262,"Why isn't it within the language if it's... if it's... the State brings the proceeding, but the person who's bringing it to the Supreme Court on writ of error, or whatever it is, is going against the State at that point."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1398.88,1401.463,--Your Honor--
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1401.463,1405.617,"--You say, oh, and the language in one case... in the Cohen case, the language covers it."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1408.569,1413.64,"--Your Honor, Chief Justice Marshall examined that very issue at length."
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.73,1467.588,Your view of... just to kind of... your view is that any proceeding in a State court brought against the State by a citizen of another State could never be reviewed by this Court.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1467.588,1472.409,--If... if the State itself is the party defendant--
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1472.409,1472.692,Right.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1472.692,1475.944,--as opposed to an officer of the State.
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1496.791,1508.665,Would the respondent have... would it be within the judicial power of this Court to grant a motion by the respondent at this stage of the proceedings to add that individual as a defendant in order to preserve the jurisdiction and review?
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1508.665,1511.515,"I do not think it would be, Justice Stevens."
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.227,1554.977,Let me go back a second.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1579.925,1580.525,--Yes.
1998.97-2045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1583.477,1584.912,To get money out of the State treasury?
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1584.912,1585.362,--No.
1998.97-2045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.362,1589.548,To get back money which they have... they claim was erroneously paid into the State treasury?
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1589.548,1593.25,"No, Justice Scalia, but they can certainly prevent it from going forward, and that's the purpose of Ex parte Young."
1998.97-2045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.083,1596.583,"You're trying to get it back, though, aren't you?"
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1598.535,1600.718,"--Oh, I'm obviously trying to prevent its payment, Your Honor."
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1601.837,1603.77,But they're trying to get it back.
1998.97-2045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.77,1607.741,To the extent... these... these plaintiffs here... I thought they had coughed it up already.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1607.741,1609.441,"Well but, Your Honor, they... they--"
1998.97-2045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1609.441,1611.526,"So, they're trying to get money back out of the State treasury."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1611.526,1613.645,--Not just to get it back.
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1623.501,1628.571,But you're saying that they have nothing... nothing... no way of getting back... getting a refund.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1630.071,1634.558,"--Well, they... they... they have the Alabama court system for getting back a refund."
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1636.041,1642.462,"Yes, but whatever Alabama says, this Court has no... and it's a Federal question that we're dealing with."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1649.918,1653.453,"--With respect to this suit, yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1653.453,1654.886,"Well, all taxpayers from out-of-State."
1998.97-2045,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.886,1656.655,With respect to all suits involving a claim for money.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1656.655,1671.081,"Well, but I... I want to hasten to note, as the Court pointed out in Seminole Tribe, that there are... there are several methods where ongoing violations of the... of the Constitution, if that's what this is, can be prevented."
1998.97-2045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.305,1689.793,What would be the authority for the United States to bring an action in a case like this where you're talking about the negative Commerce Clause?
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1689.793,1710.373,"Well, Your Honor, I... I think that... I don't have a case to cite the Court that the United States would have authority on that score, but at least broadly considered, the United States can sue a State and there's no... there's no Eleventh Amendment problem to this Court's jurisdiction over that."
1998.97-2045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.373,1715.21,"Well, do you think the United States can just go around and sue a State whenever it feels like it?"
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1715.21,1717.643,"Oh, no."
1998.97-2045,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1732.336,1745.062,"But in any event, for... for you to prevail here, I guess we would have to overturn McKesson and ignore our own rule as a minimum."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1745.062,1754.418,"--Your Honor, I think... I think that the Court need not... if you're speaking about rule 15.2, I believe the Court can apply its rule and... and reach the Eleventh Amendment."
1998.97-2045,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1770.095,1777.95,This is the kind of argument that one would certainly hope that amici would focus on and be interested in.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1785.437,1796.328,"--Once again, Justice O'Connor, the Eleventh Amendment argument is a constitutional one."
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1847.761,1860.152,"Once you hold that... once you say that, you know... once you treat the Eleventh Amendment as including citizens of a State against a State, which I take it we have to read into it... right?"
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1862.188,1864.39,"Well, that's the Hans case, Your Honor."
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1864.39,1864.89,"Yes, all right."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1922.142,1935.402,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think that the point I would make to you is that if Chisolm, in Chisolm against Georgia, had advanced a Federal cause of action, I don't think that the State's reaction would have been any different."
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1967.921,1976.694,The only way it could have reached the Supreme Court would be if the States basically had waived their sovereign immunity within their own courts.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1979.56,1980.227,--Well--
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.227,1988.547,"And if it had come up in that form, what would have been the objection to the Supreme Court hearing it?"
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1988.547,1991.333,"--Two points, Your Honor."
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.093,2035.878,"So, your answer to me is, well, the Eleventh Amendment does create such a subset of cases."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2042.865,2044.567,"--That's... that's... that's essentially it, Your Honor."
1998.97-2045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.458,2064.462,"Well, does your... does your doctrine that you're espousing now have a Ex parte Young exception to it?"
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2064.462,2066.212,Your Honor--
1998.97-2045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.212,2081.072,So that you could sue... you could sue the Alabama Revenue Commissioner in... in... in State court and bring that suit here if it was decided against you on a Federal ground.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2081.072,2082.59,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.59,2084.139,For refund?
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2085.625,2086.324,No.
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2100.366,2103.901,"How... how many years was, Mr. Cooper, this case in litigation, this refund claim?"
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2103.901,2112.189,"--Your Honor, the... the refund claim I think was in the Alabama court somewhere on the order of a decade."
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2112.189,2132.92,"Yes, and all that time the corporation must pay the tax, and on your Ex parte Young theory, maybe there could be a prospective relief, but for all those 10 years, the Federal Court, this Court, is unable to say that the State law was unconstitutional."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2139.157,2150.065,"Your Honor, I think that's... I think that is the consequence, the unavoidable consequence, of sovereign immunity."
1998.97-2045,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.25,2171.378,"And that would certainly run counter to Justice Breyer's reference to Holmes saying it wouldn't matter so much if this Court didn't have the authority to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional, but if it lost that power with respect to State laws, the Union would be something quite different from what it is."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2171.378,2180.151,"Your Honor, the... the language of the Eleventh Amendment, its... its very letter, does not contemplate this exception."
1998.97-2045,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2205.866,2211.953,"Well, if we're going to be fastidious about the language of the Eleventh Amendment, we'd have to redo a lot of our jurisprudence, wouldn't we?"
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2212.555,2217.173,"Well, Your Honor, I think that... my answer, Justice Kennedy, is this."
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.626,2255.346,"Mr. Cooper, the issue I suppose, even on the letter, is whether this is a suit within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, and that's the answer Justice Marshall gave."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2265.487,2269.689,"--Your Honor, I think Cohen is a very difficult road for that argument."
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.211,2278.745,I understand.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2278.745,2279.911,And... and--
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.911,2286.75,But it's still a key to your argument that we read the word suit to refer to the State proceeding because--
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2286.75,2287.233,"--Oh, yes."
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.233,2288.483,--the petition for cert isn't a suit.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2309.63,2318.253,"Your Honor, I think Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens made clear that the... that... and that was a case that came up out of the State--"
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.253,2318.872,Correct.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2318.872,2319.772,--appellate system.
1998.97-2045,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.176,2327.892,Within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2327.892,2330.728,"--Within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, then a very short opinion."
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.143,2381.928,They are actually in some instances.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2384.964,2386.047,"Well, this--"
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.047,2386.547,--there were some.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2394.17,2397.555,--But surely not when the State is--
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.555,2402.357,"Yes, it was tried in the State court, tried in the State court, and they got their appeal over to the Federal appeals court."
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2402.357,2404.392,--When the State itself is a defendant.
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2404.392,2405.642,In that case.
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2405.642,2406.192,Yes.
1998.97-2045,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2406.192,2408.094,I... it didn't--
1998.97-2045,1,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2408.094,2433.709,"Your Honor, I... my time is about expired and obviously I have little time left to devote to our... our respectful request that the Court reexamine this Court's negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence."
1998.97-2045,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.373,2456.023,"--Thank you, Mr. Cooper."
1998.97-2045,2,35781,mark_l_evans,,2458.658,2462.293,Just three very quick points.
1998.97-2045,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.258,2588.376,"Thank you, Mr. Evans."
