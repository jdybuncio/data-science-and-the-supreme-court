1994.93-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.8,"We'll hear argument this morning in Number 93-1151, Federal Election Commission v. NRA Political Victory Fund, et al.--"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,12.611,15.563,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1151,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.615,97.808,Are you also going to address whether you have authority to represent the FEC here?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,97.808,101.05,"--If the Court wishes, I can address that issue."
1994.93-1151,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,126.959,141.138,"Well, I suppose you could read 28 U.S. Code 518(a), giving the Solicitor General authority, as not being inconsistent with the statute 437d that you rely on."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,152.616,160.313,"You could give effect to both those statutes, though I think that would not be giving full effect to the intent of Congress in establishing the Federal Election Commission."
1994.93-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.205,182.659,"You don't think the word suits in that statute helps the Attorney, the S.G.?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,182.659,193.234,"--As a general proposition, absent some other declaration by Congress that litigation authority should reside in another agency, yes, I think that does cover it."
1994.93-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.621,208.276,"Well, you're saying that appeals in 518 indicates that it comprehends writs of certiorari."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,209.057,214.58,The word appeal generally comprehends writs of certiorari.
1994.93-1151,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,220.196,222.047,"But in 518 it says, suits and appeals."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,222.047,236.265,"Yes, but while that's a general grant of authority to the Solicitor General, we don't believe that it overrides the congressional... the words of the statute and also the congressional intent to afford the Commission its own litigation authority."
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.265,256.47,"Well, it doesn't override, it, but the point is, the mere fact that your statute says appeals is not contradicted by, or a limited reading of that statute is not contradicted by 518(a), which goes out of its way to say, not just appeals, but the Attorney General represents the United States in suits and appeals."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,256.47,264.315,"Yes, Justice Scalia, but again I think if you look at the intent of Congress, the way the statute's constructed, also--"
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.315,264.716,I'm looking at it.
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,297.417,302.983,--That provision was not enacted at the same time as the Federal Election Campaign Act.
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.815,319.886,It was not passed at that time?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,320.938,322.22,"It was reenacted, but there was no--"
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.22,322.73,I see.
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,326.063,329.055,--And it was not... it was not in any way substantially redrafted.
1994.93-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.761,354.904,How many other agencies have the authority to petition here without the S.G.?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,354.904,357.487,"--Excuse me, I'm--"
1994.93-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,357.487,365.873,"How many other agencies, or how many agencies, perhaps I should say, have the authority to petition here without the S.G.?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,365.873,369.335,--I'm aware of... there... I'm not specifically sure.
1994.93-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.382,382.316,Do you know what the other agencies are that you think have that authority?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,382.316,384.239,I think the International Trade Commission has that authority.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,386.802,390.934,"Doesn't the FTC have the same, a similar statute to yours?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,390.934,400.902,"I don't know that it has the same exact language, and it clearly does not have the same legislative history with regard to the intent of the Federal Election Commission to be independent of the Department of Justice."
1994.93-1151,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,465.694,470.776,"Well, the statute in title 26 expressly gives the FEC authority."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,492.901,493.812,Yes.
1994.93-1151,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.812,500.157,Because the consent wasn't given until long after the petition was filed.
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,500.157,501.066,Yes.
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.058,529.067,"So 2 years can go by, and we really don't know whether the case is here or not until the Attorney General chooses to retroactively give life to the suit?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,530.557,537.913,"Well, I don't think you would have a situation, because the Court would rule on the petition, presumably, before that point, but I don't think that's a situation--"
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.913,538.914,"Oh, at least there's that deadline."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,557.417,561.029,--I... that is a possibility.
1994.93-1151,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,563.16,572.156,"Well, maybe the Clerk should just refuse to accept the filing in the first instance, if it comes in here without the Solicitor General's participation, and that ends it."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,572.156,573.989,"Well, I... that would end it."
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.483,600.906,"Sort of a de facto authority doctrine, you might say."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,601.497,601.697,Yes.
1994.93-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.609,668.313,"Well, they can certainly sit in on all the discussions of the Commission, can't they?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,668.313,668.483,--Yes.
1994.93-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.483,675.969,And might not those discussions be less than full and frank in the presence of those two congressional representatives?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,675.969,694.168,"Whatever influence they would have to chill the discussions would be very minimal, considering the fact that this agency, as all agencies, works under the Freedom of Information Act, the Sunshine Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, so the Commissioners do not sit at a meeting with an understanding that what they say will forever be secret."
1994.93-1151,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.168,701.043,You mean the Freedom of Information Act would authorize the release of the private deliberations of the Commission?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,701.043,703.195,Not until an enforcement action is over.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,714.925,719.418,But do they keep transcripts of these deliberations that are later made public?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,719.418,719.769,Yes.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,720.63,721.541,Verbatim transcripts?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,721.541,721.691,They are taped.
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.549,738.265,"These members do participate in the discussion, though, and they say... I mean, they can say, well, you're making a good point but it seems to me that point is refuted by thus-and-such, don't they?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,738.265,741.758,"Yes, Justice Scalia, they do participate in the discussion, but that's all they can do."
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.758,761.583,"Yes, well, my... you know, judges, when they are recused from a case, consider themselves recused not just from voting in the decision, but from participating in the discussion, because that is... that is part of the action of any body, the discussion which leads to the decision, and when you're out of the case, you're out of it for the discussion, not only for the vote."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,772.772,783.898,"The rules regarding recusal are different rules, and the ex officio members may very well end up recusing themselves from specific cases, but here you're not dealing with a question of interest in the case that would require recusal."
1994.93-1151,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,792.093,807.975,"But if you're right, your opponent suggests that Congress could put ex officio members on this Court to sit in our conference, and under your theory, that's okay, because all they can do is discuss it with us."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,809.805,824.166,"No, Justice O'Connor, we think that that proposition is really based on an untenable proposition by the respondents, which is that what is good for an independent agency created by Congress and placed in the executive branch by necessity is good for this Court or the President."
1994.93-1151,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,824.166,831.762,"Well, do you think it would be a violation of separation of powers if Congress were to send some ex officio members to this Court's conference?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,831.762,831.963,Yes.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,839.299,839.489,Why?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,839.489,840.681,--Because--
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,840.681,846.475,Why does it interfere with us any more than the ex officios are interfering with the FEC?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,846.475,855.504,--Because the same rights that attach to either the President or this Court do not necessarily attach to independent agencies.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,855.904,862.56,"So it's the textual difference, it's the independent textually established constitutional status of this Court?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,862.56,864.89,"--Yes, in large part."
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,864.89,870.684,Then on that reasoning there could be ex officio listeners in the court of appeals.
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,870.684,871.205,No.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,872.417,872.587,Why not?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,877.98,883.105,--But you would still have to look at whether or not it interfered with the courts' Article III powers.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,883.105,887.307,"In what sense would it interfere, any more than this interferes with the FEC?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,887.307,896.192,In the sense that the Constitution gives Article III courts strong protection against partisan or political influence.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,902.036,903.729,But it seems to me you are arguing just the other way.
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,909.672,917.196,--But still the... it is not the... the Court derives its power directly from Article III.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,924.264,927.747,"Well, you keep telling me about textual bases or nontextual bases."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,938.355,945.87,"--Clearly, the one mentioned before about the potential of a chill, because this Court's deliberations are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, are not subject to the Sunshine--"
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,945.87,958.6,"Well, but a statute creating the listener simply subjects the listener to exactly the same confidentiality requirements that the Court imposes upon itself, so there's no... we assume people will follow the law in good faith."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,965.725,970.528,--Because I think it would still be considered a direct interference with the Court's Article III powers.
1994.93-1151,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,976.693,980.366,"Well, I think... I agree with you, but I don't see how you're drawing the line between the two cases."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,980.366,1007.314,"--Well, I... if you cannot draw the line, then I think there would also be a problem with the application of the Freedom of Information Act and the Sunshine Act to independent agencies, because clearly the courts have gone out of their way to not apply, for example, the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the Office of the President, saying that to do so would raise serious constitutional doubts about the Federal Advisory Committee Act, but when you get to applying it to independent agencies, there is little doubt that the act can be applied, because--"
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.314,1007.885,"Well, now, wait a minute."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,1020.456,1021.067,--Yes.
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.067,1027.252,"But now your example about the Advisory Committee Act, that applies to all agencies, not just independent agencies."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,1027.252,1029.645,"Correct, but it would not apply to the Office of the President."
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1030.977,1035.14,"But that's a quite different line, the line between the Office of the President and the rest of the Government."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,1036.192,1038.122,"--I'm... I'm relying on several lines, yes."
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.878,1044.138,I think I agree with you.
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,1057.99,1075.1,"Each one would have to be analyzed on a functional approach, and I would start with the proposition that there is a distinction with the Federal Election Commission that may not exist with other agencies, and that is that the Federal Election Commission deals in an area of law that directly interrelates with how Congress acts."
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.1,1078.693,"So we really wouldn't know until they try them one-by-one, agency-by-agency, right?"
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,1078.693,1080.894,"Well, I think each one--"
1994.93-1151,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1080.894,1085.747,"And then when they get here, you urge that we not apply the rule in the first case, anyway."
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,1085.747,1089.019,--I'm only urging it with regard to the Federal Election Commission.
1994.93-1151,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.833,1096.786,May I ask you two very brief questions?
1994.93-1151,0,34900,lawrence_m_noble,,1098.586,1100.515,The ex officio members?
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1462.134,1462.715,Yes.
1994.93-1151,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1498.912,1503.336,I guess we have accepted petitions from the FEC in the past that weren't authorized.
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1503.336,1504.408,"Yeah, and I think that's--"
1994.93-1151,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1504.408,1510.852,"There seems to be kind of a practice of it, so it's quite understandable that the Clerk accepted this one, I suppose."
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1510.852,1517.766,"--Right, and I think it's also understandable that the FEC did not ask us for authority before filing its petition."
1994.93-1151,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1521.73,1526.182,"Well, how would the subsequent consent or authorization relate back?"
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1532.178,1532.829,"It... no, I don't think so."
1994.93-1151,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.223,1558.446,"But now, is that the same sort of statutory situation that you have in petitions to this Court?"
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1558.626,1558.807,I think it is.
1994.93-1151,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.934,1580.535,"--So a U.S. Attorney filing a notice of appeal from the district court to the court of appeals, you say that notice of appeal would be, not be any good so far as the court was concerned, unless the S.G. approved it?"
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1580.535,1594.195,"I think the appeal would not be any good, unless the Solicitor General approved, authorized the going forward with the appeal, but I think the approval does not have to be given before the time for the notice of appeal to be filed, because of the time pressure."
1994.93-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.195,1598.607,In the courts of appeals you're saying that they are invalid?
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1598.607,1599.258,"No, no."
1994.93-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1605.763,1615.38,"They are valid because the U.S. Attorneys have authorization to proceed immediately, without the prior consent of the Solicitor General, so they have authorization."
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1620.265,1620.495,Right.
1994.93-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.027,1626.65,"Now, have you given the FEC authorization to file petitions for certiorari?"
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1626.65,1628.012,I think no.
1994.93-1151,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1628.012,1631.324,--Then it's not a parallel situation.
1994.93-1151,1,37685,paul_bender,,1631.324,1648.438,"In light... I agree it's not an entirely parallel situation, but in light of what Justice O'Connor mentioned, that is the general understanding that they were reasonable in having that they could file this petition without our authorization, the petition should not be deemed to be out of time because they did that and we only authorize it after--"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2094.364,2098.996,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1151,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.403,2181.76,"Was it... it was filed within 90 days by the FEC, and then there's, I gather a justice for good cause can extend it for 60 days in addition under the statute, at least as I read that."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2188.405,2213.453,"Justice Breyer, it was given outside of the 60-day period of time, so there's no understanding of the time limits of this Court, of which I am aware anyway, that would bring the authorized petition within the time limits of this Court, so if it is... if the Court has jurisdiction, it must be because the Solicitor General is empowered after the fact to authorize the petition."
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.448,2251.229,"There is a difference, Mr. Cooper."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2269.556,2283.737,"--Well, Your Honor, I think actually our theory is both that Congress is invading the executive's domain, and it is doing so in a way that aggrandizes its own, so I believe we have the benefit of all of this Court's separation of powers jurisprudence."
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.737,2298.036,"As to the invasion point, it seems to me rather clear that we would react rather promptly if somebody said somebody's going to sit on our conferences, and it's interesting to me that for some 20 years or so, the FEC doesn't seem to have been bothered at all by the presence of these members."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2299.388,2312.107,"Well, Your Honor, they were certainly forewarned by the Ford administration that, were the ex officio's retained in the statute, that that would be an unconstitutional invasion of the executive branch."
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2312.107,2315.489,"Well, they're not really the executive branch, is the reason for that, isn't it?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2317.051,2318.461,Your Honor--
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.461,2326.278,"It isn't as though, if the President objected to it they would stand up and assert the Chief Executive's prerogatives, would they?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2326.278,2327.149,--Excuse me?
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.149,2335.074,"It is not as though, if the President objected to it, the members of the Federal Election Commission would stand up and assert the President's prerogatives on his behalf."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2335.074,2341.368,"Your Honor, it is not at all like that, and in fact that brings this ex officio issue into a very sharp focus."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.814,2423.445,"But the members of the... the voting members of the Commission are appointed by the President, aren't they?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2423.445,2427.9,"Yes, Your Honor, they are, as a result of Buckley, so--"
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2427.9,2431.672,So why would one say this is out of the control of the President?
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2431.672,2438.996,"--Your Honor, the President has got influence to the extent that the appoints the members."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.205,2464.465,What about the FTC?
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2469.408,2470.409,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.409,2475.581,"--as I recall, and yet surely the FTC enforces... is a law enforcement agency."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2475.581,2498.856,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, and it is our submission that if Congress is going to place authority in the FTC or the FEC to, as the exclusive civil enforcement authority over an entire regulatory statute, then it must ensure that that authority is subject to the at-will removal control of the President."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2498.856,2509.595,"Well, what about Humphrey's Executor, the case that held that FDR could not remove a member of the FTC at will?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2509.595,2518.3,"Well, Your Honor, the FTC at the time the Court made that ruling, according to the Court, did not participate at all in the executive authority."
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2529.066,2535.511,You don't have to go this... you're not fighting the lost battle of the headless fourth branch.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2552.691,2556.034,"--I think it's doubly unconstitutional for that reason, yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.837,2647.126,--I was going to ask you if you would take the same view if the two individuals were not actually agents of Congress but rather the statute in effect had designated a public member to sit in on all meetings for information purposes and periodically report to Congress.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2650.819,2661.224,"Your Honor, I think that would be a tougher case for me to win, largely for the point you mentioned earlier, the aggrandizement--"
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.224,2661.415,Right.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2661.675,2681.53,"--of Congress, but I don't... I think that if... if Mr. Bender is correct, and I think he probably is, that the exercise of this authority, this participatory authority as a member of the Commission, is an authority that only an officer of the United States can hold, then--"
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2681.53,2682.061,--So you'd say that would violate the Appointments Clause.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2682.061,2682.833,--It would.
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.833,2693.621,"But supposing you let the President appoint that public member, a member to be appointed by the President to perform this function of advising Congress and passing messages from Congress to the Commission."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2693.621,2700.444,"Oh, well, under those circumstances I think the objectionable features would be drawn out very thin."
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2700.444,2705.856,So it's the fact that the two individuals are actual officials of Congress that are critical to your case.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2705.856,2711.71,"I don't think it's necessarily... I don't think I would lose your first hypothetical, necessarily."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2724.229,2738.19,"Isn't part of your argument, too, that Congress has selected A and B and said you're going to do this, rather than speaking for a general class, say, a public member, and saying the President may appoint a member of the public?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2746.504,2747.446,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.155,2768.253,"A case that runs through my mind is the problem Congress might have, say, with the CIA, some agency that doesn't make its deliberations public, but nevertheless Congress wants to know what goes on."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2780.528,2784.513,"Your Honor, I think that would fall afoul of the very points we're making here."
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2815.283,2818.326,Say it's just for the purpose of informing.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2826.102,2827.401,"--Well, Your Honor, they do everything--"
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2827.401,2828.673,Nobody seems to have complained for 20 years.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2833.637,2841.582,"--Well, Your Honor, I think they do everything that the other members, the other six members do, except vote, and in fact--"
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2841.582,2842.283,"And except paid, I guess, to."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2842.283,2844.426,"--Well, no, they just don't get paid--"
1994.93-1151,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2844.426,2845.786,For what they do.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2845.786,2845.966,"--Well, I'm not--"
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2845.966,2850.36,"They get paid for being agents of Congress, which is what they are in this capacity."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2850.36,2851.89,--What they are in this capacity--
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2851.89,2853.222,Mr. Cooper--
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2853.222,2853.413,"--Yes, sir."
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2853.413,2855.433,--are you going to address retroactivity?
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2855.433,2859.146,"Yes, Your Honor, I would like to do that."
1994.93-1151,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2859.146,2871.591,"Mr. Cooper, before you go into retroactivity, just explain to me, if you would, how it is that the Attorney General can be a member of the Sentencing Commission, and that's not a problem."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2871.591,2881.68,"Your Honor, the Sentencing Commission... it may well be a problem, Your Honor."
1994.93-1151,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2953.627,2970.799,"On the retroactivity point, would we have held that if there are certain deficiencies in the grand jury's structure, if the case proceeds and there's a conviction, the grand jury deficiency is essentially harmless error in some contexts."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2984.622,2992.576,As opposed to the actions that took place from the filing of the complaint in our--
1994.93-1151,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2992.576,2993.187,Yes.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2993.187,3023.739,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the case against the presence of the ex officios with respect to investigation is weaker in the sense that this Court in Buckley recognized that Congress itself can perform investigatory powers, and that the Federal Election Commission, even with members, voting members appointed by the Speaker of the House, for example, can have those powers."
1994.93-1151,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3023.739,3029.391,"Was the case prosecuted in the district court by attorneys for the Commission, or by the Justice Department?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3029.391,3030.663,By attorneys for the Commission.
1994.93-1151,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3030.663,3042.911,So that you say that... would you say that there's an ongoing violation of the structural nature because those attorneys are under the supervision of the Commission which has these ex officio members on it?
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3044.431,3044.691,"Oh, yes."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3082.347,3083.977,Why would this disqualify it?
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3091.243,3110.745,"--They are, Your Honor, but this Court's decisions have always recognized that the... that in raising a defense to a regulatory action of this kind the defendant doesn't have to show that a different decision would have been made."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3126.316,3128.938,What case are you relying on for that proposition?
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3128.938,3131.993,"Well, Buckley, for example, I think Morrison v. Olson."
1994.93-1151,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3138.468,3142.841,May I ask you another question before you get to retroactivity?
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3212.5,3223.146,"Your Honor, it wouldn't because, at least it is our submission that the Commission was constituted such that it was disqualified from enforcing this statute."
1994.93-1151,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3224.718,3228.962,"You'd have a stronger argument if you didn't have a severance provision, wouldn't you?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3228.962,3230.304,"--Your Honor, I don't think so."
1994.93-1151,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3252.189,3254.683,That's a way of characterizing the case.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3254.683,3255.311,--Yes.
1994.93-1151,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3255.311,3265.63,"But it's clear from the severance provision that the acts of the six are not, per se, facially unconstitutional merely from the... because of the presence of the two."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3265.63,3266.741,Your Honor--
1994.93-1151,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3266.741,3273.464,"That's one distinction from a... a non... a statutory severance case from a nonstatutory severance case, isn't it?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3273.464,3281.72,"--Their acts were not invalid, but the acts of the Commission itself were invalid because of the presence--"
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.72,3284.612,Does it have anything to do with whether their acts are invalid?
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3289.897,3293.848,"--That's what the severance point I think has to do with it, Your Honor, but--"
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3293.848,3299.703,"So you can cut out a piece of the statute and let the rest continue to operate, as opposed to saying the whole statute's null and void."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3299.703,3301.296,"--Well, that's true, but you can't--"
1994.93-1151,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3301.296,3303.166,It doesn't speak to operational... operations at all.
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3303.166,3324.69,"--You're right, Your Honor, and my point on the operation, Justice Souter, is that if this, if these ex officios had had voting power, but only two out of eight, they couldn't have coerced or compelled the Commission, and it may well have been that they voted against this action, but in my opinion, that would clearly make it, the Commission itself, void."
1994.93-1151,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3324.69,3329.224,"Well, it would make it, because your argument would still be an influence argument, just as it is here."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3329.224,3332.566,"Your Honor, my argument is a facial challenge."
1994.93-1151,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3332.566,3339.942,"You can't compel with... two out of six does not compel, nonvoting two out of six does not compel, but your argument would be essentially the same, wouldn't it?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3339.942,3351.99,"My argument is not an as-applied argument, it is a facial challenge based upon the membership of the ex officios, not upon whether or not they actually influenced this case in a way against my clients."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3371.843,3375.357,"Well, you think of a facial attack as being associated with the First Amendment."
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3384.583,3388.146,"--Well, Your Honor, if... let's take the Morrison case, for example."
1994.93-1151,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3518.994,3528.051,"If you prevail on the merits, can Congress act quickly and ratify all existing enforcement actions?"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3528.051,3533.754,"Your Honor, I don't believe that it can."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3534.395,3535.797,"No, you can answer the question, Mr.--"
1994.93-1151,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,3541.611,3553.479,"Your Honor, I don't think Congress has any greater authority to validate, or somehow deem valid, an unconstitutional civil prosecution than I believe this Court has."
1994.93-1151,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3554.4,3555.78,"Thank you, Mr. Cooper."
