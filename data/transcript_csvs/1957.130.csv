1957.130,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,666.238,667.37,(Inaudible)
1957.130,0,39957,robert_t_mccracken,,667.37,668.571,Sir?
1957.130,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,668.571,673.649,The Government have (Inaudible)
1957.130,0,39957,robert_t_mccracken,,673.649,674.399,"Yes, yes."
1957.130,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,781.803,784.228,"I want to make sure, that's why I understood you correctly."
1957.130,0,39957,robert_t_mccracken,,788.852,793.389,"Yes, sir and they -- they possessed the policies and they got the income from it."
1957.130,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,804.261,806.603,Gift taxes were paid to the donor?
1957.130,0,39957,robert_t_mccracken,,806.603,807.03,Sir?
1957.130,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,807.03,808.636,And gift taxes were paid --
1957.130,0,39957,robert_t_mccracken,,808.636,809.994,"Oh, yes, gift tax were paid."
1957.130,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,884.259,891.23,"Did I hear you say, Mr. McCracken, that the premium on the annuity wasn't reduced because of the insurance?"
1957.130,0,39957,robert_t_mccracken,,891.23,891.838,"No, sir."
1957.130,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,897.137,898.708,And there's no -- there has been no insurance (Voice Overlap) --
1957.130,0,39957,robert_t_mccracken,,898.708,907.704,"Of her age and the premium on the policy was exactly what she or anybody else would have paid for that policy, had she taken a medical examination and passed it."
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1251.383,1253.711,If the Court please.
1957.130,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1486.678,1488.784,Was that the same section that we have here?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1488.784,1492.036,It -- well in that -- at that time it was Section 302.
1957.130,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1492.036,1492.596,In substance?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1492.596,1494.887,"It's in substance the same, yes, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1499.674,1505.125,Does that involve (Inaudible)?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1505.125,1505.563,"No, sir."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1537.842,1550.384,"The interest of the beneficiary -- the interest of the beneficiary in Le Gierse did not arrive, did not come into being until that the testator is dead, isn't that right?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1550.384,1551.727,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1551.727,1554.285,"And here, is that true here?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1554.285,1556.416,"Well, it's a question of what you mean by their interest."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1559.694,1564.496,Could she -- could she affect the interest of the beneficiaries and the policy?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1564.496,1565.721,"In this case, no, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1565.721,1566.161,What?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1566.161,1568.892,"No, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1569.13,1571.326,"The opposite was the fact in Le Gierse, is that right?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1571.326,1573.237,The opposite was the fact in Le Gierse.
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1573.237,1574.271,All right.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1574.271,1577.488,I think I -- I will come to why I think that is not a difference.
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1577.488,1578.702,I'm not reaching that.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1580.724,1582.615,That's right.
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1686.183,1691.312,Would it interrupt you to state it exactly what it is the Government is seeking to tax here?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1691.312,1699.397,"The Government is seeking to tax this as a single investment, Your Honor, from which the income is retained."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1731.52,1756.502,"What you're -- you're trying to tax -- would you please correct the inaccuracy of what I'm about to say, you're trying to tax an interest which came into being not at all in contemplation of death long before death but of subsisting living interest with dollars and cents which were wholly unaffected by the death of the testator, is that correct?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1756.502,1759.168,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1767.59,1774.338,"But whatever they are, the variation is wholly independent of the creator of the interest?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1774.338,1774.958,"Yes, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1807.29,1813.322,"But none of that -- none of those interest would have been taxable except to the beneficiaries themselves, is that right?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1813.322,1816.589,"If they had surrendered it, then we would have an entirely different relationship."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1816.589,1829.331,But every -- all the money value of the interest that this woman created was there after tax -- an interest as much in the complete dominion of those beneficiaries as a book that you may own?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1829.331,1829.54,But the fact --
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1829.54,1830.323,Is that right?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1830.323,1831.349,"That is right, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1880.972,1884.607,Why won't they tax as interest in contemplation of death?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1889.907,1890.586,"Well, an interesting point --"
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1890.586,1900.289,"Because as you rightly indicated a minute ago, the size of what they were getting was contingent absolutely and was created to be contingent upon her death."
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1908.142,1915.742,"The contemplation of death theory, Your Honor, I think -- does, Your Honor, mean to take that effect in possession or enjoyment at death?"
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1915.742,1916.533,"This, yes."
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1916.533,1934.463,"But the reason we could not take that position, Your Honor, is that the subsection of Section 811, which includes those says that such a transfer is taxable only if the decedent held incidence of ownership at the time of her death."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1938.301,1955.933,Well you could interpret that I think with as much justice that she had an incident of ownerships since the quality of the ownership was dependent upon her death and she so created it that the fulfillment of what she was going to do was all through her actions and was dependent upon the continuity of her life.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1960.461,1960.967,"Well as, Your Honor, said --"
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1960.967,1968.932,"But you said -- your whole argument is that there was a nexus between her -- between her death and the enjoyment as to which these people came, is that right?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1968.932,1970.274,"That's right, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1976.636,1976.753,But you might be wrong all the time.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1976.753,1978.324,-- and I would had to say none.
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1978.324,1978.628,You might be right --
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1978.628,1978.92,We might be.
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1978.92,1979.254,-- all the time.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,1979.254,1987.174,"Yes, Your Honor, I'm fully aware of that and the previous decision of this Court clearly so indicates."
1957.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2373.105,2374.89,Would you state me out on this --
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2374.89,2375.508,"Yes, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2375.508,2377.551,-- please.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2398.378,2398.963,The difference --
1957.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2398.963,2401.084,I -- that -- that isn't clear in my mind.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2402.045,2405.621,"If I may, Your Honor, I'd be glad to try and clarify it."
1957.130,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2426.32,2430.522,(Inaudible)
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2430.522,2432.759,"The policy, not the cash surrender value, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2432.759,2433.441,The policy.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2433.441,2446.934,"The policy was given but they say it was an out and out gift of the cash surrender value and of its subsequent accretions, and that it was up to the assignees alone to decide whether it should continue to exist or not."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2497.812,2511.694,"But there was nothing as a matter of law that would have prevented one of the eager beneficiaries who'd lost a lot of money and who needed cash getting even blasted, getting $50,000, let us say less, wouldn't it, as a matter of law?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2511.694,2514.604,"It would have taken all the beneficiaries but certainly not, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2519.244,2519.724,Yes.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2519.724,2521.554,And they were joint beneficiaries.
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2521.554,2522.565,Well suppose they --
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2522.565,2524.173,"All four of them -- yes, certainly not."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2527.96,2528.162,If they sometimes --
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2528.162,2528.951,And I make --
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2528.951,2539.135,"-- sometimes people take less cash because they're under pressure or whatnot or the spare of the old lady living, people live and come down to a hundred."
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2539.135,2540.318,"That could be so, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2556.651,2567.511,You mean the legal transaction in this case must be judged as to what took place rather than the legal consequences when the -- when the transactions were consummated?
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2567.511,2574.946,"No, I was referring, Your Honor, to the language about which does not in fact end before his death in the -- in the statute."
1957.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2574.946,2576.227,"Well, may I ask this, Mr. Baum --"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2576.227,2576.967,"Yes, sir."
1957.130,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2576.967,2590.027,"Supposed -- suppose that they did turn these policies in and take the face value before she died, would there been any tax due?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2590.027,2606.209,"That would have created a wholly new relationship, Your Honor, and I think if I may express my opinion, they would -- the -- the insurance policy is gone, the -- the beneficiaries or assignees have received the cash."
1957.130,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2637.109,2638.244,Now Mr. --
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2638.244,2638.582,"Yes, sir."
1957.130,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2638.582,2663.061,"-- Baum, though it may have been a bad business for this decedent to have purchased at Y dollars a policy or an annuity worth less money instantly after than she had paid for it, still legally proper for her to do it and to make a convenes of it isn't it?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2663.061,2665.202,"Legally proper, there is no doubt, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2665.202,2668.962,"Yes, now isn't that what she did or isn't?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2668.962,2671.194,She did it and what she did was legally proper.
1957.130,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2671.194,2671.637,All right.
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2681.042,2681.854,"It did, Your Honor."
1957.130,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2681.854,2689.079,"Now, then she had no right to any income for her life from that portion of that property thereafter, did she?"
1957.130,1,35411,myron_c_baum,,2689.079,2707.599,"That, Your Honor, depends on where the income is paid from and what I've tried to urge upon, Your Honor, is that this Court itself held in Le Gierse and quite correctly that that is an income upon the whole sum invested, namely, the amount invested in the insurance and in the -- and in the annuity."
1957.130,2,39957,robert_t_mccracken,,2860.195,2863.146,"May I just say one thing if, Your Honors, please."
1957.130,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2863.146,2863.455,Yes.
1957.130,2,39957,robert_t_mccracken,,2863.455,2879.258,I don't think I used quite all my time as to counsel's analogy of the single trust with reservation of income to the settler remainder to the children being this exact situation.
