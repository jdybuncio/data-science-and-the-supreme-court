1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,31.895,35.129,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,112.215,114.555,He didn't -- didn't retain the bill?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,114.555,114.995,Pardon me.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,114.995,116.333,He did not retain the bill?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,116.333,120.263,"No, Mr. Justice, he dismissed it."
1959.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,488.272,492.099,Who is this witness testify -- which witness was testifying on page 198?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,492.099,525.752,"That is Mr. Estren -- I'm sorry Mr. Levin who was the vice president of the district wholesalers, one of the three drug wholesalers in the district, who -- Mr. Aspirin -- Mr. -- Mr. S -- Mr. Levin -- sorry, was initially was approached by Parke Davis and then sometime later, he was again approached by Parke Davis with a complaint from Parke Davis that they had found an invoice of this company in one of the retail stores and thereafter, instructions went out to completely discontinue dealing with the company."
1959.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.752,527.014,That's the testimony.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,529.765,535.57,"Not -- well, it's -- we don't know whether it was accepted as true because the District Court did not refer to that."
1959.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.905,559.373,"Well, there were quite elaborate findings of fact by the District Court."
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,559.373,566.152,"They were quite elaborate findings of fact, but the findings of fact do not deal with respect with this issue of the --"
1959.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,566.152,566.329,But the testimony be --
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,566.329,590.001,"-- of the testimony except to one extent and we do challenge the finding to the extent that it suggests that Parke Davis did not discuss with the individuals that visited, what it was doing with respect to the other ones and that finding, we think is somewhat ambiguous, but we are not attacking in this case, the any -- with two miles exception to the specific findings in that area."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,788.128,797.083,"Was there any explicit indication that it presents if they did not fall in with the policy of Parke Davis, Parke Davis would not sell to them?"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,797.083,798.06,To the wholesalers Mr. --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,798.06,798.83,Yes.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,798.83,808.231,"There -- there was testimony by the wholesalers that they knew if they did not agreed to Parke Davis request', Parke Davis would cut them off."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,808.231,819.628,"I want to know if there's any expression by anybody on behalf of Parke Davis, not the inferences that would you please the likely inferences drawn by the wholesales."
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,832.171,842.626,They --
1959.20,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.626,864.075,"I think the findings of fact on page 34 -- on page 34 finding of fact 13 seems to state the District Court's views on the subject, this portion, page 34 of the record."
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,864.075,872.791,That as for -- that that the District Court concluded there was no evidence that they had solicited an agreement with them.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,873.529,883.97,"I'm not telling you -- I'm not talk -- talking about the legal of consequences of the answer, whatever it may be to my question, but you're not challenging that finding, are you?"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,883.97,887.505,We challenging it to the extent that it embodies a legal conclusion.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,887.505,903.256,"Well, I understand that but you're not challenging that the finding, you're not -- you -- you're not pointing to anything in the record whereby Parke Davis were explicit in saying if we do this of course you understand the consequences to any similar suggestions."
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,903.256,905.206,"I -- I don't think it was -- it was necessary, Mr. Justice."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,905.206,907.784,What I said is a different question?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,910.771,918.653,"There is nothing to show that they explicitly came and said, ""If you do not stop selling to these people, we will cut you off."""
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,919.637,932.051,"Was there any evidence that -- is there any evidence that such, they knew that that the inference could be drawn, I'm going over to your suggestion of it, the inference would -- could be drawn because of past experience."
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,932.051,933.368,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,938.322,940.411,That isn't my question.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,949.097,954.271,"There is nothing to show in this record that at anytime, a wholesale had been in the past --"
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,954.271,954.589,The reason --
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,954.589,954.803,-- cut off.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,954.803,962.797,"-- for my question is of course the Colgate case to which you will come, and the use of the term “coercion” by the judge in his opinion."
1959.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,962.797,962.97,Was there --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,962.97,967.998,So I want to know what exactly the facts are for which I can draw my inference.
1959.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,967.998,999.046,"Without finding 13, what does it say, if you -- what Parke Davis told the wholesalers at page 34, it says here and so the wholesalers in the District of Columbia generally that it would discontinue selling to them if they sold Parke Davis product to those retailers, (Inaudible)"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,999.046,1013.834,"Well I'm -- I'm sorry, I don't recollect the specific evidence in the record that reflected this conversation but I assume this finding is based on the implicit understanding of the --"
1959.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1013.834,1015.189,"You don't attack that, do you?"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1015.189,1015.684,"Oh, no."
1959.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1015.684,1019.812,"Haven't told -- told you say, the inference?"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1021.979,1024.664,"No, were not attacking that."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1024.664,1030.434,What you are attacking is the judges' failure to draw your inference on that finding.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1030.434,1032.496,We -- we think the inference had to be drawn from that.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1032.496,1035.058,And that's what you're after?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1035.058,1035.444,Yes.
1959.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1268.306,1275.749,But that did -- one retailer would say that if they get down -- the others would likewise (Inaudible)?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1275.749,1293.781,"There was not quite in those terms, there was testimony that they advised each of the retailers as to what the other was doing and in one instance I believe, one of the men did say that if it's agreeable with -- if the other people are doing it, I will do it."
1959.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1295.753,1300.36,Who is referred to?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1306.482,1318.922,"Yes, Mr. Justice and also with respect to Mr. Strauss of State Drugs, pages 119 and 120 of the record another one of the --"
1959.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1318.922,1319.787,119.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1319.787,1320.878,119 and 120.
1959.20,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1320.878,1322.692,19.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1322.692,1327.184,The way about six or eight lines from the bottom of the page.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1387.115,1396.787,"But if he -- but he does, if he pursues that conduct without announcing it, would that be -- offends the Sherman law as you conceive it?"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1406.951,1408.49,I don't think it would make any difference whether --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1408.49,1409.427,But it would not.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1409.427,1410.962,-- whether he used the words or not.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1416.066,1422.738,"It wasn't the fact that he announced that he is going to not deal with people who don't observe his price shifting, is that right?"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1422.738,1423.98,That is right and refuses to --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1423.98,1427.543,Are you asking us to overrule Colgate flat or you think that you can distinguish it?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1427.543,1428.93,We think that it can be distinguished.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1428.93,1430.613,Would you mind doing that when you get around to it?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1430.613,1432.316,I'll attempt to do it right now.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1447.001,1448.277,Both wholesalers and retailers.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1448.277,1449.759,Both wholesalers and retailers.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1449.759,1452.869,"And both announcing to wholesalers, they won't deal with them?"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1465.035,1465.849,If you had -- if -- if --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1465.849,1470.202,And announcing it and knowing that those consequences would follow?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1470.202,1479.717,"If -- if all we had was a mere announcement, I think that probably would be covered by Colgate, but that's not what we have in this case, we have a lot more than mere announcement."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1479.717,1480.847,What else have you got?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1480.847,1487.677,"We have the approaching of these individuals, requesting them affirmatively to cease dealing."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1488.707,1490.269,You don't think that was Colgate?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1490.269,1490.513,No.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1491.53,1496.069,You think Colgate were much more general in -- in trying to effectuate their policy?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1496.069,1508.699,"No, but I think as Colgate came to this Court on merely a construction of the indictment, this Court held that under the Colgate doctrine, there had been no agreement alleged in that case."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1508.699,1512.812,So was there agreement here for the president of club? You can call them agreement?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1512.812,1515.839,We -- we think there was an agreement going out of the fact that --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1515.839,1520.283,"This has been -- this was consensual rather than coercive, do you think?"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1520.283,1521.592,I think it was --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1521.592,1522.429,Consensual.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1522.429,1523.849,"It was coerced, I think --"
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1523.849,1523.906,Well --
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1523.906,1524.636,-- economic coercion.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1524.636,1525.882,Where is your disagreement?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1525.882,1530.963,But also (Voice Overlap) gave -- I think the coercion resulted a consensual undertaking.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1530.963,1533.517,But fellow that is coerced doesn't agree.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1537.502,1538.874,Well --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1538.874,1543.036,Of course he does that rather than suffer the consequences of not being good.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1543.036,1543.521,But I think they meant --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1543.521,1545.778,It wasn't an agreement?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1545.778,1547.63,There are many situations where --
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1547.63,1553.946,"Or rather, is it an agreement different from -- from Colgate, that's what I want to know?"
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1555.478,1555.695,No.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1556.107,1556.911,You're not.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1556.911,1557.287,No.
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1557.287,1558.252,Why not?
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1563.047,1571.225,"Well, I think because Colgate does reflect a basic right of a manufacturer, that a manufacturer has the right to select his customers."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1617.094,1631.418,"You think -- you think if this, if the Government wins this case and Parke Davis hadn't scrupulously followed Colgate, the result would be in the slightest different to the negligence or to commerce or to business or to anything."
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1631.418,1632.451,"I think it might, Mr. Justice."
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1632.451,1633.644,Accept the words.
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1633.644,1641.324,"I think it might, Mr. Justice, because I think without these devices of enforcing this policy that they will not be able carry the --"
1959.20,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1641.324,1650.797,"But -- but Colgate enforced them, people knew their business, they knew it, they didn't -- because they didn't live up that Colgate would cut them off, they told them so."
1959.20,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1650.797,1654.931,"Yes, but I think there's more here than is shown in the Colgate record."
1959.20,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1768.187,1774.494,Mr. Gesell.
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,1774.494,1776.43,May it please the Court.
1959.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.588,2112.794,Did the Colgate case come here after the trial or just from an indictment?
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2112.794,2114.455,"Pure -- purely pleading question, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1959.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2114.455,2115.624,It's only a matter of date.
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2115.624,2122.542,Very -- the absence of the indictment to plead agreement resulted in the indictment being thrown out.
1959.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2123.494,2127.172,(Voice Overlap) if there were allegations in that indictment of sales to hold up (Voice Overlap) --
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2127.172,2128.368,That -- that is right.
1959.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2128.368,2128.779,(Voice Overlap) --
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2128.779,2133.042,"Their allegations in the indictment of sales, the wholesalers but it came up on purely procedural basis."
1959.20,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2133.042,2134.101,Yes.
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2134.101,2145.034,"There were also wholesalers in Beech-Nut when the decree there was passed in by the Court, there was no prohibition against defying the Colgate rule to wholesalers."
1959.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2653.859,2668.159,May I ask you what -- that the Court made in the finding as to what the wholesalers did lamenting that count in finding 13 on page 34?
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2668.159,2682.515,"The finding is that the wholesalers, three of the wholesalers -- in finding 14, Mr. Justice Black, three of the wholesalers attempted to stop their sales of products to those retailers in order not to be cutoff themselves."
1959.20,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2689.055,2690.021,Where is this?
1959.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2690.021,2690.177,This --
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2690.177,2690.834,14
1959.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2690.834,2703.317,"This count -- this count 13 means -- on the finding 13 means that what Parke Davis said, “If you continue to sell to these people, we will cut you off.”"
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2703.317,2704.703,Yes.
1959.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2704.703,2711.506,So what does it mean if they do not continue to sell to them?
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2711.506,2716.548,"Well, if -- if they -- if they do not continue to sell to the price-cutting retailers --"
1959.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2716.548,2717.163,Suppose they agree with it.
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2717.163,2719.689,-- then they would remain customers of Parke Davis.
1959.20,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2719.689,2721.563,They agreed to continue not to sell?
1959.20,1,25417,gerhard_a_gesell,,2721.563,2721.926,"No, sir."
