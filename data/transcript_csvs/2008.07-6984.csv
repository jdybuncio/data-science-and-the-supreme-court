2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.57,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-6984, Jimenez v. Quarterman."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,7.337,21.163,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the Texas courts in this case reinstated the Petitioner's direct appeal, the Texas Court of Appeals decided that appeal like it would decide any other case on direct review."
2008.07-6984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.914,80.385,And you don't think you need to go beyond (A) to resolve the case?
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,80.385,81.868,"That's right, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,163.638,175.596,"So, does your position depend upon the proposition that we are not free to consider sort of a second direct appeal as part of the collateral review process?"
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,175.596,177.679,"It doesn't depend on it, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,191.336,195.39,I guess it doesn't -- or does it really make a difference?
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,214.602,217.554,"In many cases, but not all, including this one."
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,250.841,252.458,But does that really matter?
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,264.599,267.902,--It is -- it is the case that Congress wanted it done within one year.
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,270.553,271.004,Right.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,271.004,273.504,"So, there are four different possible start dates."
2008.07-6984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,375.339,386.647,"In the background of this case, Mr. Goldstein, is that in fact he didn't know the first time that his appeal had been dismissed."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,437.246,442.316,"Okay, can I answer that question, Justice Ginsburg, in two parts?"
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,539.112,540.23,"Oh, but is that right?"
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,549.586,550.086,That's correct.
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,666.561,683.587,"What about the State convicting, penalizing the defendant despite the fact that his constitutional right to competent counsel was -- he lost that right because of the failure of notification?"
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,683.587,686.705,It's just -- it's not regarded as an impediment.
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,750.132,753.184,Is this just a dispute about the label?
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,770.878,771.595,"No, sir."
2008.07-6984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.884,939.055,Suppose it is denied by -- by the State court.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,951.029,954.148,--I -- can I just ask one point of clarification?
2008.07-6984,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.437,969.49,"Suppose he institutes it, however, within the year."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,969.49,970.774,Okay.
2008.07-6984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1003.279,1007.032,And he can't go to Federal court until that is resolved?
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1007.032,1011.234,"--That is correct, because he has not exhausted his claim."
2008.07-6984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.516,1042.337,"If you do prevail, it is rather dramatic, because your client was stunningly negligent."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1046.122,1054.644,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the State, as I said, did not raise this argument in the place where we think it's appropriate, and that no record was built on laches."
2008.07-6984,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1068.618,1082.711,"May I ask if laches is something that the Texas court could bring up on its own, or is it for the State to raise or not as it chooses?"
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1082.711,1087.365,"--It is for the State to raise, and we cite our Texas authority for that in our reply brief, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-6984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1087.365,1096.221,Is the State statute that allows the early conviction to be set aside and the appeal reinstated -- do we have that statute?
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1096.221,1101.273,"Justice Kennedy, that is section 11 -- article 11.07."
2008.07-6984,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1101.273,1102.291,I thought I had it.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1103.308,1104.358,I do not believe you do.
2008.07-6984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1159.475,1175.885,"What happens -- just out of curiosity, a prisoner's lawyer doesn't take the appeal, the time expires, bong, the year begins to run."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1196.299,1201.969,"I have to ask one question, sir, because the answer is it depends."
2008.07-6984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.969,1202.485,Yes.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1202.485,1209.808,"The question is, when he files for Federal habeas corpus the first time in your hypothetical, I take it he doesn't raise the claim--"
2008.07-6984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1209.808,1210.241,No.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1210.241,1214.379,"--He raises a substantive claim, like the judge was biased against him and the like?"
2008.07-6984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1214.379,1215.029,Yes.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1215.029,1227.953,"That is regarded as a first habeas application, because the claim did not -- I think the judgment did not arise until later."
2008.07-6984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1230.789,1233.841,"I doubt that one -- I mean, one may never arise but--"
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1233.841,1236.876,--The strange thing is that it is an exhausted set of claims.
2008.07-6984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1240.578,1244.148,--The first one is proper and on your view so is the second one proper.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1246.933,1250.802,--It's proper in terms of it being exhausted.
2008.07-6984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1267.228,1268.513,"--No, nobody knows about this."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1268.513,1269.747,--But he -- but he was--
2008.07-6984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1269.747,1276.851,"No, but nobody knows that the State made a mistake in not giving him a direct review."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1276.851,1279.803,"--Your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, I took it to be--"
2008.07-6984,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1279.803,1280.97,"Oh, forget my hypothetical."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1282.504,1286.741,"--I think, though, I can tell you this with some confidence."
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1311.274,1318.53,"Well, except that you kind of elide the point that Congress and AEDPA quite clearly wanted these federal claims to be brought within a year."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1325.266,1334.955,"Well, in many cases, Mr. Chief Justice, of course, the State appeals can take 20 years to go up and down and back and forth from State post-conviction review."
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1389.542,1393.594,You said that it's unusual for the Texas State to grant these.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1402.432,1407.42,"I'm not sure I understand the -- the hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1411.055,1411.522,Yeah.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1423.846,1430.1,"Well, he is challenging his original -- Federal habeas corpus is reviewing the judgment in his case."
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1440.808,1447.128,"But is he challenging the first conviction, or is he challenging the failure of the State court to give him another direct appeal?"
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1447.128,1455.401,"He is challenging the fact that he was denied a direct appeal, which is a challenge to his actual conviction."
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1462.988,1470.244,"Well, that's I gather if he is granted the collateral -- the direct -- second direct appeal."
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1481.569,1491.574,The fact that the State post-conviction court did not remedy a violation of his constitutional rights on direct review does not create a new constitutional violation.
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1495.776,1499.161,"Well, doesn't it depend upon the allegation he wishes to make?"
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1514.187,1515.321,I don't think so.
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.773,1550.194,I guess my hypothetical supposes a new constitutional violation.
2008.07-6984,0,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1560.05,1561.568,"I understand, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-6984,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1570.423,1571.223,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,1576.327,1590.568,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress's commitment to preventing unnecessary delays in the filing of Federal habeas claims is reflected in section 2244(d)( 1)'s strict one-year limitations period."
2008.07-6984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1601.209,1608.863,"Well, why should that be, given the fact that the day it is going to run from is the day that -- which the State of Texas is willing to take action."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,1631.728,1638.882,"Your Honor, the reason is that in (d)( 1)(A) Congress set a uniform Federal rule for finality."
2008.07-6984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1654.058,1684.911,"Yes, but that -- in effect, I think that begs the question, because if -- if Texas says: Okay, we are going to -- we are going to recognize a direct appeal starting -- or a direct-appeal right exercisable now, then (d)( 1)(A) applies by its own terms exactly at the -- at the conclusion of the process which Texas has at this date chosen to allow."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,1703.623,1713.911,"Justice Souter, there is an independent Federal interest that the Court has recognized consistently in avoiding abusive and unnecessary delay in the filing of Federal habeas claims."
2008.07-6984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1713.911,1716.846,"Yeah, but we are -- we are concerned about State interests, aren't we?"
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,1716.846,1722.6,"Certainly, Justice Souter, and comity and finality are important purposes of AEDPA."
2008.07-6984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1772.533,1774.969,"Well, you have got a -- in a sense, you have got a patchwork now."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,1785.575,1798.898,"--But the difference is stark, Justice Souter, because the -- the dates that the States use for deadlines on initial direct appeal, the vast majority, are within a short timeframe, 20 days to 90 days, the vast majority."
2008.07-6984,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1806.738,1816.51,"But aren't they -- and I will -- you know, I will take the examples, but I mean, aren't they varied because the -- the circumstances of error which led to these late appeals vary, too?"
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,1819.379,1831.02,"--Well, it is correct, Justice Souter, that some States -- the remedy varies with the type of ineffective assistance of counsel, for example, the difference between not filing a notice of appeal or not filing a brief."
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1852.233,1856.587,Can't we leave that -- and you suggest that it is a Federal rule.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,1899.08,1903.948,"--Well, it's -- it's true, Your Honor, that the -- that States can fashion whatever remedy they want."
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1931.431,1932.717,Why -- why is it a strain?
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,1948.41,1949.81,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1949.81,1950.512,Okay.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,1983.297,1994.355,"It's true, Your Honor, that the -- that the -- the Texas court made a decision to give a remedy to this inmate that was meant to duplicate the type of claims he could have raised on direct appeal."
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2005.912,2008.714,"Well, I -- I was just going to stop you there."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2015.768,2019.72,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and it says, it became final by--"
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2019.72,2022.856,--by the conclusion of direct review.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2022.856,2025.658,--Or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.
2008.07-6984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2041.269,2048.239,"Even though, as in this case, it turned out he found out within a year."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2079.628,2095.72,"Not necessarily, Justice Ginsburg, and that's the reason why Congress already provided exceptions in the statute in the form of subsections (b) through (d) that provide later start dates for extenuating circumstances beyond the inmate's control."
2008.07-6984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2095.72,2102.91,"Mr. Goldstein just explained to us why those two provisions, the (b) and (d) would not work."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2104.16,2108.73,"I understand, Your Honor."
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2147.189,2148.805,Do you have a case to cite for that?
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2152.926,2153.776,I do--
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2153.776,2154.976,How do I resolve that dispute?
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2154.976,2156.045,"--I do, Your Honor."
2008.07-6984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2257.16,2269.468,--And Texas could -- and Texas could have gone into the State court and said: Don't give him the direct review; he waited four and a half years after he -- but the State didn't ask for that.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2269.468,2272.003,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-6984,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.044,2472.746,"Well, you're saying that 2 has a negative implication."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2472.746,2474.048,--I'm sorry?
2008.07-6984,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2474.048,2477.233,You are saying that 2 had a negative implication.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2488.54,2501.098,"That's -- well, that's correct, Your Honor, in the sense that if the State -- some collateral review in State court has to be pending for tolling to be going on."
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2517.191,2520.06,"When you say ""the first habeas petition"" you mean the first State habeas petition?"
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2520.06,2520.893,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2520.893,2521.426,Okay.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2521.844,2528.498,"And that first State habeas petition -- if you look -- if you look in the record, you will see the State habeas petition doesn't challenge anything about the underlying judgment."
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2547.143,2547.66,I'm sorry.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2554.566,2555.416,--That's correct.
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.979,2581.216,"That's assuming that he files the appeal within one year, right?"
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2581.216,2585.585,"That's -- I mean, if he does, that's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.585,2586.552,What if he doesn't?
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2586.552,2590.656,If he doesn't file his State habeas within one year?
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.656,2591.222,Yes.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2591.222,2592.941,"Your Honor, if he doesn't file--"
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.941,2593.791,The game is over.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2593.791,2599.345,"--Well, it would be, Your Honor, unless he fell into one of the exceptions provided by Congress in (B), (C), or (D)."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.345,2615.371,"What if he doesn't find out about the fact that notice, proper notice, wasn't given to his counsel, so he doesn't find out about the gravamen for the appeal until after a year?"
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2615.371,2619.258,"Your Honor, two points in response."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.879,2628.547,Right.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2628.547,2642.205,"And if he has attempted to contact the court and he still had not found out, the circumstances -- I mean, we've looked at a lot of these cases and there is just very few out there where an inmate who is being diligent is not going to be able to find out one way or the other."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.957,2672.024,I don't think (d)( 1)(B) does.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2680.78,2689.585,"--Well, presumably, Your Honor, the reason that he didn't would have -- if he was being diligent, if he was -- because he needs to be diligent."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.251,2691.785,Right.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2691.785,2692.235,"--and say,"
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.73,2714.681,I just made one up.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2715.883,2716.399,--Yes.
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2716.399,2717.016,But it works.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2775.836,2776.522,Exactly.
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2776.522,2777.938,And it's -- correct?
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2781.24,2781.607,No--
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2781.607,2794.816,--and the only difficulty of it is that you have to take a sort of leap of faith of some kind in attaching what everybody's calling the direct appeal as if it were actually part of the State habeas proceeding.
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.899,2799.768,"There is more of a problem than that, as the other side just said."
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2813.545,2813.995,(D).
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.995,2815.313,--is removed.
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2815.313,2816.33,"It's not (B), it's (D)."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.33,2820.532,"Oh, you said (D), not (B)."
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.532,2821.215,(D).
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2821.215,2835.475,"Well, I thought, Counsel, that your response to that was when you have a failure of counsel, that that is imputed to the State."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2840.111,2842.261,"--That's -- that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.671,2895.979,The problem with 1(D) is that the claim or claims presented that is referred to in (D) is not the denial of the appeal.
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2907.704,2909.054,But I think it's a good point.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2909.054,2921.261,"Well, you are exactly right, Justice Scalia, that (d)( 1)(D), in this case, because it is claim-specific it only does apply to the ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.204,2935.754,(B).
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2935.754,2941.175,--is -- is -- in play in the case because of the unique circumstances of this -- of this--
2008.07-6984,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2941.175,2946.929,"Between your response to the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, stand enlightened."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,2946.929,2956.101,"--It's the interplay of these two -- of these two provisions, because both of them in any particular case could be in play."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.624,2993.54,But that's your fault.
2008.07-6984,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2993.54,3021.774,"Texas could have -- not only, that don't some States have a limitation period when -- when he finds out that his appeal has been dismissed, without notice to him, aren't there some States, criminal justice systems, that say from the date that you had knowledge, you have X days to file?"
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,3021.774,3023.909,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3051.746,3064.47,"So, do I understand correctly that, based on your answers and your friend's answers, there is no difference between the way you two in substance read these provisions?"
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,3093.871,3095.571,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3098.422,3122.105,"Then it comes down -- it does come down to his, where he began his argument, which is he said that this is an unusual case where Texas is being overly generous to convicts, because you choose to label it as direct appeal and therefore that means someone that the States allow to have another direct appeal, even though they have been non-diligent, get the benefit of the -- of a new finality date."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,3122.105,3130.442,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and our position is that Texas -- not Texas or any State can rewrite the -- this Federal statute and a finality date in this Federal statute."
2008.07-6984,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.845,3190.082,"Convicted felons don't always make intelligent decisions, you are saying."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,3190.082,3191.099,That's correct.
2008.07-6984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.142,3241.58,"Am I correct that on the underlying merits of the basic claims, that each -- his lawyer filed an Anders brief?"
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,3241.58,3243.698,"--That's correct, Justice--"
2008.07-6984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3243.698,3248.519,"He's probably not a very -- he's not -- has the greatest in the world of succeeding, I wouldn't suppose."
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,3253.988,3258.125,"--Your Honor, a lot of them are."
2008.07-6984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.217,3283.073,What strikes me about the case is we are fighting about the limitations and whether it applies and so forth; you probably could have disposed of the whole litigation a lot faster by just looking at the merits for about ten minutes.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,3283.073,3286.275,"--I think that is exactly right, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-6984,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3290.013,3293.798,This is all -- this is a product of Congress trying to save us all time.
2008.07-6984,1,41555,sean_d_jordan,,3295.431,3297.75,--Indeed.
2008.07-6984,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3313.878,3315.494,Thank you Mr. Jordan.
2008.07-6984,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3317.83,3319.196,"Thank you, sir."
2008.07-6984,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3429.818,3433.77,What about -- he cited most prominently the Evitts case.
2008.07-6984,3,41555,sean_d_jordan,,3433.77,3443.745,"That's a State action, but as the Court's questioning indication, the question is, is State action that is an impediment to filing a Federal habeas petition, and all of our cases answered that question."
2008.07-6984,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3513.036,3514.536,"Thank you, counsel."
