2000.00-346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.94,"We'll hear now argument next in 00-346, Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corporation v. Garris."
2000.00-346,0,30292,james_t_ferrini,,21.714,25.885,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court--"
2000.00-346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.615,93.871,"Mr. Ferrini, how does your case differ from the Kermarec case, the one this Court decided in 1959?"
2000.00-346,0,30292,james_t_ferrini,,93.871,120.166,"In Kermarec, Your Honor, which involved negligence, the negligence was negligence in the operation of a vessel, either with it navigating or the manner in which it was operated, but nothing like our case where we have a local enterprise that was operating a crane that was located on a pier over a--"
2000.00-346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,120.166,129.166,"But it was... that case did recognize, didn't it, a claim for negligence under general maritime law?"
2000.00-346,0,30292,james_t_ferrini,,129.166,161.488,"--Your Honor, I believe it did, but again, that was a case of a visitor on a vessel, and the captain of the vessel had an obligation to make sure that the stairway was in good condition, etcetera, but there you're dealing with a concept which I think to be very akin to that in Moragne."
2000.00-346,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.009,199.3,"But Moragne dealt with... by its terms at any rate... with unseaworthiness, and the question you've presented here is whether Moragne is a basis for also extending that doctrine to negligence as well as unseaworthiness, and yet in Kermarec it seems that we've already recognized a general maritime claim for negligence."
2000.00-346,0,30292,james_t_ferrini,,203.015,241.282,"Your Honor, I think what we have to do is look at the concept of uniformity in the context of Article 3, Section 2 in the Federalist Papers, and think in terms of why is it that this particular body of law, as of all bodies of law there are... this substantive body of admiralty is given to this Court and to Congress, and the purpose is so that the nation speaks with one voice under circumstances where there can be an impact on our relationship with our partners in trade."
2000.00-346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.282,258.166,"Well, Mr. Ferrini, the question which we granted certiorari, I thought, was whether a general maritime law cause of action for wrongful death in negligence exists or should exist."
2000.00-346,0,30292,james_t_ferrini,,288.26,288.714,The way they are--
2000.00-346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.714,298.907,"Suppose I say yes, Moragne extends to wrongful death based on negligence, but does it extend to totally land based action like this?"
2000.00-346,0,30292,james_t_ferrini,,300.598,310.258,"--Your fourth circuit, Your Honor, quite frankly, the focus of the court and the parties was upon what does Moragne create rather than should it create an exception."
2000.00-346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.258,312.365,"Well, answer my question."
2000.00-346,0,30292,james_t_ferrini,,333.586,350.593,"I think it's certainly open, Your Honor, because when we... when you made your decision in Moragne, the idea was not just is there a general cause of action for all circumstances for wrongful death?"
2000.00-346,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.133,375.9,I just didn't think you raised that here.
2000.00-346,0,30292,james_t_ferrini,,391.631,403.52,"--Your Honor, with all due respect, I view our question as having been raised as whether there is a wrongful death cause of action under the circumstances with which the Court is presented."
2000.00-346,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,403.52,410.784,"But you're arguing... the limitation, it seems to me... death wouldn't matter."
2000.00-346,0,30292,james_t_ferrini,,433.447,436.009,"If he were on the vessel at the time, as he was, yes, he would."
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1658.277,1664.964,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1692.539,1701.373,Is this the same thing that Justice O'Connor inquired of your opponent about there being all land based actors here?
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1701.373,1702.282,Well--
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.282,1708.31,"Are those two different things, or is it basically a rephrasing of the same thing?"
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1708.31,1716.733,"--Well, we would not contend... we would not agree with the characterization that... it is true that Mr. Garris did not live aboard the ship."
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.733,1718.235,"He was a longshoreman, wasn't he?"
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1718.235,1720.199,He was a ship repair worker.
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.199,1723.254,A ship repair worker who did not live on the ship.
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1723.254,1724.861,That is correct.
2000.00-346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1726.885,1736.983,And the employer was a land based contractor who did work on ships at dock to repair them.
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1736.983,1739.062,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2000.00-346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1739.433,1739.888,Yes.
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1741.829,1742.405,--No.
2000.00-346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1742.405,1743.52,No.
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1743.52,1757.062,"The defendant was a subcontractor to Norshipco that was hired to sandblast the hulls inside the vessel, and Mr. Garris was asked to assist in that effort."
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.842,1787.981,"But Kermarec, Kermarec sued the vessel owner."
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1787.981,1789.3,"Yes, sir."
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.3,1791.446,And here you did not sue the vessel owner.
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1791.446,1792.272,No.
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.272,1805.253,"So the case is therefore distinct in, factually anyway, from Kermarec."
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1805.253,1806.352,It is.
2000.00-346,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.73,1845.444,"And Kermarec... negligence under Federal admiralty law was not discussed, I take it, because there was apparently parallel to the state negligence law which was adequate?"
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1847.135,1863.482,"I read Kermarec as suggesting that the law was different; in fact, that there was a contributory negligence law under the State statute in that under maritime law, comparative negligence would apply."
2000.00-346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1866.759,1879.746,"Well, I thought Kermarec was an unseaworthiness case, and that this Court did not address whether there was a Federal admiralty cause of action based on negligence."
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1880.96,1882.263,"--I think that's Moragne, Your Honor."
2000.00-346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1885.607,1887.343,"Well, there was negligence under New Jersey law--"
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1887.343,1889.034,--New York.
2000.00-346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1889.034,1890.687,"Well, I'll read it again."
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1893.287,1893.287,Kermarec--
2000.00-346,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1893.287,1900.346,--with reference... Kermarec with reference to Federal admiralty law of negligence in a wrongful death case.
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1900.346,1929.696,"--That in Kermarec the law regarding comparative negligence would be the rule rather than state contrib... contributory negligence rule, and also that the State rules regarding different duties owed to invitees, licensees and the other classifications would not apply in maritime law because maritime law had rejected those types of distinctions in favor of a uniform reasonable care under the circumstances test."
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.588,1965.695,"And the Court, as I understand in Kermarec, the Court there said that because the guy was a visitor, there was no duty of seaworthiness owed to him."
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1965.695,1966.659,Correct.
2000.00-346,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.038,1971.101,Casual visitor.
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,1971.101,1973.618,--Social visitor is what the Court described him as.
2000.00-346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2023.363,2034.88,"But we have... we have talked in terms of general maritime duties, I guess, which could include negligence, a duty not to be negligent."
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,2034.88,2037.952,"--Absolutely, and the Court--"
2000.00-346,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2037.952,2043.797,But I'm not sure that it extends to all land based actors.
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,2043.797,2045.943,"--Well, I... I would agree."
2000.00-346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2060.311,2063.199,"And that was the case in Robins too, wasn't it?"
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,2063.199,2064.48,--Yes.
2000.00-346,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2064.48,2066.005,You cited Robins a moment ago.
2000.00-346,1,38205,patrick_h_odonnell,,2072.858,2074.8,I would submit not.
2000.00-346,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2091.723,2121.899,"Well, why isn't that something that the Court should now respect, even if it made no sense but it was... it emerges from the English common law, that there was no common law action for wrongful death, and now we have DOHSA and we have the possibility of picking up State wrongful death acts for watery deaths. Why couldn't one say, even if it made no sense, this distinction."
