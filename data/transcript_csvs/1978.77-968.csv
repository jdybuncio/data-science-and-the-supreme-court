1978.77-968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.813,"We'll hear arguments next in 968, Detroit Edison Company against the Labor Board."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,63.608,66.474,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-968,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.013,171.487,"Since this isn't a Title VII case, how does that bear on your argument here?"
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,171.487,175.886,It bears on the argument of the relevance of the test items to the Union.
1978.77-968,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.311,196.729,"Whereas if a test were not predictive at all, you would feel the Union had a greater right of access to it?"
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,196.729,198.049,Yes.
1978.77-968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,206.073,208.348,But you wouldn't want the general disclosure?
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,208.348,213.173,"No, I would not want general disclosure because that ruins the validity of the test."
1978.77-968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,213.173,219.747,"Well, does Detroit Edison object to the disclosure to -- what was sorted by the hearing examiner here?"
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,219.747,221.215,"No Your Honor, it did not."
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,557.58,559.821,But that wouldn't compromise the test.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,559.821,564.819,"No, it would not compromise the test but it would compromise the validity as seen by the EEOC."
1978.77-968,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.065,608.583,I'm puzzled by your reliance on the EEOC guidelines as compared with the Board's action here because as I recall the EEOC is not charged by law with making interpretative with actually filling in blanks in the statute.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,617.17,623.699,"Well, by reliance on the EEOC's guidelines Your Honor is the reliance that this Court placed on those guidelines in the decisions that I mentioned."
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.699,633.597,We had -- they've been -- we've never said that the EEOC power is equivalent to a -- a pow -- a what -- to a board or an agency that has power to issue regulations.
1978.77-968,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.597,637.77,And we refuse to follow them in Gilbert versus General Electric.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,637.77,638.938,Well that's correct.
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.617,685.406,But there was on the test.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,685.406,686.726,That there was on the test.
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.726,692.507,And then do you say we -- that that restriction does not satisfy you?
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,692.507,701.887,"Yes, like dissenting Judge White on the Court of Appeals, I can only suggest to you that the Board's position is really naïve in the real world in which we find ourselves."
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.952,755.088,Do you think you could rely though on a -- on the Union's --
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,755.088,755.676,Psychologist?
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.676,756.64,-- psychologist?
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,756.64,765.062,"Yes, that psychologist is under a professional responsibility not to divulge tests and test scores linked with the name of the applicant."
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.319,775.112,But do you think we must assume the Union would disobey an order.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,775.112,778.41,"No, I don't think that you have to under -- make that assumption."
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,829.213,830.078,Mr. McGuinn.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,830.078,830.585,Yes sir.
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,830.585,835.734,"I missed something, why is it the psychiatrist important to see this?"
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,835.734,843.52,The psychologist -- the importance of the psychologist to this Mr. Justice Marshall is that what we have here is an aptitude exam.
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,846.19,846.826,(Inaudible)
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,846.826,847.847,-- of the Instrument Man.
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,848.015,850.906,Aren't they experts in the testing business.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,850.906,853.811,The psychologists are the experts in the testing business.
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,853.94,856.181,There are other than psychologists?
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,856.181,856.815,Pardon.
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,856.815,859.912,There are some experts who are not psychologists.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,859.912,861.736,"Well that's correct too, Your Honor."
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,861.736,862.731,Yes.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,862.731,863.629,But I think that --
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,863.629,869.112,"But these are testers, these psychologists are experts in the testing field."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,869.112,869.242,Yes.
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,869.242,871.288,That's what you were looking for.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,871.288,871.754,That's right.
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,871.754,873.495,(Inaudible)
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,873.495,888.123,"I can fully understand why the expertise of a psychologist would be an important ingredient in the devising of these test batteries but I should think any school boy could mark the papers so to speak, couldn't he?"
1978.77-968,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,888.123,888.853,Yes the marking of the paper --
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,888.853,889.427,Or any (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,889.427,891.183,-- is basically a clerical function.
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,891.183,891.728,Exactly.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,893.615,895.378,There are multiple choice questions.
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,897.389,901.131,"I mean, a machine could almost do it."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,901.131,902.715,Yes.
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,904.958,908.069,But any layman -- any letter layman could do it.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,908.069,913.715,That is correct and we have people within the psychology group who do actually grade these tests.
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,913.715,917.696,"But you don't need a psychologist's expertise to grade them, do you?"
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,917.696,918.882,No you do not.
1978.77-968,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.293,945.169,"Mr. McGuinn, in the Griggs case and I do not mean to delay this point unduly, where you in your brief quoted as saying that EEOC guidelines are to be regarded as expressing the will of Congress and you have a page citation to Griggs at 401 U.S.433-434."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,961.705,967.001,Of course.
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1180.575,1182.495,"Mr. McGuinn, to go back for a moment to what --"
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1182.495,1182.522,Yes.
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1182.522,1184.144,-- you just told us.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1192.828,1193.812,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1193.812,1194.483,You do.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1194.483,1195.675,Yes.
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1195.675,1196.709,And therefore you do --
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1196.709,1207.328,And we think that that was a valid way of responding to the Union's request for information that we didn't have to respond to it in exactly the way the Union wanted to get it.
1978.77-968,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1213.899,1216.996,And you do concede that 8 (a) (5) required it as much as you did.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1216.996,1218.911,"Turn over the validation studies, yes."
1978.77-968,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1280.635,1284.326,"Mr. McGuinn, just to follow up on Justice Stewart's question."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1296.403,1299.223,Without an actual case or controversy in other words?
1978.77-968,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1299.223,1300.41,Correct.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1300.41,1305.275,I think that this would have to be in conjunction with a real live -- life case.
1978.77-968,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.805,1315.017,"Yes, but once the arbitration proceeding was over, did not the -- of course the inquiry become academic?"
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1315.017,1330.318,Well it is not strictly speaking academic now because the arbitrator pursuant to the agreement of both parties said that the arbitration proceeding could be reinstituted if the testing materials were in fact ordered to be produced by a Court.
1978.77-968,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1330.318,1333.095,But didn't he conclude they were unnecessary for his decision?
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1333.095,1333.574,That's right.
1978.77-968,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1339.145,1353.26,I'm just a little puzzled as to whether we should decide the case on the theory that they're needed for this particular arbitration which may be reopened or if they're needed in sort of a general way for future use and bargaining whatever may arise.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1363.503,1380.324,"Well, that's an interesting point whether an academic inquiry that comes in out of the blue, we would like to see XYZ material concerning your testing program whether that would lead to an 8 (a) (5) kind of an answer."
1978.77-968,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.868,1396.242,"Well, then I think I'm asking for a clarification of your answer to Justice Stewart."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1398.705,1399.224,Yes.
1978.77-968,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.224,1399.641,It was.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1399.641,1402.372,"It was, strictly speaking."
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.372,1417.342,"Suppose after a grievance has been processed, arbitrated, the Union just files an unfair labor practice claim that in the course of the arbitration, the employer committed an unfair labor practice."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1424.128,1430.341,Well my question would be what is the request now relevant to of the arbitration proceeding is over?
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1430.341,1437.877,The request -- all that -- what they want adjudicated is that the employer did commit an unfair labor practice.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1437.877,1439.871,"Well, in order to commit an unfair labor practice, we would have had to --"
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.871,1449.476,"Well, I know but they proceeded -- the request was made in the course of a -- and refused in a course of a grievance procedure --"
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1449.476,1449.602,Alright.
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1449.602,1458.115,"-- and that time, the Union thought the employer was breached -- was committing an unfair labor practice and it -- best they took it to the board."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1458.115,1464.267,"Apparently, the premise of your hypothetical was that the arbitration proceeding is now over."
1978.77-968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1464.267,1466.138,We'll resume there at one o'clock Mr. McGuinn.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1466.138,1487.252,"Alright, thank you."
1978.77-968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1487.252,1489.757,"Mr. McGuinn, you may resume."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1489.757,1490.286,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.603,1536.366,That wasn't my question.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1536.366,1537.837,Maybe if you could repeat your question.
1978.77-968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1537.837,1542.716,"Well, an hour has elapsed, let Mr. Justice White try it again."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1542.716,1543.257,Yes.
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.257,1553.227,"Well, suppose in an election, in a Union election campaign, the employer threatens some workers, “if you vote, I'll fire you or something”."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1564.682,1568.298,"No, it will not Your Honor."
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.352,1578.854,But they don't want the information.
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1584.396,1589.709,"Yes, that -- it would not be moot just because the arbitration was concluded.Does that answer your question?"
1978.77-968,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.709,1590.73,"Yes, it does."
1978.77-968,0,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,1590.73,1591.663,I would like to reserve the remaining time.
1978.77-968,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.663,1599.313,Very well.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1604.137,1608.73,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.2,1792.941,Mr. Come.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1792.941,1793.399,Yes sir.
1978.77-968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.399,1809.866,Did the company before the board take the position that the administrative law judge's order was correct?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1809.866,1834.442,"Well, in two places in its exceptions which we have lodged with the clerk, they urged and the word urge is theirs, the Board to adopt that part of the administrative law judge's recommended order."
1978.77-968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.532,1858.565,But they have no reason to accept to the -- his proviso that it'd be turned over only to a psychologist and since that favored them rather disfavor them.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1858.565,1860.386,That is their argument.
1978.77-968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.838,1865.5,"Well, it's not only their argument, but it's rather self-evident, isn't it?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1865.5,1896.61,"However, when the Union cross accepted to that part of the order, it is our contention that that put the company unnoticed that they would -- might lose even that part of the order and therefore, in order to protect themselves, they should have raised what the Board, at least the alternative contention that we don't think that we committed any unfair labor practice here to begin with."
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2044.24,2048.77,They didn't really asked for definitions that they were multiple choice questions --
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2048.77,2049.478,That is correct.
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2050.255,2052.485,Yes.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2052.485,2053.37,-- they wanted to know if --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2053.37,2053.623,Yes.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2053.623,2056.197,-- they could recognize what that word meant.
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2056.197,2058.487,Or what they did not mean.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2058.487,2059.308,Or what they did not mean.
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2059.308,2065.308,"In a multiple choice test, you don't need to know all the meaning of all the words."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2065.308,2067.029,"Well, it helps if you do."
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2067.029,2072.791,"Well, yes it does but you -- if you know the range you're in."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2072.791,2074.045,Yes.
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.981,2129.474,Well it seems to me that that's fundamentally inconsistent position that you described the Union is taking.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2176.291,2176.63,"Well, the --"
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2176.63,2184.701,"-- that's all conceded but that's true of any aptitude test, unless you get a 10%, I mean a 100% correlation factor."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2184.701,2200.333,But under the contract that was negotiated in which the Union as the representative of the employees has a duty to see that it has thoroughly administered the con --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2200.333,2204.921,Which requires for a promotion by seniority at the Monroe Plant except (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2204.921,2213.611,Except where there are head and shoulder differences among the applicants.
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2213.611,2214.099,Right.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2214.099,2225.214,Now the cast was a statistical major of trying to --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2225.214,2226.69,Of measuring the head and shoulder differences.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2226.69,2227.571,Yes but it was not --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2227.571,2230.615,Does the Union concede it's valid and reliable?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2230.615,2238.303,As -- but they are not conceding that the test will be 100% accurate --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2238.303,2240.442,But the employer (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2240.442,2244.512,-- nor is the company conceding that the test is a 100% --
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2244.512,2249.62,You're asking for a perfect test and that's impossible.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2249.62,2253.74,But there in lies the basis for a grievance.
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2266.005,2268.279,Who were between 9.3 and 10.3?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2268.279,2269.546,Who should have been reexamined --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2269.546,2270.84,And the company hired one of them.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2270.84,2277.454,"-- and on reexamining them, the company found that the qualifications of at least of one of them --"
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2277.454,2277.705,Yes.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2277.705,2283.26,-- was sufficient to override his low score on the test.
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2316.4,2318.325,"Oh, when you just throw out the test?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2318.325,2319.327,No.
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2319.327,2323.196,I don't see that that's at all a consistent position.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2340.968,2342.147,I submit that --
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2342.147,2357.258,"What more could the company do than reexamine the three that were raised and when they make a judgment, it isn't necessarily a judgment that they were wrong in the first time but they were willing on marginal case to take a chance."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2359.56,2376.466,I submit that all that the validity or the test shows that it has a statistical probability that they are still going to be employees who would -- could be shown are capable of performing their job notwithstanding their showing on the test.
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2376.466,2379.525,"Well, we know and the testing field generally but that's true."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2386.567,2414.027,But the point that I'm making is because our basic position is that the company is not conceding -- has not accepted that the union's right to this information as to -- is merely to show that why the Board in framing the kind of order that it framed did not require the Union to go to the expense of necessarily hiring a union psychologist.
1978.77-968,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.525,2434.926,"Mr. Come, can I get something straight."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2434.926,2436.377,Yes.
1978.77-968,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.377,2441.888,You give the example of the vocabulary multiple choice question and said that might not have anything to do with the job.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2457.223,2464.961,I think that they need to know the names of the employees and link them to the scores.
1978.77-968,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.961,2469.884,"But they would not know which questions they missed and which they got correct, would they?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2473.979,2474.889,Yes.
1978.77-968,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2474.889,2483.056,The material that must be disclosed is -- does it include the actual tests that the employees took or merely their scores and a master copy of the test.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2483.056,2484.886,No there are actual test papers as well.
1978.77-968,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2484.886,2485.78,Oh I see.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2487.029,2504.38,So that the Union could have the whole -- without the whole picture you would not know whether X scored low because he missed the physical science and mathematical questions that were germane to the Instrument Man job or not.
1978.77-968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2509.412,2516.199,Well I can see how you -- the Union could take that position if it hadn't conceded that the tests were relevant.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2536.451,2553.981,But as the administrative law judge pointed out in his report on page 47a of the appendix to the position -- to the petition.
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2640.159,2651.949,"Mr. Come, once you have conceded, once everyone agrees as they apparently do here that these tests are valid, that they have an objective purpose and they're fulfilling that purpose."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2672.275,2673.312,Yes.
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2705.098,2706.475,"Well, then the (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2706.475,2714.767,The individual has a right under these procedures we submit to show that his case should not be covered by the general law.
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2714.767,2730.972,But if you're going to rely on individual appeals of each case which is what this surmounts to then why not just scrap the whole testing process what the employer make his management decisions that the Union got -- have a grievance on anyone that he does -- they don't like.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2730.972,2733.054,"Oh, because the test is a tool."
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2848.319,2852.375,"What about the scores, individual scores?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2852.375,2869.493,"Well, as we read the terms of the protective order which are set forth on page 55a, when the Board --"
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2869.493,2871.414,"Of what, of the?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2871.414,2876.064,Of the appendix.
1978.77-968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.418,2879.83,The appendix to the petitioner?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2879.83,2885.901,Appendix to the petitioner.
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.631,2924.409,"So you -- and any information off the test papers, I take it."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2924.409,2925.666,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.666,2935.74,I mean do you think it would violate this order if somebody said John Jones got a minus 61?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2935.74,2944.094,Well I think that there would but -- that it would because the Union show -- except in connection with the arbitration proceeding.
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.094,2946.228,Yes.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2950.89,2954.786,As I interpret the order.
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.635,2960.762,How did the Union interpret it?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2960.888,2960.964,"Well, --"
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2960.964,2964.665,-- do you know?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2964.665,2970.701,I don't know how they interpret it but I'd be surprised if they did interpret it any differently.
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.372,2992.18,Of course the case isn't over yet.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2992.18,2994.144,No the case is not over.
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.142,3039.212,"That would be at the behest to the Board, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3039.212,3042.568,That would be at the behest of the Board but there's no --
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.568,3045.886,"The general counsel, the general counsel?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3045.886,3050.077,The Board must bring the contempt proceeding.
1978.77-968,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.077,3053.763,And the company has to ask them and then they have to respond.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3053.763,3072.502,That is correct but there is no reason to assume that the Board which is interested in seeing that its orders as enforced by the Court of Appeals are not flouted would not be very alert to checking any contempt there but --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3072.502,3082.19,But the Union wasn't -- the object of the -- for this where the Union wasn't a party in the Board proceeding or in the Court of Appeals --
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3082.19,3082.655,Well --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3082.655,3084.496,"-- and the order didn't run against the Union, --"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3084.496,3085.479,Well --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3085.479,3086.414,-- did it?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3086.414,3087.718,I submit that the --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3087.718,3089.995,Did it as a matter of fact?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3089.995,3097.123,"Well, it did not run against it except insofar as of the terms on the --"
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3097.123,3099.71,It's a condition of it -- of the turn over to the Union.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3099.71,3100.341,That is correct.
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3100.341,3105.901,"But I -- if I were representing the Union and somebody cited me in contempt, I think I'd have a very good case."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3105.901,3110.19,But I don't think that you would prevail for this reason Your Honor.
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3116.804,3118.162,"It was a charging party, wasn't it?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3118.162,3119.536,That is correct.
1978.77-968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3215.943,3222.267,"But it has had a historic resistance to the test too, hasn't it?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3222.267,3224.608,"Well, I think all that the --"
1978.77-968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3224.608,3226.152,Rather than seniority?
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3226.152,3240.861,"Well, all that the record shows on that is that it attempted to obtain in the contract a provision that would make seniority the sole governance for promotions."
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3259.817,3265.89,"No, no, it does -- well, at the -- not this unit of the Union which is only the Monroe Plant, isn't it?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3265.89,3268.01,"Well, it does represent the Monroe Plant."
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3268.01,3269.535,"Yes, but and only --"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3269.535,3269.684,And --
1978.77-968,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3269.684,3272.235,-- and then all the people who got these jobs were from other plants.
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3272.235,3277.667,"But when they came into this bargaining unit, they'd be represented by this unit -- Union."
1978.77-968,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.26,3294.733,"Well, into the extent that the arbitrator throws out the company's decision to promote some who did well on the test scores, they too are Union members, are they not?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3294.733,3296.497,That is correct.
1978.77-968,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3296.497,3300.377,"Mr. Come, can you clarify something for me please?"
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3333.984,3341.884,"Well, I think that test would assist it in this sense."
1978.77-968,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3351.036,3352.586,Well let's assume that --
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3352.586,3375.018,And I think that the Union rather than just willy-nilly attempting to show that the employee was capable of doing the job wanted also to see what were the types of questions that he missed on the test.
1978.77-968,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3440.992,3468.085,"But if Smith had been an Instrument Man B in another utility plant and had received the highest rating for his performance and let's assume further that he was the lowest man on this test scores, I don't understand how it would make any difference in the Union's effort to prove that he was confident to do the job head and shoulders above anybody else because it already proved it."
1978.77-968,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3468.085,3489.618,"Now, these men were not instrument -- formerly Instrument Men so you had to take analogous job skills and in making that showing, I submit that where he failed on or -- on the test would be helpful in that regard."
1978.77-968,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3489.618,3491.731,Your time has expired Mr. Come.
1978.77-968,2,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,3495.988,3496.528,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-968,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3570.615,3570.879,Mr. --
1978.77-968,2,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,3570.879,3570.995,And I think --
1978.77-968,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3570.995,3571.392,-- McGuinn.
1978.77-968,2,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,3571.392,3571.793,Yes.
1978.77-968,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3571.793,3577.736,"Let me go back for a second, why couldn't he -- you made an offer and they turned it down.Why can't you withdraw it later?"
1978.77-968,2,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,3577.736,3581.995,Because I think that we made an offer to the administrative law judge as well as to the Union.
1978.77-968,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3581.995,3582.408,Right.
1978.77-968,2,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,3582.408,3594.592,"And the administrative law judge was a part of this process too and I just think it would be undercutting the commitment if you will, that we gave to the administrative law judge that this is something that we could live with."
1978.77-968,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3594.592,3596.06,I don't understand why?
1978.77-968,2,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,3601.615,3601.855,"Well, I think that's --"
1978.77-968,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3601.855,3602.319,Was that done all the time?
1978.77-968,2,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,3602.319,3605.168,-- taking a very technical and mechanistic --
1978.77-968,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3605.168,3605.196,"Yes, but it would --"
1978.77-968,2,32026,john_a_mcguinn,,3605.196,3605.533,-- approach to some --
