2013.12-9012,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.837,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 12-9012, Robers v. United States."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,7.87,11.472,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-9012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,68.994,78.1,"When you said fully returned, it wouldn't be fully returned if the debt was greater than the value of the property."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,78.1,89.824,"The property would be fully returned and the property right that -- that is the -- the right to foreclose is returned upon the default, Your Honor."
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,89.824,91.174,"Well, let me just make it clear."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,109.052,109.821,No.
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,111.871,112.339,Okay.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,112.339,121.029,Our position is only that the property has to be valued at the time that the foreclosure or sheriff's auction takes place because that--
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,121.029,121.795,And one more -- one more question.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,137.739,141.274,"--There is -- there is not any required appraisal, Your Honor."
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,141.274,141.574,Okay.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,141.574,152.331,"But frequently, our understanding is that lenders who credit bid for those properties will, in fact, conduct an appraisal because they want to know how much they should credit bid for the property."
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,153.081,156.283,"Counsel, I have two related questions."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,217.674,218.443,--No.
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,218.443,234.202,And 36 -- 3663(2) appears to be the return of the property at sentencing or sometime thereafter.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,234.202,234.702,That's right.
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,234.702,246.276,"So it doesn't seem to be controlling earlier return of property, and yet we're sort of stuck in that model that somehow it has to be an either/or."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,322.426,325.378,The whole idea is to make the victim whole.
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,352.429,354.314,But money is fungible.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,354.314,364.77,"--Money is -- money is fungible, but so are property and money fungible, and in exactly the way that -- that my friend on the other side of the podium suggests here."
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.332,392.437,"Is that all we're talking -- you know, if I were arguing your side of the case, I would -- I would not say that the bank got defrauded of money."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,455.53,457.882,"--That's -- that's correct, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-9012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.34,483.196,What would happen if it turned out that the property was worth more on the date of sentencing than it was on the date of foreclosure?
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,483.196,485.798,Then two things might happen.
2013.12-9012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.467,546.271,"Well, how do you arrive at the foreclosure amount?"
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,571.169,575.873,"Not that -- not that we know of, but we don't know exactly what the lender did."
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,629.692,635.929,"Can you answer this -- could you answer it just happens, not this case, an ordinary case."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,684.493,688.062,"In -- in that instance, Your Honor, under our theory--"
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,688.062,689.578,Not under your theory.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,697.084,698.518,--If she accepted the bat--
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.518,699.334,"Yes, she did."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,700.62,701.003,--Okay.
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,705.355,705.705,Perfect.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,707.607,709.658,I would--
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,709.658,712.593,"Wouldn't you say it comes under A, because, after all--"
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,712.593,713.127,--But the--
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,713.127,715.979,"--if -- if -- he doesn't have the 100,000, does he?"
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,740.278,741.128,"--Well, you have to--"
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,741.128,747.434,"They'll read it while -- while I make these criticisms, and then they'll show me on the government's side I haven't read it correctly."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,758.322,765.912,"--But -- but what B tells us to do is when to value the bat, and that's why B actually applies, because--"
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,765.912,767.662,And is that -- is that how the courts have run this?
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,774.934,776.084,--Right.
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,776.084,783.624,"And, in fact, they will return the money, but it has to be less the value of something that's already been given to those individuals."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,783.624,783.824,Right.
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.774,787.124,I guess it would be up to the judge.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,787.124,787.524,Right.
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,787.524,799.432,"The judge is not -- there for something, and the judge would, in fact, normally, if she sold the bat, take the -- take the value at the time she sold it."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,820.528,827.267,"Well, it may work that very same way in that -- in that B tells us value it at the greater of the date of loss or at the date of sentencing."
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,827.751,828.701,That's my whole point.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,839.159,840.225,--Right.
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,840.225,847.513,"But -- well, that's not the government's point, because the government wants to value it as of the date of the sentencing."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,860.405,863.374,But what if she doesn't sell the bat is our point.
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,863.374,865.39,Then that's -- that's the question.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,865.892,869.361,And then we're in the exact conundrum here that the government creates because it--
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,869.361,869.928,"--Well, not really."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,881.484,883.252,"--One of the properties was sold quite late, Your Honor."
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,883.252,883.619,Yes.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,883.619,886.621,33 -- 33 months after the foreclosure took place.
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,886.621,893.893,"Well, that was my question earlier, which -- was it reasonable for that seller to hold on to the property that long?"
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,893.893,897.078,"We would say potentially not, Your Honor."
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.067,930.4,"No, it doesn't."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1007.417,1012.887,"--Well, the bat -- the bat doesn't count as a return on the government's theory because it's not a return of the same property."
2013.12-9012,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1012.887,1014.037,"Oh, yes, yes, yes."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1020.891,1028.064,"And then as Justice Sotomayor points out, Section 3664 contemplates what the judge can order turned over at sentencing."
2013.12-9012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1043.506,1044.823,And who's -- who has the burden of proof?
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1064.67,1065.504,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-9012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1068.472,1073.776,"Well, the government's interest, I think, would be to show a low value, right?"
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1073.776,1074.625,That's correct.
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1076.477,1079.446,But you say the sentencing judge has to call appraisers?
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1097.325,1099.243,"--Not in every restitution case, Your Honor."
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1102.462,1104.995,"Well, I'm not sure a sentencing court is well equipped to do it."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1107.364,1112.751,"--Yes, Your Honor, if -- if they're going to challenge what the foreclosure amount would be."
2013.12-9012,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1112.751,1115.103,"Mr. Green, here's one way of looking at this case."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1150.026,1158.13,Because the victim had complete control and dominion over the property once the victim foreclosed on the property.
2013.12-9012,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1158.13,1162.267,But real estate isn't completely liquid and so it takes some time to sell it.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1176.343,1179.628,"Because the victim has complete dominion and control, Your Honor."
2013.12-9012,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1198.957,1199.807,That's a completely formalistic answer.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1228.724,1235.913,"Well, if they accepted the truckload of tomatoes and they decided not to do anything with them, just like if the lender takes the property back and lets it--"
2013.12-9012,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1235.913,1237.313,That wasn't the hypothetical.
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.313,1238.448,You're really confusing me.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1261.547,1262.363,--That's correct.
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.363,1266.515,The baseball bat is not a return of part of the property that was stolen.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1266.515,1266.865,Right.
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.865,1269.734,Nor is the cartload of rotten tomatoes.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1269.734,1270.236,And that's the--
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.236,1272.086,So what are we talking about here?
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1272.619,1274.621,--That's precisely the point I'm trying to make.
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.625,1281.509,Why didn't you say that?
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1287.728,1293.182,"Well, in part because the question about -- about who bears the risk is a -- is a legitimate question."
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.534,1296.72,Not if it doesn't come into the statute at all.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1296.72,1321.602,"--Well, frequently, the -- the issue is, why should a fraudfeasor actually get the benefit of -- of a decline in the real estate market, and the answer is because it's not -- the fraudfeasor doesn't proximately cause what third parties do with a part of the property that the fraudfeasor returns once the fraudfeasor has returned that property."
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1321.602,1338.297,"Do you agree that if the real property is returned and that everybody agrees that on the day the property is returned, the value is less than the loan amount, that the victim is entitled to the difference between that value and the loan amount?"
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1338.297,1339.397,"Yes, we do."
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1339.397,1344.367,Then we are under B and then we are talking about money and not the mortgaged property.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1344.367,1347.503,"Well, we're still talking about property, because as I said at the outset--"
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1347.503,1348.769,Money is property.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1362.929,1370.601,"--Well, it would work, Your Honor, because we do have to put a monetary value on the property as of the date of foreclosure."
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1370.601,1381.49,"The victim is entitled to the difference in the value of the property and the amount of money stolen based, on your view, on the value of the property at the time that it's returned, correct?"
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1381.49,1382.157,That's correct.
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1382.157,1383.842,"Then we are under B, correct?"
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1383.842,1384.659,That's correct.
2013.12-9012,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1386.211,1386.828,Thank you.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1386.828,1388.23,Yes.
2013.12-9012,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1388.23,1401.738,"You made a point about under Wisconsin law, there would be -- and the foreclosure -- suppose there were a foreclosure, there could be no deficiency judgment."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1409.643,1413.611,"No, Your Honor, we weren't trying to suggest that."
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.865,1454.188,"What if I don't think that the -- that the mortgage has anything to do with returning property, that a mortgage -- the real estate is not cash."
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1460.759,1465.83,--It would be treated at -- still in a similar fashion.
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.392,1486.16,Cash hasn't been returned.
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1500.586,1507.407,"But this Court said in RadLAX that a credit bid is the same as cash, and that's what lenders do when they foreclose on real estate."
2013.12-9012,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.092,1511.459,"It's the same with the baseball bat, right?"
2013.12-9012,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1511.459,1516.513,"No, I don't -- I don't think it is, because that's a -- that's a -- that is a different transaction."
2013.12-9012,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1521.733,1522.2,"Thank you, Counsel."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1526.719,1528.837,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1557.922,1564.843,"What happens if they decide to give the house to the banker, to his mother or grandmother?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1564.843,1569.313,"Well, then that would -- that would bring in the principles of proximate cause under the MVRA."
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1570.629,1573.081,"No, no, it doesn't bring into principles."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1577.65,1578.419,--They--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1578.419,1579.935,--perhaps through the entire period.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1586.256,1592.493,"--Well, so, in that case, Justice Sotomayor, no part of the property that was lost by the lenders would have been returned to the lenders."
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1615.941,1616.707,So you--
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1616.707,1617.191,But that's not--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1617.191,1631.117,"--You're -- you're -- yes, the judge would use his or her discretion and decide what would have been a reasonable value at that -- of that house at a time when the lender should have sold it."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1631.117,1632.451,--But--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1632.451,1639.722,"Not when they received it, not when the sentencing happened, not after the sentencing."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1639.722,1640.339,--Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1640.339,1651.364,But on the day the court decides whether a reasonable investor who's taken back the property should have converted it to cash.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1651.364,1657.518,But I think it's very important to note that that situation would not fall under 3663A(b)(1)(B)(ii).
2013.12-9012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.518,1658.218,"Yes, it's under--"
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1658.218,1658.601,Exactly.
2013.12-9012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.601,1662.67,"--3664, which is quite a different thing."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1662.67,1662.97,Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1666.707,1668.94,That's -- that's my point exactly.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1668.94,1669.242,Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1694.322,1698.243,"Ms. Harrington, your whole argument really rests on that statutory language."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1698.243,1698.943,--Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1698.943,1705.247,"And one of the questions that came up in the last half hour is, is that the right section of the statute."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1714.368,1719.506,"Because Mr. Robers doesn't have the money that he took from the victim, and so--"
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1719.506,1720.039,Right.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1743.538,1743.972,--Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1743.972,1745.306,Would you think that that's under B?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1745.306,1755.179,"So our view is that 3663A governs the calculation of the loss to the victims, and 3664 governs how the defendant pays back a restitution award."
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1766.82,1771.455,"So you think that my hypothetical -- let me -- I'm just -- I'm sorry for -- is under B, not under A?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1771.455,1772.607,"I do think it's under B, yes."
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1773.224,1779.895,"So any time I don't have enough money to make the victim whole, it's under B, not A?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1779.895,1780.261,--Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1784.532,1788.417,"Well, I don't -- I guess -- gosh, I don't know."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1807.98,1815.401,"It -- well, it does make sense if you -- if you remember that 3663A is about the calculation of the loss at the time of sentencing."
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1839.265,1839.765,Does it make any difference?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1851.689,1852.341,--But unless it's--
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.341,1853.857,"--You know, I mean, that's what it says."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1859.178,1859.728,--Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1861.963,1863.297,"Return the 100,000."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1863.297,1865.065,"But if the property is a bat, you return the bat."
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.184,1868.967,"No, no, forget the bats."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1870.319,1870.569,--I know.
2013.12-9012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.052,1872.402,You brought this in.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1874.068,1874.854,--You brought it up.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.854,1880.158,--quality to this discussion which may not have contributed as much as I hoped.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1880.158,1880.508,But it--
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.508,1885.895,But the -- the -- the point is imagine it's all money.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1885.895,1886.795,"--No, I--"
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1886.795,1890.78,"I mean, if it's all money, A applies, that should be the end of it."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1894.165,1897.533,--What I'm saying is that the property that was lost is the property that was lost.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1902.271,1909.341,"No, but you see if the -- it would make a difference as to whether A or B applies because your whole argument is premised on the language of B."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1925.537,1926.587,I don't see an offset under A.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1932.24,1933.975,"Yes, but suppose -- suppose another case."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1938.11,1940.143,"--What I'm saying is if you -- if you have the bat, you give the bat back."
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1959.624,1973.617,"Well, what do you think happens in an A case where let's -- let's -- in a mortgage case, so there's a home, but this -- this person also has cash and repays the full amount in cash."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1983.989,1985.774,The defendant is entitled.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2001.701,2002.051,I know.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2007.271,2011.407,"So, no, I think the way that would -- I think it would come in under 3664."
2013.12-9012,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2017.56,2022.364,"Well, Ms. Harrington, is it correct this argument that it's all under A?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2045.73,2047.046,"Well, B--"
2013.12-9012,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2047.046,2057.787,"And under 3664, it is possible for the court to order not A, not restitution of money, but restitution of in-kind services."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2064.791,2065.476,"--No, I don't think it is."
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.113,2072.58,All right.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2072.58,2073.096,He didn't have the money--
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.096,2075.246,"If you want to read it that way, it's the same problem."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2081.602,2082.119,--I don't -- I don't--
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2082.119,2083.419,The same problem is there.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2111.788,2112.204,--Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2112.204,2117.858,"Now, the problem here is, instead of giving her the $20,000, he gave her an in-kind payment."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2121.077,2121.644,Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2121.644,2125.779,"And so now our question is how do we value the house, and the statute doesn't tell us."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2156.417,2157.167,Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.167,2160.785,--or you -- or let it befall on you what help befalls.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2166.273,2166.989,"Yes, he would--"
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.989,2169.225,And you have to value the bat if she still won't sell it.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2170.827,2180.865,"--Yes, but you would value the bat or the house as a replacement of property under Subsection 3664(f)(4), not as a return of the property that was lost."
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.865,2181.498,It was not a return.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2181.498,2182.634,"Right, because it's not the property--"
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.634,2185.217,It's in-kind property they're try to get rid of.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2185.217,2185.586,"--Right, but--"
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.586,2186.119,I see.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2186.119,2192.59,"--But under Section 3664, you are allowed to make an in-kind payment with return of property or replacement of property."
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2199.66,2203.646,But it also goes back to how do you measure and when do you measure this.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2222.692,2225.561,--It's easy when they sell the house because they've gotten back the money--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2225.561,2225.961,Right.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2225.961,2226.977,--which is part of the property they lost.
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2226.977,2235.933,"But -- but the question becomes what happens when the house is done before -- given over not as a part of sentencing, but independently."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2235.933,2237.0,So the next thing--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2237.0,2243.706,And that -- and that's why I don't think any of these provisions really answer that question.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2243.706,2244.306,--But--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2244.306,2246.991,And so why don't we go back to the basics?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2270.356,2271.106,--The victim should not.
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2271.106,2271.906,All right.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2271.906,2272.389,The MVRA--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2272.389,2275.591,But let's assume that the market dropped and they sold it.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2281.745,2287.566,"--It's -- right; but that's because that's when they got back part of the property they lost, because the property they lost was money."
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2293.052,2298.873,"Now, Justice Breyer asked you what happens if on some day they did something unreasonable."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2318.17,2319.403,So then--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2319.403,2322.055,Is that a case the victim should be made whole for their loss?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2322.055,2329.395,"--No, because that's a case -- I mean, yes, in the sense that they should be made whole for the part of the loss that's attributable to the actions of the defendant."
2013.12-9012,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.487,2353.776,"Do you agree that the victim, in this case the bank, may not hold on to the property for an unreasonable period of time?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2353.776,2354.76,Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2373.438,2381.593,There wasn't -- there wasn't anything at all in the record to suggest that there was undue -- that that 33 months was an undue delay.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2381.593,2382.529,There certainly was not.
2013.12-9012,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2382.529,2388.281,And there's a question about this case that I would like you to answer before you finish.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2418.035,2426.206,"They were ordered to pay a much larger amount of restitution because they were involved in the fraudulent acquisition of -- of many, many more houses than these two houses."
2013.12-9012,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2426.206,2431.026,So that -- but did they -- were they ordered to pay restitution for these two houses?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2431.026,2431.443,They were.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.976,2459.629,I think I understand now better than I did what his argument is.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2467.199,2467.633,Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.633,2472.687,"And they say now A is out of it because he wasn't able to return it, so we're in B."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2525.572,2526.722,You've gotten that right.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.722,2527.905,Thank you.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2527.905,2533.892,"And I just want to add the element that the reason that you do that is when the house goes back to the victim, no part of the property they lost has been returned to them."
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2541.846,2544.865,"Oh, I'm not sure you'd say no part of the property they lost has been returned."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2544.865,2546.033,--When they get--
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.033,2549.918,What's been happening is they've got some in-kind return.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2549.918,2551.853,--They've gotten different property.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2551.853,2552.786,That's true.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2552.786,2559.273,"But under Section 3663, it uses the phrase “ the property ” after it has declared that the property is the property that was lost."
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2595.63,2603.719,"And when they sell and they get much more money than they otherwise thought from the house, that extra amount also counts, then, in the defendant's favor?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2603.719,2604.302,Absolutely.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2612.658,2614.593,"Well, how does the defendant get the benefit of that?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2617.295,2620.763,"Well, again, usually the house has sold long before sentencing."
2013.12-9012,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2637.542,2638.842,You would agree that--
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2638.842,2641.877,Over the -- the total amount lost?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2641.877,2650.148,"If it's over the total amount lost, then the victim's loss is zero as a result of the defendant's fraud, and so he doesn't have to pay any restitution award."
2013.12-9012,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2658.454,2664.407,--You would -- you would -- you would agree that a different rule applies if there is some unreasonable delay in disposing of the property?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2664.407,2664.74,--Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2669.961,2679.4,And what do you do in the case of some dramatic development between the return of the house as opposed to the -- the property and its -- and its sale?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2679.4,2682.019,It depends what sort of dramatic development you mean.
2013.12-9012,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2682.019,2687.673,"Well, you know, something is discovered with respect to the property that nobody knew about."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2698.047,2698.514,The bank got it.
2013.12-9012,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2698.514,2705.05,"When the bank got it, it was worth $200,000, but all of a sudden it's, you know, Love Canal or something, and it's worth nothing."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2705.05,2710.021,"Well, it's not our view -- you know, the house is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it in an arm's-length transaction."
2013.12-9012,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2719.127,2719.427,"Well, no."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2725.714,2730.183,"--I think in that case, it would probably be whatever the money that the bank can get for the house."
2013.12-9012,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2869.092,2881.233,"Well, what if they get -- they get the house and as soon as they get it, there are ten offers at $500,000 or more, and the amount of the restitution is, you know, $300,000 or whatever."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2895.074,2898.778,"I mean, as long as what the bank -- what the bank did was commercially reasonable."
2013.12-9012,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2899.545,2907.817,"I know banks like to get rid of property as soon as possible, but, you know, they make decisions at some point, let's wait before we sell this."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2909.25,2910.317,"--I mean, it's hard to know."
2013.12-9012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2923.493,2927.545,"--Well, why should the defendant here subsidize the banks playing the market?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2929.147,2930.23,"No, what I'm saying is--"
2013.12-9012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2930.23,2931.763,The bank is playing the market.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2941.955,2949.059,"--So if there really -- if there really is evidence that the bank is sort of really rolling the dice, then that might be a harder question."
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2990.886,2998.807,"But if I could just be clear about what you're saying, you're saying it's not the sale price when the sale is for a nominal amount; is that right?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2998.807,2999.591,Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2999.591,3004.728,And it's not the sale price if the lender has done something commercially unreasonable?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3004.728,3005.078,Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3005.078,3005.478,Is that right?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3005.478,3005.944,Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3005.944,3017.369,"And so if that's right and both of those things sound right, but why doesn't that kind of explode your statutory argument, because then it's not any part of the property that's returned."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3017.369,3030.109,"Because the other parts of the statute require -- have a proximate cause requirement, and so you are only -- the victim is only entitled to get restitution for the amount of its losses that are attributable to the defendant's criminal conduct."
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3041.834,3045.136,"I followed you up through here, I think."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3047.138,3047.921,Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3047.921,3054.392,He is pointing to little (ii) and you're saying that really is not relevant here because it's cash.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3059.546,3064.267,"Well, we're saying it's relevant when the bank sells the house because then part of the property is returned."
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3064.267,3065.517,"Well, wait."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3067.051,3070.17,They have the house until they sell it and then they have cash.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3070.17,3071.203,"Oh, I see."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3071.203,3073.305,And so it's the cash they get when they sell the house--
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3073.305,3076.157,And that is if they've sold it before the sentencing.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3076.157,3076.674,--Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3078.807,3085.78,"Well, let's suppose it doesn't and they still have it as of the time of sentencing, then we're over into 3(a)."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3088.396,3088.948,--Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3088.948,3090.432,It's an in-kind payment.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3096.586,3096.986,Right.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3096.986,3099.537,Or he could say if you don't want to do that we call in the assessors.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3099.537,3103.824,It wouldn't be considered an offset under Section 3663A(b)(1)(B)(ii).
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3103.824,3113.713,"You're saying because (3) -- little (ii) applies, that when it's transformed into cash prior to the sentencing, then they have received--"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3113.713,3115.299,Some part of the property.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3115.299,3116.715,--some part of the money back--
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3116.715,3117.199,Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3117.199,3120.201,--and often that will work in favor of the defendant.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3120.201,3120.953,It will because--
2013.12-9012,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3120.953,3125.005,"Sometimes, as in this case, it won't if the housing market collapses."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3125.005,3126.805,"--Sometimes it goes down, but other times it goes up."
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3133.511,3144.399,"So where do you value for the person who -- the -- the creditor, the secured creditor who acts unreasonably?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3157.976,3167.848,"Well, I think in those unusual circumstances it would be as you suggested earlier, which is that you would value it as of the date it would have been reasonable to dispose of the property in a fair market, arm's-length transaction."
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3167.848,3168.184,So--
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3168.184,3169.217,--and that's usually not--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3169.217,3170.784,--what do you think of this test?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3193.649,3195.167,--I think generally that's fine.
2013.12-9012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.713,3214.396,"Well, it's not just more complicated."
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3234.042,3234.975,--I think that would be available to the defendant.
2013.12-9012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.975,3235.325,Yes.
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3235.325,3235.875,I think--
2013.12-9012,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.875,3238.427,"You would prefer that to the other formulation, wouldn't you?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3238.427,3245.85,"--Yes, and I think there is a presumption that banks are going to act in a commercially reasonable way because they have no expectation of getting any money back through the restitution process."
2013.12-9012,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3245.85,3269.881,"If the sale -- if at the time of sentencing, the house has not yet been sold, but there's no -- there's good reason for the delay, because for example, there are no bids at an earlier time, could the judge defer the restitution order until the house is sold?"
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3269.881,3292.662,"So as Justice Breyer suggested, under our view the court -- the district court's first resort would be to say -- to push off the determination of the restitution amount for 90 days under 3664(d)(5), and give the -- give the bank a little more time to sell the house, because in that case, a determination -- you wouldn't be able to ascertain the net losses of the victim."
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3321.348,3324.966,What does the defendant do if they act unreasonably after that order?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3324.966,3325.802,--Then you--
2013.12-9012,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3325.802,3328.937,If the bank does a nominal sale and only gets $100?
2013.12-9012,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3328.937,3338.625,"--So then I think the district court would have retained jurisdiction to fill in an amount related, blank, for the amount of money the bank got back, and there could be proceedings about what that amount should be."
2013.12-9012,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3338.625,3339.275,"Thank you, Counsel."
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3341.327,3353.969,"It's important, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kennedy, to understand that defendants have no compulsory process in this restitution-ordering scheme."
2013.12-9012,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3399.35,3400.816,Why not?
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3415.293,3415.86,It's--
2013.12-9012,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3415.86,3418.827,"--an in-kind payment, and they were wrong to sell it."
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3434.387,3435.32,--No.
2013.12-9012,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3435.57,3436.02,Why?
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3436.02,3449.828,"--Because, Your Honor, in an obvious case like that, the defendant would have the ability to -- to point to the facts and circumstances and say, you know, that -- that, it doesn't appear, to be an arm's-length transaction, Your Honor, and that would be obvious evidence."
2013.12-9012,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3483.484,3490.905,"Well, but the only reason he would have been trespassing is because, in fact, he did not live in the house as he promised the bank he would when the bank gave him the money."
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3490.905,3491.407,--Right.
2013.12-9012,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3491.407,3494.19,So why shouldn't he bear the responsibility for that consequence?
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3494.19,3503.38,"Because of the bank's dominion, because of the situations we've been talking about here where the bank holds on to the property unreasonably too long, right into the teeth of a great recession--"
2013.12-9012,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3503.38,3504.33,There was no -- there was no--
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3504.33,3504.747,--that he's not--
2013.12-9012,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3504.747,3508.366,"--evidence of that in this case, that the bank held on too long."
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3508.366,3511.134,"--Well, it was 33 months after foreclosure."
2013.12-9012,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3517.038,3519.754,The answer that Ms. Harrington gave was that there were no bids.
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3519.754,3522.44,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2013.12-9012,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3522.44,3524.292,I think she said there were no bids.
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3524.292,3530.112,"There were no bids at the -- at the foreclosure sale, but that frequently happens that there's no bids at the foreclosure sale, Your Honor."
2013.12-9012,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3548.807,3564.017,"Is there any reason why the -- why the sentencing judge, where there's an -- an allegation and maybe a -- a suggestion that there was unreasonable delay or something unreasonable was going on require the government to provide some substantiation for -- for what happened?"
2013.12-9012,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3564.017,3565.952,"--There -- there could be, Your Honor."
2013.12-9012,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3640.167,3641.433,"Thank you, Counsel."
