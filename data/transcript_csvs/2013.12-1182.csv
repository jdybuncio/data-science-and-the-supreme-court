2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,15.01,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-1182, Environmental Protection Agency v. EME Homer City Generation and the consolidated case American Lung Association v. EME Homer City Generation."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,15.71,18.462,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,127.266,133.67,"Of course, those -- those savings would -- would not be evenly distributed among the upwind States, right?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,150.196,153.398,"Well, there -- there were two bases for distinguishing among the States."
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.985,212.872,"Well, I don't mind a State doing less."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,243.474,244.124,Well--
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.124,246.176,Yes or no?
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,248.728,268.256,"--I think it is -- no, I think it is the case that if you adopted an air quality only threshold, then it would be more likely to be the case that States that had already done a lot to control air pollution would have to take additional steps, even if it was done at a non-cost -- in a non-cost-effective way."
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.256,271.743,Have you answered my question?
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,303.68,318.539,"I think it would be the case that at least as -- yes, as compared to at least some air-quality-only measures, the use of cost would have the effect of distributing the burden in a somewhat different way than it would have if you considered air quality factors only."
2013.12-1182,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,318.539,324.36,"Is the idea, Mr. Stewart, that the States that are required to do more are the States that haven't done much already?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,324.36,324.962,That's correct.
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.16,353.295,And what provision of the statute allows you to take that into account?
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,353.295,355.147,"Well, the -- the term that we're--"
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.147,365.187,"I mean, as opposed to each State, whether it's inefficient or efficient, has to merely reduce its contribution to the downwind State pollution; right?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,366.539,376.395,"--Well, the statute says that each State will adopt measures that prevent sources within its borders from contributing significantly to downwind nonattainment."
2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,436.885,445.055,"That's -- I was just going to say, that just is because of, in the latter case, because contribution happens to be used in both an affirmative and a negative sense."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,457.549,458.282,I think--
2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,458.282,463.869,Or -- or not significantly contributed in -- in -- contributed in varying degrees.
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,463.869,469.856,"--I would say if -- if you cause death by alternative means, then both people would have contributed as significantly."
2013.12-1182,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,516.67,517.387,Can I ask a question?
2013.12-1182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,517.387,526.793,"Is part your -- your answer to Justice Kagan's question and Justice Scalia's question that it depends on the time point, at the time at which you measure?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,543.571,545.421,I--
2013.12-1182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,545.421,549.206,Or don't you like that answer?
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,549.206,550.641,--I don't -- I don't quite want to go there.
2013.12-1182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,574.256,574.74,How far back?
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,578.592,584.462,"--In this case, there are two NAAQS that were implemented -- that were promulgated in 1997."
2013.12-1182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,584.462,585.148,"Oh, '97."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,585.148,598.039,"One of them for annual particulate matter, and one of them for ozone; and then the 2006 NAAQS was for 24-hour particular matter -- particulate matter, which is harder to achieve."
2013.12-1182,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,635.414,637.064,Can I ask a question?
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,692.017,707.26,"Well, in the case of the NAAQS I think it was -- it was not the case that requiring EPA to establish the NAAQS without reference to cause -- to cost, would call a silly result."
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.197,792.116,"The problem is that that allocation among different actors is done State by State, and simply taking costs into account as determining who will do what simply eliminates the requirement that each State not be -- not be required to do more than its share of the pollution it's -- it's causing downstream."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,809.059,810.077,--I guess--
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.077,812.612,And maybe that'd be a better statute.
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,814.262,831.074,"--I mean, the first thing I would say is we -- we can accept the premise that each State should alleviate no more than its share and there still may be -- that each State should do no more than its share, and yet there still may be different ways of determining what a State's fair share is."
2013.12-1182,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,935.908,936.677,--Just one more question on cost.
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,963.511,963.828,I misspoke.
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.37,1014.76,"If Congress wanted that, why couldn't Congress simply have said the EPA shall prescribe minimum pollution reduction measures that have to be taken by the States?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1048.934,1051.302,Let me say three things in response to that.
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.457,1086.54,Excuse me.
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1088.209,1109.055,"--The good neighbor provision -- we're dealing here with a situation where EPA was the one that promulgated Federal implementation plans, but that's only because the States didn't -- the relevant upwind States did not discharge their obligation to implement State -- promulgate State implementation plans that contain good neighbor provisions."
2013.12-1182,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1141.943,1142.726,Mr. Stewart--
2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1142.726,1156.62,"Well, when you mention the fact that the States didn't address the good neighbor requirement, of course you hadn't come up with their budgets that they had to meet at the time that they had to promulgate their SIPs."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1181.27,1185.639,"Well, it's the statute that imposes the obligation on the States."
2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1266.441,1281.267,"So if you were working for one of the upwind States and you were facing this 3-year deadline and EPA had not told anyone how it intended to interpret the State's obligations under the good neighbor policy, what would you have told the State to do."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1281.267,1294.777,"--Well, certainly EPA's basic methodology of using -- using cost thresholds had been embodied in the -- the NAAQS SIP call in 1998 and in CARE, which I believe was promulgated in 2006."
2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1294.777,1295.161,Right.
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1305.334,1309.386,"We would tell them, in all honesty, we don't know yet."
2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1327.548,1336.354,"Well, but that kind of glosses over the fact that, as you say elsewhere in your brief, this is a -- is your analogy, right -- a spaghetti matrix or something?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1348.411,1368.409,"--Well, certainly what EPA was called upon to do was far more complicated than what any particular State was going to be called upon to do, because as a result of widespread noncompliance, EPA was promulgating Federal implementation plans for close to 30 States and plans for -- for different NAAQS."
2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1370.694,1372.061,But could I address the first thing first?
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1386.72,1399.611,"--Well, it certainly has the data available to it that -- that EPA had available about how much did each State contribute to the overage at various nonattainer -- nonattainment receptors in the past."
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1409.702,1410.702,"Oh, but that's crucial."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1424.345,1441.54,"--I guess the second -- the other two points I would make are: First, the State's role is to devise something, in this area as in others, that it believes will carry out its own legal obligations, not necessarily to predict just how EPA would do it if the task fell to EPA."
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.761,1495.858,"Can you give us an example of when EPA has done this in the past, where a -- a crucial element of a -- of a NAAQS has not been defined by the agency and yet the agency nonetheless requires the States to -- to put together their SIPs without knowing what their target is?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1507.582,1525.194,"Well, the examples I would point to are in the brief filed by the -- the Respondent States that are on our side of the case, who identify examples of instances where States did successfully comply with their good neighbor obligations and -- and persuaded EPA that what they had done was enough."
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.194,1527.663,"Well, that just means it's pin the tail on the donkey."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1552.094,1561.55,"I don't -- I wouldn't characterize what EPA is doing as hiding the ball; that is, it didn't kind of fail to divulge information that it had its -- at it's disposal."
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.55,1561.986,All right.
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1562.652,1568.14,It released a great deal of information at the time that the proposed rule was announced in the -- the summer of 2010.
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.14,1568.506,Okay.
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1568.506,1576.377,"But -- but I take your point that -- the two additional things I would say, though, are that for better or worse Congress did place this obligation on the States."
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.694,1630.23,Yes.
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1644.973,1672.557,"--I guess the final thing I would say on -- on this part of the -- this particular sub-issue of the case is that, even if you reach that conclusion, even if you determine that it was just practically infeasible for any State to adopt a compliant State implementation plan with good neighbor provisions for these NAAQS until EPA acted, then the proposition of the opposing States still wouldn't follow."
2013.12-1182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1719.604,1744.554,"Mr. Stewart, below, the government conceded that there was a theoretical possibility that some States could be overcontrolled, that they would be implementing measures that would reduce their contributions to pollution below the 1 percent."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1781.762,1806.477,"I mean, I think in the circumstance you describe, if you reach the conclusion that there was a theoretical possibility that this could happen and that it would be a problem if it did, but that the methodology used by EPA was on the whole rational, I think the task for the Court at this stage of the case is to rule on the more big picture objections that are properly before it and -- and that the court of appeals ruled on."
2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1830.142,1833.563,"Including -- including the overcontrol argument, or would that have been done?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1833.563,1841.067,"--Well, to -- to the extent that any State had -- and I don't know the -- the pending as-applied challenges at this level of detail."
2013.12-1182,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1997.935,2006.708,"If we were to rule against you and affirm the decision below, how long do you think it would take to get a new rule in place?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2006.708,2020.451,"I don't have an estimate on the time, but if the Court affirms on the ground that EPA may not consider costs -- part of the problem, I think it would be an extraordinary undertaking for EPA to try to achieve."
2013.12-1182,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2045.016,2046.768,"--Could you explain that to me, Mr. Stewart?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2058.826,2065.397,--What -- at least what we understand to be the straight proportionality approach is impossible.
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.544,2113.344,"I suppose you could average them out, couldn't you?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2113.344,2115.329,You might be able to average them out.
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.329,2123.768,"I don't think that's any more irrational then picking a number like 500 bucks as -- as to, you know, what the -- who can do it more efficiently."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2125.385,2134.141,"Well, I mean, the purpose of the cost threshold was not to increase or decrease the total amount of reductions that would be necessary."
2013.12-1182,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.599,2156.256,"I understand that, but my point is that is certainly a pretty -- pretty arbitrary number, and -- and I think averaging for all the receptors is certainly no more arbitrary."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2156.256,2164.077,"--Well, I think the cost methodology is one that EPA had used often in the past."
2013.12-1182,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.349,2228.603,"Sir, I don't want you to -- finish your argument if you had something to say on what you started out with in describing the plan."
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2251.885,2265.878,"The third part of the process is that once each State's emissions budget has been quantified, with respect to each State the EPA essentially divides up the emissions that are allowed among the different power plants within the State's borders."
2013.12-1182,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2394.429,2401.516,"I'm sure I should know this after reading all these briefs, but if we -- if we reverse the D.C. Circuit what would happen going forward?"
2013.12-1182,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2423.18,2424.115,Yes.
2013.12-1182,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2456.67,2460.038,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2517.291,2521.01,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2546.478,2557.285,"Well, it's -- it's certainly -- it's certainly hard, but it is what the statute says; and it seems to me that if EPA had taken a different view, it would have been contrary to the statute."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2557.285,2561.153,EPA's actions are unlawful for several independent reasons.
2013.12-1182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.253,2611.77,"Well, they don't know exactly how to do it."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2662.103,2665.321,Because that's the approach EPA rejected in the NAAQS SIP call.
2013.12-1182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2665.321,2666.34,"Well, they objected to it once."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2687.42,2696.942,"EPA is allowed to change their interpretation of the statute, but if they're going to do that, they have to acknowledge in the Transport Rule that they're abandoning the prior construction of the statute."
2013.12-1182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2696.942,2702.93,"Well, years and years, the neighbor board, the labor board decided things in adjudications, rules."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2712.202,2716.071,"No, they're not prevented from making the change, but the arbitrary and capricious standard--"
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2716.071,2719.907,But you're not prevented from giving a counter SIP is what they were being told.
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2731.199,2736.317,--But we can propose and submit the SIP only after the FIP has already been imposed on the States.
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2736.317,2736.936,So what's the difference?
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2776.894,2780.78,We do not have a position on the question of whether EPA can consider costs.
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2780.78,2782.298,"It'd be crazy if they didn't, right?"
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2782.298,2784.084,We represent a coalition of States.
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2784.084,2784.617,Right.
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2787.952,2794.19,There's simply no consensus among the States on that question.
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2795.673,2805.663,"Can I ask, until you propose your SIP to replace the FIP, right, the FIP remains in effect?"
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2805.663,2806.247,Yes.
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.247,2811.401,And you're bound by that until they approve your new SIP.
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2814.103,2815.003,It depends.
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2818.905,2820.007,You think that's a quick process?
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2821.423,2821.89,"No, it takes months."
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2821.89,2825.225,"--If you'll have to develop a new SIP, that'll take you some time?"
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2825.225,2825.744,Yes.
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.744,2832.165,"And then that SIP is -- is submitted to EPA, and -- and they chew on it for as long as they want, right?"
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2832.165,2832.698,Yes.
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.698,2836.867,"And then maybe they will say your SIP is good enough, and maybe they won't."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2836.867,2844.555,We're still waiting for EPA to decide on the SIP that we submitted to implement the good neighbor obligations for the 2006 particulate matter standard.
2013.12-1182,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2844.555,2859.632,"But at least if you've adopted a SIP or proposed a SIP, you've given reasons, you have a -- you have a rational plan, and the EPA then must give a reasoned response to it."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2872.023,2879.812,"Well, it's still an unlawful use of the FIP authority for several reasons, and this gets back to Justice Breyer's question, why is this unlawful?"
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2901.642,2904.827,"And that means the statute doesn't require you to do that, I assume."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2904.827,2906.113,--The statute--
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.113,2912.617,"I mean, when they say that, that -- that's an affirmation by them that the statute does not require you to do it, I assume."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2914.219,2919.354,"--Not only that, they said in the NAAQS SIP calls that they are adopting an interpretation of the statute that prohibits us from doing that."
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2953.158,2954.844,But they were doing that with respect to the NAAQS.
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2959.748,2964.449,What they said on a NAAQS SIP call was they have to quantify the good neighbor obligations.
2013.12-1182,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3030.242,3037.581,"Mr. Mitchell, I might just not be understanding you, but this goes back to the Chief Justice's question."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3089.096,3091.132,I agree that the EPA has that discretion.
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3165.847,3168.065,Haven't some States already challenged that?
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3175.136,3177.538,--Three of the States have challenged their--
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3177.538,3181.392,"I don't know why the rest didn't, but three of them have."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3190.581,3201.806,--The United States is suggesting that we're somehow launching an improper collateral attack because the States could have challenged the earlier SIP disapprovals or earlier findings of failure to submit.
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3201.806,3202.822,"No, no, no."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3222.885,3226.421,But those judicial proceedings have been stayed pending the outcome of this proceeding.
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3226.421,3228.237,"Well, I don't know why, but that's a different issue."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3241.014,3247.585,I don't think the Court should wait because the issues that we're raising are discrete from what's being challenged by those three States in their separate proceedings.
2013.12-1182,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3259.575,3264.962,And that's because -- because EPA did it that way -- you don't get that from the statute.
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3270.466,3273.502,"--We're not relying solely on the statute, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2013.12-1182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3296.248,3297.55,"But they may not know, you know."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3317.014,3317.564,Right.
2013.12-1182,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3317.564,3319.447,So they have a tough problem.
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3363.976,3366.012,EPA has done this before.
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3386.041,3387.641,"Well, they have done the impossible here, haven't they?"
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3400.835,3404.37,--It's not impossible for EPA to decide what ‶ contribute significantly ″ means.
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3410.107,3412.392,You started to give us a second statutory reason.
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3416.11,3421.331,"Yes, that's the Section 7410(k)(6) issue that we mentioned in the brief."
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3461.473,3476.233,"Isn't that the issue that the three States are challenging below, just that discrete issue about whether the EPA can call this a corrective action or not?"
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3481.451,3484.47,"--Well, it's not being determined because the proceedings have been stayed."
2013.12-1182,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3487.089,3489.957,"But this issue is what's at issue there, part of the--"
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3489.957,3492.326,Would you finish describing the issue?
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3493.526,3504.883,"EPA invoked its corrections power under (k)(6), but (k)(6) says that a correction must be made, quote, ‶ in the same manner as ″, end quote, the decision being corrected."
2013.12-1182,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3544.543,3550.364,"Well, why can't -- this is of course a statute on which EPA gets substantial Chevron deference."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3560.237,3562.855,Because that caveat does not appear in (k)(6).
2013.12-1182,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3562.855,3564.572,"Well, it's not a caveat."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3588.406,3597.862,I think your argument or suggestion is that EPA could rely on the normal rule set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act.
2013.12-1182,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3597.862,3611.92,"Whatever procedural requirements constrained EPA when it approved the SIP, those were the same procedural requirements that constrained EPA when it's disapproved the SIP."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3626.329,3629.047,We don't think that's a tenable construction of (k)(6).
2013.12-1182,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3658.817,3661.085,"Well, I think that they are trying to make that argument."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3672.893,3677.047,"--If that's what the statute means then (k)(6) doesn't constrain the agency much at all, because--"
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3677.047,3686.403,"Well, I think -- it think it would follow that if you did it for good cause to -- to apply the rule, you can do it for good cause to abolish it."
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3698.543,3701.329,--The text says ‶ in the same manner as ″.
2013.12-1182,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3701.329,3702.379,In the same manner?
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3702.379,3703.412,In the same manner.
2013.12-1182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3720.957,3722.843,You can finish your sentence.
2013.12-1182,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,3722.843,3726.278,The (k)(6) argument doesn't knock out all of the steps on -- standing alone.
2013.12-1182,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3729.763,3730.599,"Thank you, Mr. Mitchell."
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,3743.572,3745.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1182,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3839.57,3841.186,Why is it wrong?
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,3946.772,3950.791,"I'll try to respond to that -- that fully, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4029.993,4032.611,"Amounts significantly attribute, right?"
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4033.761,4034.98,--Amounts -- great.
2013.12-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4036.13,4036.997,"Yes, yes."
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4038.065,4039.049,"No, that's right."
2013.12-1182,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4129.525,4130.659,On that point.
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4185.612,4200.788,"--I think there's one thing I can cite, Your Honor, and that is that the statutory history in this case is that the predecessor version to what we currently have before us simply said that States were required to prohibit the amounts which prevent attainment or maintenance."
2013.12-1182,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4240.18,4256.042,"So, Mr. Keisler, I mean, you have a statute here that clearly does not have any language about no costs allowed, that also does not have what the American Trucking Association statute had, which was like public health only, sufficient margin of safety; right?"
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4343.081,4378.337,"Well, first of all, I think in the example that Your Honor gave, where you had the two States and should they be each reduced to ten, the reason in favor of doing it that way from a statutory perspective is that that then gives a consistent application to the same causal language in the statute, which means that the same causal effect from one upwind State on a downwind State isn't significant if it comes from Indiana to Delaware, but insignificant if it comes from Tennessee; and that when the statute says that States must prohibit the amounts they significantly contribute, then the more they contribute the more they reduce."
2013.12-1182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4417.779,4434.257,Do you battle Mr. Stewart's point that Congress surely didn't intend to shut down these plants if they didn't or couldn't feasibly reduce their contributions?
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4434.257,4436.692,"--Yes, Your Honor, but we think the statute--"
2013.12-1182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4436.692,4450.952,"So if they couldn't feasibly do it, doesn't the words ‶ significantly contribute ″ have to take into account in some way the cost of reducing the amount?"
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4450.952,4459.991,"--Your Honor, I'm here on behalf of industry and labor, so certainly we believe that there have to be mechanisms to deal with the kinds of problems that Your Honor just identified."
2013.12-1182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4530.254,4535.789,"Well, they found a way to do that with the cost tradeoff with the cap and trade system--"
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4535.789,4536.308,Well--
2013.12-1182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4536.308,4540.693,"--because the industry itself can make that choice, with the State presumably."
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4544.645,4549.033,"--Well, the trading presents to me issues under the statute."
2013.12-1182,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4570.529,4577.183,"Yeah, but you're -- I mean, you want me to write -- look what I would have to write if I made it very specific."
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4613.158,4616.593,I'd like to resist the role Your Honor--
2013.12-1182,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4616.593,4617.31,--Of course.
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4617.31,4620.712,--has assigned me of bringing death and destruction and starvation.
2013.12-1182,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4621.445,4628.485,"Well, I'm trying to use the most -- I'm trying to use the most extreme words I can so that then you will either have to draw a distinction or something."
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4629.068,4642.41,"But in some ways the distinction is the one I was drawing in response to Justice Sotomayor's question, which is that when you get down to the level of implementing these things you can take into account whether death, destruction, starvation will be taken care of when the State is doing that as part of a SIP process."
2013.12-1182,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4665.158,4669.228,They say that's not a theoretical possibility under the numbers they've worked out.
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4678.667,4688.189,"Let me make a distinction in that regard, Your Honor, which is what the government says is a theoretical possibility is simply whether a State would be driven below the 1 percent threshold."
2013.12-1182,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4706.318,4712.639,But you're -- you're saying that ‶ significant ″ must mean only measurable amounts.
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4743.843,4745.51,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2013.12-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4751.716,4753.582,It isn't contributions to nonattainment.
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4765.523,4768.558,"--We agree, Your Honor, and we would emphasize that language as well."
2013.12-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4768.558,4768.808,Okay.
2013.12-1182,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4769.241,4775.645,But the word -- the word ‶ significantly ″ does import a judgmental component.
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4779.731,4781.283,It's not a limitless--
2013.12-1182,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4781.283,4782.199,--Maybe they'll have a better answer.
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4782.199,4788.769,--I don't think that ‶ significantly ″ means that any factor that might be deemed relevant in a broad policy sense can be imported in.
2013.12-1182,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4795.292,4796.992,"--All right, so there's an ambiguity here."
2013.12-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4809.968,4811.618,--That's my point exactly.
2013.12-1182,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4813.087,4813.554,Yes.
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4833.917,4839.571,"--Yes, and I guess our position is that significant may have a range of meanings, but it's not a limitless range of meanings."
2013.12-1182,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4850.943,4855.497,"But, Mr. Keisler, the nature of this problem is that there's an allocation issue."
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4903.245,4905.264,"I -- I disagree with that, Your Honor."
2013.12-1182,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4940.853,4945.489,What is -- what is your answer -- do you have an answer to Mr. Stewart's basketball hypothetical?
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,4963.302,4976.11,"It's -- it's very hard for me to translate the -- the amount concept into performance on the basketball court, but Mr. Stewart's other example was a contribution to a charity."
2013.12-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4992.435,5005.962,"But the basketball thing is -- to make it parallel to what's at issue here, the question you should ask the coach, which -- which of the -- you lost 101 to 100."
2013.12-1182,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5015.835,5019.389,As in the answer is that some one point--
2013.12-1182,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5019.389,5021.772,It's -- it's the one that was the layup.
2013.12-1182,2,38076,peter_keisler,,5027.076,5038.45,"--But if there were different teams playing in the league and you had an overall result, you could actually determine, you know, which team had contributed what to the overall result."
