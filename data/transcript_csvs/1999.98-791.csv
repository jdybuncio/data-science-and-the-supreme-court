1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.539,"We'll hear argument now in Number 98-791, J Daniel Kimel v. The Florida Board of Regents and the United States versus the same."
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,11.808,14.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,76.064,90.074,"Mr. Collins, how many other Federal statutes purport to abrogate State sovereign immunity without specifically referring to the Eleventh Amendment or to sovereign immunity?"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,90.074,91.024,I'm not sure--
1999.98-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.024,92.776,Because this statute doesn't.
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,92.776,93.726,"--That's correct, Justice--"
1999.98-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.726,100.097,And I just wondered how many others there might be that use similar language without any reference to the--
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,100.097,101.699,"--I don't have the number, Justice O'Connor."
1999.98-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.041,129.699,"--In our case, Kennecott Copper, though, we didn't think that the phrase, court of competent jurisdiction, was enough to do the--"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,129.699,147.762,"And that was true in Missouri Employees as well, Your Honor, under the FLSA, but here Congress has gone further, as the Court observed in Alden, and clearer, in that it refers among other things to courts State or Federal, and to suits against any employer, including a public agency."
1999.98-791,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,188.737,189.356,--Is--
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,208.485,211.17,"I don't believe that's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1999.98-791,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,275.295,285.901,"Mr. Collins, in answer to Justice O'Connor's question, you mentioned the IGRA that figured in Seminole that didn't use, make specific reference to the Eleventh Amendment."
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,290.622,297.543,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg, no, it does not, and I believe that there are numerous others that do not make a specific reference."
1999.98-791,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,297.543,305.299,"And in this case the term public agency is specifically defined to include a State, is that correct?"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,305.299,306.099,That's correct.
1999.98-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.991,328.264,"Well, probably the statute goes beyond any constitutional substantive limit, does it not?"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,328.264,345.19,"It does, Justice O'Connor, and it certainly goes beyond what the courts acting without congressional guidance could find to be unconstitutional, but it does so, as I'll undertake to explain, in a way that's congruent, to use this Court's terms, with the constitutional prohibition."
1999.98-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,356.997,369.741,Was there any more indication in the history of this legislation other than trying to reach the private sector?
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,379.53,381.799,"--I don't think that's the case, Justice--"
1999.98-791,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,381.799,382.599,"--legislation, isn't that true?"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,382.599,404.062,"--I would say not, Justice O'Connor, because even in 1967, in the years leading up to the initial enactment, what Congress was looking at, and what the Labor Department, for example, studied in the reports it gave to Congress, was the general approach that employers of all sorts took to decisionmaking based on age, and the Labor Department surveys, for example, did include public agencies."
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,421.44,442.687,"You say that Congress was addressing its attention to invidious discrimination and yet, in our Murgia case, we said in effect that there wasn't, under the Constitution, invidious discrimination when you classify it on the basis of age, so can Congress change that constitutional law?"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,442.687,453.311,"No, Congress is not changing constitutional law, Mr. Chief Justice, and in Murgia the Court did not say that there could never be unconstitutional or invidious discrimination based on--"
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,453.311,455.68,"No, but certainly it approved the use of stereotypes."
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,455.68,463.619,--I would not... not a stereotype of the sort that Congress was concerned with in the statute.
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.238,470.356,"Well, what's the difference between a generalization and a stereotype?"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,470.356,473.891,"--Well, I would say the difference, Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress--"
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.891,478.545,"I would like your answer to that question, not what Congress--"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,478.545,494.222,"--One can make a generalization regarding any classification which is for the most part true but will have certain exceptions, and which is essentially grounded in a rational determination."
1999.98-791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.837,520.205,--Any unfounded prejudice is unconstitutional.
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,520.205,523.491,At least--
1999.98-791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.491,537.584,"I mean, I find it extraordinary that Congress would have felt the need to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in an area where there was no opinion of this Court saying that the Fourteenth Amendment was violated, and a suggestion that it wasn't violated."
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,550.641,558.247,"--Justice Scalia, the judgment Congress made is in no way inconsistent with anything reflected in the decisions of this Court."
1999.98-791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.511,586.332,"Do you think it's unconstitutional... suppose a State says, you know, we just don't have enough jobs."
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,600.824,612.399,"--That kind of a judgment would be closer, Justice Scalia, because it would not be based on the kinds of stigmatizing attitudes towards people's ability that Congress found to be pervasive."
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.023,625.809,"But in Murgia... in Murgia, it wasn't economic."
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,631.712,632.178,--But--
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.178,633.812,--a lot of us can testify to.
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,634.545,640.013,"--But Mr. Chief Justice, I think two points are crucial about Murgia and Vance and Gregory."
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,691.465,697.135,"Well, was the suggestion that the political process could deal with it by making new constitutional law?"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,697.135,701.92,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice, and we don't believe that's what's been done here."
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.151,741.73,"Yes, and if Congress had addressed itself in the ADEA to simply arbitrary and irrational judgments based on age, but it seems to me it went a good deal further than that and said that between 40 and 65, that you simply could not discriminate in any way between these people."
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,741.73,762.811,"It didn't go quite that far, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think actually it established a scheme which is more proportional to the Equal Protection Clause core than in the voting rights cases, for example, because what Congress did, it recognized, it learned from the Labor Department that there are some instances when employers rely on age in a noninvidious, rational way."
1999.98-791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.663,805.386,"Is there any indication in the statute or, as far as you know, in the legislative history that Congress believed that such invidious discrimination by the States was unconstitutional?"
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,805.386,808.152,"There's no reference to the Constitution, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.152,809.288,That's extraordinary.
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,809.288,818.36,"There are comparisons to title VII and to other discrimination statutes which Congress certainly knew had been passed to deal with constitutional problems, but of course--"
1999.98-791,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.36,830.684,"You're saying Congress took this action in order to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, but makes no reference to the Fourteenth Amendment in the text of the statute, or any reference to the fact that it thought this action was unconstitutional."
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,830.684,833.303,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,837.188,838.771,Fullilove has been overruled.
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,838.771,849.979,"--Not on the point that Congress' section 5 power could be considered as a source of the statute, despite the fact that Congress hadn't mentioned the Fourteenth Amendment."
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.806,905.733,"But it's one thing to say you're acting under section 5, which gives the enforcement power to Congress, but then for Congress to go and say we're acting under section 5 but we don't even mention what constitutional provision we're talking about seems strange."
1999.98-791,0,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,905.733,935.685,"But I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that if Congress has made clear its judgment as to the nature of the conduct it is dealing with, and it made that clear here not only in '67 but in the '74 legislative history that it believed it was dealing with arbitrary, invidious discrimination, it seems to me the fact that Congress did not then finish the sentence and say, and that violates the Constitution, is not dispositive as to Congress' possession of the power to enact the statute."
1999.98-791,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.685,936.919,"Thank you, Mr. Collins."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,939.137,947.977,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.329,1004.729,"Oh, excuse me."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1016.637,1017.489,--Well--
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.489,1023.077,Which I thought is the usual test for rational basis scrutiny.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1023.077,1023.977,"--Actually, the--"
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.977,1029.131,"I mean, in gross you could say, you know, I'm better off hiring people under 60."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1042.438,1050.127,"--The evidence before Congress was of a decision that was common, and it was irrational."
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.785,1064.635,So is that irrational?
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1065.803,1066.37,--And what they--
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1066.37,1068.839,I want to hire somebody who will be with my company for a long time.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1072.473,1083.181,"--And what Congress found was that those decisions were predominantly based on beliefs that Congress also found, on the basis of studies, to be false, that--"
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.181,1083.814,But that's not false--
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1083.814,1084.164,--It is--
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1084.164,1088.585,--if the person who's 40 is going to be retiring sooner than the person who's 20.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1089.685,1090.402,--It's false--
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1090.402,1092.887,"Now, you can say as a policy matter we shouldn't allow this."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1093.554,1094.572,--It's false--
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.572,1099.124,"But to say that it's unconstitutional because it's irrational, I... it just boggles my mind."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1099.124,1108.713,--The studies before Congress showed that in fact younger employees did not stay with companies longer than people who joined them at the age... in their forties and fifties.
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1135.28,1136.88,And didn't retire sooner.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1136.88,1138.898,--They didn't leave sooner.
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.219,1146.352,Exclude one reason.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1150.64,1174.655,"--Well, what Congress found was that the reasons actually used by employers, namely, the belief that they were less productive, more often absent, and left sooner, were false, that that's what the studies showed, and that that's the belief on which the employers were by and large acting, and on the basis of that kind of information, Congress passed this law."
1999.98-791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1174.655,1179.725,"Well, at the very least there wasn't any focus, was there, on State action?"
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1179.725,1190.498,"There was, even in 1967 when the law was passed, evidence before Congress about State action, although--"
1999.98-791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1190.498,1198.954,"There's just very little reference to State action, and don't most States have their own age discrimination laws today?"
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1198.954,1199.387,"--Well, by now they do."
1999.98-791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1200.639,1202.106,They certainly do now.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1202.106,1204.941,"--When the statute was passed in '67, there were only a few."
1999.98-791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1205.958,1209.844,Could not these very plaintiffs have pursued State law actions?
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1212.51,1215.129,--It's actually not clear about the Alabama plaintiff.
1999.98-791,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1215.831,1218.248,--But Florida clearly has laws.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1218.248,1220.366,--Florida has laws.
1999.98-791,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1285.408,1307.508,"Ms. Underwood, in that respect it resembles title VII, doesn't it, because there were EEO laws in the States long before title VII came on the books, and I believe when title VII was extended to public employment, State and Federal, the vast majority of States had their own antidiscrimination statutes."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1307.508,1308.258,That's correct.
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1331.187,1341.145,"Of course, the reason for the unconstitutionality of race discrimination is not some generalized notion that it's irrational, but the explicit constitutional prohibition of it."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1343.279,1348.149,"That's correct, although the history of sex discrimination is a little bit more ambiguous."
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.95,1391.578,"--Maybe, but I've never heard it argued on the basis of irrationality, that the reason Congress can do this is that sex discrimination is irrational, and therefore... and therefore title... the Fourteenth Amendment is triggered."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1391.578,1418.479,"The fact that age discrimination is not entitled to the same kind of constitutional scrutiny as race discrimination and therefore has to be irrational before it's unconstitutional, as distinguished from the different tests that would be applied to race, doesn't put it beyond the race, the reach of the Protection Clause or beyond the reach of Congress."
1999.98-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.12,1431.537,But--
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1431.537,1432.405,--or even heightened scrutiny.
1999.98-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1432.405,1453.152,"--But Ms. Underwood, by that standard, things that are dealt with on a rational basis approach, zoning decisions and that sort of thing, they're all within Congress' section 5 power under your view, because there can be existent cases of arbitrary exercises of that authority."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1453.152,1453.468,Well--
1999.98-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1453.468,1455.854,And I presume Congress could then address the subject.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1455.854,1466.46,"--Well, Congress... what happened here isn't that Congress identified an occasional instance of arbitrary use of age and provided a remedy."
1999.98-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1486.79,1506.203,"What if Congress were to look over a whole bunch of zoning decisions and say, there's just evidence throughout the country that people are being deprived of their right to make the best use of their property by these zoning decisions, so we're just going to make it a Federal statute that allows you to bring everything in Federal court."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1506.203,1511.339,"No, I don't think that would be an appropriate exercise of the section 5 power."
1999.98-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.547,1525.082,"Well, let's say their class is developers."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1525.082,1542.293,"--Well, I think that a... the kind of person... class-based judgment based on personal characteristics have traditionally been the subject of persistent discrimination that has a kind of impact on an individ... on a group--"
1999.98-791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1542.293,1562.374,"Don't you think that the far-reaching nature of these questions respecting Congress' power under the Fifth... Fifth Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is a reason why we should insist on a very clear statement of intent to abrogate in the first place, then Congress could have these debates."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1565.992,1566.592,--Congress--
1999.98-791,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1566.592,1568.361,It didn't come to anything close to it.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1568.361,1573.646,--Congress had the debate about the rationality of the use of age.
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.085,1592.743,"Ms. Underwood, when Congress makes a conclusion of irrationality regarding the treatment of some insular minority within the electorate, I'm inclined to credit it."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1604.951,1608.169,"Well, I'd like to mention--"
1999.98-791,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.169,1610.705,And a body of voters that changes.
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1638.272,1644.442,"--Well, I think you've identified a distinction, but that doesn't mean that Congress didn't have the power to find what this Court couldn't."
1999.98-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1647.711,1649.246,"Very well, Ms. Underwood."
1999.98-791,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1651.946,1652.532,That's correct.
1999.98-791,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.532,1653.082,Very well.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1654.898,1662.571,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.98-791,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.282,1760.651,"Mr. Sutton, I don't understand this argument of yours."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1778.846,1780.498,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1829.564,1848.959,"When I put these statutes together by using quotes and brackets and so forth, I got the following: bracket, the ADEA, bracket, shall be enforced in accordance with the, bracket, quote, following, quote, provision."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1872.408,1874.01,"Two problems, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.86,1876.378,If I put them together right.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1876.378,1885.817,"--First of all, the problem that Justice Kennedy identified, the phrase, court of competent jurisdiction by itself is ambivalent, the reason being there are two issues in an abrogation case."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.574,1968.702,"If that section had been repealed, would you then agree that there had been a valid abrogation, or are you arguing in effect that Congress must say in so many words that the Eleventh Amendment immunity, the States shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment?"
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1968.702,1971.839,"Our case gets much harder, Your Honor, at that point."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1987.682,1991.151,"Without saying, and the Eleventh Amendment is hereby abrogated."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1991.151,1994.186,"And they've not used what we'll call magic words to say the Eleventh Amendment, so my case--"
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1994.186,2005.977,"So what would you here... if you say, you don't need those magic words, what in addition to the repealing of the section... whose number I forgot, what, in addition, would it have taken?"
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2005.977,2017.535,"--Just what we have in Seminole Tribe, which is several mentions of the phrase, State, in the enforcement provision, the State itself, not just in the court enforcement provision, but throughout the whole remedial scheme."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2017.535,2018.768,How about title VII?
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2018.768,2023.272,"Well, title VII is... does mention the public body in the scheme itself."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2032.811,2038.215,Although they didn't say the immunity under the Eleventh Amendment is abrogated.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2038.215,2039.733,"That's true, they did not, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2039.733,2045.904,"And so they could have been thinking of State in an Ex parte Young sense, the injunctive relief."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2045.904,2053.041,"That is true, and I think that is an ambiguity, and I think that's one of the things that Justice Kennedy's question prompts, is the question--"
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2053.041,2055.659,So you think Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer was decided wrongly.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2055.659,2057.043,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2077.239,2079.192,Just before you get there--
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2079.192,2079.542,Yes.
1999.98-791,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2079.542,2087.63,"--Has either Florida or Alabama permitted a suit in its own court, waived sovereign immunity in its own courts, in State courts?"
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2087.63,2098.587,"Your Honor, there are published Florida opinions where there are money damages actions brought against public employees in State court against Florida, public employers, as to--"
1999.98-791,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.587,2100.222,Under this statute?
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2100.222,2101.724,"--Oh, under that... I'm... excuse me, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.702,2123.387,"Howell wasn't the State, was it?"
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2124.954,2125.87,"It was a county, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2143.432,2153.937,"Can I quickly ask you on that 626(c)(1), it looks as if its there either to specify legal and equitable or for the purpose of putting in the proviso."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2153.937,2154.473,Right.
1999.98-791,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.808,2163.06,"Wall, you could write (c)(1) in order to put in the proviso."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2170.483,2171.033,--Uh-huh.
1999.98-791,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2429.249,2441.641,"Of course, seven out of those eight steps can be eliminated by the simple fact that the elderly employee just says, life is too short, and doesn't seek litigation."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2454.301,2457.919,"--No doubt, Your Honor, but that is not a problem the ADEA is going to cure."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2465.59,2468.624,Doesn't the ADEA require you to touch base with State law?
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2474.095,2480.666,"--That is true, and there's a 60-day wait before you can bring a Federal action, but there's nothing about the age laws that require you to wait."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2495.192,2495.961,There's no exhaustion requirement.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2495.961,2496.528,--Excuse me.
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2496.528,2497.928,There's no exhaustion requirement.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2497.928,2498.528,Exactly.
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2504.567,2506.634,"Well, there's one point in this that puzzles me."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2531.115,2534.734,"I... I'm sure I did, and I most clearly misspoke."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.704,2539.371,"Yes, I mean that."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2539.921,2540.438,Okay.
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2543.256,2543.941,--Okay.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2546.341,2546.893,Right.
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2546.893,2555.749,"--to stop using this formula to calculate salaries because it discriminates against older people, stop order from the Federal court."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2576.413,2586.101,"Well, Your Honor, that raises some of the questions we were addressing earlier, and that's whether the State waiver with respect to claims under State law constitutes a waiver for Federal law claims."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2588.018,2588.47,But it's not a Federal law claim.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2615.788,2626.845,"Your Honor, the premise of the question about ordinary rules of issue and claim preclusion, and I'm certainly underarmed against you on this particular issue, if that is correct, I think that would be a problem."
1999.98-791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.845,2628.695,Wouldn't that depend on State law?
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2628.695,2629.713,Absolutely.
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2654.996,2664.619,"But I don't follow the beginning in the State, because you'd have no reason to go into the Federal court for Ex parte Young injunctive relief if you win on the merits in the State, where you could get both."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2664.619,2666.054,--That is true.
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2666.854,2671.557,"And you might be... if you tried it, that, encounter a problem of splitting your claims."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2671.557,2674.492,"--No, I'm just saying as a theoretical matter, one could."
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2725.509,2758.563,"Well, does that... given your argument, does that as a practical matter entail that there simply cannot be general statutory enforcement of a first tier equal protection claim in the practical world, so that your position really is that you can enforce... Congress can enforce by general legislation antidiscrimination against suspect categories and so on, but that is really in practical terms the extent of the enforcement power under section 5?"
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2758.563,2768.538,"--Well, Your Honor, they... and I think I'm answering your question... they can always pass legislation that creates a standard that parallels the equal protection standard and supplies--"
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2768.538,2771.054,"What would that... true, but what would that accomplish?"
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2773.506,2774.192,"--Well, I--"
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2774.192,2777.727,Why not simply leave it to the individual claimant to come in under 1983?
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2778.41,2779.31,--Well--
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2779.31,2780.512,--Would there be any advantage?
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2780.512,2783.714,"--No, I... 1983 is an enforcement statute--"
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2783.714,2784.264,Yes.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2784.264,2793.419,--and I think you're right to suggest that there aren't going to be many situations where an individual is going to have a successful equal protection claim for discrimination against the elderly.
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2793.419,2794.386,On your view.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2794.386,2796.271,"Well, yes."
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2796.638,2799.673,I'm not suggesting that as a cosmic matter that I am adopting your view.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2799.673,2800.106,"--No, no, no."
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2800.54,2802.04,I'm simply exploring your position.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2802.04,2813.414,"No, but I... and I'm answering it by referring to this Court's cases, and that would be under Murgia, Bradley, and Gregory v. Ashcroft, that that seems to me a very difficult standard to meet."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2838.798,2847.404,"Mr. Sutton, where do you put sex discrimination, then, in the... because as I understand it, there's race and national origin and religion in title VII--"
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2847.404,2848.254,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2848.254,2871.436,"--which all had something before the Civil Rights Act in 1964 to suggest that those were suspect categories, but sex discrimination, as I think was pointed out, even in the time title VII was extended, the only decision on the book was Reed v. Reed, and that applied a rational basis test."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2871.436,2872.352,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2943.882,2945.567,Could you add anything to the catalogue?
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,2966.248,2970.366,--I couldn't begin to answer that.
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3028.369,3054.27,"Do you take the position, when considering proportionality with respect to a first tier rational basis equal protection category, that it is irrelevant, or at least unnecessary for us to consider the defenses in the statute, e.g., bona fide occupational qualification and so on, and limitations on remedies?"
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3073.683,3089.543,"Well, Your Honor, first of all I would say the defenses don't parallel Equal Protection Clause defenses, so that's one of the central arguments we're making, and I think it is borne out by this Court's decision in Western Airlines, but there are... it's true, there are things in the statute."
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3102.751,3109.523,"That certainly goes to federalism, but is it... do you take the position that it's irrelevant to the question of proportionality?"
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3109.523,3111.057,"--No, it is relevant."
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3113.124,3114.524,It just doesn't get you across the line.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3138.257,3143.011,"--Just, when you say 1983 litigation, you're referring to litigation involving equal protection claims--"
1999.98-791,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3143.011,3143.378,Yes.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3143.378,3143.794,--exactly.
1999.98-791,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3216.39,3218.258,"Mr. Sutton, can I just ask one very minor question."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3233.785,3235.987,"--With that last caveat, yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.987,3236.487,Yes.
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3236.487,3237.654,That is true.
1999.98-791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.708,3300.977,"Thank you, Mr. Sutton."
1999.98-791,2,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3300.977,3301.444,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.98-791,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3301.444,3303.679,"Ms. Underwood, you have 3 minutes remaining."
1999.98-791,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3303.679,3319.605,"As to the fact that this Court has not found an age discrimination unconstitutional, I'd like to point out that this is no different from what happened with literacy tests for voting."
1999.98-791,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.606,3362.016,"It's not quite parallel, because the discrimination there is discrimination on the basis of race or national origin, which was clearly unconstitutional discrimination, and the only issue was whether this device achieved it or not."
1999.98-791,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3370.121,3373.089,"--Well, no, it's whether... I think it's... the parallel is much stronger."
1999.98-791,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3479.609,3487.448,Would you say that was irrational under the... under our constitutional jurisprudence?
1999.98-791,3,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3487.448,3496.202,"--I would say that Congress... that it was irrational under our jurisprudence if it was based on the belief... false beliefs, as Congress found that these decisions were."
1999.98-791,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3496.202,3497.87,"Thank you, Ms. Underwood."
