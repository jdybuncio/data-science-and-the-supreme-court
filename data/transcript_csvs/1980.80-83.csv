1980.80-83,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.237,We will hear arguments next in Muskie v. Agee.
1980.80-83,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,58.753,62.555,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1776.611,1779.211,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-83,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1790.502,1792.387,He'll be back before you finish your statement.
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1792.387,1808.896,I just want to answer one question which you asked the Solicitor General that has to do with when Mr. Agee's passport was last renewed.
1980.80-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1822.656,1824.425,You say renewed.
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1829.377,1835.982,I assume it was issued five years previously thereto; I think five years is now the standard period.
1980.80-83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1835.982,1845.005,"Well, your affidavit in the record says it was issued March 30, '73, and expires on March 29, 1983."
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1845.005,1847.707,That is an error.
1980.80-83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1854.277,1855.877,And it's been renewed now until '83?
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1855.877,1857.063,--And is renewed--
1980.80-83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.063,1859.765,"Well, I'm just reading from your affidavit, that's all."
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1859.765,1863.25,--It must be a typographical error.
1980.80-83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.809,1878.66,That's what you say.
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1878.66,1879.242,--Yes.
1980.80-83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.594,1884.213,"But you say it was issued on March 30, '73?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,1889.581,1891.217,It was renewed in '78; yes.
1980.80-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.898,2080.64,"--Mr. Wulf, to what extent do you think that Congress can limit the President's authority to revoke or grant a passport to someone whom he has previously issued it to?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2080.64,2086.027,"According to the decision in Kent, he has plenary... Congress has plenary authority."
1980.80-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.364,2115.129,"Do you think that if the President appoints an ambassador to Italy and trouble comes up in Italy and the President summons the ambassador home, that the ambassador can simply stay in Italy and keep his passport, saying I've got a right to travel and I'm not going to come home?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2115.129,2118.765,"Well, he can certainly be deposed and--"
1980.80-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2118.765,2122.967,"He wouldn't be ambassador for long, I'm sure, but--"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2122.967,2124.752,--Not at all.
1980.80-83,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2218.031,2229.754,"--Which of our prior cases, Mr. Wulf, would you think presented conduct and acts comparable to that of the respondent here?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2229.754,2238.092,I think that Kent involved the same kind of considerations that are involved here.
1980.80-83,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2239.277,2241.896,Disclosure of national security information?
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2241.896,2256.156,"--Well, the Kent decision, particularly the Kent dissent; and of course we all remember the history of that period when travel by American communists and communist sympathizers was prohibited, during the '50s."
1980.80-83,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2272.915,2284.973,Did any of the people involved in any of that litigation get themselves involved in releasing classified information of the United States?
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2284.973,2319.979,"The party in Dayton v. United States, which was a companion case to Kent, the basis on which his passport was refused at that time, which led to the decision here, was that it was thought that he had something to do... and I quote from the charges against him... something to do with the Rosenberg espionage ring, and that he was at a meeting somewhere in New York where information was prepared for delivery to a foreign nation."
1980.80-83,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2321.681,2334.589,"Well, that might be suspicion, founded or not founded, but how does that compare with the statements released by Mr. Agee in the London press conference?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2334.589,2336.624,"--Oh, I would think they would be worse, Your Honor."
1980.80-83,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2336.624,2337.441,Worse?
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2337.441,2343.595,"The statements that Mr. Agee released are expressions, political expressions which are protected under the First Amendment."
1980.80-83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2423.064,2431.92,"Well, might I ask, Mr. Wulf, the same question I asked of the Solicitor General about that information in Footnote 7 of the Court of Appeals' opinion?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2458.653,2466.426,"--No, I don't know what they are, and neither does the Government, Your Honor, because there's absolutely no explanation about those in the documents where they appear."
1980.80-83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2466.426,2473.98,"Well, wouldn't that be significant in terms of the issue you're now arguing if that were so?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2473.98,2482.585,"I think they are insignificant, Your Honor, because there's no explanation about what they mean."
1980.80-83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2541.891,2552.865,"Well, I agree with you, Mr. Wulf, that we're not told how many of those 36-odd were bad check, unpaid debt, difficulty with the police, and that sort of thing."
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2556.651,2558.602,"--We can't find out, because they--"
1980.80-83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.602,2569.226,"But that same statement says, there were numerous other refusals for security reasons, in addition to the ones that might be harmful to relations."
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2569.226,2580.582,"--Well, their saying it isn't proof that it exists, Your Honor, and they can't produce the proof because... well, they haven't produced it; perhaps they can but they haven't here, and they have to rely on the record which they presented to the Court here."
1980.80-83,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2606.649,2606.649,Am I disqualified to talk--
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2606.649,2607.665,I'm sorry?
1980.80-83,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2607.665,2612.184,"--because I know why one of them was, am I disqualified because I know why one of them was?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2612.184,2614.653,"No, we won't disqualify Your Honor."
1980.80-83,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2614.653,2615.755,You won't?
1980.80-83,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.755,2634.649,"Mr. Wulf, can I ask what your position is with respect to the authority of the Secretary of State to revoke a passport for matters such as writing bad checks, being convicted of crimes, or something of that kind, non-political in context, but is there authority for the Secretary to do it?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2634.649,2637.268,I think he doesn't have authority.
1980.80-83,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.268,2638.434,He does not have?
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2638.434,2638.868,That's right.
1980.80-83,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2677.909,2682.38,"Well, do you agree that that's a proper basis for revocation of a passport, and if so, what's the authority for that?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2682.38,2687.451,The authority for that is that Kent found that that was--
1980.80-83,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.451,2690.819,Did Kent create an authority that did not previously exist?
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2690.819,2695.605,--Kent found the authority when it hadn't been previously looked for.
1980.80-83,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2695.605,2696.723,Where did it find it?
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2696.723,2697.69,In history.
1980.80-83,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.69,2701.091,"In history, rather than in any written regulation or statute?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2701.091,2703.31,Absolutely; absolutely.
1980.80-83,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.328,2709.964,I'd sort of like to figure out where the thing started.
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2717.201,2729.442,--There were first cases in the 19th century which are described in one or another of the briefs before the Court.
1980.80-83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.442,2732.06,"Well, did Kent involve a revocation?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2732.06,2735.495,Kent was a refusal.
1980.80-83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.197,2750.339,"Well, I know, so you do say that despite the absence of any express power to revoke in the Secretary, the Secretary at least for some reason may revoke a passport?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2750.339,2751.291,I wouldn't deny that.
1980.80-83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.945,2760.73,And if he can refuse for a reason he can revoke for the same reason?
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2760.73,2762.763,We wouldn't contest that; no.
1980.80-83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2762.763,2769.503,"Well, are you suggesting now, Mr. Wulf, as in Kent, that Mr. Agee's activities have First Amendment protection?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2769.503,2770.403,Yes.
1980.80-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.403,2772.503,"Well, then you reject--"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2772.503,2776.89,"But I go beyond that, of course, because I think Kent is broader than merely a First Amendment case."
1980.80-83,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2785.044,2793.499,"--I know, but what was the constitutional protection for whatever the activities were that were involved in Kent, wasn't it in every instance the First Amendment?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2793.499,2794.832,--Yes.
1980.80-83,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.832,2798.051,"You reject the Court of Appeals' distinction, then?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2805.64,2812.877,"We don't argue the distinction about that, Your Honor."
1980.80-83,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2812.877,2831.588,"Mr. Wulf, is it your position that the First Amendment protects everything that Mr. Agee is said to have stated in his press release in London in 1974, including the exposing of CIA agents abroad?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2831.588,2832.374,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2834.074,2838.194,There is no First Amendment in that there's no written constitution in England.
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2838.194,2841.563,"--Oh, it's protected with respect to American law."
1980.80-83,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2841.563,2842.563,Of course.
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2842.563,2843.146,Yes.
1980.80-83,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2843.146,2853.185,"But even if exposing the agents, as the Solicitor General has argued, resulted in their death, is that a proper exercise of the First Amendment?"
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2853.185,2861.525,There is no claim at all here that his revelations have resulted in anybody's death.
1980.80-83,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2883.973,2892.544,I'm not suggesting that there is proof of an agent dying as a result of Mr. Agee's disclosures; I just don't know.
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2900.316,2917.461,"--Well, as you presumably know, Your Honor, there has been attempts continually being made for the last year or two in Congress to adopt a statute which would make it a crime to identify CIA and other covert action--"
1980.80-83,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2917.461,2920.979,It's very difficult to draw that sort of legislation.
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2920.979,2929.002,"--And the Congress has been unsuccessful in doing it, and no bill has been acted on, no statute has been adopted."
1980.80-83,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2929.002,2930.219,But if it adopted--
1980.80-83,1,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,2930.219,2938.858,"Until then, if such a statute should be adopted, I dare say that the question of constitutionality will be here soon enough."
1980.80-83,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3654.936,3658.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-83,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3767.692,3770.061,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
1980.80-83,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3770.061,3771.077,Thank you.
