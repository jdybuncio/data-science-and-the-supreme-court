2001.00-1770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,11.488,33.766,Mr. Feldman.
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,33.766,46.443,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Confronted with the problem, an undisputed problem, of severe violence and drug crimes and other crimes in public housing, Congress enacted the statute at issue in this case."
2001.00-1770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,87.142,100.155,Do you have any question about the respondent's standing to contest the provisions that... of a lease that's made between HUD and the housing--
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,100.155,113.334,"The... what happened in the district court in this case, if I can just answer it this way, is there was a... we suggested that the court should abstain, and this whole thing should be litigated in the local courts in the unlawful detainer action."
2001.00-1770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.006,133.366,--Is the... is the issue jurisdiction?
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,133.366,135.686,"--No, I don't... I don't think it is jurisdictional."
2001.00-1770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,166.422,172.038,"We read scienter requirements into criminal statutes with some regularity, don't we?"
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,172.038,173.248,--Yes.
2001.00-1770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.539,193.771,What... what about other civil forfeiture actions?
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,203.099,207.11,"I'm not sure... well, under Federal law, I'm not sure."
2001.00-1770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.872,215.014,Was that--
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,215.014,221.419,"State... in the United States... in Bennis against Michigan, I don't think there was such a... there was such a provision."
2001.00-1770,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.718,261.296,--Is it your position that the Government can place any terms and conditions whatever on leases as long as it doesn't violate some other constitutional provision like the First Amendment?
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,261.296,263.51,"Yes, I think that is our position."
2001.00-1770,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.51,267.771,And so this is a condition that the Government has the right to impose.
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,269.622,270.166,That's right.
2001.00-1770,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.48,273.174,Then you don't need reliance on Bennis at all.
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,273.174,273.926,"--No, no."
2001.00-1770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.851,291.462,Whether it involves a narrower or a broader slice really doesn't make any difference.
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,293.632,293.931,--Right.
2001.00-1770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,300.123,307.136,I guess I'm still... I guess I'm still puzzled by why a tenant can sign a lease and then challenge it.
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,319.739,341.259,"I think that the tenant's position... I suppose the tenant... you'd have to ask my opponent, but I think the tenant's position here is that this lease provision which embodies the... the HUD rule of... the rule that Congress enacted concerning that there was no innocent owner defense, that that is itself not authorized by Federal law or not permitted by Federal law and therefore was an invalid condition."
2001.00-1770,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,343.883,366.955,"The position of the Government in... in saying that any misuse by any guest, whether on or off the premises, will result in a forfeiture does seem to operate in a rather draconian fashion in some of the examples we've been given in the briefs."
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,375.051,386.192,"I think most... I would say that most of the examples that are given in... that are given in the amicus briefs supporting respondent are ones that are based on third-hand hearsay, and I'm not sure that they're accurate accounts of those events, but--"
2001.00-1770,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.192,389.995,"Well, but if they are, they sound pretty draconian."
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,389.995,396.379,"--I think the underlying point is that Congress was facing a very serious problem, and it had essentially three choices."
2001.00-1770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,451.494,458.646,"Mr. Feldman, how can you say that's so when the district court... the injunction was he's drawing a line between on premises and off premises."
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,494.87,496.678,--That... that's correct.
2001.00-1770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.763,543.488,But you say this is... a housing authority may not must.
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,543.488,543.75,That's correct.
2001.00-1770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,543.75,560.923,"And I think in your brief, as well as in Judge O'Scannlain's opinion for the original panel, there was a suggestion that the housing authority should be equitable in the way it administers it, that it shouldn't evict every time it theoretically could."
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,581.654,588.651,I don't think there would be because I think Congress... the way the scheme works is this is a provision in a lease which is a sort of contract.
2001.00-1770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,640.054,640.72,Do I understand--
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,640.72,642.427,There... there might be other cases where that's not appropriate.
2001.00-1770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,642.427,653.355,"--But you did take the position that here and now with this, that the housing authority should not evict automatically, that they should do it on a case-by-case basis."
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,654.614,671.611,"I think what... well, you know, I hesitate to say yes to that because I think what... our position is that the housing authority has the discretion to enforce these provisions or not, and there may be cases where zero tolerance policy is necessary or required, in which case that's what they should do."
2001.00-1770,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.611,679.286,"--But the discretion is unreviewable and in the... in the final analysis, as I understand your argument, it doesn't have to exercise any discretion at all."
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,682.075,684.235,They... it could say zero tolerance across the board.
2001.00-1770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,684.235,688.096,"And if... if you say it's reviewable by the courts, talk about an unworkable system."
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,689.083,707.771,"That's correct because you... with respect to the particular issue of knowledge that's at issue here, as I said, it's going to be very hard for a housing authority, which is not a criminal prosecution agency... they're in the business of running housing... housing developments, not prosecuting crimes... to prove who had exactly what state of mind or who had what level of control."
2001.00-1770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,787.563,794.64,"Mr. Feldman, how do you answer that the statute doesn't say anything about the duration of time or the place?"
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,806.022,818.363,"In terms of time, I think that there... generally the statute doesn't say anything about time, and I think it would be open to HUD to fill in a... in a gap, although certainly a very broad period of time would be... would be suggested."
2001.00-1770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.483,824.587,But you're saying the part of the unreviewable discretion is it could be 5 years ago.
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,824.587,837.323,"--That's... that's correct, but that... that... it was not... the issue of time and place... and let me say place is addressed in the statute because Congress... originally it said on or near, and Congress amended in 1996 to say on or off."
2001.00-1770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.694,935.755,"Well, it runs up against expressio unius too, doesn't it--"
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,935.755,936.08,--Right.
2001.00-1770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.08,936.32,--as a--
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,936.32,950.384,"Right, and... and I think in this case where there's no word in this statute that requires that... that requires interpretation and the context that you're trying to take the meaning from is quite a... an entirely different context, I don't think that that in pari materia is soundly applied."
2001.00-1770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.326,1025.146,--They can litigate that in the unlawful detainer action.
2001.00-1770,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1025.146,1038.731,"That's right, and they have the right to litigate all of the issues that would come up in the unlawful detainer action, but it doesn't... the... the fact that they have a property interest in their lease doesn't, in turn, give them a property interest in acting in ways substantively that are contrary to the terms of their lease."
2001.00-1770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1043.002,1044.486,"Very well, Mr. Feldman."
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1046.976,1073.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In response to Congress' enactment of 1437d(l)(6) and HUD's regulations, the Oakland Housing Authority revised its lease to properly reflect the changes that had taken place with regard to the HUD regulations."
2001.00-1770,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1136.752,1141.712,"Mr. Lafayette, how big a problem is this in this housing authority?"
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1141.712,1143.03,It's a... it's a significant problem.
2001.00-1770,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1324.465,1333.958,"But that was not required of the housing authority, and if they had gone and said, well, we don't care that circumstances have changed, out you go, that would be unreviewable."
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1333.958,1335.697,That would be unreviewable.
2001.00-1770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1441.244,1446.188,Do you take the position that you could have this provision in the lease even without the Federal statute?
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1446.188,1452.626,There is nothing that restrains us from putting this provision in this lease before that.
2001.00-1770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1472.988,1480.215,"That... that in premises has not... has never been an issue in this case, I take it."
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1480.215,1487.724,"In premises has not, but in premises alone does not address the problem with regard to this type of activity in public housing."
2001.00-1770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.858,1507.639,"May I ask one question, if you're through?"
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1527.927,1536.455,--There... there isn't a procedure in place for anyone to review these decisions based on some arbitrariness standard.
2001.00-1770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1537.351,1547.191,"Well, but I mean, in the precise instance that Justice Stevens gave you, that would be a constitutional violation, wouldn't it?"
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1547.191,1548.54,If--
2001.00-1770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.54,1553.431,And you... you would have judicial review for... for violation of some constitutional provision.
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1553.431,1556.002,--It's foreseeable if there is a constitutional issue.
2001.00-1770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.479,1562.167,Of course.
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1562.167,1564.103,--then those issues could be reviewable.
2001.00-1770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.103,1564.759,Right.
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1564.759,1566.652,But--
2001.00-1770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1566.652,1568.007,What?
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1573.111,1577.111,--That could be and it could be a 1983 violation against the housing authority.
2001.00-1770,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1577.111,1579.271,"Well, wouldn't it have to be on your view?"
2001.00-1770,1,25640,gary_t_lafayette,,1584.546,1597.41,"It could be... landlord-tenant disputes in California are summary proceedings which particularly dovetail into the issues in dispute, and it probably would be a separate action as a 1983 claim."
2001.00-1770,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.132,1612.892,"Thank you, Mr. Lafayette."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1615.959,1656.162,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: In this case, as we've heard in... in the argument of HUD is that HUD says, by reason of this lease provision, which Congress mandated in section 1437d(l)(6), it is the judge and jury as to whether or not innocent tenants, such as the... the respondents who are before this Court, whether they can be summarily evicted from their homes."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1656.162,1661.97,"Well, that doesn't really differ from the role of any landlord in a landlord-tenant situation, does it?"
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1661.97,1680.647,"Yes, Your... Chief Justice, it does because what they're saying is that there can be no defenses raised in the eviction proceeding other than an attack on whether or not there was a drug-related violation."
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1680.647,1686.018,"Well, but as the Chief Justice points out, that's true in... I've drafted many leases and we have clauses--"
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.018,1686.402,--Absolutely.
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1686.402,1689.5,--that this premises is used for commercial purposes.
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.5,1690.418,Regional eighths.
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1690.418,1691.81,The lease is void and that's... and that's it.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1704.812,1730.93,"Justice Kennedy, under most State laws, the eviction court has a right to make a determination whether under all the facts and circumstances to... to terminate the lease would be, for example, a forfeiture because of the violation not being sufficient or the circumstances such as... that don't bring it under those terms."
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1736.631,1742.903,We just don't have before us a question in which you're contesting that the drug activity occurred.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1742.903,1764.295,"--Yes, but the Congress mandated that in any action taken to evict, HUD, or the Oakland Housing Authority in this case, had to provide some grievance mechanism of an independent evaluation whether eviction should occur."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.663,1785.804,"This wasn't the basis of the Ninth Circuit's decision, was it?"
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1785.804,1787.154,Yes.
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.135,1821.452,"Well, this doesn't sound to me like the Ninth Circuit's reasoning at all."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1822.716,1829.148,"Well, it... it is, Your Honor, if you look at what the Ninth Circuit is saying."
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1835.842,1838.13,Where does it come from in the first place?
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.13,1839.415,"Well, where did... exactly."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1840.658,1843.148,The innocent tenant defense?
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.148,1843.495,Yes.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1843.495,1858.092,"From the... the statute which provides that in eviction proceedings, the eviction court shall provide an opportunity for the tenant to present all legal and equitable defenses."
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1858.092,1860.498,"Yes, but the question is whether or not this is a legal defense."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.498,1860.802,Yes.
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1860.802,1862.503,That's the only question before us.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1862.503,1864.972,That's correct.
2001.00-1770,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1873.948,1878.119,But it's not recognized in the Federal statute or in the regulations.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1884.124,1888.594,The... the statute doesn't say anything about defenses.
2001.00-1770,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1906.775,1909.58,But these tenants didn't let it get to that stage.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1916.524,1917.314,That's correct.
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.93,1954.279,Why didn't it say that here?
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1964.071,1965.127,--It put it in.
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.127,1965.735,--it specified it.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,1970.93,1986.812,"I... I submit the reason why they didn't is because landlord-tenant law is a... in public housing is a amalgamation of Federal and State law, and that's well recognized in all the cases."
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.54,2013.724,These provisions are... that say legal and equitable defense can be presented are... appear in Federal law or in State law?
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2013.724,2015.463,They appear in HUD's regulations.
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.284,2037.202,And you think this is an authorization for all sorts of defenses?
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2037.202,2038.268,--Absolutely.
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2042.743,2047.815,Then you are going considerably beyond where the district court left off.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2091.851,2108.124,"I believe you are correct, Justice Ginsburg, that we believe that that defense of a totally innocent tenant should be available whether the offense occurred off or on the premises just as it does in the forfeiture statute."
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.124,2111.431,Did you object in the Ninth Circuit because the district court didn't go far enough?
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2111.431,2113.655,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2113.655,2117.559,A very odd procedural posture you're in.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2124.695,2136.46,"I'm not trying to overturn it, Your Honor, I suggest, but I would be perfectly happy if this Court addressed just the off premises, which is what the district court held."
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2137.223,2139.303,But you say there's no logical line that one could draw.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2149.906,2152.412,--The... the Ninth Circuit didn't draw that line either.
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2160.375,2163.255,I thought the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2163.255,2164.626,--That is correct.
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2164.626,2170.631,And the district court said the... there is no problem with on premises.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2173.682,2179.586,"What the district court said is, I'm not going to issue an injunction for on premises."
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2208.034,2209.906,But you said there's no difference at all.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2228.68,2242.968,"On the facts that were before the district court judge, all he had to deal with, for purposes of the injunction, was the... the off premises."
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2322.483,2328.67,You think it's irrelevant that the tenants signed a contract which specifically provides this in the... in the rider.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2332.227,2334.819,"No, Justice Kennedy, it's not irrelevant."
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2335.433,2343.331,I... I frankly don't understand your... your standing to contest the housing authority's interpretation of a HUD regulation anyway.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2346.67,2369.241,"--The... the question is... and I think the contract question is way circular, that if... if Congress did not mandate that it's an automatic eviction with no opportunity to present any kind of a defense, if Congress didn't mandate it, the fact that it's in the lease doesn't change it."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2380.761,2392.772,"Well, but I'm not sure you're correct in your argument there, Mr. Renne, because perhaps you... if you had a prohibition against that sort of a thing in the statute, certainly HUD would be bound by it."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2402.628,2413.748,"The... but it's also, in its regulations, said that the tenant has a right in the eviction court to present equitable and legal defenses."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2413.748,2417.908,"But as Justice O'Connor said, you never let it get to the eviction court."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2427.967,2431.865,"I respectfully submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that is not what they litigated."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.292,2471.844,"Well, but they're being treated in accordance with the provisions of their lease."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2481.428,2491.951,"But again, with all due respect, that's assuming the answer, and that is that the lease does say that you can't present an innocent tenant defense."
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2494.356,2501.284,"Well, that's a different... now that Ninth... that's... finally you're talking about something the Ninth Circuit talked about, and it seems to me that that's just absolutely dead wrong."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2510.703,2528.905,"--But the... if you are suggesting that the tenant has any choice in a public housing situation in which the... the only choice of housing they have is public housing, to say that somehow or other they have agreed to a provision which Congress didn't require."
2001.00-1770,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2528.905,2534.271,"Well, but... but now... now you're skating away from the point where we were finally at issue."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2541.183,2557.295,"My... Justice Kennedy, what I was saying is that section 1437 of the... of the statute didn't require the language that they are putting in."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2557.295,2568.495,"But under... under your theory, you have to show not just that it didn't require it, but that HUD could not, as an administrative agency, interpret it to allow that."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2568.495,2571.124,And I believe--
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.124,2579.908,"It seems to me your argument... when... when you have to argue that point, the argument, as I regard the Ninth Circuit opinion, is just extremely weak."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2579.908,2584.261,--I address that in three ways.
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2620.207,2622.309,And precisely what are those issues?
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2622.309,2638.207,"The due process issues, Your Honor, in that what they are threatening to do is to attach punishment and collective guilt, and in American jurisprudence, we always put individual--"
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2638.207,2649.786,"If you're... you're saying if you're... if you're evicted from a tenant... as a tenant from a public housing, you are, A, punished, and B, you're found collectively guilty?"
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2649.786,2656.394,"--You are certainly being punished, and Rucker being thrown out in the street is certainly being punished."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2656.394,2660.053,"Well, then... then every eviction proceeding in the country punishes the tenant."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2662.165,2673.509,"And it's because the tenant has supposedly violated and the eviction court has found, based upon all the evidence that it hears, that eviction is appropriate."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.509,2675.541,"Well, we're just going in circles, Mr.--"
2001.00-1770,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.541,2700.277,"--You... as I understand the provision that you object to, it... it says, in effect, the... the tenant who signs the lease is going to be the guarantor that there will be no drug activity in the apartment or by other people who are... are inhabitants or even people who come to the apartment, going to be a guarantor."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2709.274,2712.069,"Under these circumstances, yes."
2001.00-1770,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.069,2712.554,Why?
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2712.554,2734.618,"In... for the same reason that I believe this Court has at least indicated in... in dicta, that when you are essentially seizing what is property, particularly somebody's home, you must afford them due process including--"
2001.00-1770,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2734.618,2744.634,"Well, we're... now, you're talking about procedural due process, and there's no claim here, as I understand it, that the tenants were denied procedural due process."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2759.642,2770.645,--And substantively is that you are... you are punishing without any guilt and without allowing the tenant to establish that he or she is innocent.
2001.00-1770,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2770.645,2776.991,"So, no one can be made the guarantor under a contract for the conduct of a third person."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2776.991,2779.893,Not in public housing--
2001.00-1770,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2779.893,2780.458,--from the Government.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2780.874,2782.079,--In the public housing situation.
2001.00-1770,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2782.079,2782.421,--Is that your position?
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2782.421,2783.466,That is correct.
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2783.466,2801.754,"Then you're challenging something that you have, as I see it, no standing to raise in this Court because I looked back at the district court's opinion, and what it said as to conduct occurring in the tenant's union... unit... it didn't say, well, we just won't extend it preliminarily."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2827.978,2842.533,"Well, with all due respect, Justice Ginsburg, the cases in this Court have said that respondents are entitled to rely on anything that would affirm the judgment below."
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2842.533,2847.338,But the judgment below that's being affirmed deals only with off premises.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2847.338,2862.191,"It's the Ninth Circuit judgment that is being attacked, and the Ninth Circuit does not limit itself in terms of the arguments that it raises and it... conclusions it reached--"
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2862.191,2864.842,Are you not making a distinction between a judgment and an opinion?
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2869.45,2872.229,--What was affirmed was the preliminary injunction.
2001.00-1770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2872.229,2880.368,"Yes, and that preliminary injunction was only with respect to off premises activity, and that's all that the Ninth Circuit affirmed."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2880.368,2883.152,"Yes, I don't disagree with that at all."
2001.00-1770,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2918.011,2937.088,"Well, I... I realize that's your position, but in order to maintain that position on a substantive due process basis, you've got to say, I suppose, that there's no reasonable relationship between this kind of guarantor of conduct provision and the kind of drug problem which I presume it is conceded the Government can deal with."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2949.515,2955.467,"--Well, I don't think that... when you say it seems to be obvious, with all due respect again, I would say they talk about deterrent."
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.48,2976.8,"Well, she didn't take enough steps under the lease."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,2990.955,2991.44,And--
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.44,2994.571,"--Now, she could do that, and you're saying she was blameless."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3022.432,3044.592,"--I suggest that we took... we take... compare it to the forfeiture statute where we have specifically... Congress has mandated that in the forfeiture situation where the drug offense can be... on the premises can be horrible, it can be a very serious drug offense, and they cannot forfeit the tenancy."
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3044.592,3045.659,Congress has said that.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3048.715,3049.685,Yes.
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3049.685,3051.179,My goodness.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3068.416,3073.141,And the... the... it's not... this Court has held it is not--
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3073.141,3073.765,Not--
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3073.765,3078.165,--if there's a nexus either because the automobile was used--
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.165,3079.099,--It's your car.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3099.627,3103.973,"--Well, I... I think the courts recognized that it is her premises."
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3120.315,3121.12,But--
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3121.12,3122.752,--even though it may have occurred on the premises.
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3122.752,3129.824,--forfeiture suggests the Government coming in from the outside and taking the property because of criminal activity.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3139.499,3147.008,"Well, 881 talks specifically about public housing leases as being subject to forfeiture."
2001.00-1770,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.888,3183.712,"Does the landlord have some duty to provide a secure... a secure premises, i.e., secure from drug use?"
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3183.712,3185.536,Yes.
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3249.045,3253.616,The housing authority wants to put the responsibility on her.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3253.616,3254.549,Right.
2001.00-1770,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3254.549,3263.035,It wants to put the responsibility on the tenants to make sure that they are not being the cause of a drug problem in the facility.
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3282.688,3294.091,"And... and the best way for... to make sure that that doesn't happen, that is, that no one on her household violates a drug law or... remember, the statute doesn't just relate to drugs."
2001.00-1770,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.629,3402.757,"Well, you're hypothesizing an exercise of discretion by HUD that's just not in the record."
2001.00-1770,2,38265,paul_a_renne,,3402.757,3403.611,--All right.
2001.00-1770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3404.011,3405.541,"Thank you, Mr. Renne."
2001.00-1770,3,30335,james_a_feldman,,3407.467,3408.667,Thank you.
2001.00-1770,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3454.763,3456.997,And the eviction proceeding is in the State court?
2001.00-1770,3,30335,james_a_feldman,,3456.997,3462.027,"Yes, but what Federal law doesn't do is say that there's any particular defenses."
2001.00-1770,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3557.574,3558.977,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
