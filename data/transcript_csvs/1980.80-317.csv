1980.80-317,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,We will hear arguments first this morning in University of Texas v. Camenisch.
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,17.093,20.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,150.363,161.552,"May I ask, Mr. Zwiener, your position is that there's absolutely no affirmative obligation under any circumstances toward the handicapped?"
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,179.48,181.548,I beg your pardon?
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,181.548,184.434,Do you have to provide a ramp for that handicapped person?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,184.434,185.384,We would say not.
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,185.384,186.119,Say not?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,186.119,195.475,"We would say not, unless it's a program in which, which is designed to educate this handicapped in some way."
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,195.475,198.094,"I'm assuming that's what it is, it's a program."
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,205.795,213.151,"No, we would also say, we would also say that it's not an affirmative action statute under any... circumstance."
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,213.151,213.385,--Right.
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,215.52,215.903,That's true.
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,216.87,219.322,Unless you get the federal money to finance the program?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,219.322,219.989,"That's true, Your Honor."
1980.80-317,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,275.475,276.927,Too many oil wells down there.
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,276.927,282.831,"Yes, Your Honor, that has helped the University of Texas and Texas A&M."
1980.80-317,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,544.431,553.286,"Mr. Zwiener, do you know of any evidence that is less reliable in a courtroom than a newspaper?"
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,553.286,554.953,"--You're right, Your Honor."
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.113,601.184,"Mr. Zwiener, I take it your real position is that the regulation that the Government has promulgated is not authorized by the statute, is that?"
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,607.171,608.221,"That's true, Your Honor."
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.221,612.256,"So, basically, the question is whether the regulation is valid or not?"
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,612.256,625.497,"Well, it's also a question whether the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit is correct in saying, not just under the regulations, I think, but I think they went under the statute, so we do have that decision."
1980.80-317,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,814.337,821.843,"This argument, according to your brother, was not raised until now, in this case."
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,821.843,822.91,We are saying that--
1980.80-317,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,822.91,823.843,Is that correct?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,823.843,824.712,--That's true.
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.091,951.289,"Counsel, the court of appeals said that the University of Texas is the recipient of over $31 million of federal assistance and has agreed to comply with Section 504 as a condition to continued receipt of federal funds."
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,951.289,956.276,"Well, we did stipulate that the University got $31 million."
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.482,1046.518,"If you're right, then, you could have denied this man admission to the University, period."
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1051.238,1053.49,"No, sir, we could not do that."
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.49,1054.09,Why not?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1054.09,1054.607,No.
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1054.607,1059.011,If you agree to programs that are supported with federal money?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1059.011,1059.661,That's true.
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.661,1065.498,"And he wants to be, say, an English major and the English Department doesn't get any federal funds, you could say, we don't want deaf people in the English Department."
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1065.498,1066.065,"No, sir."
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.065,1067.032,Why not?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1067.032,1068.782,"No, sir, we could not do that."
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.467,1099.301,Why not?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1099.301,1101.936,"--we don't like blind people, we don't like funny-looking people--"
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.936,1104.721,"I'm asking you, what is it that would prevent you from saying that?"
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1109.209,1117.798,"--We could say it, and I would say that if we did that, and they were otherwise qualified, brought their own interpreter along, were able--"
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.798,1120.35,"I'm asking you, you keep saying you can't do it."
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1123.535,1125.719,--504; it's in the statute.
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.719,1131.622,Then you do not... what happens to your argument that that only applies to programs that are funded with federal money?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1131.622,1135.092,"All right; you're right, Your Honor, you're right."
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.892,1139.094,"So you could in the English Department say, we don't want deaf people, under your view of the case?"
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1139.094,1141.66,"--We very possibly could, under the ultimate--"
1980.80-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.66,1142.979,Not very possibly.
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1145.331,1146.231,--That's true.
1980.80-317,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1147.498,1154.437,Do I correctly understand that he has been allowed to have interpreters in the classes from time to time?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1154.437,1174.533,"Yes, sir, he was always allowed interpreters, and we would say, the reasonable accommodation which Southeast Community College v. Davis refers to is permitting an interpreter to be present, permitting an interpreter to distract, if you will... and there are some people that fussed about some of our city council meetings."
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1199.381,1204.017,And what's the source of the obligation to make that kind of accommodation?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1205.25,1229.983,"Well, I would say... without buying all of my argument, my argument ultimately goes, as indicated, to the fact that 504 doesn't require us to do anything unless the program receives federal financial monies."
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1240.024,1244.326,I'd still like to know what's the source of the obligation to make that accommodation.
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1245.844,1250.665,"--Well, I would say it's this Court's opinion in Southeastern Community College v. Davis."
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1257.735,1258.569,What I was--
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1258.569,1261.121,"--doesn't protect the handicapped, and therefore--"
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1261.121,1263.723,--Wasn't Davis a construction of 504?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1263.723,1265.591,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1274.281,1283.986,"Well, now, but you are conceding, contrary to what you told me at the outset of your argument, that there are some things you have to do for the handicapped under 504."
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1289.373,1291.59,--If the program receives federal assistance.
1980.80-317,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1332.2,1340.056,Does your state statute reach so far as to require that you provide the deaf with an interpreter?
1980.80-317,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1340.056,1342.258,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1980.80-317,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1411.919,1415.621,Mr. Pollak.
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1415.621,1419.175,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.80-317,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1454.598,1455.748,Mr. Pollak--
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1455.748,1456.398,"Yes, sir?"
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1456.398,1462.685,"--It's pretty clear, is it not, that the statute does not and cannot mean exactly what it says?"
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1499.043,1504.345,"Yes sir, we accept that, that's the interpretation in Mr. Justice Powell's opinion for the unanimous Court."
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1504.345,1505.947,But the statute does not mean precisely what it says?
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1505.947,1520.541,"No, it's admitted in spite of, and that's clearly made in the Powell opinion for the Court in Southeastern Community College, and this case does not re-present that issue; indeed the HEW regulations make that clear."
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1520.541,1527.295,"Well, the would-be airplane pilot without hands presents that issue."
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1527.295,1542.287,"No, to the extent that the argument presented by my worthy colleague suggested that we're taking a position that persons may be required to be admitted who cannot press the buttons."
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1571.056,1573.508,"And that he is such, quite apart from his handicap?"
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1573.508,1574.508,--That's correct.
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1582.297,1585.916,He's not somebody who would be qualified except for his handicap.
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1588.518,1589.018,--That's correct.
1980.80-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.228,1606.313,He might even be more qualified because of his handicap?
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1606.313,1607.932,--There is no suggestion--
1980.80-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.932,1609.515,Qualified for the job that he wants?
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1609.515,1610.599,--That's correct.
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1619.487,1626.56,"As I understand it the regulations impose this obligation only in institutions of higher learning, is that correct?"
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1626.56,1633.23,"--We are speaking about, Mr. Justice Stewart, subpart (e) which applies only to postsecondary institutions; that's correct."
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1637.784,1642.652,And is there any such requirement on secondary institutions or below?
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1642.652,1656.912,"Elementary and secondary schools, which is a different subpart, do have a requirement for the children to be provided with interpreters, as HEW has interpreted its regulations."
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1658.863,1665.684,"But, I would think if the statute means what you say it means, then the obligation would run throughout."
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1665.684,1684.829,"I think, while the HEW regulations for higher education have been drawn with the concerns expressed by universities and colleges during the comment period respecting costs, and so as to provide a limited obligation."
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1690.567,1694.787,"Well, the statute doesn't seem to permit any compromise or accommodation."
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1696.906,1701.357,--The obligation imposed by the statute runs throughout; that's right.
1980.80-317,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1724.77,1732.292,And there is a different and lesser obligation imposed upon secondary and primary educational institutions?
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1732.292,1733.676,"No, I don't represent that."
1980.80-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1787.463,1799.121,"What does the record show, if anything, Mr. Pollak, about the financial ability of this respondent to provide his own interpreters?"
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1799.121,1811.761,"The record and stipulation indicates that Mr. Camenisch and his wife had earnings in excess of $23,000."
1980.80-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.281,1850.869,"Then what would you say if the record showed that he had an income of $100,000 a year from a family trust or otherwise?"
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1850.869,1853.338,"We would take the same position, Your Honor."
1980.80-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1853.338,1867.598,"In other words, the University must provide the expense of an interpreter even if the individual student has very large means of his own?"
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,1867.598,1876.937,The statute does not make lack of financial means a condition of the rights which it guarantees; that is our position.
1980.80-317,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2006.839,2013.975,"Mr. Pollak, what's the evidence as to the amount of the federal support for this particular program?"
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2013.975,2028.085,"--Your Honor, the stipulation provides... pages 30, 31, and 32... that the University of Texas receives $31.4 million."
1980.80-317,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2074.633,2075.65,Let's get to the merits.
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2081.87,2094.095,"--My position is that the aid received by this University, $31.4 million, aid to the University satisfies the requirement of 504."
1980.80-317,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2104.485,2107.853,So you feel it's a false issue?
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2107.853,2131.135,"Your Honor, I feel that the issue has not been litigated and presented, and indeed there are interrogatories in the tail end of this brief in which Mr. Camenisch sought, following the decision on the preliminary injunction, this case arises before this Court on a preliminary injunction needed by Mr. Camenisch in order that he could attend the summer session."
1980.80-317,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2143.693,2145.562,"Well, I'm still trying to get at your position."
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2150.447,2159.303,I would be making that argument but I would also be strengthened with the detail of the type of aid which the University received.
1980.80-317,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2161.005,2180.485,"I know, Mr. Pollak, but are we to assume that $31 million, whether or not it supports this particular program, satisfies 504, or are we to assume that $31 million, because it's not otherwise litigated, includes funds, federal funds, to support this program?"
1980.80-317,1,41897,stephen_j_pollak,,2181.068,2194.476,"--My position is that the program to which Mr. Camenisch by the record has been admitted is the University program, and the University program receives $31.4 million, so that any program specificity--"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2680.855,2685.223,I hesitate to answer that with a yes or no.
1980.80-317,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2716.444,2727.752,"I suppose my question is whether or not the Government has the authority under the Constitution to order the elimination of what's characterized as this discrimination, but irrespective of funding?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2727.752,2732.804,"Well, that issue is certainly not before the Court today."
1980.80-317,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2732.804,2733.038,I know.
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2749.832,2759.288,"My answer to that question, Mr. Justice Powell, is that financial need is not a relevant criterion under the regulation."
1980.80-317,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2759.288,2759.738,Right.
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2773.881,2782.387,"Well, I think that the question of whether financial need is an appropriate criterion has been abandoned at this point by the petitioners."
1980.80-317,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2782.387,2784.423,So you think it's not before us at this time?
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2784.423,2799.682,"I don't think that it's the theory on which they bring the case here, although I suppose that if financial need, if the Court were to decide that financial need, notwithstanding the regulation, is an appropriate factor that petitioners might be entitled to some relief from the preliminary injunction."
1980.80-317,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2815.192,2819.846,"Well, if the question's here, the Government's position is that financial need is irrelevant?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2819.846,2822.548,Under this regulation; that is true.
1980.80-317,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2834.355,2839.407,Do you really think the Congress of the United States intended financial need to be irrelevant?
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2839.407,2855.785,"I think the Congress of the United States intended to give to funding agencies the power to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the antidiscrimination, the antiexclusion guarantees of Section 504."
1980.80-317,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2855.785,2864.958,"And without regard to the federal funds provided, and without regard to the financial need of the individual that claimed this help?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2864.958,2872.063,"Well, certainly not without regard to the federal funds provided, because as I said at the very beginning, if there were no federal funds provided--"
1980.80-317,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2872.063,2876.598,"Well, I suggested $31,000 instead of $31 million."
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2876.598,2886.99,"--If there was $31,000 provided, the University would of course make a decision as to whether that amount of aid was sufficient to justify the imposition of the requirements of the statute."
1980.80-317,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2890.692,2892.175,"Without the $31,000?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2892.175,2893.394,"--Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-317,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2897.196,2901.398,"Isn't it true that $31 million to Texas is like $31,000 to most schools?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2901.398,2913.121,"--Mr. Justice Marshall, as I understand the record, it indicates that the $31 million is approximately one-sixth to one-seventh of the University of Texas's annual budget."
1980.80-317,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2913.121,2929.567,"What if the record showed a million-dollar grant to the Medical School, and this student is not part of the Medical School... a $1 million grant to conduct research on cancer."
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2937.839,2950.063,"Mr. Chief Justice, I want to say that the question of the interpretation of the statutory language, program, or activity is a very difficult one that has arisen under Title VI and Title IX, and Section 504."
1980.80-317,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3009.535,3014.756,"In a sense it is jurisdictional, and therefore in a sense it is before the Court."
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3043.172,3048.224,"--Well, I'm not sure that I agree with the characterization of that as jurisdictional, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.80-317,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3049.14,3053.276,"--Well, let's say this institution received no federal aid at all."
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3054.711,3057.08,"--Well, it would have no substantive obligation under the statutes."
1980.80-317,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3057.08,3057.546,Precisely.
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3061.298,3064.65,"Yes, but I think this Court would still have jurisdiction in the case."
1980.80-317,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3064.65,0.0,And the plaintiff simply would not have proved a cause of action?
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3066.566,0.0,Exactly.
1980.80-317,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3116.832,3119.365,That's because we have only the temporary injunction here?
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3119.365,3121.117,"--That's correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.80-317,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3121.117,3124.669,"So there are further proceedings before there's a final judgment on this, is that it?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3124.669,3125.219,That's right.
1980.80-317,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3125.219,3127.705,And how about the question of mootness in this case?
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3130.657,3139.327,"I would think, Mr. Justice Stewart, that there is a substantial question, and I think this is jurisdictional under Article III."
1980.80-317,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3162.276,3166.228,"And he was held harmless, and he has his degree and he's gone and left the University, hasn't he?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3166.228,3172.798,--then the preliminary injunction no longer has any effect and the jurisdictional basis for this petition is no longer--
1980.80-317,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.798,3174.834,It's still not decided who has to pay for the interpreter?
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3174.834,3177.036,"--Oh, that's absolutely correct."
1980.80-317,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3177.036,3179.136,"That's the issue, isn't it, who has to pay the $3,000?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3179.136,3181.421,Just the question of how this petition should be disposed of.
1980.80-317,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3181.421,3182.571,Nobody has to pay for the interpreter anymore.
1980.80-317,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3184.272,3188.974,"Yes, but if the University had no statutory obligation to pay him, they can get their money back from this student."
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3188.974,3189.407,That's right.
1980.80-317,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3192.692,3194.378,That's Liner v. Jafco?
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3194.378,3197.163,I think that's one of the cases that's relevant to that.
1980.80-317,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3197.163,3207.268,"Let me be sure I understand your position as a friend of the Court, in relation to what Mr. Justice Powell was asking you, and what I have put to Mr. Pollak."
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3220.278,3229.717,"Under the regulation that has been promulgated by HEW in implementation of this statute, financial need is not a relevant criterion."
1980.80-317,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3303.765,3316.073,"Well, suppose, Mr. Buscemi, that suddenly someone shows up from Poland or Czechoslovakia to get a master's degree or a PhD and can't speak English."
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3323.809,3332.349,"Well, of course Section 504 would have no application for someone, it would be a discrimination on the basis of national origin, I suppose, what you're referring to."
1980.80-317,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3332.349,3334.784,"No, no; he can't speak English."
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3334.784,3337.503,"Well, I'm not sure--"
1980.80-317,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3337.503,3338.938,That's my hypothesis.
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3338.938,3343.657,--I don't Think that qualifies as a handicap within the meaning of Section 504.
1980.80-317,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3385.3,3387.816,May I ask one question before you sit down?
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3410.88,3415.384,"Well, that was the argument, Mr. Justice Stevens, that petitioners made in the district court."
1980.80-317,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3421.604,3423.806,It's not in the regulation itself?
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3424.972,3425.689,That's right.
1980.80-317,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3431.493,3433.928,"And then, well, it's really not necessary because he can afford his own interpreter?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3433.928,3445.135,"--That would be a possible argument, and that's the argument that was made, because in the district court petitioners assumed that they were required to make some financial expenditures in some circumstances under the Act."
1980.80-317,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3465.964,3473.136,"Why not say that it's not in this case, rather than to continue to say it's irrelevant?"
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3473.136,3478.457,"Well, I'll be happy to adopt your formulation, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1980.80-317,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3481.091,3483.591,You're digging deeper all the time.
1980.80-317,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3487.312,3490.847,The statute certainly does not refer to financial need; that's--
1980.80-317,3,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,3494.132,3496.648,"If I might, Your Honor."
1980.80-317,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3677.834,3679.667,"Well, this case is the case we have before us."
1980.80-317,3,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,3679.667,3693.677,"--And in this case, to summarize, Your Honor, we would say that 504 requires the universities to do nothing; not, certainly not to spend money."
1980.80-317,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3735.338,3740.392,"This case isn't brought under the Constitution either, though."
1980.80-317,3,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,3740.392,3742.51,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1980.80-317,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3792.175,3793.96,"Well, what about 504, though?"
1980.80-317,3,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,3795.662,3798.263,Addresses?
1980.80-317,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3832.117,3840.621,Did the plaintiff's complaint allege that the program in which he was enrolled received federal financial assistance?
1980.80-317,3,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,3840.621,3841.223,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-317,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3841.223,3843.806,"Well, then, he didn't state a case, did he?"
1980.80-317,3,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,3843.806,3847.043,"Well, I may be misstating it, Your Honor, but--"
1980.80-317,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3847.043,3849.41,"Well, that's quite important, I think."
1980.80-317,3,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,3849.41,3883.55,--I didn't... I don't see that he did state it.
1980.80-317,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3883.55,3887.418,Did you file a motion to dismiss on that point?
1980.80-317,3,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,3887.418,3888.787,We filed a motion to dismiss but--
