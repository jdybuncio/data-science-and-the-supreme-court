2006.05-705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.407,We'll hear argument next in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,9.597,13.391,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,100.558,102.959,"Mr. Fisher, may I ask you this question?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,107.713,109.604,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,109.604,111.847,And where may that obligation be enforced?
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,111.847,114.807,Our position is that can be fully enforced in the FCC.
2006.05-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,120.301,123.994,By means of a private action before the FCC?
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,123.994,127.396,"Yes, by means of an administrative action before the FCC."
2006.05-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,127.396,135.211,"Where the carrier... where they would file a complaint saying you owe us X dollars, and the agency could order them to pay X dollars."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,135.211,135.571,That's right.
2006.05-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,145.919,148.951,And is the obligation enforceable in State court?
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,148.951,152.992,"No, we believe... of course, this Court did not grant certiorari--"
2006.05-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,152.992,154.154,I understand that.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,156.067,162.472,"--If this Court holds there is no private cause of action in Federal court, then it is not enforceable in state court either."
2006.05-705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,166.696,174.88,"But the administrative remedy that you just conceded is a counterpart to a private right of action, or isn't it?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,201.447,204.789,"In terms of damages, we're talking about exactly the same thing, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-705,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.656,231.309,"And before the agency, you don't get counsel fees?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,231.309,231.807,--That's right.
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,231.807,243.695,"Mr. Fisher, I realize you don't concede, in fact, quite to the contrary, you deny that the failure to pay the full rate is... could be considered a practice here."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,276.587,280.65,I think that's very much what the Commission is contending here Justice Souter.
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,280.65,283.332,But it wasn't textually as nice as that?
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,283.332,283.892,Right.
2006.05-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.892,287.235,"But they have made it that, haven't they, in a later regulation?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,289.036,290.906,"In a later order, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,290.906,291.337,"In a later order, yes."
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,291.337,296.7,"Let's assume in the reg itself, they were that precise."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,298.442,299.013,Yes.
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,306.146,306.546,Sure.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,306.546,318.575,"And in terms of the FCC calling this unjust and unreasonable, the problem with that is that the only reason the FCC has ever given that this is unjust and unreasonable is because it violates its regulations."
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,329.402,329.762,Okay.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,329.762,330.933,It has to be.
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,330.933,335.057,"You invite me to change the hypothetical, then, by jacking it up in this respect."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,353.508,361.385,"Yes, because the reasoning the FCC would give simply would not be a permissible construction of the terms unjust and unreasonable in 201(b)."
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,361.385,381.207,"Are there any times under any circumstances that you can think of in which the FCC can adequately and validly define a practice as unjust and unreasonable within the meaning of the statute so that, in fact, in applying the statute, we would follow... be bound to follow the regs?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,381.207,382.629,"Of course, in the vast majority."
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,404.652,404.913,Okay.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,410.597,414.489,"--Well, that goes to the heart of this case, Justice Souter, in the kind of regulations that we have."
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,434.845,436.325,"Well, do they?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,467.814,478.553,"--You are right, Justice Souter, insofar as we're trying to capture the money here for essentially the equipment rental or the access fee that the caller is availing himself of."
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,515.956,527.385,"Well, the customer is going to pay if, in fact, the long distance carrier is the one who has to make the immediate payment, because that payment is going to be figured in the long distance rate."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,550.69,558.385,"--The economic result may be the same, but with all due respect, Congress has not decreed that the administrative system work this way."
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,558.385,559.947,It hasn't decreed otherwise.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,559.947,561.026,It hasn't decreed otherwise.
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,562.218,567.321,Isn't that the classic situation in which agencies are supposed to figure out what to do?
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,567.321,572.274,--Congress gave the FCC power in 276 to come up with a plan.
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,582.14,595.129,"Well, as I understand it, it came to the conclusion not that they were not acting under 276, but that, in fact, the cause of action has to refer back to 201."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,595.129,596.139,--That's right.
2006.05-705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,607.107,616.612,"In your answer for why they can't, Justice Souter's comment is a classic, this is what administrative agencies do all the time in typical rate regulations."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,643.861,649.064,"Well, Chief Justice Roberts, the FCC was unquestionably acting under 276 when it did this."
2006.05-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.602,687.06,"Are rate making regulations issued under 201, do they purport to be the FCC's definition of what is just and reasonable compensation?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,687.06,688.039,That's right.
2006.05-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.332,691.733,They are issued under 201.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,691.733,693.312,I think largely they are.
2006.05-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.312,698.057,So they are an interpretation of the statutory language in 201.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,698.057,699.196,That's right.
2006.05-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.196,700.879,And you say this one is not.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,700.879,702.0,That's right.
2006.05-705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,715.918,728.856,"When you say it was always thought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC reference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,728.856,733.33,"--In its order, it references 276 and--"
2006.05-705,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,739.454,751.572,"Suppose it issued the regulation after notice and comment, and said... violation of the pay phone order is an unjust and unreasonable practice, would the case be different?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,751.572,754.564,"No, it wouldn't be."
2006.05-705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,760.117,760.627,You haven't.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,844.321,846.354,"--There are two things that are wrong with that, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,882.616,893.024,"So, my answer... not answer, but my characterization of what you have just said is that the FCC did say it was an unreasonable practice."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,924.184,924.604,--No.
2006.05-705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.604,925.666,Okay.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,926.715,929.397,"Well, what you should do is reverse the Ninth Circuit."
2006.05-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.397,939.114,"You say it would be a reasonable practice not to pay the money, but for the existence of the regulation."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,939.114,941.195,That's exactly right.
2006.05-705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,941.195,961.928,"Just like AT&T when, in fact... or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation, they would not be overcharging, because they have a way of doing it that isn't on its face unjust."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,972.537,972.858,"No, it wouldn't."
2006.05-705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.47,999.685,"So in other words, you are saying... I think it is common that the FCC might write some accounting rules, for example."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1036.988,1038.661,"--No, you would have been right, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.887,1048.496,"Before you go back, let's hear about the accounting rules."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1051.839,1053.04,--They might.
2006.05-705,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.197,1069.83,"It seems to me accounting rules... in order to decide what is just and reasonable, you have to have accounting rules."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1074.445,1076.285,--I don't think we're disagreeing.
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1080.649,1083.919,May I focus your return to me?
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1164.643,1165.855,"--No, for two reasons."
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1189.32,1199.304,"My question is simply, you can say... one way of looking at this transaction is, it is the guy making the call who's using it."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1210.263,1210.992,Thank you.
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1239.542,1241.443,What difference does that make?
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1267.91,1272.303,"I think another way to perhaps characterize your position is, why is this like a commission that they are seeking."
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1284.482,1293.556,"Excuse me, but aren't you arguing with the 24 cents, as opposed to creating an argument about what is the proper characterization of the transaction?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1293.556,1294.778,I don't think so.
2006.05-705,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1326.248,1332.322,The reason is that the store that rents the cell phone is getting rental income from the cell phone.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1339.858,1350.504,"--Right, but then we're back to the rental income question, and the question of whether it would be unjust or unreasonable for long distance providers, absent the regulations, to be the ones paying that rental income."
2006.05-705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1387.649,1390.501,It doesn't cover certain practices in connection.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1393.012,1401.197,"I think we agree with respondent, Mr. Chief Justice, that in looking at 201(b), you have the word such communication practices."
2006.05-705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1454.763,1476.618,"So you are saying that, putting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for the FCC to say one way that long distance carriers provide service to their customers is when those customers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting up this rate regime in connection with that service."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1480.0,1484.202,"As we're still talking generically, I don't think it necessarily would be."
2006.05-705,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1504.116,1507.707,"That's actually... that's, I think, your strong... to me that was the strongest argument."
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1534.037,1536.277,"We submit it is a not a ""so what"", Justice Breyer."
2006.05-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1571.181,1573.825,"Mr. Fisher, can I go back to the first question I asked you?"
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1579.796,1585.271,The FCC might have that authority.
2006.05-705,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.001,1604.452,It could certainly impose penalties of some kind.
2006.05-705,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1604.452,1608.366,"Yes, it could, and the FCC could double fine... the FCC could do lots of things."
2006.05-705,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1625.646,1626.628,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1630.191,1633.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.639,1678.641,What can't... what can't be--
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1714.585,1721.558,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, the FCC has never argued, and we have never argued that all FCC regulations are enforceable through a private right of action."
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.7,1728.323,"No, I'm saying you'd have to argue that if the theory you're propounding for this case is correct."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1736.427,1737.359,"--No, no, Your Honor."
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.222,1763.015,So can... every FCC regulation can be enforceable by private action?
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1768.02,1768.681,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.681,1769.149,No?
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1769.149,1773.183,"There are also examples of things that fall outside of charges, classification, rates or practices."
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.754,1826.007,"But at least... at least any FCC regulations relating to charges, practices... and you want to interpret practices very broadly... classifications, and regulations for and in connection with communication service, all of those regulations can be sued upon in Federal court with all the diverse and contradictory rulings that that will produce, so long as the FCC says that the failure to obey this regulation is, in our view, unjust."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1826.007,1828.148,"Well, Your Honor, let's start with statutory text."
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.255,1868.976,I don't think he's saying that.
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1909.412,1915.236,"--Your Honor, our position doesn't require us to argue that it would have been unjust for the FCC to adopt some other scheme."
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.017,1939.692,But the rate regulation is... is established in order to determine what reasonableness and justness requires.
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1943.115,1944.617,"I respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2006.05-705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1964.309,1973.065,"Is it possible... I was worried somewhat about, I think, the problem Justice Scalia raised, that old regulations become unjust and unreasonable."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2007.099,2007.359,That's right.
2006.05-705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2007.94,2015.935,--And it has to focus on the fact that their doing so will create this private remedy in the courts.
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2015.935,2016.964,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2006.05-705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2016.964,2036.087,"That that... if you have that tough... which I haven't seen anywhere, but I mean, if you had that tough a requirement, so they actually have to focus on it, it would tend to minimize the problem of a thousand different actions in ten thousand different courts and a big mess."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2048.746,2049.605,"--No, that's right."
2006.05-705,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.771,2057.062,Yeah--
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2057.062,2058.712,"--Well, that's fine."
2006.05-705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.194,2065.876,"Well, but reasonably criticized for it."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2110.746,2117.171,"Mr. Chief Justice, let me address the interplay between 201(b) and 201(a), because Mr. Fisher has simply misunderstood our position."
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.311,2184.585,"Well, but wait."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2200.083,2207.429,"No, but... well, that's debatable, but what 201(b) refers to, in any event, is in connection with--"
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.429,2210.161,Such communications service.
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2210.161,2210.491,--Right.
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.491,2215.664,And I would think that would mean such communications service that was furnished.
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2215.664,2220.179,"Well, they have furnished a communications service to a customer, not to us, but to a customer."
2006.05-705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2306.126,2321.225,"Well, I think that's right, but that's also why I guess I don't regard it as particularly helpful that the FCC opines on what the consequences of its determination that something is unjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with respect to a private right of action."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2321.225,2323.867,"Well, it may not be particularly helpful, but it is surely not particularly harmful."
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.089,2327.509,"Well, except that it is none of their business."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2327.509,2329.042,--If they were trying to construe--
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.042,2329.292,We--
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2329.292,2331.123,"--206 through 208, Your Honor, I might agree."
2006.05-705,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.164,2429.826,Let me just be sure I understand your argument on 208.
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2441.144,2445.706,"Yes, Justice Stevens, and section 207 expressly gives the complainant a choice of forums."
2006.05-705,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.706,2452.652,So the same statutory requirement for the remedy that your opponent challenges is the one he acknowledges is available.
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2452.652,2466.821,"That's correct, and in fact, Global Crossing... Global Crossing went so far as to argue before the Ninth Circuit that there is no administrative remedy, that there's simply nothing to do except get fines under sections 502 and 503, and has reversed its position before this Court."
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.821,2475.808,"--Well, you should be arguing, then, that we should give Chevron deference to the Commission's interpretation of Section 208."
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2480.52,2481.741,I'm happy to make that argument.
2006.05-705,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.741,2483.501,I thought you should be.
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2483.501,2492.848,"With respect to the question whether practices are limited to carrier-customer relations, I've already touched on that by talking about the interplay between 201(a) and 201(b)."
2006.05-705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2598.439,2599.739,I saw that argument.
2006.05-705,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2606.975,2615.18,"Sorting one call from one carrier that has a relationship with you is not difficult, or sorting 100 calls from a carrier that has a relationship with you is not difficult."
2006.05-705,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2765.347,2766.669,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2775.004,2778.287,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2816.243,2817.004,Let me just ask this.
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2819.576,2820.915,--No.
2006.05-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2885.978,2897.208,Do you have a position on whether or not Chevron deference is owed to the Commission's determination of whether or not their action creates or gives rise to a right of action?
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2897.208,2898.556,I think that--
2006.05-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2898.556,2903.549,"There are two different, it seems to me, two different Chevron questions."
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2914.207,2925.364,"--I think that... I guess we don't have a position on whether 276, independent of 201, would be sufficient to have a prior right of action under 206 through 208."
2006.05-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2936.892,2948.549,"But it's never gotten deference, at least I guess from this Court, on whether or not there is or is not a right... whether there is a right of action to enforce its regulations."
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2948.549,2952.593,"No, and I don't think the FCC here is claiming that there's a right of action to enforce its regulations."
2006.05-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2952.593,2960.948,"Well, but they're certainly entitled to deference as to whether an administrative action can be brought under 208."
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2960.948,2962.698,"That's correct, and that's why under--"
2006.05-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.698,2967.473,"Once you say that it can, then a court action can be brought under 206."
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2967.473,2968.632,--That's correct.
2006.05-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.273,2973.407,"So you think we don't owe them deference for 206, but we do for 208."
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2977.568,2977.999,Right.
2006.05-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.932,2984.293,Yes.
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,2984.293,2990.638,"So in order for the FCC to decide that there's an action either before the agency or the court, it has to identify a violation of the statute."
2006.05-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3018.173,3020.086,Is your position... I want to be sure I understand you.
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3028.832,3030.492,"--That's correct, that's correct."
2006.05-705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3090.513,3103.311,Are you making the point that Chief Judge Ginsburg made in the D.C. Circuit that it is necessarily unjust and unreasonable to refuse to pay a charge that is fair and reasonable?
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3103.311,3103.942,Yes.
2006.05-705,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3144.881,3146.901,"What... sorry, go ahead."
2006.05-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3146.901,3157.738,"So you would have a different position here if 276 said something like, we think there ought to be more pay phones; in order to promote investment in pay phones, we're going to have this scheme."
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3165.731,3181.073,"I think in that case also, I would probably be here arguing that maybe if the FCC had determined that it's necessary, for whatever regulations they came up with under that scheme, in order for the Act to function correctly, that they have to be complied with."
2006.05-705,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3198.286,3207.052,"Are there regulations, FCC regulations, the violation of which would not be unfair and unreasonable?"
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3207.052,3208.741,I think there probably are.
2006.05-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.663,3265.001,Depending upon how broadly you think Congress intends regulations to be sucked into the terms of this statute.
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3269.272,3271.352,--I don't think that that's correct.
2006.05-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3279.349,3281.71,"Yeah, but you could say any violation of a regulation is unjust."
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3281.71,3282.1,--No.
2006.05-705,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3291.705,3293.868,So Sandoval doesn't mean a heck of a lot.
2006.05-705,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3298.901,3299.272,--No.
2006.05-705,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3332.313,3333.565,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2006.05-705,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3336.448,3340.291,Thank you.
2006.05-705,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3444.653,3445.511,That's not true.
2006.05-705,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3454.067,3470.459,"--The FCC might have said that, but as I said to Justice Souter, that would be a very different proceeding and a very different scheme than we have here, and a very different dollar figure or cent figure that the FCC might have come up with when it was trying to encapsulate that figure, which we think is zero, but under your reasoning may be something very small."
2006.05-705,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3491.323,3492.552,What about the cell phone example?
2006.05-705,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3492.552,3494.845,This is a pay phone case.
2006.05-705,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3498.597,3504.379,"But you don't know, the cell phone holder may be right next to the pay phone or he may be across the country."
2006.05-705,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3504.379,3509.384,"--I think it still constitutes a long distance call, depending on where the cell phone owner lives."
2006.05-705,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3540.416,3541.378,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
