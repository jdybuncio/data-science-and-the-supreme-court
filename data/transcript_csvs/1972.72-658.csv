1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.226,Mr. Dalton you may proceed whenever you are ready.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,9.226,13.736,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,235.08,238.117,The option is exercised by the voters?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,238.117,242.377,Either the voters or the governing body.
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.377,248.732,"I thought the basic option was exercised by the voters, but then that the governing body decided who to license?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,248.732,251.562,The governing body can refuse to issue any licenses under our --
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,251.562,255.316,They can't without the --
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,255.316,263.148,But there can be referendum here initiated by the voters to put the issue up to election as to whether or not there shall be.
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,273.206,276.613,"There has to be a petitioner, a referendum petitioner?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,276.613,283.601,"Yes, then it's up to the governing body each year to decide which licenses will be issued."
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,283.601,285.99,Right.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,285.99,288.642,This is under other --
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,288.642,296.284,Under Wisconsin statutes could they have a program of saying each person gets a license for one year and just rotate it?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,299.227,308.696,Our statute provides that the license runs for one year from July 1st to the succeeding June 30th.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.696,312.087,(Inaudible) they canceled it in midway (Inaudible)
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,312.087,320.026,"It can be revoked, but then there has to be what amounts to an adjudicatory-type hearing."
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,325.79,329.505,And that is determined by what agency?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,329.505,331.693,The licensing body.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,331.693,336.153,Which is the local governing caveat --
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,336.153,336.51,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,336.51,340.139,And it has to give an adjudicatory hearing before revocation?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,340.139,342.258,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,342.258,344.879,Is there a judicial review?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,344.879,347.651,There is by certiorari.
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,347.651,348.71,On a revocation.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,348.71,350.785,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.883,375.749,Got to the revocation?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,375.749,376.897,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.897,378.722,And the Federal Court enjoined it?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,378.722,383.148,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,474.572,478.647,Is that under review de novo or a trial de novo?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,478.647,479.393,Trail de novo.
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,479.393,480.825,Not to just review on any records?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,480.825,496.872,No it's a trial de novo and there are limits set by the Wisconsin's statute as to when the Court must act so that any aggrieved parties can have a prompt determination of the issues.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,512.061,516.852,That is discretionary with the writ or is that --
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,516.852,521.659,The writ of certiorari is discretionary.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,521.659,523.246,And in what court does that goes?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,523.246,533.465,"That's in the Circuit Court, that is the Court of general jurisdiction within the state."
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,536.208,539.904,"Now, that is a review, isn't it, that's not a de novo?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,539.904,543.376,That's a review including all constitutional questions.
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,543.376,545.867,"There is no record, isn't it?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,545.867,552.973,"Yes, there are the notes that are made in court in review."
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.973,554.729,But there is no transcript?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,554.729,586.712,"There is no transcript of testimony, no verbatim transcript, but if there is a denial, of course, the statute requires a statement of the reasons for denial be made in the record and all of the notes of the licensing body in the case of the City Council that are subsequently printed and they are part of the record in this case would go to the Circuit Court for review."
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.712,593.008,Does there has to be some reason for (Inaudible) renew a license?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,593.008,601.846,"The reasons should be stated according to our statute whenever renewal is refused, renewal."
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,601.846,602.781,That's on renewal.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,602.781,604.929,But not for original application.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.929,613.185,"For original application, they just deny it, but on renewal there has to be a determination of some kind -- some kind of conduct?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,613.185,627.12,"Yes and our Supreme Court has indicated that, that is to facilitate the certiorari so that the Court can determine whether or not any action taken was arbitrary or capricious."
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,627.12,629.814,"So, it is different than an original application."
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,629.814,632.906,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,632.906,638.487,That's the first time he finds out what the Board acted on?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,638.487,643.102,"No, he would find out at the time."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,646.601,653.632,These limits etcetera that you say are kept for the certiorari right hearing.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,657.245,660.039,He may yes they are public records.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,660.039,663.487,They are printed and available?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,663.487,666.096,"They would be, I imagine would be available."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.198,675.856,But that is after the hearing?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,675.856,679.383,That's after the City Council has acted.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,679.383,685.239,"Well, what does the applicant have before the City Council acts?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,685.239,688.015,He files an application each year.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,710.47,714.993,"Maybe I am using the word hearing wrong, but does he get a hearing?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,714.993,718.062,"Well, this is a difficult term."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,727.925,729.849,But do you know what notice means?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,729.849,730.442,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,730.442,733.018,Does he get a notice?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,733.018,735.026,"A notice of what, Your Honor?"
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,735.026,741.393,Of why there is a possibility that it will not be renewed?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,741.393,750.949,"He understands, each year when he applies that there will be hearings on all licenses that have been filed, that the applications have been filed for on 15th of April."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,773.0,774.718,His request.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,774.718,777.384,"Well, all of them."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,797.424,801.279,And does he know whether or not there is going to be opposition?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,801.279,803.219,Not necessarily.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.219,806.607,You mean a law.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,806.607,807.77,It is very possible.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,807.77,812.761,And the people testify against him?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,812.761,814.99,"Well, they testify, yes if they want to."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.99,816.272,Under oath.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,816.272,823.877,"No, unless he asks and makes a motion."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,876.392,883.014,"So, the only hearing he gets is in a Court?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,883.014,890.132,"The only one practice, Your Honor is the hearing that's granted is legislative type hearing."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,891.926,896.927,"Well, the only non-legislative he gets is in the Court?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,896.927,907.534,"If he asks for it, but I am not ruling out that if he asks for a fact-finding hearing before the Board that he wouldn't be entitled to it."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,907.534,911.138,What provision of the law says it gives him that right?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,911.138,919.266,"There is no provision in the law, but the City Council may sit as a fact-finding body."
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.266,926.211,But your state Supreme Court has ruled that he is not entitled on a renewal proceeding?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,926.211,930.348,They have held that a legislative hearing comports with due process.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.348,938.871,"Yes, they have held that so it is not (Inaudible) hearing that the fact-finding hearing or a final-type hearing was --"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,938.871,940.634,Right but if there is an --
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,940.634,948.058,"Now, let's assume he is not renewed then he goes to Court over, you say he has a trail do novo?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,948.058,949.418,Yes in the County Court.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.418,955.715,And meanwhile nothing happens to it.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,959.679,962.222,That depends upon the Court order.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.222,962.498,But the Court has --
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,962.498,973.528,"He can convince the Court that he should continue during the litigation, the Court could, the same as the lower did here, grant a temporary restraining order."
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.528,977.319,And this gentleman is not out of business yet?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,977.319,993.84,"There are nine of these and Your Honor, I must say that I understand that three of them are on a business but they have been protected by the Federal Court for almost two-and-a-half years by different orders allowing them to continue nude dancing and the selling of alcohol."
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.84,1017.346,But anyway if he went through judicial review there would have to be some finding of some kind of conduct dis-entitling him to renewal in order to sustain the refusal.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1037.387,1047.061,"When he starts his Court action, he must make allegations that he has some legal right that's being violated."
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1047.061,1049.243,Alright.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1049.243,1057.25,And one of those I was suggesting is that the licensing body has come to a wrong conclusion as to some facts.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.25,1059.489,Right.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1059.489,1063.925,"So, he could have a factual determination by the Court"
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.925,1064.495,By the Court.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1064.495,1071.866,And then that could be applied to the denial of the renewal and his legal rights would be protected.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.866,1092.782,"But now the district, in order to affirm the refusal to renew the Court is going asked to define or is going to have to agree with the City Council with respect to this alleged conduct?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1092.782,1101.167,"If you are talking about the 66.054, our Supreme Court has not yet interpreted the breadth of that provision."
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1116.493,1156.14,"Well now, that connection Mr. Dalton and I am looking at the record here page 44, I do not know which of the cases I see three of them and there appears there a report of the Committee on Licensing & Welfare with the recitation in five paragraphs of the reasons why the license was not renewed, and then that was followed by a later report which speaks of the alleged of violence and threats of violence and feuding between the management of the Pussycat and the whatever the other one is."
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1166.595,1169.007,Whatever notes are in the --
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1169.007,1171.093,"Well, this case (Inaudible)"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1171.093,1174.068,That was the report of this Committee.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.489,1183.524,"You mean on certiorari Is the review on a record, I thought it was de novo?"
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1183.524,1184.516,That's what I am trying to get at.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1184.516,1186.761,No it is not de novo on certiorari.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1186.761,1188.359,You have not called any witnesses then?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1188.359,1189.687,No.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1189.687,1196.269,"And it's discretionary whether or not of the Circuit Court will give you that review, isn't it?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1196.269,1200.615,"Yes, I think certiorari is discretionary writ which --"
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1200.615,1206.38,How does the applicant seeking a renewal get any fact determination?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1217.521,1218.128,No.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1218.128,1218.89,He cannot.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1218.89,1220.623,"I am sorry, I misled you."
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1259.278,1262.586,Now what do you mean by regular court proceeding?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1262.586,1264.047,A de novo trial.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1264.047,1266.388,"A de novo trial, judicial trial."
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1266.388,1266.671,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1266.671,1268.826,With witnesses and fact findings and all that?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1268.826,1269.258,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1269.258,1273.072,"Alright, now when does the alternative of certiorari come in?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1273.072,1280.302,That's the applicants choice as to whether he wants to move by this route or by a certiorari.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.302,1281.004,Can he move this way --
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1281.004,1292.58,"If he has factual, excuse me, if he has factual issues which he wishes to be determined, let's take for instance in this case."
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1331.964,1336.57,Now he doesn't have to do that and so he doesn't do it then what may he do.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1336.57,1340.639,Then he may choose one of these two judicial routes.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1340.639,1346.577,"Either way in which he gets a fact-finding as I understand it, is that if he follows the de novo route."
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1346.577,1347.448,Right.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1347.448,1350.682,If he follows a certiorari route he does not get it?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1350.682,1362.28,"There is one exception, the certiorari court could weigh evidence and determine whether or not there is substantial evidence."
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1362.28,1364.031,"Now wait a minute, you mean take testimony?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1364.031,1368.112,"No, they could refer it back to the Administrative body."
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1368.112,1369.145,"Oh, I see."
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.145,1375.164,Now where is this provision that you are talking about where you get an actual judicial trail?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1375.164,1382.928,It is on page four of our brief Section 66(054).
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.928,1389.402,Now is that as a right?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1389.402,1392.012,"The action of any city council, yes."
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1392.012,1404.253,"I see, a when it comes up renew he is turned down, the council alleging that he has done and finding if he has done A and B."
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1411.004,1412.381,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.381,1414.136,And meanwhile --
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1414.136,1421.491,But that's only on the beer license which is a necessary step to get a liquor license?
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.585,1425.11,What was not renewed here?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1425.11,1428.181,Both
1972.72-658,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.181,1429.19,For the same reason?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1429.19,1432.638,Yeah.
1972.72-658,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1432.638,1436.793,May you have a renewal of the beer license and yet be denied a renewal of the liquor license?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1436.793,1442.007,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1442.007,1452.47,"When the council fails to renew that after the end of one year to distinguish it from a revocation, when they fail to renew it they must give a statement of reasons, is that correct?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1452.47,1453.412,"That is right, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1453.412,1461.52,And it's on that statement of reasons that whether a Court of general jurisdiction that decides whether to grant a review by certiorari?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1461.52,1462.647,"That is right, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1466.521,1470.552,"Now, Where are the statement of reasons in these cases?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1470.552,1475.595,The statement of reasons were just referred to by Justice Brennan.
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1475.595,1480.548,"What page, where do we find in here in the Appendix?"
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1480.548,1483.909,You mean the Committee on License wrote that?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1490.762,1493.106,That was the Committee report.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.106,1498.198,"But you keep saying that you have to have a statement of reasons, is that correct what you said?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1498.198,1498.908,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1498.908,1503.597,"Well, where is that in this case, “a statement of reason?”"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1503.597,1510.849,"Well, the statement of reason that was adapted by the Council was because these bars had nude dancing."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1510.849,1513.003,But where is that in the record?
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1513.003,1516.634,"Tell us the page, where do we find it in here?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1516.634,1523.075,It is in the -- these were stipulations of facts that were entered.
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1523.075,1533.484,Where do we find the stipulation then?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1533.484,1541.376,On page 28 of the Appendix.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1546.054,1552.163,Is the statement of reason is in the stipulation of facts?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1552.163,1563.302,"Yes, Your Honor, on page 32 number 26, that such statutes perform both in customs and in the news."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1563.302,1569.021,"You keep saying statement of reasons and you know what stipulation of facts, is that statement of reasons?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1585.339,1587.308,Other than the report of the committee.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1587.308,1590.851,Then there is no such instrument as the statement of reasons?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1590.851,1593.771,"Well, they adapted the committee report."
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.771,1598.359,"Oh, then when you say statement of reason you mean the Committee report?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1598.359,1599.826,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1599.826,1614.405,"Well, under the law the committee itself could have acted with out reference to the council as I read in the statute and that's what the complaint of your brothers on the other side, they did not even know which body was going to act, whether it was going to be the committee or the council as a whole."
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1614.405,1617.76,"Well, the council as a whole made the final determination."
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1617.76,1621.534,"Well, that's not what the law seems to say."
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1633.827,1636.066,But these cases they were all referred to the city council.
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1636.066,1637.124,They were in fact in these cases to find out.
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1637.124,1643.983,They were in fact referred to city council and they adapted the reports of the Committee.
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1791.503,1798.202,"Do you have to spend much time on that view with the holding in the rule, isn't this basically a procedural problem now?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1798.202,1830.739,"Yes, the rule we think solves that and I want to point out that after the rule, the District Court released the injunctions that had permitted the nude dancing to take place in these two cities, but while this injunction was in effect, the city decided that they would not re-license these bars and they sat as a legislative body in doing this."
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1862.184,1895.714,"Well, I submit to you that at the bottom of your page 32 that you referred to us, paragraph number 26, and on the opposite page, at the bottom page 33, paragraph 32 both ascribe that direct and indirectly as reasons for not finding the renewal in the Committee reports and if the Committee reports were adapted by the legislative body that would be quite adequate statement of reasons to satisfy me as to why they had failed to renew."
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1895.714,1896.087,Maybe the --
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1896.087,1898.539,(inaudible) itself is on page 34 and 35?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1898.539,1900.252,Yes.
1972.72-658,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1900.252,1901.839,Now the --
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1901.839,1907.621,But my point is these are the underlying reasons for the legislative resolution.
1972.72-658,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.653,1946.185,(Inaudible) Wisconsin law would be common council of Racine or Kenosha be permitted to deny a renewal of a license simply on the ground that they felt they had too many places in Kenosha or Racine selling hard liquor without giving any more reason than that?
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1946.185,1952.624,Our Supreme Court has so held.
1972.72-658,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.193,1972.744,"And not reissuing licenses, just by not issuing, not renewing the licenses?"
1972.72-658,0,34379,leroy_l_dalton,,1972.744,1976.908,"Yes, sir."
1972.72-658,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1976.908,1997.622,"Your time is up now, Mr. Dalton and Mr. Walrath, will you be the only one acting, speaking on behalf of the respondents, the appellee is here?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,1997.622,1999.66,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.554,2087.913,Could you have gotten -- could these applicants have gotten a trial type hearing in some court by some procedure after their renewal was denied by the City Council?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2087.913,2092.65,"Our position is, Your Honor, that they could not and that was the next point I want to raise."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.749,2107.564,Is your colleague essentially correct with respect to the beer license?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2107.564,2110.036,I would submit that he is not because both --
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.036,2112.199,"Alright, well then you take it your own way."
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2112.199,2112.99,Okay.
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.401,2133.913,"In which event, no evidentiary hearing, all on records, reasons and notes?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2133.913,2141.017,"Yes, all on handwritten notes or typed notes by city clerks, whatever is there."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.395,2156.567,"That isn't our question here, whether it was arbitrary?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2156.567,2160.373,"But there definitely is no entitlement to a trial de novo, excuse me."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2160.663,2164.679,"On certiorari, the judge could not give a hearing?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2164.679,2165.918,That is correct.
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2184.905,2186.53,How about the statement of reasons?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2186.53,2188.745,"It would, it contain statement of reasons, yes."
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2188.745,2193.92,"Well,would it specifically be what appears at page 44 to 46?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2206.468,2211.121,"I would submit that the return could include that document, yes."
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2211.121,2211.934,And --
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2211.934,2216.813,If this document was in fact adapted by the City Council as its reason for denying the license.
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2216.813,2220.422,"And in addition then there would be what, notes you said?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2220.422,2222.607,"Possible notes, if they had been taken."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.607,2233.322,"But if the City Council gives no reason at all, is it automatically arbitrary to deny renewal?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2233.322,2235.879,"I would submit yes under State law, if there is a reason."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2235.879,2238.22,There must be a reason for denying renewal?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2238.22,2240.595,"Yes, by state statute."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.595,2249.177,And so the arbitrariness of denying renewal simply turns on whether it states a reason or not?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2249.177,2253.336,"Well, our claim here, Your Honor, is not all -- is more than that."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.672,2266.104,"Oh, I understand that."
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2266.329,2269.641,But that is the other aspect of arbitrariness that we referred to?
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.641,2284.286,But I would suppose that there would be a different case if you had a right to a complete de novo hearing on review of the renewal where you could call witnesses and statement had to call it?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2284.286,2285.635,"Yes, no question about it."
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2285.635,2288.541,"Then you would not be here, would you or you would not have brought the action?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2288.541,2290.604,We would have gone to State Court.
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2290.604,2295.771,You would have gone to State Court and let me understand this clearly now.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2303.739,2305.09,"Yes, that is correct."
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2305.09,2309.529,"Well, what is the connection of the beer license to the liquor license?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2315.811,2320.884,You cannot have a liquor license unless you have a beer license first.
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2320.884,2324.733,"Well, now what about these appellees?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2324.733,2333.942,"In each instance, I do not believe there is an indication in the record as to whether in each instance, their beer license is worth denial."
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2338.511,2349.775,"And if they were, then as I understand, you might have gone into one of the County Courts or the circuit court and got a de novo hearing?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2349.775,2365.996,"Well, that is the argument on the state, Your Honor, but I would submit that that does not comport with a reading of the state statute which provides for renewal of or which provides for procedures on beer licenses, Section 66054 sub 14 --"
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2365.996,2367.164,What page now?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2367.164,2373.683,Page 4 of the brief of the appellants.
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2390.761,2397.069,"But what, isn't granting cover renewal, toward granting, does that cover renewal or not?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2397.069,2405.994,"Well, our point, Your Honor, is that there is no express declaration in this statute to cover the situation where renewal is denied."
1972.72-658,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2412.574,2414.303,"Oh, I see."
1972.72-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.303,2426.717,Would you say that basically is at 66.054 is more devoted to the outraged citizen who feels that a license has been improperly granted or it is not been revoked when in --
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2426.717,2435.834,"Yes, or to the outraged tavern keeper who has gone to revocation procedures which are separate from what this case involves."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.834,2450.137,"Well, the provision that your colleague referred to for a de novo hearing on denial of a beer license renewal, that provision was not considered by the three-judge court, I understand?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2450.137,2451.25,That's correct.
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.25,2458.105,It did not consider that as a matter of Wisconsin law or in connection with its due process ruling?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2458.105,2466.533,"It did not consider, if my recollection of the lower court opinion is correct, it did not consider that remedy is a viable one for these individuals."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.533,2471.22,Let's assume or didn't even considered it?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2471.22,2474.393,"I am not sure what the opinion on the point states, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.393,2488.576,"Well, let's assume for the moment that each of these gentlemen had his beer license renewal refused and could have gone to court and had a de novo hearing --"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2488.576,2489.366,Yes sir.
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2489.366,2498.029,-- as to what are the reasons alleged existed or not and let's assume that were true.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2501.234,2512.652,"Then the question would be if they did get a remedy in state court and they did get a beer license, then the next problem is that they still did not get their liquor licenses back and --"
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2512.652,2531.082,"I know but those reasons that the liquor licenses depended on the existence of some reasons and if they spend the term, then those reasons did not exist?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2531.082,2537.302,"Then I would say the municipality (Voice Overlap) states would have to provide them with the liquor license, yes."
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.302,2538.167,That's right.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2538.167,2543.554,But there is nothing in the statutory procedure which would compel them to do it.
1972.72-658,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.554,2550.103,"Well, I was just curious to know whether the District Court addressed itself to this matter at all?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2550.103,2555.174,Not in the way that we have just gone through it.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2555.174,2561.529,"Mr. Walrath, I appreciate you hardly a chance to get the first sentence out of here, the arguments you intended to make."
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2591.664,2612.806,"Your Honor, if I may, the situation is this that the -- first of all, we submit that both liberty and property interests under the definition or the analysis provided in Board of Regents versus Roth, both concepts of liberty and property were involved in this situation."
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2622.45,2628.419,"Well, these are a one-year licenses by their terms and under state law that's what they were and that is all they could be?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2628.419,2629.593,Yes.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.593,2632.291,"And that is right, so that's very much like a --"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2632.291,2633.573,It is similar to Roth.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.573,2636.399,"And like Mr. Roth, a teaching contract."
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2636.399,2640.049,But there are some very significant differences from the Roth situations.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2640.049,2640.922,(Inaudible)
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2640.922,2659.268,"Now, the first significant difference is that in Roth, the action taken with regard to Roth was not -- the reasons for not renewing Roth’s teaching contract were never stated, were not required to be stated, were never made public."
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2695.627,2701.239,The Court indicated he would then have been given an opportunity to clear his name if the charges were false?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2701.239,2701.589,That is correct.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.589,2707.948,I didn't understand there was any claim here that this kind of dancing did not warrant in these bars?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2707.948,2711.333,"No, but that is not the central point."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2820.071,2828.862,I am perplexed about this criminal complaint on page 69 as they give on the record.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2828.862,2831.281,"On page 69 of the Appendix, Your Honor?"
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.281,2834.408,Yes.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2834.408,2845.934,The document on that page and on the following page; both of those documents were inserted into the record below as part of the affidavits on motions for summary judgments.
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2865.133,2868.86,What are doing in the appendix?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2871.783,2882.334,I think they were inserted as part of the documents that accompanied the motion for summary judgment by the state.
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2882.334,2885.501,Then we do have something in this record about nude dancing?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2885.501,2888.444,"Well, there is definitely something in this record, yes."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2888.444,2891.1,"Well, this record in this case?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2891.1,2902.488,"Well, the question is whether there was anything in the record before the Licensing Committee and the City Council and whether they said specifically or only that the only reason they were denying these licenses is because of nude dancing."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2902.488,2907.014,Then you don't know whether this report is from the City Council or not?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2907.014,2907.413,I am sorry.
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2907.658,2913.991,Do you know whether these complaints were before the City Council or not?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2913.991,2916.416,"They could have not been, Your Honor, because they were --"
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2916.416,2918.854,Did you object to them being putting in the record?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2918.854,2919.976,"No, I did not."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2919.976,2920.538,Huh?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2920.538,2924.057,I did not.
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.963,2931.442,They are irrelevant on the question of nude dancing?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,2931.442,2938.217,"No, they were irrelevant on the question of what was before the Licensing Committee and the City Council at the time it reached this decision."
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2999.305,3006.416,Do you think that is a nature of the legislative licensing process sometimes.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3012.691,3046.964,"Yes Your Honor, I would submit that in a legislative type situation where you are as in LaRue instance where you are dealing with legislative findings in enacting a resolution or an ordinance or state statute, these kinds of statements are appropriate, but here we were dealing with a definite adjudicatory situation where the City Council or the Licensing Committee itself was passing on -- as required by the statute, was passing on the question of whether these individuals were proper individuals to have their licenses renewed."
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3052.743,3068.449,Is it you argument -- did you contend that in any way there was a common law kind of a property right or expectancy to a renewal each year?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3068.449,3075.477,Yes Your Honor and that's an argument that we did not make sufficiently I would submit in our brief.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3138.997,3141.857,The District Court did not rely on that at all?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3141.857,3142.434,"No, it did not."
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3142.434,3150.781,"So, the District Court rather relied on the Court of Appeals' opinion in the Roth case which was subsequently reversed here, correct?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3150.781,3156.395,"Yes, the three-judge court below did not have the benefit of Perry versus Sindermann or Roth with Board of Regents versus Roth."
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3156.395,3163.737,You have the then benefit of -- you had the then benefit of a case that was subsequently reversed.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3165.176,3182.252,"Yes, but we think quite clearly even in light of Roth which does restrict concepts or at least define concepts of liberty and property more carefully that quite clearly, these individuals, their liberty and property interests were affected."
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3298.95,3307.949,"On the fact, that whether this is true or on the fact -- on the question of whether this is a legitimate reason for non renewal?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3307.949,3310.598,"I am sorry, I didn't hear the beginning of your question, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3310.598,3323.241,You say they are entitled to a hearing to determine the fact of whether these events took place or whether this is an adequate ground for a non-renewal or former?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3323.241,3325.035,The former and not the latter.
1972.72-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3343.129,3344.251,Mr. Walrath.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3344.251,3346.438,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3346.438,3355.271,"As you were probably in Monroe against Pape, this Court said that Section 1983 did not apply to municipal corporations."
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3363.268,3377.877,"They were joined because the lower court was able to distinguish the Monroe versus Pape language in that, that was, if I recall correctly, a request for damage --"
1972.72-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3377.877,3388.54,"Here is what this Court said in Monroe against Pape, “For we are the opinion that Congress did not undertake to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of 1983.”"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3388.54,3397.751,"But if I am correct, Your Honor, I believe that was in the context of a damage suit against the City of Chicago."
1972.72-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3397.751,3398.344,That is correct.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3402.642,3405.921,"Well, it is our position that it can be."
1972.72-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.921,3407.6,How do you distinguish?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3407.6,3413.436,"There are two cases out of the Seven Circuit, Your Honor, that distinguishes it --"
1972.72-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3413.436,3421.66,I mean not as a matter of Seven Circuit present but as a matter of reason?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3421.66,3427.519,"Frankly, I am not familiar enough with the history of 1983 to be able to distinguish it at this time."
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3427.519,3432.212,"You do not need the reasons if you have the law on your side in the Seven Circuit, do you?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3432.212,3433.287,"Well, that is what we had."
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3437.18,3462.929,"When you responded previously to the question I put to you, I am not sure which case you were referring to, but turning to paragraph number 26 on page 32 of the Appendix, in the stipulation of facts, they have stipulated a fact, parties have stipulated a fact which under the LaRue would mean non-renewal of the license."
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3464.491,3474.769,I don't dispute that except for the fact that the municipalities in this case didn't say that they were denying the applications because of that fact in paragraph 26.
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3474.769,3482.937,"Well but then in paragraph 32, a page later, they say that their method of doing business?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3482.937,3483.838,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3483.838,3487.344,And it includes that paragraph 26 reason.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3488.948,3502.528,"The statement at paragraph 32 was something that happened in Federal Court and it is a statement that was not made at the time that the licenses were renewed or denied, excuse me, that the renewal applications were denied."
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3502.528,3512.805,What was the purpose of paragraph 26 stipulation if it was not to bear on the decision to renew or not renew the license?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3512.805,3524.774,I think the purpose of paragraph 26 was merely to get an agreed stipulation of facts that in fact we do not dispute the fact that nude dancing occurred on these premises.
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3530.16,3536.833,"Well, but do you dispute that this is a good enough reason not to renew the license?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3542.401,3546.004,"Well at the time, yes, it was a disputed fact because --"
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3546.004,3546.811,At that time?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3546.811,3546.975,Yes.
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3546.975,3550.3,Since that time this Court decided the LaRue case.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3550.3,3550.739,That is correct.
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3550.739,3560.037,"Now, after the LaRue case, isn't paragraph 26 the end of the case in terms of whatever cases are covered by that stipulation?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3560.037,3578.589,"Well, whether or not the municipality has subsequently been proving to be right or wrong as to the basis for denying the applications still does not counter the problem that these individuals and the procedures that confronted them, denied them due process initially."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3578.589,3589.107,What do you do with the top of page 34 that says that this the reason for the denial?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3589.107,3590.856,At the top page of 34?
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3590.856,3594.162,First full sentence.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3604.171,3612.057,"It relied but it did not specify -- first of all, it did not give any notice prior to going into any of these meetings or hearings."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3617.265,3623.698,That's not what I am talking about but this admits that the reason that they denied it was because of nude dancing?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3623.698,3626.284,"No, I would beg to differ with you, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3626.765,3629.277,"Well, what word in that doesn't say that?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3629.277,3649.036,"Well, it says that the defendant city relied on such entertainment as one of the factors producing the effects and what they specifically stated was the reason for denying the license -- the applications was not the dance entertainment, it was the allegations of paragraphs A through F."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3649.036,3652.987,"But this is all in the same statement here, isn't it?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3656.526,3660.808,"Well, what you are reading from is again the stipulation of facts."
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3660.808,3662.141,In the Federal District Court?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3662.141,3663.947,In the Federal District Court.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3663.947,3678.833,And 34 and 35 is the findings of the Committee adopted by the common council and one of those municipalities and on page 7 as we read for the findings of the Committee adopted by the common council and other municipalities.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3678.833,3679.37,That is correct.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3679.37,3683.141,And they are quite separate from what the stipulations of the District Court?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3683.141,3683.657,That is correct.
1972.72-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3683.657,3689.073,Am I right in thinking that the stipulations in the District Court weren't necessarily entered into by all the parties?
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3696.104,3697.687,That's also correct.
1972.72-658,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3703.231,3710.066,"So, there is no distinction then between what might affect your clients or in people who are --"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3710.066,3717.773,There is no crucial variation in the facts as far as what were stipulated to.
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3720.404,3732.896,"(Inaudible) the review of this case goes back on the city as to do and to show that nude dancing and then that is against their policy and that is the end of the case, right?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3732.896,3733.745,Yes.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3733.745,3734.695,So long as you have taken charge here.
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3734.695,3735.777,So long as you have a hearing.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3735.777,3737.541,So long as we have a hearing.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3737.541,3740.724,"So, this is purely a due process claim?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3740.724,3742.83,We are not challenging what happened in the rule.
1972.72-658,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3759.978,3763.305,"There was no due process issue in the LaRue, wasn't there?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3763.305,3765.166,"Not that I am aware of, Your Honor."
1972.72-658,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3765.166,3787.366,"In your view of the due process question, if the case went back to the state, went back to the District Court, would the stipulation paragraph 26 be sufficient if they put that and only that in evidence of the reason for non-renewal?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3805.798,3812.082,"If that is the only allegation that the city raises, I think that would be an adequate basis for non-renewal."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3849.091,3855.868,"There would be no trouble in drawing an ordinance that would cover that criminal complaints, there would be?"
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3855.868,3856.647,"No, there would not be."
1972.72-658,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3856.647,3859.014,They would be easy for you to find.
1972.72-658,1,33632,james_a_walrath,,3859.014,3861.985,Thank you.
