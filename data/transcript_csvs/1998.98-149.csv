1998.98-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.419,"We'll hear argument now in Number 98-149, College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, et al.--"
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,13.16,16.402,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1998.98-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.107,88.688,"The Solicitor General doesn't agree with you on this point, I take it."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,88.688,93.463,"The Solicitor General does not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,93.463,96.875,"That doesn't mean you're necessarily wrong, certainly."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,98.525,104.068,We like to think the Solicitor General is half right.
1998.98-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.279,141.575,"In your view, Mr. Todd, was this property right created by Congress in the Lanham Act?"
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,141.575,146.847,In our view the property right was codified by the Congress in the Lanham Act.
1998.98-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.183,187.223,"Well, supposing Congress had never passed the Lanham Act but just felt that organizations such as yours were put at a considerable disadvantage by the sovereign immunity doctrine of the States."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,196.78,221.197,"That is our position, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that the fact is that Congress can step in, having determined that the State remedies are genuinely inadequate and that there is a need to foster interstate commerce, the commerce of this country, for there to be a Federal standard governing these matters."
1998.98-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.197,232.473,"But you're in trouble, I think, if you say it's based on interstate commerce, because we've held that Congress can't abrogate sovereign immunity under it's commerce power."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,232.473,235.945,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm certainly aware of that."
1998.98-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,297.876,305.933,Is it your position that Congress passed this 1992 act to enforce the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,305.933,309.346,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it is our position."
1998.98-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.346,324.063,And therefore they must have concluded that the invocation of sovereign immunity denied your clients their property without due process of law.
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,324.063,346.849,"They certainly decided that there was a need for a standard here, and that given what they found to be an inadequate protection of these rights by the State, they determined that in the exercise of the section 5 power there should be an abrogation."
1998.98-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.137,380.4,"Well, Mr. Todd, that assumes, I take it, that the right to be free from unfair competition is a property right to be protected."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,380.4,382.743,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1998.98-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.743,385.765,But it certainly is not like any traditional property right.
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,387.966,395.92,"No, but this Court has never narrowed a property right in anything approaching a right to alienate or sell."
1998.98-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.821,401.594,"Well, can you exclude others from a right to unfair competition?"
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,418.965,419.996,"--Well, but--"
1998.98-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.996,423.589,--would affect the business economically.
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,423.589,437.448,"--Justice O'Connor, I think in the first case I would again like to reiterate that this Court has never held a particular set of attributes that must be met in order for a particular interest to be called property."
1998.98-149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.652,465.628,But those things were all things that belonged to the person asserting the right.
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,495.936,497.518,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
1998.98-149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.518,500.48,"You still are free to do business, as you always have been."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,500.48,502.79,"--Well, Justice Scalia, we have not alleged takings."
1998.98-149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.105,527.907,Anything that takes away customers takes away a property right of yours?
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,527.907,535.312,"--If it is proscribed by law, yes, I would say so, Mr.... Justice Scalia."
1998.98-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.312,541.406,"Mr. Todd, I don't know anything about your business, but there are a lot of businesses where customer lists are sold."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,554.574,560.2,"Justice Stevens, in the context of this case, no."
1998.98-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.132,566.322,And is it... I want to be sure of one other thing.
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,569.293,570.345,--We are not.
1998.98-149,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.345,571.206,"No, okay."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,602.566,609.3,"Justice Kennedy, I think the cases are not at all closely related."
1998.98-149,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,630.395,651.139,"There's a difference in negligence and intent, but the observation still, it seems to me, has force in this case, that you're using the Constitution to make a constitutional violation out of what is generally concerned to be a tort that is actionable within the concepts of tort law but not under the Constitution."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,651.139,662.124,"--I would suggest two things, that I think that this Court clearly has found... they have never found a case... I have no case specifically on point."
1998.98-149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.341,727.778,That argument might get you somewhere if the claim in this case was that your goodwill had been taken or destroyed.
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,742.648,754.706,"Well, Justice Scalia, the harm to the business from a competitor misrepresenting his own goods and services is identical to the harm caused by a misrepresentation of the competitor's--"
1998.98-149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.706,757.217,"It may be, but is it a deprivation of property?"
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,771.457,785.124,"--Well, Justice Scalia, with respect, there is nothing in the jurisprudence in this Court which suggests that property interests are limited to those things which would be deemed to be larceny if stolen."
1998.98-149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,794.891,803.887,"Is that right, if it were possible to take away a horse trainer's license, as you say it's possible to take away your customers?"
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,806.248,807.79,Well--
1998.98-149,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.79,809.0,This doesn't seem to me to be property.
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,822.938,848.928,"--Justice Scalia, the entire business of College Savings Bank is threatened by this kind of false advertising, and I would like to close and save some time for rebuttal just by stating that neither the court of appeals nor Florida Prepaid has cited a single decision by this Court in which an economic interest has not been found to be property."
1998.98-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,850.577,852.578,"Mr. Todd, I have a question, though."
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,865.537,870.961,"--Justice O'Connor, we believe that an Ex parte Young action would lie."
1998.98-149,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,872.553,881.458,Are there State remedies for various State causes of action that could result in damages if you're correct?
1998.98-149,0,21605,david_c_todd,,881.458,884.08,There are not adequate State remedies across the board.
1998.98-149,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.593,892.446,"Thank you, Mr. Todd."
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,895.047,904.152,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.871,945.591,"General Waxman, most constitutional rights where you talk about waiver, it requires a very explicit, fully informed waiver, which I don't think what you just described would meet that test, do you?"
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,945.591,954.486,"--I think... I don't, and I think that the... well, to the extent that Congress has made its intent clear is where that test is met."
1998.98-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.992,1049.478,"General Waxman, do you really think there's a difference between what you call a unilateral act of the Government, the Government saying, the State shall be liable for any damages arising from its operation of a railroad... unilaterally, the State's liable if it operates a railroad... and the Government saying on the other hand, the State shall be liable for any damages from the operation of a railroad if it should operate a railroad--"
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1049.478,1051.789,That is--
1998.98-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1051.789,1054.253,"--and the latter... the latter said, well, it's a choice to the State."
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1061.156,1083.952,"--The test... there is a distinction between unilateral abrogation and consent, and the test really boils down to, as it does in the Tenth Amendment cases this Court has decided, like FERC v. Mississippi and United States v. New York, in terms of whether the State is exercising a genuine, reasonable choice and is not being coerced."
1998.98-149,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1135.698,1136.539,Is there a third--
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1183.35,1193.003,"Well, I think... I haven't made it expressly, but I think in the foreign sovereign immunities context we apply that rule in the context of, it is a consent."
1998.98-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.422,1220.172,This Court didn't develop that principle.
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1234.192,1265.473,"--The legislation of Congress simply permits, Justice Scalia, what we think is an operation here, which is the operation of a principle whereby if the legislature makes clear, unmistakably clear, the conditions under which engaging in a truly voluntary activity, commercial activity, the truly voluntary act of subsequently doing that, amounts to consent by conduct, and the general principle--"
1998.98-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.473,1267.336,"That applies to the United States as well, I assume, right?"
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1267.336,1268.107,--Excuse me?
1998.98-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.107,1281.115,"If you want to buy Justice Ginsburg's notion, I assume it would apply not only to the States but also to the Federal Government, that when the Federal Government acts in any private capacity, it will be subject to suit."
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1286.476,1294.504,"Well, we're attracted by any notion where... any principle the logic of which carries us to the result we think is just, but--"
1998.98-149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1295.242,1298.174,Any port in a storm.
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1298.174,1300.277,"But I think, Justice--"
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1300.277,1300.647,General Waxman--
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1300.647,1321.461,"--I think, Justice Scalia, if I can just respond to you for a moment, I think there are some important bedrock principles in the law that this Court has recognized that doesn't require any stretching for this Court to say that the Parden doctrine as a concept of waiver by consent with adequate notice and truly voluntary conduct is not one that should be abandoned."
1998.98-149,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1334.11,1339.723,--Does that principle assume that in this case the National Government could prevent the activity entirely?
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1339.723,1354.363,"I think you could never have... a State choice would never be voluntary if one of the... you know, if the quid was something that the Government couldn't possibly do."
1998.98-149,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1355.605,1360.738,"So that would distinguish the case that we're talking about from Justice Scalia's case then, wouldn't it?"
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1360.738,1362.0,"--Yes, and in fact--"
1998.98-149,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1362.0,1367.883,There's no super legislature that in effect would be able to bar the United States.
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1367.883,1383.191,--I think for me at least a useful way of thinking about the continuity of the Parden principle as it's been qualified following this Court's decision in Union Gas and Seminole Tribe is to think about those cases themselves.
1998.98-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.666,1425.52,But we don't allow waivers of constitutional rights whenever the Government has the ability to take away one thing in exchange for another.
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1437.057,1452.177,"That's right, and one of... for... that's why one of the... in the Spending Clause context one of the four... the last of the four factors in South Dakota v. Dole is, it can't impose a condition that is itself prohibited by the Constitution."
1998.98-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.795,1477.723,"But the condition here is prohibited by the Constitution as well, just as the Federal Government has no power to coerce testimony against the defendant, so, also, the Government has no power to revoke the sovereign immunity of the State."
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1477.723,1478.324,The--
1998.98-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.324,1487.359,"And to coerce the one by saying we're not going to let you do... run a railroad is no different, it seems to me, from coercing the other by saying we're not going to let you enter the financial market."
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1487.359,1502.671,"--If there were coercion here, Justice Scalia, I would agree, but I think the facts of this case are quite similar to the facts in Reeves v. Stake, which was one of the trilogy of cases this Court decided under the market participant principle."
1998.98-149,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1519.361,1525.704,"Are you saying that when States do research, that this is not governmental?"
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1525.704,1527.126,"--No, no, not at all."
1998.98-149,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1528.216,1530.757,The whole point of Reeves v. Stake was that it was a cement plant.
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1534.41,1534.941,--Right.
1998.98-149,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1583.973,1587.615,But some people have thought that States ought to get involved in the market.
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1624.27,1630.194,"The entire force of my argument and logic of my argument is, the Government is not saying it can't be done, period."
1998.98-149,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.654,1688.414,"General Waxman, the law for a long time, and maybe it still hasn't made a distinction between governmental functions of a Government and proprietary, and I think a lot of courts just felt that didn't work, that it was just too hard to tell which was which."
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1690.914,1702.993,"It does offer some of the same problems, but it's a distinction this Court was prepared to make and I think is prepared to make in the market participation, market regulation field that I just talked about, and even--"
1998.98-149,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1702.993,1705.314,We do make it with respect to foreign sovereigns.
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1712.828,1713.239,--And--
1998.98-149,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1713.239,1716.631,--that there was no immunity once you engage in a market activity.
1998.98-149,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1716.631,1722.866,"--That's right, and we also... the courts also make it, Mr. Chief Justice, in other contexts."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,1809.043,1813.026,"Yes sir, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.782,1870.743,"That's not an unusual suggestion, is it?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,1883.652,1890.357,--I think the use of property in the Sherman Act is for particular antitrust purposes.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1901.624,1913.08,"Well, all I'm suggesting is, it's not a totally novel thought to say that someone whose business is destroyed, or seriously harmed through loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of customers, has suffered an injury to his property."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,1913.08,1913.721,"Yes, and--"
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.721,1915.432,You agree with that.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,1915.432,1950.204,"--In the sense that that person has a claim for the injury, but the question is whether this property, this revenue that's never been received, and the only way you could recover damage is by showing false advertising, causation, the fact of damages, and damages with a reasonable certainty is all contingent, and that kind of a right, a right to be free of false advertising for Fourteenth Amendment purposes, hasn't been looked upon by property."
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1995.655,1996.984,Do you think... may I ask another question?
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,1997.945,2002.778,--Goodwill is likely to be property.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.778,2008.213,"And if so, if one's goodwill is taken away, has that person been deprived of property?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2008.213,2011.587,If goodwill is taken away--
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.587,2014.297,Or destroyed.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2014.297,2028.898,"--Destroyed, which is a hard concept to grab a hold of, I think that there would be a problem of turning the tort that was involved into--"
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.898,2030.047,My question is very simple.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2033.368,2041.323,"--I think if one's goodwill has been destroyed, it is likely the person has been deprived of property."
1998.98-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.323,2046.268,But you don't... you assert that didn't happen here.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2046.268,2046.618,No.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2049.13,2049.751,There was no trade libel--
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2049.751,2066.431,"The allegation here is that Florida Prepaid misdescribed its own property and as a result, says the plaintiff in the case below, I lost some business that I would have gotten, some revenue that I would have gotten, for which--"
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.431,2067.223,--It's similar to a case under--
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2067.223,2068.743,--there would be a tort claim for damages.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.743,2076.797,"--Similar to a claim under the Robinson-Patman Act if the competing sellers sold below cost for a long period of time, causing a plaintiff to lose a lot of business."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2080.688,2081.17,Yes.
1998.98-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2130.361,2151.707,"Well, I think part of the Government's argument, your opponent's argument here, Mr. Mallin, is that Congress can perhaps write with a broader sweep than just strict definitions of property previously, along the lines of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that was involved in the City of Boerne."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2158.251,2178.725,"When it comes to false advertising, unfair competition prong of the Lanham Act and the amendment to the Lanham Act there were no findings by Congress, no discussion from Congress, no suggestion that there's any kind of problem out there with the States doing this, or that there's any inadequacy of remedy."
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2206.363,2209.733,"--Yes, but you don't question the power of Congress to do that if the defendant were not a State."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2209.733,2211.987,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.987,2218.9,"You do not question the power of Congress to enact this legislation providing remedies against non-States, against private defendants."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2218.9,2220.162,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2220.162,2221.223,They can federalize to that extent.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2221.223,2226.357,this is not a challenge to the constitutionality of the Lanham Act.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2226.357,2228.487,"No, just the application to the States."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2228.487,2231.148,Of Eleventh... through the Eleventh Amendment.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.148,2232.26,"Right, and your argument--"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2232.26,2234.351,We're not even challenging whether the law applies to the States.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.017,2250.321,"--But your argument would not apply if they'd asserted an infringement of their trademark, would they?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2250.321,2258.036,"Well, the argument in the case of the trademark would be a different set of arguments."
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.693,2269.755,"Well, is it your argument that Congress--"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2269.755,2270.586,There must be lack of revenue.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.586,2272.556,--Is it your argument that Congress didn't make the appropriate findings?
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2276.129,2282.404,"Well, I'm sure they did, and at the time they passed the legislation it was before Seminole Tribe."
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2282.404,2283.105,Right.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2283.105,2287.817,And Congress was under the impression that under the Commerce Clause they could simply abrogate it.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.817,2288.337,Right.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2288.337,2289.469,And that's what they tried to do.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.469,2292.659,"But they thought there was a reason to do so, or they wouldn't have passed the statute."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2292.659,2297.483,"Yes, but the reason had... the reasons have nothing to do with the constitutional dimensions--"
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.483,2298.284,"Well, they have--"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2298.284,2299.093,--of the Eleventh Amendment.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.093,2304.426,"--If you're arguing, though, that there were not adequate findings you're in effect saying they should have made different findings, aren't you?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2306.088,2311.082,"Well, I don't think this Court has required findings from Congress."
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.626,2317.156,"Let me just ask one, to be sure I understand--"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2317.156,2318.558,But there's got to be a basis--
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.558,2319.71,"--Let me ask you a question, please."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2319.71,2320.378,--Yes.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2320.378,2343.573,"If Congress had said, we have studied the matter at great length and we think there's a problem that Florida has a couple of hundred patents out there and other... there's all sorts of patent infringement, trademark infringement going on by States, because they've accepted the suggestion that Justice Scalia made, they've decided to go into business all over the place where they didn't before, and we think there's a real problem, and therefore we're enacting this statute, would that have made any difference?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2344.504,2345.105,No.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.278,2354.692,"Well, I'm assuming there was a basis factually for what they did, but nevertheless, wouldn't you argue they're without power to take care of that problem?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2354.692,2367.64,"On that... first of all, on the property right, since there's no property right, yes, I would argue that they're without par, and since the record shows that there are remedies on the State level, I would--"
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.64,2373.532,"It seems to me that's totally irrelevant, because you're saying even if Congress had found there were no remedies, the result would be the same."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2373.532,2382.809,"--Well, if Congress had found there were no remedies and there were no remedies, and deference is... Congress is entitled to deference on its findings--"
1998.98-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2382.809,2408.876,"Well, in the City of Boerne case I think the Court said that where Congress seeks to go beyond the strict coverage of the amendment itself and perhaps wants to have... file a... classified as enforcement legislation, that the fact that Congress had found that there were a number of abuses, it could be of some importance in deciding whether Congress could go that extra step."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2408.876,2409.838,--Yes.
1998.98-149,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2447.482,2457.218,"Mr. Mallin, may I switch you to the other prong on this argument, and I would like to return to the question that I asked General Waxman."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2488.2,2493.844,"With all respect, Justice Ginsburg, I do not see that anomaly."
1998.98-149,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2504.789,2514.857,"Well, Congress codified what had been a doctrine of common law, Federal common law doctrine that had been around many, many years before the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2514.857,2521.32,"--Well, the point I'm making, it is not constitutional, so Congress could massage it the way it wanted to."
1998.98-149,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2522.962,2525.603,It was a definition of what does sovereign immunity mean?
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2542.053,2549.349,"--Your Honor, I would tend to think that Congress made a policy decision there with regard to foreign Governments."
1998.98-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2566.23,2573.787,"Well, that's true except when a State is in the court of another State, the Nevada v. Hall case."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2579.308,2583.831,A suit between States and States?
1998.98-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2583.831,2591.047,"No, a suit by a citizen of California against the State of Nevada in a California court."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2591.047,2593.598,A California State court?
1998.98-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2593.598,2594.179,Yes.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2594.179,2597.01,I don't think that's--
1998.98-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2597.01,2606.445,"In this case, for instance, could the Florida entity have been sued in the State courts of another State?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2606.445,2610.508,--That would depend on the law of those other States.
1998.98-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2618.764,2624.918,"Yes, but it might indicate that the sovereign immunity of the State is subject to some qualification."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2655.138,2666.445,--The question of whether a State can be sued in another State is first a question of State law and it might raise constitutional dimensions but they would not be Eleventh Amendment--
1998.98-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2666.445,2667.527,"Well, let me put it this way--"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2691.653,2692.832,--Well--
1998.98-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2692.832,2695.213,"Other than the words of the Eleventh Amendment, which--"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2695.213,2696.234,--Yes.
1998.98-149,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2698.337,2700.748,--If we probe the reason for it--
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2700.748,2723.972,"--The reason for it is that the Eleventh Amendment is a limitation on the judicial power of the United States, and it represents a concern that the States had from the very beginning of being hauled into the courts of the new National Government and subjected to the will of the new National Government in their courts."
1998.98-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.972,2731.239,"--Mr. Mallin, do you think that lending and borrowing money can fairly be described as a commercial activity?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2731.239,2736.061,"Well, in some contexts, yes, it could be described as commercial--"
1998.98-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.061,2737.263,"In any contexts, could it not?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2742.756,2743.996,--I think it's a very--
1998.98-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2743.996,2747.028,"And what was the Eleventh Amendment directed against, primarily?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2748.981,2754.353,"--Well, the suit that created the great controversy was a suit on a note, on a debt."
1998.98-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.353,2758.514,"They were worried about suing for debts that they had contracted in order to fund the war, isn't that right?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2758.514,2759.085,Right.
1998.98-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2766.101,2789.026,"Is it the case that if a State decides it's going to go in the ice cream business and it sells shirts, decides to open their own coffee bars, run grocery stores, that Federal commercial regulation is just out the window insofar as Federal commercial regulation involves giving individuals who are hurt private actions in a Federal court."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2813.612,2818.215,"--My view is, I don't know where this Court may draw the line."
1998.98-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.215,2820.315,But all what line?
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2835.235,2849.496,"The line that this Court has drawn so far, the line it drew in the Parden case, as modified, is a line of sometimes called poor Government functions."
1998.98-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2851.677,2864.146,"So you would say that if, in fact, they do go into a proprietary field, if they do go into the business, a business, then they do waive, then they do waive any rights."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2866.507,2867.576,Well--
1998.98-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2867.576,2868.408,Which is it you--
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2868.408,2871.329,--they don't waive it simply by going into the proprietary business.
1998.98-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2875.413,2876.344,"--Oh, no, no, we'll write the statute."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2878.826,2879.767,They'll have to provide something that's--
1998.98-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.767,2881.21,"--at the beginning, we'll write that in."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2891.525,2899.299,--What I'm trying to do is to say one must be careful about Government activities too quickly to say they're proprietary.
1998.98-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.883,2913.389,"With Starbucks, if they're out there selling coffee, T-shirts, and bananas, or whatever, then you have no problem with the waiver."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2913.389,2918.142,"Yes, I have no problem with staying that that's beyond State activities that--"
1998.98-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2918.142,2919.974,Where do you find that in the Eleventh Amendment?
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2923.277,2924.306,"--No, I don't find that in the Eleventh Amendment."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2927.759,2928.29,"Oh, okay."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2928.29,2928.77,--up until now.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2928.77,2931.271,A lot of which is hard to find in the Eleventh Amendment.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2976.729,2978.762,"No, I made no such suggestion."
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2978.762,2979.072,All right.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2979.893,2981.234,"No, the Fourteenth Amendment--"
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2981.234,2986.216,"--Where do you... you spoke of drawing a line, and I thought you were conceding that that might be the place to draw the line."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2990.349,2995.583,"--There is two issues, one is Parden, and one is the Fourteenth Amendment."
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2997.923,2998.744,Okay.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,2998.744,2999.375,The implied waiver.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3018.367,3019.088,Okay.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3019.088,3019.839,Which I think there is there.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3019.839,3029.386,"So you're saying there is still a vital Parden exception in effect to the limitation announced in Seminole, is that right, as far as you know?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3033.156,3033.647,No.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3033.647,3034.308,--you've got facts to support it?
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3034.308,3035.189,"No, I do not, and we haven't--"
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3035.189,3035.909,You don't?
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3035.909,3036.309,--got to that point.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3046.577,3047.038,Okay.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3047.038,3047.957,Some have questioned it.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3047.957,3077.305,"Here's... the thing that I'm trying to get at is, I thought you were conceding that there is some kind of a line to be drawn, that whether we're talking about Eleventh Amendment Article I power, or whether we're talking about the section 5 enforcement power, there are some things that the State can do to subject... that the National Government can do to subject the States to national regulation like the Lanham Act, but certain conditions have to be met, and that is how I thought you were saying you draw the line."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3080.978,3082.59,"On... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3108.921,3129.831,"So that, for example, if the State does go into a Starbucks operation and it becomes very predatory, it's driving all of its competitors out of business, there is no power under section 5, I take it, under which the Government might act, the National Government might act?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3129.831,3130.903,--Unless it's taken property.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3133.915,3135.816,It's driving its competitors out of business.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3137.028,3140.16,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so."
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3140.16,3141.429,Okay.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3155.842,3159.374,"I want to be sure I understand the hypothetical, Your Honor."
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3159.374,3167.639,The State goes into the coffee bar business and decides a good way to increase its business would be to burn the coffee bars of its competitors.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3173.074,3173.792,Yes.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3195.298,3196.279,So long as--
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3196.279,3198.961,--so the State is not denying due process at all.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3198.961,3207.236,"--So the National Government could not say, we have our doubts about the effectiveness of that remedy in the courts of the very State that it's burning down the bars."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3209.259,3210.99,The National Government has--
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3210.99,3212.712,That would not be a basis to section 5 legislation.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3212.712,3235.575,"--Congress has discretion, but that discretion can't change the fact that if the State provides due process of law so that the individual whose bar was burned could bring a suit in the State court and obtain full compensation, the State has not deprived property without due process at all."
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.575,3237.025,"Yes, but what if they do as some States."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3241.209,3241.59,Yes.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3241.89,3243.04,What do you do--
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3243.04,3255.979,"--Yes, Your Honor, if it's well-established that the State takes property and doesn't have a remedy for it, that that's lack of due process of law."
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3258.721,3269.509,"--Well, given that, doesn't... are you then saying in that situation it would be appropriate to... it would be permissible for Congress to authorize a suite against a State in a Federal court for damages?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3269.509,3276.215,"--Yes, where the State has denied due process of law, but there's nothing in this record--"
1998.98-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.215,3277.745,I don't think they have to authorize it.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3279.615,3280.656,--Yes.
1998.98-149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3295.856,3298.168,"--Yes, but all those cases are before our latest decisions."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3303.641,3304.442,Yes.
1998.98-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.867,3316.931,"Now, as to the other line, you say there are two arguments, one's the Fourteenth Amendment, the other one is Parden."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3323.713,3324.324,No.
1998.98-149,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3324.744,3327.537,You seem to have gotten yourself into the position of defending it.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3330.749,3331.5,--Yes.
1998.98-149,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3347.299,3386.615,"In other words, you're thinking that Hamilton and Madison and... they... if you'd even asked them, let's imagine you asked them, say we have this State that's gone sort of wild for commercial ventures, and they're acting not like a duck, they're acting like a business, exactly, identical, but you, Mr. Madison, believe that those same rules that affect every other business of the United States that Congress has enacted like antitrust laws should not apply, simply because the name on the... on that business, which is in every other respect identical happens to be the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Shoe Store, or... et cetera."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3396.773,3415.557,"If we have an Eleventh Amendment issue, on the Eleventh Amendment the State cannot be sued unless it denies due process or it has a voluntary amendment."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3458.395,3460.336,Is it your--
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3460.336,3463.758,"In a situation where the waiver is demanded, the waiver is the same as abrogation."
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3463.758,3473.893,"--Mr. Todd, is it your position that there is no sovereign immunity principle operating here which is in addition to or different from the Eleventh Amendment?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3482.749,3490.015,"Well, the State has its own sovereign immunity principles, and when I say Eleventh Amendment I'm talking about the--"
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3490.015,3492.278,"Well, cognizable... cognizable in a Federal court."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3492.278,3494.8,--entire bundle that this Court has read into the Eleventh Amendment.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3494.8,3495.761,Cognizable in a Federal court.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3505.836,3518.194,"Well, I think the Eleventh Amendment, as interpreted by this Court, includes a full bundle of sovereign immunity, so that would be taken into account."
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3518.194,3524.489,"Well, does it include any concept of sovereign immunity in addition to the strict terms of the Eleventh Amendment itself?"
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3524.489,3527.872,In addition to the Eleventh Amendment?
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3527.872,3528.583,Yes.
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3528.583,3532.433,Only those things that the Court has interpreted that it be included.
1998.98-149,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3533.906,3535.807,"Well, I'm asking you how the Court should interpret it."
1998.98-149,2,45499,william_b_mallin,,3563.324,3587.231,"--The State claims a sovereign immunity defense that goes beyond their specific language of the Eleventh Amendment, to include what was thought to be the original understanding as bound by Hans v. Louisiana and later confirmed by this Court among other places in Seminole Tribe."
1998.98-149,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3587.231,3588.383,"Thank you, Mr. Mallin."
