1986.86-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.371,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 86-104, Board of Airport Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles versus Jews for Jesus and others."
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,14.605,17.182,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,61.617,65.645,"Mr. Kapel, may I ask a preliminary question or two?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,72.909,75.032,"Yes, the Board of Airport Commissioners."
1986.86-104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,75.032,80.561,Was that resolution binding without city council approval?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,80.561,83.342,It is binding without city council approval.
1986.86-104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.089,92.401,Has the city council ever approved it in fact?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,92.401,96.869,"--No, it has not been presented to the city council."
1986.86-104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,106.456,118.452,"And in another preliminary inquiry, would the airport be a public forum under California constitutional law?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,118.452,120.546,"No, I don't believe so."
1986.86-104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.728,133.93,How about the Hoffman case making a railroad terminal a public forum?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,133.93,142.113,In that case there was no indication that the owner of the property ever attempted to restrict the uses of the terminal facilities.
1986.86-104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.441,148.299,Was the state law point argued in the courts below?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,148.299,149.658,"--Yes, it was argued."
1986.86-104,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.266,152.594,Thank you.
1986.86-104,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,152.594,157.592,"May I ask a question before you proceed, Mr. Kapel?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,161.809,162.699,Yes.
1986.86-104,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,162.699,163.731,Specifically?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,163.731,164.668,Yes.
1986.86-104,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,181.582,183.909,"When people have not left, have they been prosecuted?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,183.909,186.237,They have not been prosecuted.
1986.86-104,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,206.182,208.041,So this is a facial challenge?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,208.041,209.119,"Yes, it is."
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.119,230.687,"That means, I take it, that if we disagree with you that it is a public... if we disagree with you that it's a public forum, what result should accrue?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,230.687,236.716,I believe that the determinative issue is the public forum issue.
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.716,242.338,Suppose we're worried about the allegations of unequal enforcement of it?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,242.338,243.682,"Excuse me, I'm sorry?"
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.682,257.16,"Suppose we're worried about the allegations of unequal enforcement, the Christian Science reading room, for example, and the advertisement about environmental matters that are alleged to have been in the airport."
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,259.504,274.154,"I don't believe that issue is before you, because I believe both of those matters are airport-related matters, or matters the Board could determine were airport related."
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.875,312.732,"What I'm asking is, do we have to reach that?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,331.224,352.716,"If you find that there has been viewpoint discrimination, where the Board has picked improperly and decided that an activity is airport related when it fact it isn't, then I believe our resolution should not be enforced until we remedied that situation."
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.716,354.543,And we can make that determination here.
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,354.543,356.7,"Yes, I believe you can."
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.7,359.901,Did the lower court base its decision in part on that?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,359.901,360.37,No.
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.6,373.363,So we wouldn't have to... and the Ninth Circuit did the same?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,373.363,374.785,--That's correct.
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.737,383.141,"So if we're worried about these other matters, we could remand and let them decide whether there's been unequal enforcement, couldn't we?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,383.141,384.516,"Yes, you could."
1986.86-104,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,384.516,394.84,"Counsel, is your position one of all or nothing, that it either is a traditional public forum or it is not?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,403.805,408.46,There is room for that in this case.
1986.86-104,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,452.973,458.422,"Of course, you have presented nothing by way of evidence to counter-balance the thing."
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,472.106,474.182,That's true.
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,474.182,479.899,"May I ask, you said airport related, and you said, things needed by the traveller."
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,492.223,501.782,"The test is airport related, and it is what the Board has determined aids the travelling public in their travels."
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.642,503.97,But not necessary for the traveller?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,503.97,506.141,--Not absolutely necessary.
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.779,515.042,And without a Christian Science reading room.
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,515.042,516.337,It is not necessary to board an airplane.
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,516.337,534.644,"However, if it's something like the reading room that provides a place to sit while you're waiting for planes, and maybe to obtain peace of mind before you get up in the storm, or something like that, why wouldn't the literature that is passed out by these people perhaps serve some airport related function?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,534.644,542.312,The reading room provides a waiting area that is the same as any other waiting area in the terminal facilities.
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.605,558.196,"Well, but they read newspapers, which is something to pass the time and occupy the traveller and perhaps give him peace of mind."
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,558.196,558.728,Absolutely.
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.728,564.287,Why wouldn't reading the literature that these people pass out be airport related in the same sense as reading a newspaper is?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,564.287,567.177,I believe reading the literature would be.
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,569.224,573.159,"Well, why is that any different than passing... than offering it for sale by the news vendor?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,573.159,586.029,"--I think it is different, because the Board of Airport Commissioners has determined that a certain amount of space within the terminal should be devoted to loading gates; a certain amount to newstands; a certain amount to--"
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.029,607.224,"Well, but could they then, just as they have... and consistently with the general policy decide, this is good health literature that will help the passenger be comfortable if there's a thunderstorm or something; we ought to set aside an area of 10 square feet and let them have a booth to pass it out, just like the Christian Science people can pass out Mary Baker Eddy's writings?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,607.224,612.94,"--Well, the Board of Airport Commissioners does not decide what literature is made available within the terminals."
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,621.014,621.389,"No, I understand."
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,635.321,638.087,Clearly they could come to us and do that.
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.624,662.169,"Yes, but you keep going to the waiting area."
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,670.213,671.197,--That's correct.
1986.86-104,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,671.197,676.601,Why isn't it equally conceivable that travellers might want to read the literature of the Jews for Jesus?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,676.601,684.443,"They may well wish to read it, and they're welcome to bring that in the terminals and read it in the terminals or anywhere in the airport."
1986.86-104,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.443,691.721,Are the news people allowed to hawk their newspapers by walking around in the terminal selling them?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,691.721,692.987,Absolutely not.
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.515,702.903,But that isn't how your ordinance reads.
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,709.322,710.494,"No, it is not."
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,710.494,712.258,What specifically is prohibited?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,712.258,714.898,Non-airport-related activities.
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.898,722.223,"So I'm a Congressman flying from Washington to Hawaii, and I have to transfer planes in Los Angeles."
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,734.766,735.499,Absolutely not.
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.932,752.368,Speech is not an activity?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,765.738,768.361,--I don't believe there would be any problem with that.
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.361,769.845,Oh really?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,774.046,778.842,I believe conversations are not a problem.
1986.86-104,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.619,789.102,I couldn't give the Congressman a piece of paper.
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,790.821,795.209,"No, I believe you could give the Congressman a piece of paper."
1986.86-104,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.209,804.784,"Well, isn't the ordinance designed in part to prevent obstruction of the passage of people along the concourses on the way to the planes, and coming out from the planes?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,804.784,805.487,Of course.
1986.86-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,854.232,857.934,Is there anything in the record to show exactly what they do?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,865.742,880.268,"It is in the record from the standpoint that the city has stipulated that the Jews for Jesus, the individual who brought this lawsuit, was not interfering with the travelling public, and was not grabbing onto anybody."
1986.86-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,900.746,901.776,-- do.
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,901.776,903.073,Excuse me?
1986.86-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,903.073,906.086,What is wrong with what these people do?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,906.086,910.365,Nothing is wrong with what they do.
1986.86-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,910.365,914.302,"Well, how can you prohibit something that doesn't do anything wrong?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,914.302,920.815,Because we are trying to control the uses of the interiors of the terminal facilities.
1986.86-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,929.812,930.671,"Well, what right do you have to stop it?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,930.671,941.527,"I believe the Board has the right to limit the use of its facilities to their intended, dedicated purposes."
1986.86-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,941.527,944.119,Could it stop all red-headed people from using it?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,944.119,945.241,Absolutely not.
1986.86-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,945.241,946.226,Why not?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,946.226,948.365,Because I believe that would be discriminatory.
1986.86-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,949.584,951.162,"Well, why isn't this discriminatory?"
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,953.677,960.377,"--No, I don't believe we have singled out one group of people."
1986.86-104,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,963.25,968.561,You have singled out people that you don't want to use your facilities?
1986.86-104,0,31333,james_r_kapel,,968.561,970.139,--Absolutely not.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1709.123,1713.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1737.408,1744.093,You mean just generally that any airport... any airport that's open to the public is a public forum?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1744.093,1748.248,"--Your Honor, we have couched our argument that... a major airport terminal."
1986.86-104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.199,1763.288,"And you would say that nothing that the city could do could... could close it, or to... or to put it in a category other than a public forum?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1763.288,1764.881,Our position is twofold.
1986.86-104,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.864,1770.582,"So it's like a sidewalk, they just can't--"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1770.582,1772.832,"Yes, a sidewalk or a street or a park."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.832,1777.547,--How has it been created by tradition if airport authorities close them?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1777.547,1779.11,"Well, the tradition, Your Honor--"
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.11,1782.359,I mean what is the tradition with respect to major airports?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1782.359,1785.356,--Major airports as we know them are a major... a recent phenomenon.
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1787.044,1793.073,So there is no tradition with respect to major airports; is that true or false?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1793.073,1794.761,"I think there is a tradition, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.761,1795.136,What is it?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1795.136,1795.948,I think it's twofold.
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1810.909,1814.19,"So that is the tradition, what's happened in the past 12 years?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1814.19,1818.595,"--Considering the length of the history of the airport itself, that period of time is substantial."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.742,1842.461,I thought about that city gates thing.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1874.698,1890.113,"--Well, Your Honor, I think in the spectrum of history, if you will, starting from... if you want to start from the Constitution, our position would be, not being there, of course, that Jews for Jesus would have had the right if in fact it was not a private enterprise."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.939,1901.514,"No, but come back to a place where travellers gather to use transportation."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1916.212,1922.943,The places such as an inn or a bus terminal or a rail station have been the places where people have gathered.
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1925.443,1930.283,"The innkeeper couldn't throw somebody out, saying I don't want to have any... you know, no politics, no religion in my inn."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1931.455,1939.343,The innkeeper could throw someone out if the innkeeper wasn't a government sponsored organization like the Los Angeles International Airport.
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.529,1944.246,"But he traditionally was a private operation, that's the point."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1947.87,1953.681,"--No, I think that from a historic standpoint, it was the access issue there."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1962.49,1967.736,But what's your answer as to the private versus public ownership of a railroad terminal in this tradition?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1967.736,1970.501,A different situation as far as the actual private ownership.
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1979.748,1981.793,In the railroad terminals?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1981.793,1982.965,"Yes, I mean it was--"
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1982.965,1987.901,And yet there's no question that people could have been thrown out of there by the owners of the terminals.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1987.901,1988.463,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.509,1994.914,And weren't almost all of the railroad terminals privately owned?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1994.914,2000.646,"I'm not an expert in that area, and I don't know if in fact all of them were privately owned."
1986.86-104,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.365,2007.893,Have you ever seen a station where people stand around in groups and discuss things?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2007.893,2008.611,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1986.86-104,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2008.611,2015.811,Have you ever seen a station or an airport where people stand around and discuss problems at all?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2015.811,2016.405,Absolutely.
1986.86-104,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2016.405,2017.093,You have?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2017.093,2017.702,"I have, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2019.732,2024.512,"Well, you get in Grand Central Station around 5:00 o'clock, and you'll get run over."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2024.512,2037.224,"--Your Honor, the fact that there are a lot of people in the particular forum is more evidence of the importance of those particular places being available for public access for the dissemination of, in this case, religious literature."
1986.86-104,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.786,2046.549,"xxx home to dinner, not on religion."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2046.549,2067.416,"Your Honor, if we were to phrase the issue as it has been phrased, is that the airports are traditional public forum, as we have phrased the issue, our position would be, that access that you're talking about, that mass of people is exactly the reason why First Amendment activities should be allowed inside the central terminal area at LAX as they have been for over 12 years."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.416,2068.369,Because there are a lot of people?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2068.369,2069.978,"Are there a lot of... yes, Your Honor, there is."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.978,2072.601,"I mean, that's the reason: Because there are a lot of people?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2072.601,2082.301,"No, it's... we would... we would... in reviewing the issue or making a determination of whether a particular area was a public forum, we would utilize what this Court has long held as a compatibility."
1986.86-104,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2088.377,2088.985,Counsel?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2088.985,2089.485,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2089.485,2091.141,Excuse me for interrupting you.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2099.701,2102.23,"Yes, Your Honor, a reasonable time, place and manner regulation would be appropriate."
1986.86-104,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2102.23,2102.777,"Yes, right."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2102.777,2103.23,Could be appropriate.
1986.86-104,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2103.23,2113.491,"Now, the facts in this... facts in this case, as I recall them are, that a minister of Jews for Jesus was physically handing out literature."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2113.491,2114.803,That's correct.
1986.86-104,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2114.803,2115.584,That's correct?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2134.17,2139.607,"Depending on the particular forum, a booth limitation could be appropriate--"
1986.86-104,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2139.607,2141.293,Analogous to distributing newspapers.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2141.293,2142.324,--It could be appropriate.
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.778,2179.011,Can you think of any place where it wouldn't be compatible?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2190.007,2192.679,That's a factual analysis.
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.068,2195.754,"--Oh, I think it wouldn't, but Congress just says, we don't want it here."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2202.58,2206.579,"--Well, the airport has taken... of course, have taken the position that they have said that."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2232.178,2232.38,That's your test.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2238.409,2239.471,--Substantially interfere.
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.471,2241.439,"--substantially, the activity must be allowed?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2241.439,2244.47,"Your Honor, it would be a balancing test."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.746,2260.759,"Well, that's a vast extension of the public forum doctrine to date, it seems to me."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2260.759,2263.743,"Your Honor, our position is that it's really not."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.424,2287.889,"I thought the rule was that when it is a public forum, you must allow those activities to the extent they're compatible with the other things occurring in that public forum."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2293.356,2303.102,"Your Honor, our position is that the compatibility is, does the First Amendment activity substantially interfere with the primary purpose of the public forum."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2306.07,2307.242,You have to establish that it's a public forum first.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2316.877,2321.672,"--And the public forum, to look at the public forum, we have to look at it as a multitude of factors."
1986.86-104,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2360.581,2364.626,You mentioned the sidewalk in front of this building.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2366.001,2370.701,"Your Honor, that is something obviously I pondered as I walked up."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.576,2413.888,xxx test you're applying?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2413.888,2414.901,--I'm applying--
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.901,2417.308,You just look at the sky and say it is?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2417.308,2417.884,--Absolutely--
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.884,2420.555,"I thought it depends on tradition, essentially."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2420.555,2426.07,"--Your Honor, it goes... it's both tradition, and it is of course those that have been open."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.158,2440.658,What about the plaza in front of this courthouse?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2440.658,2450.856,"Well, based on my knowledge of the plaza of the courthouse, I think communication... communicating activities have not taken place because there has been a presumption that it is not an area open."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.638,2452.591,But that doesn't trouble you?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2452.591,2457.369,"--How can you bring up... how can you have a history, Your Honor, when a government authority says no?"
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2457.369,2460.118,That's how you get a history.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2471.91,2474.94,"No, Your Honor, it's precisely contrary to that."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.719,2486.405,"Well, but we don't know about the hypothesis, whether they would have done it or not, if the government had banned it."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2486.405,2491.98,"Your Honor, there were laws in 1789, the Seditions Act, which said, basically, don't distribute literature."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2496.103,2500.118,"Well, tell me a little bit about those laws that were challenged in 1789."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2500.118,2503.007,"--Again, not specifying the date, the handing out--"
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.007,2506.287,"Well, pin it down to within 40 or 50 years, will you?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2506.287,2507.146,"--Well, I'll do my best."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.546,2522.233,Where was this?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2522.233,2523.764,"I don't recall the exact place, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2524.42,2525.498,Somewhere in the United States?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2525.498,2526.202,"--Yes, absolutely."
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2550.612,2551.55,Mr. Sekulow--
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2551.55,2552.034,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2552.034,2568.871,"--suppose that we disagree with the court below and think that this is not a traditional public forum, did... did you argue below that in any event under the California constitution it would be a public forum, and must be open?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2568.871,2569.34,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2577.945,2580.146,But the courts below never reached the state law question?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2580.146,2580.678,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2583.208,2592.861,"And if we decided the federal constitutional issue here against you, would it be your position that the state law might nevertheless require it to be open?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2592.861,2601.686,"--Our position would be that in re Hoffman, as Your Honor cited earlier, would stand for the proposition that First Amendment activities would be appropriate."
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2605.372,2608.481,"Well, suppose we decide against you on the federal Constitution?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2615.962,2617.446,"--Yes, Your Honor, we would take the position it has."
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2618.147,2622.568,Why then shouldn't the court below have decided the state issue first?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2622.568,2625.129,--We've pointed that out in our brief.
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2644.434,2646.011,"Let me ask one other question, too."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2649.605,2650.073,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.895,2703.816,"That's not before us, though, right?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2703.816,2706.034,--It's not before you... before this Court--
1986.86-104,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2706.034,2724.495,"So we should decide this case as though the question is, could LAX like the Capitol promulgate a nicely, narrowly crafted rule that says, no religious proselytizing on these grounds, right, and that's the issue?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2729.947,2738.85,"--Your Honor, the Court has before it facts which have been stipulated by the parties showing exactly what's taken place in LAX, the activities that have taken place."
1986.86-104,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.126,2756.029,"Putting it more precisely, you're asking us to affirm the judgment on other grounds than the ones relied on by the Ninth Circuit, which we do all the time?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2756.029,2761.074,"--Your Honor, I'm also asking that the Court affirm, of course, that it is a traditional public forum."
1986.86-104,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.074,2763.276,"Yes, but I mean you have not abandoned your overbreadth arguments."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2763.276,2763.823,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.823,2765.728,"And if we think it's overbroad, we have to affirm, don't we?"
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2765.728,2769.149,"Overbroad, vagueness, and again, the content-based discrimination."
1986.86-104,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2769.149,2769.571,Mr. Sekulow--
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2769.571,2770.665,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-104,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2770.665,2780.005,--suppose your group stood in the... with the permission of the newsstand and handed it out inside of the newsstand.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2784.33,2787.782,"Under the resolution, there wouldn't be a newsstand to stand in at."
1986.86-104,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2803.777,2806.572,Assuming that they don't close the newsstand.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2806.572,2807.337,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-104,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2807.337,2815.085,Could he stand in the middle of that with the permission of the newsstand and hand out these pamphlets?
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2815.085,2818.926,"The question then would be, would that activity substantially interfere with the flow of traffic?"
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2877.745,2880.276,"Well, Mr. Sekulow, they lease space."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2883.197,2883.713,"No, your Honor, it has not."
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2883.713,2886.149,"Well, then, they're not the same situation."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2886.149,2887.429,"Your Honor, we would take the position--"
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2887.429,2888.101,They're paying a lease.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2890.881,2905.125,"--Your Honor, our position is that a First Amendment activity is not something we would have to pay for; that one of the purposes of the public forum doctrine is giving groups that may have less popular messages and not the... not through that cost."
1986.86-104,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2905.125,2905.343,I understand that.
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2915.246,2916.432,"Your Honor, in this context."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2946.436,2957.822,"Well, that's like saying that the Methodist Church, which owns the property on which the church is located, because they preach religious doctrine in there, somebody else who doesn't own a church should be able on the street outside to hold their church service."
1986.86-104,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2959.479,2960.633,"Well, the courts have dealt with that."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2980.454,2988.763,"Yes, but what you're saying is if... anything the Christian Science people can do by leasing, you want to be able to do without leasing."
1986.86-104,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2990.231,2991.325,"--Your Honor, we're not taking it that far."
1986.86-104,2,31333,james_r_kapel,,3524.61,3527.468,Thank you.
1986.86-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3548.054,3550.193,Like a good ordinance drafter?
1986.86-104,2,31333,james_r_kapel,,3550.193,3551.615,--Yes.
1986.86-104,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3603.109,3603.719,"Thank you, Mr. Kapel."
