1987.86-1743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.127,"We'll hear argument next in number 86-1743, Monessen Southwestern Railway Company versus Gerald L. Morgan."
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,90.76,97.506,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.425,413.019,Is the announced purpose of Rule 238 to encourage settlement in this kind of case?
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,413.019,414.137,"It is, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.99,492.299,But Pennsylvania doesn't say prejudgment interest is awarded as a matter of right to a prevailing plaintiff; it's only where there was a failure to submit an offer of a particular kind by the defendant?
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,492.299,494.151,"Yes, Your Honor, that is true."
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.705,836.207,"Mr. Manion, in this case, who decided on the prejudgment interest?"
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,838.778,839.279,"It was not, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,845.313,849.057,It wasn't characterized then as an element of the damages?
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,849.057,850.178,"It was not, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.178,853.62,And how did the Judge decide on the ten percent rate?
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,853.62,877.846,Rule 238 which is applicable since 1978 in common law bodily injury cases or those which involve property damage provides that the award shall be at the rate of ten percent per year providing the conditions are met that there's been no offer by the defendant and that the award exceeds any offer by 125 percent.
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.846,878.105,I see.
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,878.105,888.513,"And of course, that's another reason why this rule of course was adopted in that inflationary period of the late 70s."
1987.86-1743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,954.166,956.307,"When you say for 80 years, the Court has held that."
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,960.06,961.61,"--I am not, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.632,1004.0,"Mr. Manion, did any of those cases involve the peculiar wrinkle we have in this case of a separate rule that provides that this can be done as a remedy for failing to make a high enough settlement offer?"
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1004.0,1004.77,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.022,1028.497,But particularly to any of them involve State Court rules that are dealing with the subject of trying to motivate settlement offers?
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1028.497,1032.669,"I believe a substantial number of them do, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1032.669,1038.532,"The Third Circuit case certainly would be because it was dealing with the Pennsylvania Rule, wasn't it?"
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1038.532,1039.723,It was in the first.
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.125,1274.232,"Supposing the State rule, instead of having a prejudgment interest as a remedy for failing to make settlement offer provided that say it would be double costs of a thousand dollar flat one percent of the judgment."
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1296.339,1296.549,Your Honor... yes.
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.223,1301.414,Right.
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1301.414,1306.427,Because counsel had delayed the prosecution of the case--
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1306.427,1307.288,Leave it the same.
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1311.642,1313.283,"--I don't think that would be permitted, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.283,1315.245,And they couldn't do anything of that kind?
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1315.245,1317.395,Not as a State rule.
1987.86-1743,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.398,1367.461,"I presume you would also argue that the State rule is not really designed to punish for not making settlement offer, but rather the rule is designed to provide prejudgment interest and however there is a dispensation for someone who has been good enough to make a settlement offer?"
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1374.424,1381.229,"--Whether the true motivation of the Court is to clear up the congested docket, that also is a consideration, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1434.595,1441.308,"Mr. Manion, do you plan to discuss the total offset damages issue at all?"
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1441.308,1442.729,"I was about to address that, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1442.729,1458.341,"And in that regard, may I inquire whether at trial there was any effort on the part of your client to establish a technically more accurate method--"
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1458.341,1459.112,"There was, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1459.112,1461.112,--than the total offset method?
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1461.112,1461.483,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1508.077,1516.101,I didn't find anything to indicate that you established that that was a better method than the total offset method.
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1516.101,1516.672,"Well, Your Honor,--"
1987.86-1743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1516.672,1520.536,Do you think it's open to the Court to select any reasonable method?
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1520.536,1522.997,"--I don't think it's open to the Court, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1524.926,1526.068,We held that it was in Pfeifer.
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1526.068,1532.082,"It was in Pfeifer, Your Honor, because the Court was sitting non-jury."
1987.86-1743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1532.082,1532.463,Yes.
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1543.703,1550.185,"It is, Your Honor, because like a lot of questions of that kind, it depends on the evidence which goes into the record."
1987.86-1743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1555.07,1559.942,"Well, I would have thought the method of calculating damages was one for the Court."
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1559.942,1562.654,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, for this reason."
1987.86-1743,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1571.209,1577.003,"Well, once the method is selected, then the factual question and its application goes to the jury."
1987.86-1743,0,38114,paul_a_manion,,1583.888,1599.039,"--I think Justice Hutchinson makes the point in his dissent in this case and Your Honor understanding now we're talking not just about the method in terms of a legal method, but where it involves issues of fact concerning the discount rate."
1987.86-1743,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1677.607,1680.559,"Thank you, Mr. Manion."
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,1682.288,1685.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.521,1932.054,You should make that argument to Congress when it enacted the FELA.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,1934.107,1947.417,"Well, Your Honor, I'm glad you raised that, because Congress... and we're talking now about prejudgment interest, I take it, is what your question is... Congress said nothing about prejudgment interest."
1987.86-1743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.418,2195.526,"Mr. Hollander, this Court has handed down many many decisions saying on fairly minor points that Federal law rather than State law governs how you construe a complaint."
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2207.276,2214.83,"--Your Honor, if you're referring to whether the Rule for 238 prejudgment interest applies?"
1987.86-1743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.83,2215.671,Yes.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2215.671,2226.48,"There are a number of things that I would like to comment on with regard to that, because we're really talking about the uniformity of the application of the FELA across the country."
1987.86-1743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2320.575,2325.436,"Well, is that really the question whether it's a just concept here?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2339.517,2339.968,"--Your Honor,--"
1987.86-1743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.968,2342.862,I don't think that's the standard that our cases have laid down.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2342.862,2345.334,"--Well, let me make this comment with regard to that question."
1987.86-1743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2373.253,2374.925,"In general, you mean as a matter of Federal law?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2377.178,2389.958,"--I think a case can be made, Justice Scalia, that prejudgment interest ought to be awarded in FELA cases because prejudgment interest is awarded in so many Federal claims across the country in Federal courts."
1987.86-1743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.958,2391.4,But I'm not asking--
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2393.53,2400.324,"It has been done in Jones Act, Death on the High Seas Act, Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act cases."
1987.86-1743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2402.798,2408.233,That's quite a different argument than saying Rule 238 can be applied by the Pennsylvania State Court?
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2408.233,2409.083,That's correct.
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2439.945,2444.439,"Mr. Hollander, how many States have a statute like this?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2444.439,2446.79,"I don't know how many States, if any, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2446.79,2447.811,I don't mean just interest.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2449.664,2454.506,I can only report that Pennsylvania has this rule.
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.506,2457.829,"Well, did you do any research to find out if--"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2457.829,2462.082,I did and I saw that there are 32 States with prejudgment interest statutes.
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2462.082,2463.033,--Like this one?
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2463.033,2464.325,"No, no."
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.796,2468.977,So now we're going to have fifty of them?
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2468.977,2470.73,"--Your Honor,--"
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2470.73,2472.262,"We're going to have fifty of them, right?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2472.923,2473.942,--I don't know that.
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.942,2475.605,"Well, you could, couldn't you?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2475.605,2476.115,You could have.
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.519,2486.502,"That's what I said, each State could do a different one?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2486.502,2487.894,"Yes, yes."
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.894,2488.465,That's a little different.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2488.465,2489.336,"That's correct, I'm sorry."
1987.86-1743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.753,2512.545,"Mr. Hollander, suppose you decide to eliminate congestion instead of by providing prejudgment interest where there hasn't been a proper settlement offer, suppose you decide to do it by simply increasing the damages?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2537.152,2538.203,"Let me say this, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.542,2555.534,I didn't ask whether it would be reasonable.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2571.005,2574.829,"--Well, I guess I heard the fifty percent and thought you wanted me to respond to that."
1987.86-1743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2590.99,2591.621,"Well, change the amount."
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2604.019,2610.905,"Well, let me respond first, it's not my position that Federal courts should adopt Rule 238."
1987.86-1743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2617.409,2627.898,"No, I mean as far as this Federal Court receiving an appeal from the courts doing that, from the State courts doing that?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2627.898,2628.108,Yes.
1987.86-1743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.4,2643.728,Do you think the State courts could apply that rule and increase FELA damages a certain percentage so long as their purpose in increasing the damages is to eliminate congestion in State courts?
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2643.728,2644.84,"--Yes, I do take that position."
1987.86-1743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2644.84,2654.885,"Counsel, assume that we adopted the Federal rule that there would be prejudgment interest."
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2660.421,2661.851,Yes.
1987.86-1743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2674.122,2679.004,"Well, then you're saying it's a Federal rule if there's interest but not a Federal rule if there's no interest?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2679.004,2683.077,Perhaps I'm having difficulty with the question.
1987.86-1743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2711.585,2712.987,"All right, suppose we say you're right."
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2722.792,2725.704,If the offer is tendered and rejected--
1987.86-1743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2725.704,2731.499,Could the Pennsylvania courts encourage settlement by saying that prejudgment interest would not apply in that event?
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2731.499,2739.274,"--I don't think they could take the position that if it was a Federal rule allowing prejudgment interest that they could prevent its imposition in State courts, that's correct."
1987.86-1743,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2739.274,2742.145,I don't see how that's any different than the case before us.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2742.145,2744.297,"Well, I guess if--"
1987.86-1743,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.297,2746.157,It's the same purpose.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2759.838,2787.146,"--I guess I'm getting caught in the dilemma that I was going to refer to earlier of the consideration of whether there is a State court right to have a procedural rule to eliminate congestion which passes constitutional muster in Pennsylvania as well as Federal Constitutional muster, both by this Court's denying certiorari in the Laudenberger opinion, and the Third Circuit's affirmance of that matter in Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania v. Supreme Court of Pennsylvania."
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2802.378,2808.211,Could Pennsylvania pass a rule that applies only to FELA cases?
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2808.211,2809.03,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2809.03,2811.273,"They couldn't do that, could they?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2811.273,2812.886,"No, I don't believe they could."
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2812.886,2813.907,No question about it.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2813.907,2820.8,"They have treated all cases over which they have jurisdiction alike, whether it's an FELA case or not."
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2825.745,2831.278,"So if they wanted to get to the FELA cases, all they'd have to do is pass a general statute."
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2831.278,2837.262,"That's correct, if they wanted to do that in Pennsylvania, they could pass a general statute."
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2839.153,2841.585,Do you think that Congress meant that?
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2841.585,2844.018,--My argument is what I have indicated--
1987.86-1743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2844.018,2847.46,Do you think Congress meant that?
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,2847.46,2849.249,--I think that Congress did not preclude it.
1987.86-1743,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3067.043,3074.198,"Well, the jury was not instructed that it had to make a reduction or that it had t calculate present worth."
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,3074.198,3074.597,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3086.917,3094.924,"Well, do you suppose that Dickerson requires at least that the jury be told they have to base damages on present worth?"
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,3094.924,3106.16,"Your Honor, the jury was told that their award would essentially have a reduced worth implication because of what the Court told them it was doing with regard to the use of the total offset method."
1987.86-1743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3324.206,3325.027,May I ask one question.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,3332.202,3333.324,The verdict was in 1981.
1987.86-1743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.324,3336.556,How much of the appellate proceedings were post-Pfeifer?
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,3336.556,3340.459,The Superior Court argument briefs were done before Pfeifer.
1987.86-1743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3343.481,3343.812,Were post-Pfeifer.
1987.86-1743,1,42833,thomas_hollander,,3343.812,3399.24,"Since there was a reduction to present worth, since there is equity and justice in prejudgment interest in any event, and since there is no violation of the Supremacy Clause, nothing that is done by the State Supreme Court in promulgating Rule 238 that is inconsistent with the FELA or with Congress' intent except by somebody's inference of what their silence was many years ago that has been honored reluctantly by Circuit Courts who have expounded in the very recent time in the Third Circuit, in the Ninth Circuit and in the Tenth Circuit and in the Fifth Circuit, that prejudgment interest ought to be allowed in these cases, and since there is no reason to exclude railroaders from the rest of the litigants in the Federal system who are entitled to have prejudgment interest, I ask this Court to dismiss the appeal or to affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court in its entirety."
1987.86-1743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3400.038,3401.791,"Thank you, Mr. Hollander."
1987.86-1743,2,38114,paul_a_manion,,3403.681,3428.619,"Your Honor, to answer Justice Stevens' last question, part of the delay in the appellate courts was that the Superior Court, on suggestion of counsel, delayed its decision or consideration pending Pfeifer which had been granted cert. So that about two years of it was because of Pfeifer because of the thought that it might have some impact."
1987.86-1743,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3546.952,3552.546,"Yes, but you'd have a one-way discount if you just used the table without any offset for inflation?"
1987.86-1743,2,38114,paul_a_manion,,3552.546,3553.537,"--Oh, no, Your Honor."
1987.86-1743,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3554.648,3556.601,"Of course, that wasn't really debated, was it?"
1987.86-1743,2,38114,paul_a_manion,,3556.601,3569.79,"--Well, Your Honor, it's clear that when one is projecting into the future, particularly in these cases, you take into account what the wage rates were for the last ten years, and what they might be into the future."
1987.86-1743,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3589.155,3593.318,"Thank you, Mr. Manion."
