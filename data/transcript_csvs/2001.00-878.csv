2001.00-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.233,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 00-878, Richard L. Mathias v. WorldCom Technologies."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,12.662,14.754,"Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,100.728,107.601,"Can I ask a very preliminary, quick, I hope... and I hope you'll have a conclusive answer."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,113.597,115.077,We--
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,115.077,116.114,You won on the merits.
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,116.114,116.553,--Yes.
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,116.553,117.015,All right.
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,134.526,135.98,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,135.98,138.044,And the reason they gave for our winning was wrong.
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,165.136,180.572,"Your Honor, I believe the conclusive answer is that our assertion that there was no jurisdiction over us and that we... if there was jurisdiction over us and over this cause of action, we are asserting immunity as a claim that we can bring regardless of the result on the merits."
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,180.572,184.012,And is there any precedent at all where that's ever happened before?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,184.012,187.499,"Your Honor, I cannot... I'm afraid I cannot cite you to any."
2001.00-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,192.746,198.89,Does the opinion below cause you some kind of continuing injury?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,198.89,234.238,"--Well, it does, Your Honor, in the sense that it is going to, if it stands, result in our continuing to be brought to Federal court, in spite of the immunity that we assert, and it is going to continue to place these cases in Federal court even though we believe that they are properly State court cases completely, and that our State court should have the opportunity to review these, to review all the matters that are raised, and to fulfill both their duty to apply State law and their obligation to consider whether their State law construction in any way is inconsistent with Federal law."
2001.00-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,234.238,250.078,"There's a patent case in 307 U.S. that says... where the lower court ruled both on infringement and on the validity of the patent, and the person who sought to... had won on one of them."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,255.58,258.339,"I appreciate that, Your Honor, and I will have a look."
2001.00-878,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,258.339,287.605,"Except, isn't it the ordinary rule that when... there may be a special consideration in that patent context, and maybe yours is also, but I had thought that reasons that went against the judgment winner do not get any kind of preclusive effect, so that you would not be bound by this jurisdictional holding which was against you."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,303.267,305.378,"I understand, Your Honor."
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,332.682,347.91,"--Your injury results at least in a formal sense from the fact that, in order to get the review which the companies sought, they made your State regulators defendants in a case, is that correct?"
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,347.91,355.576,"They subjected them to... the individual commissioners to suit and made them defend their rule, yes, sir."
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,355.576,370.619,But the essence of what they were... the essence of what the companies were claiming was not some kind of right asserted against the State as a sovereign entity or against these regulators in official or individual capacity.
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,386.702,389.076,"Your Honor, I think it does so for two reasons."
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,397.895,418.3,"Well, but that's... anyone who loses a case has been injured by the actions of the judge who made a mistake of law, or by the regulator in a regulatory case, so that in itself doesn't take it out of the usual attempt simply to get review of a judicial or a quasi-judicial decision that you say is wrong."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,418.3,424.812,"That's correct, Your Honor, but the result... the other thing that the complaint does is, it names the individual commissioners as defendants."
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,435.463,436.614,But that's a formality.
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,471.887,473.326,"Your Honor, we believe it does."
2001.00-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.615,506.072,Is it your position that the private parties could have brought the case to the district court without naming the commission?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,506.072,510.072,"Your Honor, not in this interpretation case, no."
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,519.562,532.445,"But does that, again, put you in any different position from a State commission in a run-of-the-mill utilities case, even within... let's say just within the State system, to keep it simple?"
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,566.863,594.103,"Your Honor, given the fact that this was a Federal court reviewing a State proceeding, we might well have been able to be heard if the district judge had allowed us in, and again, as I indicated... and I believe this is still in response to the question... it has turned out that because the district court agreed with us, nothing has happened to us that doesn't happen to us in State court when our decisions are affirmed."
2001.00-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,722.737,725.784,Where do we find section 252 in the briefs?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,725.784,737.339,"--Your Honor, if you take a look at the blue brief in... we've attached both sections 251 and 252 as an appendix, and 252 starts at page 12a of that appendix."
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.339,782.381,"Suppose that you're in the State court and you've won, and they've sued you in the State court, and then suppose that their claim is the following, the agreement as interpreted by the commission does not meet the requirements of section 251, including the regulations prescribed in the FCC pursuant to section 251, and then the judge asks you this question: Counsel, where is the law that says it has to meet the requirements of section 251, including the regulations prescribed by the FCC pursuant to section 251?"
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,784.77,802.519,"Your Honor, if we're talking about an interpretation case, the answer is essentially a combination of State law, which now makes compliance with Federal law, with the act, a requirement, and the general requirement that in any case that a State court hears, it not contravene Federal law."
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,803.686,805.226,It's not in 252?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,805.226,808.097,"--No, Your Honor, it's not, if we are talking about an interpretation."
2001.00-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.749,848.568,"Are you saying that in a post determination interpretation case, that the commission doesn't look to 251 and 252, it can't look there?"
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,848.568,873.44,"It... well, Your Honor, interestingly enough, in this case it can't, because this was... the provisions that deal with reciprocal compensation in this case were negotiated, and they're not required to comply with the act, but even in a case where there had been an arbitration, and where there was an issue with respect to that, I believe that certainly the commission... certainly the court could look to Federal law and see if there was anything that didn't comply with 251 and 252."
2001.00-878,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.44,884.515,"I mean, it's just a very odd concept that the State commission launches this vehicle having looked at the Federal law, and then subsequent interpretation doesn't involve Federal law."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,885.785,895.828,"I think the interpretation will involve Federal law in many instances, Your Honor, but the interpretation cases are going to be driven by State law, and this case is another good example of that."
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,911.863,913.493,What if they had decided that it did?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,923.66,926.796,--Then I think that they would have to construe it differently.
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,927.617,929.816,How can you construe it differently?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,931.031,932.813,"--Well, they cannot... they are--"
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,932.813,936.021,"So then they're not doing construction any more, they're doing application of Federal law."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,936.021,948.488,"--I think, Your Honor, in that instance, if they wanted... if the contract could survive, what they would do is, they would say the Federal law superseded whatever State contract principle they applied in construing it in the first place."
2001.00-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,948.488,950.871,"Well, there isn't any Federal law of contracts."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,958.48,959.319,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,960.877,984.757,"And if they came to that conclusion, that although they construe the law of contracts to have reading A, nonetheless reading A violates or does not violate the Federal statute, do you still maintain there is no Federal jurisdiction to review that, neither under the provision at issue in this case nor under 1331?"
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,984.757,986.548,"--We do maintain that, Your Honor."
2001.00-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.548,988.763,Even though it's no longer an interpretation question?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1001.204,1001.61,Yes--
2001.00-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.61,1002.048,--under 1331?
2001.00-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.048,1009.257,"Well, it seems to me your position on 252 and in response to your question from Justice... is very likely well-taken."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1014.559,1021.096,"--Well, Your Honor, with respect to section 1331, we start our analysis back at section 252."
2001.00-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.925,1073.711,"But you're relying on silence regarding interpretation, and in the hypothesis we were just discussing, it was no longer an interpretive question."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1084.784,1086.687,"Yes, Your Honor--"
2001.00-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1086.687,1098.863,"You say they have to move to that second question, and if they do, they just override their interpretation, but that's no longer an interpretive question, it seems to me, at that point, so your distinguishing of section 252 doesn't--"
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1098.863,1106.108,"--Your Honor, I... it is no longer an interpretive question, but the proceeding is still an interpretive proceeding."
2001.00-878,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1150.182,1173.941,"--But it suggests there's a large lacuna between the approval process and the interpretation process, which is... you know, I can understand how you can construe 252 that way, but I think you have to read 252 as precluding 1331 jurisdiction, and I think that's a more difficult question."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1173.941,1176.86,"It is more difficult, Your Honor, but I believe that that's what it does."
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1177.611,1209.658,"Isn't it... isn't the difficulty this, that... I mean, we don't lightly imply a negative on 1331 jurisdiction, and it's perfectly possible to read the sentence in subsection (6) as simply saying, whatever the State commission may do in applying these two sections gets Federal court review, and going no further than simply to make it clear that you do get Federal court review of it, in effect as a regulatory matter."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1215.7,1226.237,"--Your Honor, I believe that to read it that way and then... and to include interpretation, enforcement proceedings under it would essentially read the words under 252 under the statute."
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1287.976,1289.326,"Well, approvals, agreements and arbitration."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1291.341,1291.803,Yes.
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.803,1292.177,Yes.
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1292.177,1292.639,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-878,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1292.639,1308.948,"And did you say... did I understand you correctly to say that if this particular issue had come up at the time of approval, then there would be Federal court review, so if something... the character of the issue has nothing to do with it."
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1320.719,1321.926,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2001.00-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.345,1386.576,"Yes, but in an ordinary private contract, if the State court refuses to enforce the contract, let's say on the ground that it would be a contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and thus violate the Sherman Act, you would be able to get review of that determination in Federal court, wouldn't you?"
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1405.678,1421.907,"Your Honor, my belief is that if a State court invalidated a contract on Federal grounds, appeal would be to the State appellate court, and the Federal court that would be able to review that determination if it was wrong is this Court, so there is always going to be a Federal court that can determine that."
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1424.706,1426.849,We can review it because there is a Federal question involved--
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1426.849,1428.151,--If that were--
2001.00-878,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1428.151,1430.798,--but for purposes of 1331 there's no Federal question involved?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1430.798,1462.409,"--For purposes of 1331, there may be Federal issues involved, but we believe that there is a specific congressional intent, reflected in the specificity of 252... you can look at it as silence, or you can look at it as specificity... in the specificity of 252 to have these matters litigated in State court, and again I would cite Jackson Transit for the proposition that whether there is an arising under question under 1331 does not mean you still don't look to the question of where the contracts are litigated."
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1465.953,1477.397,Why--
2001.00-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.397,1478.452,--Let's assume we can--
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1478.452,1481.291,--Why would they?
2001.00-878,0,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,1481.291,1482.433,I'm sorry.
2001.00-878,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.433,1484.576,"I mean, you know in order to--"
2001.00-878,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1484.576,1484.576,"--That's my question, too."
2001.00-878,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1637.218,1652.27,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over cases contending that a State public utility commission has construed and enforced an interconnection agreement in a manner contrary to Federal law."
2001.00-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1659.119,1672.77,"Well, let's look specifically at 252, and 252(6), where it says in any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, and all the section talks about is approval."
2001.00-878,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1672.77,1679.98,"--Well, Your Honor, the section establishes specific procedures to be followed at the arbitration and approval stage."
2001.00-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.98,1684.772,"But it talks only about... you agree, don't you, that it... substantively it deals only with the approval?"
2001.00-878,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1684.772,1690.26,"That's correct, but these agreements exist only by virtue of section 252."
2001.00-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.124,1703.947,But all it talks about is approval.
2001.00-878,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1706.45,1713.3,"--No, it doesn't speak specifically about interpretation and enforcement."
2001.00-878,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.3,1714.994,Speak specifically or any other way about it.
2001.00-878,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1714.994,1730.014,"But this Court said in the Ardestani case, for example, that under a statutory provision means subject to or by authority of, and State commissions are acting by authority of section 252 when they're construing and enforcing interconnection agreements."
2001.00-878,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1732.613,1735.564,"Well, Ms.-- --Do they have authority under State law to do that?"
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2543.844,2583.221,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The complaint that Ameritech filed in this case in Federal court specifically alleged not only that the ICC had misinterpreted the interconnection agreements at issue, but also that its order requiring payment of reciprocal compensation for a particular category of calls violated several specific sections of the Telecommunications Act as well as several allegedly applicable FCC rulings."
2001.00-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2660.789,2667.886,"Before you get into that, you're separating interpretation of the contract from violation of the Federal law."
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2667.886,2668.524,"--Yes, sir."
2001.00-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.524,2671.963,Does that mean the State still has control over what the contract means?
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2680.941,2686.096,"Certainly it ought to be done by virtue of some analysis of the intent of the parties, if it's a negotiated agreement."
2001.00-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.88,2693.279,"Yes, but different States have different approaches."
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2706.626,2737.507,"--Well, Congress, Your Honor, very specifically turns over responsibility for developing these contracts, reviewing them, to State commissions, and in the process of doing that says that while the State commissions have to follow various substantive standards in 251, they also are authorized in more than one place in the act to impose their own policies that are not inconsistent with the Federal policies, and it also said the parties can negotiate agreements notwithstanding the substantive provisions of the act, and that the State commission can't overturn them unless they find that they violate the public interest and necessity."
2001.00-878,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2792.147,2801.845,"What if you have a case in which one of the arguments made by one of the parties is that if you interpret the contract this way, it will violate the Federal act?"
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2806.172,2807.603,"--I see that as a Federal question, Your Honor."
2001.00-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.323,2824.89,"Well, I mean, interpretation is barred?"
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2832.675,2843.125,"Their claim was that even if that is what the parties intended, that Federal law had evolved to the point where that was preempted by Congress, or by the FCC."
2001.00-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.125,2845.804,I just don't understand how you play that game.
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2877.189,2882.453,I'm not sure I really meant to say that every case becomes a Federal case.
2001.00-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2914.444,2914.794,Okay.
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2914.794,2926.277,"But if they're merely looking at the intent, there will be lots of situations where there isn't any Federal preemption because the law, after all, says if you negotiate it, the substantive provisions of 251 don't apply."
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2940.569,2942.648,And it could not be appealed in the Federal court?
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2942.648,2946.983,"Unless there was some odd situation involving diversity, my sense is... my understanding is--"
2001.00-878,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.983,2960.299,"Well, I guess the claim would be, look, the very contract that you're interpreting is a contract which is authorized, and authorized only by Federal law, and that's enough to get us into Federal court, and you reject that position."
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2960.299,2973.078,"--Our position, Your Honor, is that under Jackson Transit, that the fact that the Federal statute requires that a contract exists but doesn't specify the terms of the contract, in that situation the contract itself remains a matter of State law."
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2973.078,2978.542,"Well, aren't we slightly outside of that situation, because there are some Federal standards here, aren't there?"
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2978.542,2982.021,"Well, actually, as to negotiated contracts, the Federal standards--"
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2982.021,2983.396,They can be--
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2983.396,2983.698,"--are very, very loose."
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2983.698,2984.334,--I see.
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2984.334,2989.846,"It has to either be discriminatory or a violation of public interest, which is... and the specific rules of 251 don't apply."
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2989.846,2995.287,Is public interest a State concept or a Federal concept?
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2995.287,2998.526,I would view that as something that is authorizing the State commission to--
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2998.526,2999.908,It has to be State on your--
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2999.908,3006.093,"--to apply its... no, obviously, they can look at Federal policies if they want to, but I wouldn't suggest that it's inherently Federal in the way that the Solicitor General does."
2001.00-878,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3043.252,3047.748,"--That issue we've been wrestling with for 100 years exists in one of these cases, doesn't it?"
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3051.723,3054.002,"Well, there have been assertions, Your Honor, that that's the case."
2001.00-878,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3143.149,3145.62,"You think the commission is a necessary party, then?"
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3145.62,3158.103,"It's our position that they are a necessary party, but to use the technical term under the Federal rules, if there was a reason why they can't be sued and that the case can't go forward, then they may not be an indispensable party."
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3162.044,3174.031,"If that's the case, then, it says we've got an unusual action here, because we're talking about parties who have no personal or even official interest except as interpreters of law."
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3174.031,3188.363,"--That's true, Your Honor, but what makes them a necessary party is that the private parties have an interest in having the administrative body that has told them to do X be bound by a ruling from the Federal court which they're trying to get which says don't do X, do Y, and that--"
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3188.363,3195.9,You're in effect saying that they might dispute the application of the Supremacy Clause.
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3196.338,3204.131,--And the reason why a Federal district court is not named as a defendant in the court of appeals is because the court of appeals has the power in a unitary system to direct the district court to do something.
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3205.946,3213.155,"--Yes, but the State court is not named as a party when a case gets from a State supreme court on a Federal question here."
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3213.155,3214.097,"--Right, but I think--"
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3214.097,3228.389,"It's assumed that they will respect the Supremacy Clause if there is a Federal declaration of law, and why shouldn't the same assumption govern if there is Federal review of a State order on, in effect, a Federal question jurisdiction basis?"
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3228.389,3246.514,"--It may be factually true that most of the time State commissions will obey Federal courts, but 100 years of jurisprudence under Ex parte Young and before all follow the Federal administrative model and say that as to Federal... State executive officials, when they violate Federal law, that you name them as a defendant."
2001.00-878,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3246.514,3247.272,"Oh, I agree."
2001.00-878,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3268.845,3285.249,"Well, Your Honor, though, the... a large number of these Ex parte Young cases, going back to the Reagan v. Farmer's Loan case that Ms. McDowell mentioned, an Ex parte Young, cases involving rate-making commissions, railroad commissions and others that are... have always been named as the defendants."
2001.00-878,3,29179,joel_d_bertocchi,,3454.418,3458.97,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.00-878,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3617.121,3617.517,"Thank you, Mr. Bertocchi."
