1972.71-496,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.741,"Your argument is next in 71496, Ward against the Village of Monroeville."
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,38.119,42.311,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,468.36,471.013,Does the record show what the mayor's salary was?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,471.013,472.523,"No, it does not."
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,482.535,486.409,But now the salary is a matter of a local decision as it is not determined by state law?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,486.409,486.633,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.442,490.791,And it'd probably be to the few hundred dollars in a village like this one.
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,490.791,492.694,I would imagine.
1972.71-496,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,516.65,526.436,"Well, Mr. Berkman, doesn't it have to be true of almost any none lawyer traffic judge you go regardless of whether he has some executive position (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,526.436,528.318,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think you're quite right."
1972.71-496,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,556.615,558.12,I need to be sure I understand you.
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,567.948,570.37,That is not our -- our particular consideration.
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.872,603.847,"Did you have a right, an unrestricted right (Inaudible)"
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,603.847,622.049,"Well, I think that it is now clear that under the 1970 amendments at least which followed the -- the case as it was tried initially, by some two years, now that there is under Section 1905 --"
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.049,623.71,But was there at the time?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,623.71,625.029,I think not.
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.903,639.791,Let's assume there was for the moment.
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,639.791,641.156,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.156,653.652,"That there could have been an appeal in this connection (Inaudible) de novo trial, though what was the -- what's the -- what's the first trial having the most significance later in this trial."
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,653.652,654.102,Yes.
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,654.102,655.713,Would that be de minimis to your case?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,655.713,666.019,We think that it would not make any difference because of the fact that we contend that it is not necessary or condition to proceed to go through an unconstitutional trial in order to get a constitutional one.
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,670.248,677.996,You want to say that all of these traffic enforcement (Inaudible) it has to be on constitutional trial.
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,677.996,679.108,We think that the --
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.108,681.514,That would withstand all -- all kinds of questions?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,681.514,696.315,"Well, I don't think we need to stretch that far, Mr. Justice White, because so far as we are concerned, at least in these kinds of cases, the bare minimal amount of due process, and we know that in different kinds of circumstances, this Court has applied different standards of -- of due process."
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.705,725.565,How much of the fine have there been in this case?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,725.565,727.175,"In this case, the maximum was imposed."
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,729.04,732.329,Could you have -- could it have been transferred to another court?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,732.329,751.442,"As a matter of fact, it could not because under -- under the -- the rule, if the fine exceeds $50, then and under those circumstances, the individual who is on trial is entitled to a trial by jury in a court of record in as much as --"
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.442,753.185,Could be fined $50 or more than that?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,753.185,754.452,Yes.
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.452,755.935,"And here, it couldn't more than that."
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,755.935,756.492,That's right.
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,758.66,761.124,The Court - it could be the County Court?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,761.124,769.144,The -- the court said they have current jurisdiction which are courts of record in Ohio municipal court and the county court set up incidentally --
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,769.144,770.684,-- were created back in the ‘50s right?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,770.684,776.589,"Back in 1957, as a result of the -- the legislative --"
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,776.589,777.286,Abolition of the (Inaudible)
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,777.286,779.341,"The abolition of the Justice of Peace Courts, Your Honor."
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,779.341,784.699,And then -- and would there be a municipal court with jurisdiction over Monroeville?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,784.699,790.94,"I think not, but the county courts have jurisdiction where -- where the municipal courts do not."
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,790.94,807.196,"Now, while I interrupted you, may I ask if I'm right in my understanding that this is a -- this system is not in anyway peculiar to Monroeville, Ohio but it would be as a situation to be found in all of the non-chartered, incorporated villages throughout the State, isn't it?"
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,807.196,807.382,Yes.
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,810.541,811.771,And there hundreds of such villages.
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,811.771,816.925,"-- and there, I would imagine, hundreds of -- of such mayoral courts."
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,841.433,848.062,"But again, their -- their power to punish is limited even for a violation of those state laws, isn't it?"
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,848.062,853.509,To the extent that the accused actually has a right to and seeks a jury trial.
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.585,866.781,"But well, a limited power to punish."
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,867.916,869.541,"No, I -- I find those such --"
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,869.541,870.225,Should a village (Voice Overlap) --
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,870.225,872.872,-- no such --
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,872.872,874.369,I fine somebody for manslaughter?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,874.369,883.091,I find no such statutory limitation and desire contention that traffic manslaughter is indeed within the jurisdiction of the Court if the accused does not signature a trial.
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.091,888.803,(Inaudible) put people in jail.
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,888.803,889.594,I think he can.
1972.71-496,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,994.715,1000.306,Would it violate due process if you had judges appointed by the mayor?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1000.306,1011.995,"Judges appointed by the mayor, I think that it might not violate due process under such circumstances so long as the judge takes a note and -- and performs as -- as officer."
1972.71-496,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1011.995,1018.491,What if -- what if the mayor had appointed the judges under those statutes to serve at the pleasure of the mayor?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1018.491,1027.724,"Well, I think we might run into a question depending upon the entire aggregate of circumstances under those concerned."
1972.71-496,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1027.724,1031.738,But what you want is some other person.
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1031.738,1034.265,"Yeah, it seems to us that we are asking too much."
1972.71-496,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1034.265,1037.266,"Judicial officer, whether he is a lawyer or not."
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1037.266,1038.31,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-496,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.783,1066.956,Is this -- is this scheme the same one that we had here in both Tumey and in Dugan?
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1066.956,1086.052,"Well, I think that the -- the situation has changed, insofar as the statutes are concerned with respect to Tumey, and since that time the jurisdiction of the -- of the mayor's court has been whittled away so that it no longer involves countywide jurisdiction as I've indicated in response and answer to that."
1972.71-496,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1086.052,1092.54,And no longer I got it from what you said earlier that the mayor gets paid part of his compensation from the fines.
1972.71-496,0,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,1092.54,1092.768,Right.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1589.157,1591.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-496,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1658.725,1661.265,"Now, you've got to sort it out."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1669.718,1678.833,He could not in his first case because he brought in a stenographer and what I'll call a second case where he did not bring one in and simply --
1972.71-496,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1678.833,1680.472,The second case was the other related --
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1680.472,1682.469,That was a fear to produce a driver's license.
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1692.729,1694.835,What's the difference between the (Inaudible)
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1694.835,1697.51,"Well, what happened Mr. Justice White --"
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.51,1701.464,What's the difference in the rule when you say he had a (Inaudible) stenographer.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1701.464,1715.478,"The rule was that if you bring in a court reporter and the testimony and the written evidence is reduced to a writings when you appeal from the mayor's court, you only get a review of the questions of law."
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.598,1746.801,One of these questions involved (Inaudible) sufficiency of the evidence.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1746.801,1747.402,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.402,1749.648,It is there to take the evidence over again that's all.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1749.648,1750.757,That's correct.
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.757,1751.799,I see.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1751.799,1753.148,But to go back to --
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.148,1756.294,And you say that's true also now since 1970?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1756.294,1766.574,"This was true then, and as I say, I would hesitate to differ with any interpretation with our practice in county courts and municipal courts as well as mayor's courts in the -- in the surrounding communities."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1768.546,1773.018,There was a change in the law in 1970 but you say -- and this reflects us that the law is the same.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1773.018,1773.522,It's the same.
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1793.358,1806.276,"So while the -- while the 1970 law does talk about a trial de novo, you are telling us that when in fact you had a stenographer in the mayor's court, it may not be a trial de novo."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1806.276,1808.088,It was not a trial de novo.
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1808.088,1810.678,Even though -- even though the legislature is calling that.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1810.678,1820.761,"Well, the provisions if you -- they're -- they're now, unfortunately set up (Inaudible) that if you read the provisions as the way it worked out and that's in our practice, that's the way it was."
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.761,1826.514,What does the Court of Appeals do in (Inaudible)
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1826.514,1830.545,"Yeah, it's an appeal, Mr. Justice White."
1972.71-496,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1849.515,1855.248,"No, no, the question is when is it transferred as you say was in the first case?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1860.624,1861.078,I see.
1972.71-496,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1867.346,1870.013,(Inaudible)
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1870.013,1870.74,"No, it's not a new trial."
1972.71-496,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1875.181,1883.139,"(Inaudible) sufficiency of the evidence, you have to know what the facts are and it's a fact they disputed."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1887.181,1888.867,"In that case, I think you would have to."
1972.71-496,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1888.867,1890.299,"(Voice overlap) de Novo trial, isn't it?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1890.299,1892.644,"No, not when there's a transcript."
1972.71-496,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1892.644,1899.34,Do you know whether they have developed any clearly erroneous type of rule or -- do you know --
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1899.34,1902.445,None to my knowledge
1972.71-496,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.445,1916.061,"Mr. Eckstein what are the -- you -- you mentioned the tactical decision that the litigant faces in deciding whether or not to bring a stenographer, whether to the mayor's court, what sort of tactical considerations would lead him to bring a stenographer with?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1916.061,1935.265,"Well, if he felt that he would not get a favorable decision in that particular mayor's court, he could bring in a stenographer to preserve a record so that he could go to the -- to the county court and perhaps -- and perhaps did a very minimal effort in terms of time, isn't just written briefs, perhaps, could get a reversal."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1939.01,1950.615,"Well, there might be another reason again to the argument we heard earlier today in this antitrust case just the presence of the stenographer might lead to a fairer trial by the mayor, would it not?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1950.615,1954.553,I think that that could be a possible consideration.
1972.71-496,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1954.553,1966.905,"If you have a trial de novo, may the judge in the court have rendered -- or the jury imposing higher sentence or a more severe sentence?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1966.905,1971.123,"No, they would not be able to, and in this case, the maximum fine would have been $50."
1972.71-496,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1976.798,1984.35,"Tell me, Mr. Eckstein, if Mr. Ward fails on this appeal, would he have an opportunity for trial de novo?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1984.35,1985.939,"No, not under a higher law."
1972.71-496,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1990.549,1992.854,"Well, how about on the second offense was that before us?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,1992.854,2002.76,"Well, that has been -- that has been merged into the second offense and the failure to ask for a -- a complete retrial for facts in that case, in my estimation would have waived the right."
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2005.022,2011.754,What is it -- your view of the difference between the trial de novo and in the field?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2011.754,2033.253,"Well, as we view it in -- in the case of mayor's courts, an appeal would only be where you have the transcripts and the question would be a question to whether or not the law had been properly applied to the facts as they appear in the transcript, whereas, trial de novo, as we understand it, is a complete retrial as to an introduction of evidence and everything else."
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.253,2038.613,It is an anomaly of appeal from a non-judicial officer?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2038.613,2047.82,"All I can say, Mr. Justice, is that I believe that the legislature in weighing to keep this court system wanted to provide every protection they recently could and still keep the system."
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2105.627,2109.992,And now you said that over badly if you might have done what was right.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2109.992,2120.427,"Well, the point -- the point was, Mr. Justice that once that the county court judge returned the case to him, he felt obligated to go forward under -- under Ohio law."
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2120.427,2121.362,Why?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2121.362,2134.673,"Well, the county court did not have original jurisdiction in that instance to -- to hear that case, because of the fact that the fine was less than $50, and the basis for the -- the motion in the county court judge's opinion was not well-taken."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.273,2146.099,"What -- what is the basis -- were a valid basis i.e., let's just say that there was a personal prejudice part of the mayor."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2151.946,2162.849,"I don't see how they could have done other than have the -- have a substitute county court judge hear the case because I can't -- I've -- I've not personally had that experience, but I don't see how they did appoint a mayor --"
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.849,2164.869,Why would they have to have a substitute judge?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2168.109,2170.139,"Well, I -- under the system, I'll tell you that's --"
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.139,2173.314,"Because the mayor wasn't a lawyer, he wasn't a judge."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2181.244,2183.139,"Well, I think that --"
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.139,2184.093,Or any other civilian.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2184.093,2191.406,"Let's open to question, possibly the president of council, who assumes the role of mayor when the mayor is out of town or resigns, perhaps --"
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.406,2198.457,"Or the head of the -- the doctor, the head of the hospital or some obstetrician."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2198.457,2201.175,"That's -- that's a question I simply can't answer, I'm sorry."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2201.175,2202.314,It's not clear under the Ohio law.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2202.314,2203.081,Yeah.
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2203.081,2207.05,But because you suggest in your brief that he could have filed then.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2207.05,2210.066,My -- my suggestion was that he should have based it on other facts.
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.066,2214.052,"All right, but if he had, and if that had been valid, now my question is, “What would have happened?”"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2214.052,2214.479,Yeah.
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2214.479,2215.277,And you don't know the answer.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2215.587,2223.446,"In this case, I don't see how it -- how it could have been other than a county court judge, but possibly, it could have appointed the president of the council, let's say."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2223.446,2229.016,"Because in this case, the county court judge probably said, “I have no jurisdiction of this case, even though the mayor had disqualified himself.”"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2229.982,2232.741,"Yeah, that's right."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2269.468,2271.815,"So, this mayor, you're telling us, gets no salary at all?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2271.815,2275.818,"He received a couple of hundred dollars a year and as a footnote, he was right."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2298.443,2300.366,Does the record show what the population of Monroeville village?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2300.366,2303.254,"It has a population of 1300, Your Honor."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2303.254,2304.113,It's on Huron County.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2304.113,2305.203,Huron County.
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2358.713,2363.473,"Are you gone to distinguish all of these, you're talking about in Tumey?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2363.473,2364.639,"I think so, Your Honor."
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2414.363,2423.164,(Inaudible)
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2423.164,2425.652,"I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question."
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.652,2439.315,The fact that they can get the (Inaudible) a new trial does not interfere with some people consider it to be a right to be tried by impartial judicial officer.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2439.315,2443.439,"Well, I would simply like to suggest, Your Honor that --"
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2443.439,2446.202,"Well, this man is not a judicial officer, is he?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2446.202,2453.939,"He does have a limited judicial function just as he has a limited executive function, just as he has a limited legislative function, believe it or not."
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2453.939,2456.358,Could this man be an officer obstetrician?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2456.358,2459.065,He sure could.
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2462.604,2465.183,"Well, could be the magistrate be a truck driver?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2465.183,2466.17,Yes.
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.17,2467.092,This magistrate was.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2467.092,2469.999,"Yes, he was, in fact."
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.999,2473.703,And that's the new impartial judicial officer?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2473.703,2474.789,"Well, Your Honor, I would like to --"
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2474.789,2476.451,Yes or no?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2476.451,2486.283,"In this particular instance, I would say that -- that the man was -- was partial, because of -- of a lot of things that got into newspapers over the sixth-month waiting period."
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2488.084,2493.813,"Well, I'm saying without anything to do with this case or anything."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2499.051,2501.818,I don't see why he couldn't be just as impartial as a man --
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.818,2504.961,Is that your idea of what it is?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2508.839,2515.129,I can't say but what -- that he could be as impartial as -- as a lawyer could be.
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2515.129,2520.542,(Inaudible)
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2520.542,2523.406,With -- within the limited judicial function I think so.
1972.71-496,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2523.406,2528.048,(Inaudible)
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.048,2532.075,"In any event, he was elected by the voters of Monroeville, wasn't -- was he not to this period?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2532.075,2541.127,"Yes, he was, and all I want to -- would like to point out is that he does not have -- he doesn't have -- the mayor doesn't have the power to levy taxes."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2700.651,2705.233,"I don't understand -- I don't understand, Mr. Berkman, to be making that argument."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2711.072,2711.605,Well --
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2711.605,2716.688,"But you know, I think that the system may in some cases grant very, very fair trials."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2716.688,2717.077,"Well, it was --"
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2717.077,2721.097,"In other cases, unfair trials but that the system itself is constitutionally invalid."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2721.253,2721.824,Yeah.
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2747.755,2754.853,"As I understand it, you can't tell us what, under the law of Ohio would have happened, if the mayor had said, “Yes, you're right I am prejudiced."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2755.323,2764.951,"I, with my limited experience, Your Honor, all I can say was I would presume it would be tried by a county court judge or that -- appointed for that special purpose so they'd appoint some other civilian."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2764.951,2767.824,"But you know that the law is not clear, as I understand it."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2767.824,2777.252,"There is no provision in the laws, I -- as I have read it to say who must then take this spot of the mayor."
1972.71-496,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2826.55,2839.304,"Well, couldn't you elect a local village judge or a magistrate if you want to call him that, the same way they elect the mayor in the city council and at the same time with no great burden?"
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2839.304,2846.312,"If -- depending on the holding of this Court and a change in the state law as you could, Your Honor, but not under the existing laws."
1972.71-496,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2846.312,2847.927,I wasn't speaking on the existing law.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2855.265,2864.264,I was assuming that if the mayor's court system per se is held to be unconstitutional that people would have to go immediately to a county court for relief in the municipal court.
1972.71-496,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2864.264,2867.727,Until some other program were set up.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2867.727,2870.127,Depending on the grounds for the holding of course.
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2870.127,2872.285,How many county judges are there in Huron County?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2872.285,2874.42,"Believe it or not, there are only two, Your Honor."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2876.232,2877.548,"No, I know."
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2880.201,2884.784,"No, the court has held in Willard, Ohio where I practice, a town of about 6,000."
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2890.039,2892.38,And only day time sessions?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2892.38,2895.06,And these judges hold court during the day time.
1972.71-496,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2895.06,2896.19,And not at all at night?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2896.19,2898.931,No.
1972.71-496,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2898.931,2904.243,How does the Village of Monroeville get its legal advice on a --
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2904.243,2905.46,"Well, I would like to say --"
1972.71-496,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2905.46,2906.613,Any basis?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,2909.53,2912.469,"No, this is provided in state -- state law."
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.982,3094.797,(Inaudible) proceeding them and that is required substantial reports with --
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,3094.797,3095.434,No.
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.434,3097.347,And that -- these convictions should be reversed?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,3097.347,3103.863,"No, I think that if the defendant had filed an affidavit for prejudice and had cited facts to show the kind of --"
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.863,3111.116,(Inaudible) in great words that the mayor in this case had acted improperly.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,3111.116,3131.311,"I think that you can -- that if you look at the fact that the mayor lost his temper and first, I think on -- on the findings of fact, I think that he made, as far as the findings are concerned, I don't think the outcome would have been changed but that's not -- well, then I think the mayor losing his temper acted as -- not as a fair and impartial judicial officer."
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3131.311,3134.436,(Inaudible) in case you haven't investigate.
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,3134.436,3142.03,"No, not from having investigated, in a small town, when the newspaper picks up this kind of events and they're republished over six months."
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.057,3156.758,Was he -- was he responsible for the event?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,3156.758,3161.548,"No, he was not and the mayor -- the mayor is not in charge of police."
1972.71-496,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3181.98,3184.61,And who's responsible for bringing the charges?
1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,3184.61,3188.945,The charges are always brought by a policeman or by people who have witnessed events.

1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,3194.452,3196.277,"Well, I suppose so."

1972.71-496,1,23877,franklin_d_eckstein,,3210.529,3215.638,"I don't think that the mayor -- I -- I know a little of five times I represented, he can and he does."
1972.71-496,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3241.092,3242.02,Thank you Mr. Eckstein.
1972.71-496,2,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3243.702,3245.77,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-496,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3267.831,3270.475,"Well, what's it all about?"
1972.71-496,2,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3270.475,3278.485,There was apparently an altercation after the -- the attempt by the village constable to flag down the accused.
1972.71-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3319.002,3320.975,The mayor wasn't there.
1972.71-496,2,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3320.975,3321.645,I beg your pardon?
1972.71-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3321.645,3322.726,The mayor wasn't there.
1972.71-496,2,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3322.726,3323.838,The mayor was not there at that time.
1972.71-496,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3323.838,3325.575,He had nothing to do with them?
1972.71-496,2,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3325.575,3326.28,No.
1972.71-496,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.378,3367.715,But the facts were quite different with respect to in his salary and so on.
1972.71-496,2,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3367.715,3372.938,"Yes, I'm only talking about those particular aspects of his financial responsibility, which were an issue here."
1972.71-496,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3500.637,3505.836,You wouldn't expect us as a matter of due process to tell them what hours of the day.
1972.71-496,2,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3505.836,3506.206,Oh no.
1972.71-496,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3513.183,3524.113,Are you telling us that if the Court should hold that the mayor can't try a contested case as distinguished from a non-contested case that it will go to the county court?
1972.71-496,2,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3524.113,3527.042,"We are saying that there are a couple of alternatives, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.71-496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3546.876,3548.317,Thirty years after Tumey --
1972.71-496,2,17433,bernard_a_berkman,,3548.317,3548.895,Pardon?
1972.71-496,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3548.895,3551.417,"Thirty years after Tumey, they did that?"
