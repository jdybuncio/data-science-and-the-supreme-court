2004.04-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.26,"We'll hear argument now in No. 04-340, San Remo Hotel v. the City and County of San Francisco."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,13.835,14.443,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,27.101,35.216,"Well, what are your... exactly what claims are... is your client now raising in Federal court?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,44.862,53.532,My client is making a facial and as-applied takings challenge to both the hotel conversion ordinance and the regulatory scheme of which it is a part.
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,56.769,62.691,I somehow thought that your question had boiled down to whether there was issue preclusion here.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,63.467,66.799,--The issue before this Court is whether there's issue preclusion--
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,66.799,69.281,I'm talking about the issues in this Court.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,69.281,71.038,--Okay.
2004.04-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,83.623,95.764,"Well, as I understand, I... I would... I will grant you that there are moments in the... in the Ninth Circuit opinion in which there seems to be a shift back and forth in the rhetoric between claim preclusion and issue preclusion."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,126.45,130.195,The Ninth Circuit did limit its holding to issue preclusion.
2004.04-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,131.743,132.016,Okay.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,132.016,138.9,The other part of your question about whether it was based on factual determinations could not have been based on factual determinations.
2004.04-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.815,155.326,"Well, the Supreme Court of California decided only the State constitutional question, did it not?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,155.326,157.089,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.441,188.649,"Well, it was this Court's decision in the Williamson County case that led you and I assume other lawyers in these takings cases to return to State court and try to litigate everything."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,189.464,197.021,"--This Court in Williamson County said that before you could bring a Federal takings claim, you had to go to State court and seek compensation under State law."
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.021,201.916,"And you haven't asked us to revisit that Williamson County case, have you?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,201.916,205.368,We have not asked that this Court reconsider the decision in Williamson County.
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.368,206.433,Maybe you should have.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,206.433,210.209,"Well, at this point I don't think that we can."
2004.04-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.201,240.534,"Mr. Utrecht, you... you refer to the primacy of Federal courts."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,271.451,272.801,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2004.04-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.54,297.679,"So... so your case does not hinge on the fact that when the State court acted, there was a pending... a pending Federal case asking for the Federal constitutional question to be resolved by a Federal court."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,297.679,299.144,That's correct.
2004.04-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,324.669,339.407,"Is it your position that issue preclusion doesn't apply at all, or that there was no issue decided in the State court proceeding that carries over into the Federal proceeding?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,359.093,370.13,Our... our primary position is that issue preclusion does not apply for the same reasons that this Court found that issue preclusion did not apply in England when you were required to do two separate litigations.
2004.04-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,382.652,386.657,"And if it did... if it did apply, what issues would be precluded?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,386.657,406.186,"--In our position no issue should be precluded because under California law, which the Ninth Circuit was obligated to apply, only identical issues that are resolved under a different set of laws can be precluded in the second proceeding, and there was no identical issue finding by the Ninth Circuit."
2004.04-340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,427.132,429.281,Is... excuse me.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,431.943,432.896,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,432.896,442.613,"It... are... are you bound by a finding in the State court that there was no exaction, or was there no such finding?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,442.613,444.702,I don't believe there was such a finding.
2004.04-340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.107,458.844,Was the... was the Ninth Circuit wrong in indicating that there was no exaction?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,461.876,465.88,--I... I don't read the Ninth Circuit's opinion as saying there was no exaction.
2004.04-340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.373,500.104,"But... but the Ninth Circuit seemed to think that Dolan doesn't apply, and I take it that you would say that it does."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,500.104,509.246,"Well, I think this Court has not decided whether exactions imposed by legislation are treated differently than exactions imposed by administrative proceedings."
2004.04-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.831,537.093,"And you don't want us get that... to that question either, whether Dolan applies or not."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,537.093,544.311,"I did want this Court to get to that question, but when this Court rejected question 2, I think this Court decided that it did not want to get to that question."
2004.04-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,563.076,579.697,"Mr. Utrecht, if I understand the respondents' brief correctly, there is on pages 10 and 11 a whole list of issues that they say were determined... raised, litigated, and determined in the State court."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,608.355,616.696,I think that technically what the California Supreme Court decided was that our facts did not state a cause of action under State law.
2004.04-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,635.321,637.353,How did the case go up?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,639.009,648.961,"--The case in State court went up on a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the trial court, reversed by the State court of appeal, and then affirmed by the California Supreme Court."
2004.04-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,648.961,671.574,"So, in effect, then maybe... are you saying this, that there is no issue preclusion here because the... the ruling that there was no statement of a cause of action was, in fact, a disposition of the claim without there being any resolution of any fact issue upon which the claim might depend."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,677.955,680.253,That's not the argument that we made in this Court.
2004.04-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.976,726.646,But... but isn't there an essential step to find out that there were issues?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,747.187,751.06,--That would be a simple route to knocking out the case.
2004.04-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,756.78,759.851,What... what were the issues that the Ninth Circuit thought were decided?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,759.851,762.026,--I can't quite tell.
2004.04-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,783.013,787.914,"Well, issue preclusion does extend to questions of law, as well as fact."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,787.914,790.206,It does extend to questions of law.
2004.04-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.325,809.608,I thought they said that their... their compensation law was congruent with ours?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,809.608,812.95,The California Supreme Court did say that its compensation law--
2004.04-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.95,814.162,What do you... what do you think that means?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,814.162,821.472,--I think that means that the California Supreme Court would like to believe that its law is congruent with this Court's decisions.
2004.04-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,849.208,852.354,What do you understand the word congruent to mean?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,852.354,858.444,--I think congruent means that it's equivalent.
2004.04-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,866.481,871.984,What... what is the claim you want to make?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,946.457,949.749,I think that what's important is the very beginning of your question.
2004.04-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.957,954.121,I don't know if you said it.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,970.274,980.116,The California Supreme Court decided whether those legal propositions were relevant under the State constitution and the State compensation--
2004.04-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,980.116,981.231,I thought it decided a different thing.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,995.957,999.445,--And they made that decision under State law.
2004.04-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1000.757,1011.85,"Just as, suppose, for example, they had decided that the hotel clerk or the temporary manager did speak English, and in fact, he was a scholar of English."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1047.415,1063.535,"--In the hypothetical that Your Honor gave of a factual determination that the clerk spoke English well, that fact under the England case and under England's rationale would be subject to relitigation in Federal court in the Pullman context."
2004.04-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1080.06,1080.832,"No, but am I right?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1091.605,1093.283,--The factual claims--
2004.04-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1093.283,1093.864,Am I right about that?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1093.864,1094.63,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1100.379,1107.296,"Well, but is there precedent that what is reasonable for the State constitution is always reasonable for the Federal Constitution?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1107.296,1108.23,--That--
2004.04-340,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1108.23,1112.429,"I mean, this is somewhat different than simply a specific factual finding."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1112.429,1119.722,"--Well, in this particular case, they found that the facts that we alleged did not give rise to a right to compensation under State law."
2004.04-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.226,1178.72,May I interrupt?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1187.093,1188.802,"--No, I'm not saying that it was not made."
2004.04-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.683,1205.822,"Why... now, why should that not be binding on you if your allegations were, in fact, insufficient under Penn Central?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1205.822,1209.137,The court did not find that they were insufficient under Penn Central.
2004.04-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.57,1222.403,"Well, I can understand how you should be free to argue that in fact the two rules are not congruent, that there's broader recovery under the Federal system."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1230.486,1236.053,--Issue preclusion should not apply because it prevents the Federal courts from deciding the Federal takings questions.
2004.04-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.763,1244.162,"Yes, but... but it's just a conclusion from issues that have... have been resolved on which normally we would defer to the State court."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1245.856,1250.886,"--You shouldn't defer here because in Williamson County, you required that parties go through two litigations."
2004.04-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.886,1251.138,Right.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1251.138,1256.257,And all the rules of res judicata are designed to prevent two litigations and to require a single litigation.
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1266.177,1266.771,But it isn't--
2004.04-340,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.771,1267.332,That doesn't make sense.
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1267.332,1280.708,--It isn't clear from Williamson County that this Court envisioned two... two separate determinations of fact issues: one in State court and one in Federal.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1293.322,1294.835,--Correct.
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1294.835,1301.522,And I don't... I didn't understand it to set up parallel systems of factual determinations.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1301.522,1304.201,It clearly set up parallel systems of litigation.
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1316.777,1326.072,"Well, England was an abstention case and had to deal with the effect of 28 U.S. Code 1738, the Full Faith and Credit Act."
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1333.357,1334.698,--The England case--
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1334.698,1337.77,--as... as applied section 1738.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1337.77,1356.831,"--The England case held that when you're required to do two separate litigations, the first in State court and the second in Federal court as a result of Pullman abstention, that in the second case there would be no factual or legal issues that were decided in the State court that would be preclusive in deciding the Federal claims--"
2004.04-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1356.831,1357.113,My--
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1357.113,1360.547,This is not a... a Pullman abstention case here.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1360.547,1362.765,"--As it comes to this Court, it is not a Pullman abstention case."
2004.04-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1362.765,1363.118,No.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1363.118,1373.61,"It is a case where Williamson County has held that before you can bring your Federal takings claim, you must first go to State court and obtain a determination of whether you're entitled to compensation."
2004.04-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.61,1384.666,I don't think that Williamson County ever contemplated that you would have to take your case all the way to the supreme court of the State.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1390.627,1393.192,"I think that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2004.04-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1407.113,1418.445,Do you think Williamson County by its terms spoke of going to State court and... rather than just a State administrative proceeding?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1418.445,1426.562,"--As... as I read the Williamson County opinion, it says that you have to use the State procedures that are available to obtain compensation."
2004.04-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.845,1484.167,"If you... if you disagreed with the resolution of an issue by the State court, which issue would be determinative of your Federal claim, if we hold against you here?"
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1492.049,1493.495,No.
2004.04-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.495,1500.776,What... what strikes me as strange about this... this system is... is not leaving it to the State courts to make these decisions.
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1515.236,1517.14,I think that's exactly the problem.
2004.04-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1537.209,1543.562,Didn't you seek to reserve the Federal question in the... in the State court litigation?
2004.04-340,0,38400,paul_f_utrecht,,1543.562,1546.869,--We did reserve the Federal question in the State court litigation.
2004.04-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1549.118,1550.861,"Very well, Mr. Utrecht."
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1552.558,1562.024,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.225,1627.871,You say the courts below.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1634.067,1641.044,"Mr. Chief Justice, here I was referring to the district court and the Ninth Circuit following the California Supreme Court's decision."
2004.04-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1801.96,1804.525,"Well, I mean, they didn't really certify it."
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1804.525,1804.787,--No.
2004.04-340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1903.625,1913.21,Do you think it's open to us to reconsider aspects of Williamson County in this case?
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1913.21,1924.398,"--I don't think... well, I would have to take a very deep breath before I told the Court that it was not open to the Court to reconsider just about anything that touched on it."
2004.04-340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1925.186,1939.178,"It... frankly, it isn't clear to me that the Court ever contemplated just cutting off any determination in Federal court of takings claims in the way that it seems to work out by application of Williamson County."
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1939.178,1954.199,--Let me explain why I think it would be imprudent for the Court to resolve it and then explain why I think it's fair to say that the Court didn't consider one way or the other principles of preclusion in application of the Full Faith and Credit Act in Williamson County.
2004.04-340,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1954.199,1955.798,"Well, it's clear we didn't."
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1967.841,1979.306,"Well, I think it would be imprudent to decide... I... I think that the Court will have to elaborate on the Williamson County requirement and how the procedures work."
2004.04-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.723,2015.744,"Well, now, wait a minute."
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2023.894,2024.362,--No.
2004.04-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2054.413,2055.752,"Well, what--"
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2055.752,2056.179,--to Nollan and Dolan.
2004.04-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.452,2059.614,--What preclusion law do you apply?
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2064.469,2075.675,The... it's... the Full Faith and Credit Act requires that you... requires that you apply the preclusion law of the State that rendered the judgment to which--
2004.04-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2075.675,2077.312,Which would be California.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2077.312,2078.196,--Which would be California.
2004.04-340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2196.039,2196.793,"Mr. Waxman, can I ask you this question?"
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2213.313,2216.855,Issue preclusion or claim preclusion?
2004.04-340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.855,2217.348,Either one.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2217.348,2228.932,"I think the answer is there... if England... if the England decision were extended to the Williamson County context, there would not be claim preclusion."
2004.04-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.566,2243.615,"Of course, they could have come up here, though."
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2266.744,2268.481,"I... I don't... I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
2004.04-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2378.871,2381.876,Monterey... Monterey Dunes was from the United States district court.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2381.876,2386.459,"--Yes, because that was a case... that's the other one that I was thinking of this morning."
2004.04-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2574.467,2584.794,"Let's take a... may I... may I, in effect, approach it with a simpler example, which... which is not this case, but I... I just want to know how... how the... the systems work together."
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2674.002,2676.767,"At most... I mean, they could certainly make the argument."
2004.04-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2829.247,2829.82,"Well, was there an allegation--"
2004.04-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2829.82,2830.22,I guess in the--
2004.04-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2830.22,2838.36,--at any point here... was there an allegation at any point here that the State procedures were inadequate to protect property rights?
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2838.36,2839.727,"--No, to the contrary."
2004.04-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2852.578,2852.806,Well--
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2852.806,2853.029,They--
2004.04-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2853.029,2871.857,"Well, it's not so much that weren't appellate procedures, but that the procedures and the variance procedures and... and a multiplicity of agencies here were just so complex that it amounted to an... inadequate remedies to protect against a taking."
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2871.857,2876.244,--There have been absolutely no such allegations made in this case.
2004.04-340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3088.833,3093.246,But they said there was no litigation because it was just decided.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3096.438,3128.797,"Well, the... the California Supreme Court decision makes clear at page 113a of the petition appendix that it decided the takings claims, the substantially advance claims, on a demurrer and that they decided it, therefore, based on the factual allegations of the complaint, matters subject to judicial notice, of which there were many, and facts and circumstances that were not disputed."
2004.04-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3140.202,3141.879,--Decided but not litigated.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3148.72,3149.077,Well--
2004.04-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3149.077,3150.775,And his... he's arguing it was not.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3150.775,3164.393,--The... the issue of whether or not the hotel... whether or not the... San Francisco's hotel conversion ordinance was reasonably related to the city's objective was litigated with a vengeance.
2004.04-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3194.993,3203.371,"Tell me how that statement that you just made, fully litigated, squares with the fact that... I thought you said a moment ago it was decided on a demurrer."
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3203.371,3204.077,It's--
2004.04-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3204.077,3204.957,I'm... I'm confused here.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3204.957,3207.612,--It's the application of law to fact.
2004.04-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3210.611,3218.512,But you're... you're saying that the facts were... were independently developed before the demurrer was filed and granted?
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3218.512,3219.233,--Yes.
2004.04-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3223.51,3224.871,So it was not decided simply on pleadings.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3224.871,3226.085,--No.
2004.04-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3226.085,3226.612,Okay.
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3226.612,3228.095,"I mean, what the court--"
2004.04-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3228.095,3229.177,A demurrer--
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3229.177,3230.119,--I'm sorry.
2004.04-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3230.119,3234.156,"--A demurrer is decided on the pleadings, isn't it?"
2004.04-340,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3234.156,3248.786,"Well, it... what the court said... and I think this is a... what the California Supreme Court said at page... I think it was page 113a and they also reiterate this point at page 139a, footnote 12... is this is a demurrer."
2004.04-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3339.099,3341.129,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
