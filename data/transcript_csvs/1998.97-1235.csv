1998.97-1235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.789,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97 1235, the City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes, et cetera."
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,13.074,13.391,Yes.
1998.97-1235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.254,85.337,Five times.
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,85.337,87.206,"It did so, Your Honor."
1998.97-1235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,98.664,101.282,"This was the fifth plan presented, right?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,105.75,111.237,"The initial rejections were for density, and the fifth one was rejected down for two reasons only."
1998.97-1235,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,119.843,120.593,"And this is typical, you say?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,120.593,123.129,It is typical in this kind of complex.
1998.97-1235,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,124.481,135.52,"Well, in asking whether the decision in question was reasonable, the history of the zoning and the previous attempts are relevant, are they not, in determining the reasonableness of the city's action?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,135.52,148.429,"I submit that the issue is not the reasonableness of the city's action, but rather the issue is whether, in fact, the city's action in the first instance bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate goal."
1998.97-1235,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,148.429,155.5,"Well, could you... suppose you told the jury, the issue for you to decide is, was the decision based on reason?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,160.67,163.356,I believe that that is two different questions.
1998.97-1235,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,163.356,165.122,"Well, that was your argument to the jury."
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,166.908,177.366,"I submit that the question presented to the jury in the instructions was, does the city's action bear a reasonable relationship to a legitimate goal."
1998.97-1235,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.199,180.568,"You said, did it substantially advance a legitimate goal?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,194.827,217.591,"--And we didn't argue that the jury could not consider that past history, but on the specific issue that the jury was asked to address, over our objection, because we continue to believe that that is an issue for the court, on the first prong, the substantially advance a legitimate public interest, that prong, which derives essentially from substantive due proc language, that is a deferential test."
1998.97-1235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.591,224.946,"Well, are you saying that the jury was not entitled to consider the length of time that these proceedings were underway at all?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,224.946,227.096,"I'm not suggesting that, Your Honor."
1998.97-1235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.096,230.583,"How long were they underway, from beginning to end?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,230.583,236.154,The first time that the city was presented with this development application was 1983.
1998.97-1235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.443,249.478,What happened between 1986 and now?
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,249.478,257.233,"After 1986, the testimony is that the developer made no further effort to develop the property or contact the city."
1998.97-1235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.939,269.375,We have a lawsuit here.
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,274.779,275.662,"--Well, one hopes."
1998.97-1235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,288.353,316.522,"May I ask about that ripeness challenge, and it relates to how significant this jury trial issue is because, as I understand it, the Ninth Circuit said it was ripe because at the time California had no proceeding which the developer could bring, but now California does and, as I understand our case law, a developer in the situation that this one is in would be obliged to go to the State court, not Federal court, is that correct?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,316.522,317.589,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,317.589,323.01,And under the California procedure the liability issue would not go to a jury.
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,323.01,324.795,"That is also correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-1235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,324.795,338.27,"So is there, now that the States have been told that they must have these proceedings, is this question of jury trial or not just a question for these cases hanging over from the eighties?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,338.27,344.274,"Your Honor, I certainly submit that the issue of the jury trial is very significant to my client in this case."
1998.97-1235,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,349.593,352.695,Does it have any continuing significance at all?
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,366.872,383.834,"There are two issues that were raised, one which was raised by the amicus filed on behalf of some of the States is there might be, under some circumstances, a question as to whether, in fact, the State determination would be fully collaterally estoppeled in a subsequent case, or whether it would give rise to collateral litigation."
1998.97-1235,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.933,441.753,"Well, let's talk about... we're dealing with inverse condemnation here, and it's a two part inquiry if we follow Agins."
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,444.239,445.405,I believe--
1998.97-1235,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,445.405,459.632,"Agins says two things, that the city's action has to substantially advance a legitimate purpose, and deny the subject property all economically viable use."
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,459.632,461.851,"--Yes, that is what Agins says."
1998.97-1235,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,463.703,468.421,And they found on both those points in favor of the respondents.
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,468.421,469.522,"We don't know that, Your Honor."
1998.97-1235,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.522,470.889,"Well, they gave a general verdict."
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,470.889,471.872,They gave a general verdict.
1998.97-1235,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,473.724,476.526,"Well, was it an and or an or instruction?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,478.378,478.862,Or.
1998.97-1235,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.862,481.078,"--it takes both, or were they told either one?"
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,481.078,481.68,Either one.
1998.97-1235,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,482.547,483.83,It was a general verdict.
1998.97-1235,0,26342,george_a_yuhas,,483.83,485.513,--It was a general verdict on that claim.
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1161.065,1169.321,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1235,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1196.638,1198.907,"Well, of course, the jury wasn't instructed on that theory."
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1206.363,1212.934,"Well, I... but... that seemed to be an important aspect to the court of appeals affirmance of the judgment."
1998.97-1235,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1270.186,1284.096,"Well, suppose we agree with you that the court of appeals got it wrong on the Dolan point, what is... how would reversing that, or vacating it, affect the balance of the decision, if at all?"
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1284.096,1305.86,"Well, the question then would be whether the court of appeals was correct in affirming the judgment on the ground that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that there was not a reasonable basis for the action in this case, and that really goes to the substantial relationship prong, and we have... we have two basic problems with that."
1998.97-1235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1321.988,1324.423,"Was that challenged by the petitioner, the Agins rule?"
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1324.423,1326.273,"--It was not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.97-1235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.273,1331.261,Ordinarily we don't accept any new questions or positions from an amicus.
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1331.261,1332.477,I understand that.
1998.97-1235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1355.792,1360.263,"Well, but that's not any particular justification for taking a new point from an amicus."
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1362.565,1363.032,No--
1998.97-1235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1363.032,1365.132,Presumably all new points from amicus are based on that.
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1365.132,1390.049,"--My point was that in order to decide the question of whether deference to the agency is appropriate and whether the question should be whether there was sufficient evidence before the city council from which it could conclude that there was a rational basis for this action, there is the antecedent question as to whether that is a proper inquiry at all, and we think that where you have an antecedent question upon which the standard of review depends--"
1998.97-1235,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1390.049,1390.665,"Well, do you--"
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1390.665,1391.331,--it would be proper for the Court--
1998.97-1235,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1391.331,1398.585,--Do you take the position that the legitimacy of the Government purpose is irrelevant to the inverse condemnation question?
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1398.585,1403.556,--We believe that it is irrelevant to the question of whether a compensable taking has occurred.
1998.97-1235,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1405.106,1407.691,"That's hard to derive from Agins, certainly."
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1407.691,1424.319,"--No, but if... if you look at Agins, what the court recited for that proposition was this Court's decision in Nectow, which was a due process case, and what the Court said there was that the action did not substantially advance a legitimate governmental purpose because it was arbitrary and irrational."
1998.97-1235,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1446.918,1453.505,"Would this be a... Mr. Kneedler, would this be a possible different way of looking at it in nonprocedural terms?"
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1480.323,1481.106,--I think not.
1998.97-1235,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1532.006,1534.29,When you get... is it relevant here?
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1544.165,1549.3,"Well, it would... the way the jury was instructed here, either that the property--"
1998.97-1235,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1549.3,1549.883,What is the fact?
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1557.073,1560.858,--The Court has said if there was all economic... that is the test.
1998.97-1235,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1560.858,1561.108,All right.
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1566.762,1576.951,"The Court has not really spelled out what the standards are, but it has typically come up in terms of saying that the property has been deprived of all economic... all economically beneficial--"
1998.97-1235,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1576.951,1577.551,And if it has?
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1577.551,1578.451,--Pardon?
1998.97-1235,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1578.451,1579.736,"See, that's what keeps bothering me."
1998.97-1235,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1586.823,1602.185,"Well, first of all we think if you focus on the deprivation of all economic value in this case that would simply be impossible to find, because the... as petitioner's counsel pointed out, the respondent's own expert said this land was worth $3 million after the permit was denied."
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1756.951,1767.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1998.97-1235,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1791.941,1821.811,"Mr. Berger, I'd like to... this jury trial issue, which has been posed as a discrete issue, I have it in my mind, and I may be wrong about this, that as a result of our two decisions, Williamson the last one, there won't be any ripe claim to be brought in the Federal court as a court of first view any more, because the inverse condemnation proceeding will take place... must take place in the California State courts, is that right?"
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1821.811,1824.496,"That's my reading of this Court's cases as well, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.97-1235,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1824.496,1838.589,"And do I also understand that these two questions, the economic justification or deprivation, that under the California law the liability question, that is, whether there has been a taking, is done by the judge?"
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1838.589,1842.791,I would have to say that's not as clear as counsel for the city represented.
1998.97-1235,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.791,1845.326,"Well, what cases are you referring to, Mr. Berger?"
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1848.695,1851.48,"Oh, actually I thought that that was Justice Ginsburg's reference."
1998.97-1235,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1852.43,1853.782,Williamson was the second one.
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1853.782,1855.432,--Williamson and probably First English--
1998.97-1235,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.432,1857.384,"Yes, and First English... yes."
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1857.384,1861.019,--that mandated compensation as a remedy for a regulatory taking.
1998.97-1235,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1861.019,1870.458,"And Judge Wallace, as I recall, said the reason this case is ripe, he said at the time all this happened California did not have those procedures--"
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1870.458,1871.743,That is correct.
1998.97-1235,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1872.16,1872.46,--in place.
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1873.01,1879.999,"--This case arose in 1986, 1 year before First English, at a time when California recognized no compensatory remedy."
1998.97-1235,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1879.999,1889.372,"So that's why this whole 1983 jury trial or not seems to me largely academic, not having any continuing importance."
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1889.372,1892.057,"It could have little continuing importance, I would--"
1998.97-1235,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.057,1894.24,"It's certainly not academic in your case, though, is it?"
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1894.24,1896.859,--In this case it was the heart of the case.
1998.97-1235,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1896.859,1908.166,"Well, and in California juries do, in precondemnation delay cases, for instance, decide whether the State was unreasonable in delaying condemnation activity under Coppin, I take it."
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1909.435,1920.224,"Your Honor, there are many of those kinds of cases in California, and I would have to say I cannot put my finger on a citation to an appellate decision that deals with the issue."
1998.97-1235,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.795,1926.411,"Well, in--"
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1926.411,1927.33,--and without objection.
1998.97-1235,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1928.147,1940.971,"--In California, State condemnation is a jury trial, is it not, because Arizona it is, and we patterned ours after California, unlike the Federal system where it is not."
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1940.971,1959.618,"Yes, Your Honor, but of course the only issue in a direct condemnation case would be the valuation of the property, a major distinction between the kind of case we have here and a condemnation case, but in California those issues, the only issues that are left, the valuation issues, are decided by juries."
1998.97-1235,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1959.618,1965.855,"And in the inverse condemnation case, which is new in California, how is that division?"
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1965.855,1973.526,"I'm hesitating, Justice Ginsburg, only because there have been so few of them that have reached--"
1998.97-1235,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1973.526,1983.234,"Well, I don't want to detract you on that, but at least it's my understanding that these cases are not going to come up under 1983 now the way they did."
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,1983.234,1992.505,"--They're very unlikely to make an appearance in the way that this case did, because this Court has ordered California to recognize compensation as a remedy."
1998.97-1235,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2033.682,2038.051,"Does that derive, do you agree, from due process concerns?"
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,2043.022,2048.525,"--Well, Your Honor, there are certainly some due process aspects that could be raised in such a case."
1998.97-1235,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2091.353,2111.017,"It seems a little odd to me, perhaps to you, too, given your representation in the case in your client's position, that the judge would find as a matter of law that the planning action was substantively reasonable under due process but then submit the takings issue to a jury."
1998.97-1235,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,2113.034,2119.522,"Well, let me say at least I was disappointed in that result, Your Honor, but I don't think that... I don't think it's terribly inconsistent."
