1968.366,0,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,15.31,17.115,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.366,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,25.877,26.46,You may.
1968.366,0,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,31.713,32.479,Thank you.
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,32.479,35.926,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.366,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,79.415,87.276,Is there anything in the record to indicate how much the Government did obtain in taxes from this law?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,87.276,90.091,"Yes, that is a matter of public record."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,110.856,113.597,Is that from the $3.00 and $1.00?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,113.597,116.092,This is all revenue collected under the tax.
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,122.747,127.144,"Well, but does the Government depended to $100.00 has ever collected?"
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,127.144,127.758,"No, sir."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,130.082,140.71,Do you mean at the time of transfer of marihuana illegally under state law that is that I can pay the $100.00 tax collected?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,140.71,150.8,"If you are not eligible to comply with state law, you cannot register with the Director of Internal Revenue under the Marihuana Tax Act."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,157.766,162.089,But do you think that after conviction it governed with the civil action?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,162.089,163.678,Not always after conviction but --
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,163.678,165.255,"No, if and when, that's what I want to know."
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,165.255,169.997,"-- after the transfer -- the illegal transfer has taken place, the Sanchez case before this Court."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,169.997,172.488,And the Government will accept the $100.00?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,172.488,174.649,The tax is levied by an assessment.
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,176.134,181.41,But why is it this -- do you mean levied by assessment?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,181.41,182.853,"In the civil suit, yes."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,182.853,186.994,So that the -- there is liability for $100.00 tax?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,186.994,188.086,"There is absolutely, yes."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,188.086,196.381,And if the person wants to is there a penalty involved for not paying -- for non-payment civil type penalty?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,196.381,199.361,I'm not sure whether the 50% surcharge --
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,199.361,201.376,There's interest anyway?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,201.376,203.314,"Yes, there would be 6% interest."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,203.314,212.707,"So the -- how do you really distinguish this from Grosso, but that the payment of the tax itself?"
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,212.707,217.384,"Well, I think there's a very critical distinction in Grosso."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.693,227.01,Government --
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,227.01,227.936,"In this situation, --"
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.936,231.352,Do you mean to pay the tax yourself that we can collect the premium with it?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,231.352,236.123,"If the Government bears the burden of proof, there is nothing even in Grosso."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.123,244.337,"No pressure on the person because if he doesn't pay the tax, he doesn't break the law but if he doesn't pay the tax, the Government assesses that he done?"
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,244.337,246.307,"No, there is no additional criminal violation."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.307,247.779,Like peculiar situation.
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,247.779,257.007,"Mr. Justice, there is no additional criminal violation in not paying the tax after the transaction has occurred and the way the --"
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,257.007,258.108,That isn't the point.
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,272.212,282.524,"Yes, and the Government is not punishing him for failing to waive his Fifth Amendment right. The Government is saying, “We have information that you illegally obtained marihuana."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,285.849,291.251,"And can you pay the tax and say, “I am in that category.”"
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,297.138,307.449,The same could be said about an embezzler who fails to report the proceeds of an embezzlement on his income tax return if the Government and it brings a civil suit --
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.449,325.627,The Government wants to argue that the general liability applicable to law the income tax -- is there suspect as the Grosso situation and argue its (Inaudible)?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,325.627,330.502,We're not willing to suggest that the income tax is fatally a suspect.
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,330.502,333.344,"Well, I don't think the argument now did."
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,333.344,333.518,"Well, --"
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.518,337.8,About the embezzlement.
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,337.8,344.307,"In practical effect, we suggest that there really is no Fifth Amendment difference in this situation."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,377.057,388.617,Don't you think the Government gets some clue that I transferred narcotics illegally if I have to come forward and pay a tax?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,388.617,390.663,You don't.
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,390.663,395.708,Because I'm the only -- the only reason I have to pay $100.00 is that I have transferred it illegally?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,395.708,397.353,You obtained it illegally.
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.353,399.296,Well.
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,399.296,403.264,But what we're saying is that --
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.264,410.949,That maybe the first thing the Government heard of it that I transferred illegally is that if I come forward and pay the tax?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,410.949,434.53,"Well, Mr. Justice, I have to reiterate that the way the statute was drafted and the way it's been interpreted under the regulations for the past 30 years and illegal acquisition the person who acquires marihuana illegally that is in most situation someone who was a non-registrant is not expected to come forward and pay the tax."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.53,437.198,But he is expected to pay it?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,437.198,447.52,If the Government brings suit against him and a judgment is rendered establishing his civil liability then the tax is collected as any assessment is.
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.268,461.416,If on the face of the law is exempted for the liability for not paying the tax itself?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,461.416,462.993,"Yes, that the statute doesn't --"
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,462.993,464.417,Incase he forget that?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,464.417,465.875,Statute that is involved here --
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.875,469.411,"Just forget that and say, well if he doesn't deny this means civil liability?"
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,469.411,471.226,"No, sir."
1968.366,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,495.616,499.815,There is nothing except this tax law that prohibits it.
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,510.648,511.499,"Well, I don't suggest --"
1968.366,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,511.499,520.235,"But I don't, is there anything else other than the violation of the tax law that is involved here?"
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,540.635,543.889,"No, Congress wrote the criminal statute."
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.931,594.075,"Well, I certainly agree we're not talking about the Harrison law in this case."
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,596.254,605.32,That's right and that's why Congress indemonstrably trying to achieve the same result making it the crime to transfer marihuana.
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.32,607.854,But why didn't they just do it like the Harrison Act?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,607.854,613.278,Because of the -- then doubts about the constitutional power.
1968.366,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.278,615.645,The same doubts in here and the Harrison law?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,615.645,616.44,"No, sir."
1968.366,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,626.233,626.977,What is this?
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,632.616,637.359,I would call it a prohibitory tax as the constitutional doctrine is developed on that.
1968.366,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,648.093,650.945,Will have the same effect as the fine.
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,650.945,654.607,"Not a fine, it's a deterrent rather than a fine principally."
1968.366,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,654.607,657.388,"Well, I'm fined for the purpose of deterrent?"
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,657.388,660.64,"Well, all criminal statutes we can say both deterrent and cumulative."
1968.366,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,660.64,671.029,"Well, as I understand you this can view this never comes up until after you violate it then they file a civil suit to collect the fine."
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,671.029,673.468,"No, to collect the tax."
1968.366,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.468,675.004,"Well, the word."
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,675.004,682.171,It's a civil suit rather than a forfeiture proceeding in form.
1968.366,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,892.725,904.052,"Well, if that were so then you would have to defend the statute, wouldn't you on some power -- constitutional power of the Congress rather than the taxing power?"
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,904.052,905.28,"No, sir."
1968.366,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,905.28,929.466,"In other words, what you're saying is that this taxing statute here is not in reality a tax statute, it's a prohibitory statute but that we should regard the taxing power as a constitutional basis for the congressional prohibition?"
1968.366,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,929.466,930.034,"No, sir."
1968.366,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,967.773,982.324,"But a while ago, you told us that Congress didn't follow the Harrison Act model here in order to avoid the frightful prospect presented by the fact that they were in dissents in Doremus."
1968.366,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,982.324,991.597,"To make it clearer that this was a legitimate exercise of the tax power, they impose to transfer tax."
1968.366,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1406.216,1407.622,Mr. Davis.
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,1407.622,1408.891,Thank you.
1968.366,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1432.112,1434.708,(Voice Overlap) You may proceed on the argument of this case Mr. Davis.
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,1434.708,1436.776,Thank you.
1968.366,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1914.928,1920.789,"Mr. Davis, is what you just read to us in the record before us?"
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,1920.789,1921.46,"No, sir."
1968.366,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1932.248,1938.37,There's a copy of the -- you're reading from an official notice?
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,1938.37,1939.311,"Yes, sir."
1968.366,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1939.311,1941.731,Is copy of that available?
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,1941.731,1944.916,I'll -- I'll leave the original.
1968.366,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1968.068,1976.998,Can you may -- you may leave it with the Court if you please and if counsel has response to it they may make it.
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,1976.998,1978.679,"Yes, thank you sir."
1968.366,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2020.26,2021.665,Is that in the record?
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,2021.665,2022.056,"No, sir."
1968.366,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2025.405,2026.88,What's in the record?
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,2026.88,2027.428,Sir?
1968.366,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2027.428,2030.025,It's rather difficult to take things if not in the record.
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,2031.978,2044.808,"Just the fact that this order was -- that this order was served on him, the order from the Internal Revenue or from the narcotic agent notifying him that he should comply with the statute."
1968.366,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2044.808,2046.394,"Official notice of him, I don't --"
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,2046.394,2047.405,Sir?
1968.366,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2047.405,2051.033,It might be possible to take the judicial knowledge of them?
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,2051.033,2053.378,"Yes, this is an official notice and --"
1968.366,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2053.378,2059.69,Did the government argue below the same point of civil liability that it argued in this Court?
1968.366,2,44506,william_j_davis,,2059.69,2072.289,"I -- we, -- the case below was decided on memorandum solely and I do not recall a civil liability being raised in the memorandum."
1968.366,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2360.094,2361.595,Yes.
1968.366,3,39538,robert_j_haft,,2365.011,2369.438,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.366,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2711.59,2712.739,Mr. Lacovara.
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2712.739,2728.97,"Mr. Chief Justice, in answer to the question that you asked Mr. Davis, the Government did argue that and cert that transfers of -- illicit transfers of marihuana are taxable civilly."
1968.366,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2756.708,2767.144,"How did the figure get up to the rather dizzy heights that were and that was given to us by counsel some like $2,900.00 or --"
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2767.144,2773.125,"Well, there are 737 grams which is approximately 29 ounces of marihuana."
1968.366,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2773.125,2775.672,"29 ounces, $2900.00 I see."
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2775.672,2779.259,I‘m not sure what the $2.75
1968.366,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2779.259,2782.399,But then there was only 8 cents interest or 28 cents interest?
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2782.399,2784.637,"Well, that's because the demand apparently --"
1968.366,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2784.637,2786.189,Was just a matter of days?
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2786.189,2787.049,Just a matter of days.
1968.366,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2796.376,2804.63,"Mr. Lacovara, do you have any objection to the two documents that that counsel pointed out to us?"
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2804.63,2806.416,"As far as I know Your Honor, I do not."
1968.366,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2819.074,2825.941,But then you may provide both of them to the Court Mr. Davis.
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2825.941,2833.586,I think it's important to turn to the contention that the regulations and the statute themselves belie the Government's contention.
1968.366,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2927.94,2957.154,Can somebody apply for him and obtain the $100.00 -- go in and pay the $100.00 tax in applying for him and obtain the permit with assurance that the information listed will not be used either to institute a criminal investigation or as evidence in a criminal prosecution?
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2957.154,2960.847,"No, he cannot come in and pay the $100.00 transfer tax at all."
1968.366,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2971.501,2985.082,"Well, apart from that suppose where the -- somebody could take a -- could issue a permit to $100.00 upon payment of a $100.00 tax in a proper case?"
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2985.082,2986.611,"No, sir."
1968.366,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3001.561,3011.635,"So, the money that's been collected -- has been collected and on the $100.00 tax has been collected in the absence of the insurance of an order form?"
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3011.635,3012.072,That's right.
1968.366,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3014.927,3024.818,And what you're asking us to do is to go along with this -- what shall I call it?
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3026.285,3026.538,I would call it consistent administration --
1968.366,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3026.538,3036.234,"(Voice Overlap) We'll go along with this straight statutory scheme that you say should be read as saying, “Thou shalt not?”"
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3036.234,3041.071,That's essentially our argument that we say it's been interpreted that way for 30 years.
1968.366,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3065.803,3077.57,It's a little difficult to think of something where the Court has -- the party is quite as far as you're suggesting from the language of the statute?
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3077.57,3080.605,"Well, we're dealing in a noble area Mr. Justice."
1968.366,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3107.768,3115.149,What if they -- what if the defendant sued the Government who has refused in order form sued this Government for an injunction?
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3115.149,3119.856,I think that would raise the question whether the regulations are ultra vires.
1968.366,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.153,3125.041,"Well, how would the question be answer though?"
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3125.041,3126.649,We would be prepared to --
1968.366,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3126.649,3131.173,"How could you possibly refuse somebody to order form who came in and said, “I want the money."
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3136.214,3140.564,Our contention is that the Act does not say that that Congress didn't mean that and the --
1968.366,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.564,3144.725,You mean a fellow may not waive his privilege against self-incrimination?
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3144.725,3145.666,That's right.
1968.366,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.187,3181.777,But you have -- you do have to go just exactly that far.
1968.366,4,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3181.777,3183.832,"Yes, sir."
1968.366,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3183.832,3186.384,Very well.
