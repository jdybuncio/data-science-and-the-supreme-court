2005.05-8794,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.157,We'll hear argument first this morning in Hill v. McDonough.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,6.47,8.986,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,76.703,78.767,Which you decline to specify.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,79.813,81.986,"I'm sorry, Justice."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.424,90.176,"By a means which you decline to specify, so that if they come up with some other means, you could... you could object to that as well I assume."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,90.176,99.365,"Well, there... in... in answer to your question, there's never been a... a requirement that a section 1983 plaintiff must plead a constitutionally acceptable alternative."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,99.365,100.116,"No, I understand that."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,106.836,107.804,"Well, this--"
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.804,112.305,You... we... we say this... this procedure is no good.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,119.104,126.606,--I... I respectfully disagree with the fact that it would just leave open a total series of challenges.
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.606,127.184,Why?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,127.184,133.466,The State... the State would have the opportunity to come in and propose a acceptable alternative.
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.032,168.724,"You... you think that the... the way you would proceed in trial court is the trial court finds that this is no good, and... and then the trial court proposes an alternative, or... or invites the State to propose to the trial court an alternative, and then asks whether you agree to that alternative."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,176.147,176.882,This... that's--
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,176.882,177.866,That's not bad.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,177.866,182.555,"--that's entirely correct, and I think we've seen that in... in a couple of the cases that are out there."
2005.05-8794,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.875,221.298,You're envisioning that one case will take care of it.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,247.695,256.009,--The only... the only way I would foresee a second episode is if they... if they proposed a second unconstitutional procedure.
2005.05-8794,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,256.009,258.963,"Well, that probably will be what will be alleged."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,277.513,285.906,"That's correct, although it would proceed to basically an up or down ruling, just as it did in... in the Brown case and the... the Morales case."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.906,291.703,"In this very case, you're saying the court would... would rule on the State's proposed alternative."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,292.266,293.172,That's correct.
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.172,295.642,"But if you disagreed with that, you could appeal it up again."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,297.408,298.361,That's correct.
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.361,299.518,--and then seek cert up here.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,300.767,301.721,That... that would be correct.
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,301.721,307.55,"May... just as a... maybe this is technical, but what did you ask for for relief?"
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,334.9,355.499,"We asked for... for two... two injunctions, one a preliminary injunction allowing the... the Court to be able to consider the case, and then the way the prayer for relief was worded is, is that we asked for a permanent injunction barring the State of Florida from executing Mr. Hill as they currently intend."
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,355.499,366.844,"Well, if that's... if that's the relief you get, then the door would be open to successive different 1983 actions every time the State comes up with... with a new protocol."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,407.275,414.964,In... in the sense of... of the State of Florida proposing a... a... hopefully a constitutional way of executing--
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,414.964,415.308,Yes.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,415.308,420.247,"--Mr. Hill, where it wouldn't give rise to another 1983 action?"
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,420.247,420.481,Right.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,420.481,420.919,Yes.
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,420.919,422.028,You... you would agree to that?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,422.028,423.342,Yes.
2005.05-8794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,423.342,424.42,"Well, do you have confidence--"
2005.05-8794,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.42,424.888,You said--
2005.05-8794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,424.888,426.451,--do you have confidence that Florida can do that?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,426.451,438.766,"Based upon the litigation that we've seen around the country, yes, I think there are acceptable ways to... to do it out there."
2005.05-8794,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,462.021,462.146,Do you--
2005.05-8794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,462.146,466.928,"Well, one... one of the circumstances that... that was raised by the questioning is this."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,508.015,518.486,"Well, within... within the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence of... of the evolution of... of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, we've seen hanging go by the wayside."
2005.05-8794,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,525.738,525.925,Precisely.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,527.832,531.989,--That's an... that's an evolution over time.
2005.05-8794,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,532.708,534.771,--You said there were other States.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,552.963,569.2,"--In Mr. Brown's case in North Carolina, my understanding was... is that the State had went and purchased a device to make sure that he was actually unconscious during the procedure and wasn't subject to the excruciating pain that's been detailed within... within the briefs."
2005.05-8794,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,588.549,594.299,--Do you agree that that was not a... that method of execution is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,594.299,599.269,As far as using the machinery that was used in Brown?
2005.05-8794,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,599.269,599.582,Yes.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,599.582,606.208,I... I don't know enough about... about that machine to... to accurately comment on... on that.
2005.05-8794,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,628.729,637.246,Do you know of any method that has been used... used throughout the country that is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,637.246,651.687,"As far as... as far as this particular protocol, this particular protocol that's... that's utilized and that we're... we're challenging is unconstitutional because of the excruciating pain."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.271,682.241,Is it only excruciating pain that the Eighth Amendment prohibits or is it any pain?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,685.569,686.976,"No, absolutely not."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.774,698.682,"Well, when you say wanton and gratuitous, you're... you're saying any pain that can be eliminated must be eliminated."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,702.401,706.309,"It's... it's gratuitous when it's beyond what's... what's necessary, and whenever the--"
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.309,706.559,Yes.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,714.263,719.514,"--If there were a way to do that, I... I would agree with that."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.514,720.28,Where... where do you derive that from?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,746.332,746.661,I--
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.661,753.271,"I can understand excruciating pain, but... but you... you want to press it to the point where there can't be any pain associated."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,759.476,766.68,--The... the... what... what we've detailed here in our complaint is an extreme and tortuous method of... of death.
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.055,769.072,No.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,783.309,800.798,"--Well, when you look at the... when you look at... at Morales and Brown, both of those that... that were proposed were eliminating... for instance, one of the options within Mr. Morales' case was that only the sodium thiopental be used eliminating the pancuronium bromide and the potassium chloride."
2005.05-8794,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,867.187,879.346,"Would it be... if... if in the future, if States specify the method of execution in the sentence, then you would not have a 1983 action."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,885.426,898.225,"If the particular protocol was alleged in the sentence, yes, it would be ripe at that point in time as opposed to Florida's system where it's within... it's within the discretion of the Department of Corrections to change it at any time."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.602,915.23,"Well, but... but you... you... their procedure was set forth in a... in a notice, a regulation or something."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,920.199,921.325,The only--
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.325,923.746,"Now, you're saying they could change it in the future, but sure, of course."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,931.279,932.905,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.082,963.192,So you have to wait to... you have to wait to the eve of execution before... before you think you have a... a ripe claim under... under habeas.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,963.192,969.71,"--Under... under Florida's scheme, yes, we have to wait because they have the complete discretion."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,974.382,988.87,"Congress has the complete discretion to change the statutes it's enacted, but that doesn't mean that you can't change... you can't challenge a statute now because it might be changed before... before the action you want to take occurs."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,998.997,1006.577,If Congress has the situation set up that Florida does not engage in... in rulemaking.
2005.05-8794,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1013.391,1014.126,"Well, what did they have?"
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1045.132,1054.978,"--Because... because that claim was not ripe at that time, because we didn't know what would be utilized whenever it came to Mr. Hill being executed."
2005.05-8794,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1070.528,1074.419,"Have they, in fact, changed the procedure for the lethal injection?"
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1074.419,1079.468,--I don't have any public records to... to be able to say one way or another.
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1083.453,1089.688,When did you ask for the public... when did you ask for the... a... a statement of the protocol that would be used in your case?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1089.688,1101.004,"It was December the 8th is whenever it began, and then pursuant to the court's... the trial court's order that was entered in that case, the State's response came on December 19th."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.115,1109.803,I don't understand.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1112.991,1114.21,Once--
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1114.21,1118.226,You say you didn't know it until the 19th when your case was already in the court.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1120.133,1136.355,"--What we... what had happened is... is whenever the... whenever the death warrant was signed on November 29th, that put into play Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.852(h)(3) which then entitles us to more records that we are not entitled to before a warrant is signed."
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.154,1148.529,Excuse me.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1153.186,1153.905,--Yes.
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.905,1157.172,What... what is the... the action that you're bringing?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1159.093,1160.437,Yes.
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1201.853,1203.728,May... may I ask you to clarify one thing?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1235.361,1241.456,"--Within the... within the public records proceeding, it was referenced that it would be the same as... as Sims."
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1243.081,1249.707,"But until you went into that proceeding, I take it, you had asked Florida to specify and Florida said, no, it would not do so?"
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1249.707,1259.584,"--We had asked for the records and had requested the records that would specify and any written procedures and protocol, as well as the records from... from prior executions."
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1281.011,1288.965,"Did... did you ever say to... to any Florida official, please tell me what the chemicals are and the amounts that will be used--"
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1288.965,1290.153,We--
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1290.153,1293.701,"--not asking for records, just asking for a statement about what they were going to do?"
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1293.701,1300.516,--It... it came forward at the... at the hearing regarding the public records that it was going to be the Sims... that it was going to be the Sims procedure.
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1300.516,1307.251,"But I guess before you went into court with a public records action, did you ever say to somebody, tell us what you're going to do?"
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1307.251,1310.361,"By our public records request, yes."
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1313.221,1313.799,What... what I'm getting at is--
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1313.799,1315.128,"--Department of Corrections, no."
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1315.128,1315.831,--there... there are ways to find out.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1330.552,1337.649,That was essentially done at the public records hearing on December 19th whenever they came in and said it was... that it was Sims.
2005.05-8794,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1337.649,1338.071,Okay.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1338.071,1343.478,"The... the thing is, is--"
2005.05-8794,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1343.478,1350.886,"Well, you... you alleged in your complaint... I'm looking at footnote 3... that you assumed they were going to follow the same protocol as in Sims."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1350.886,1357.105,--Because of their... because of... of the representations that were made during the public records litigation.
2005.05-8794,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.546,1370.687,"Well, they still do, but you're here."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1379.939,1381.814,They... yes.
2005.05-8794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.758,1413.665,Can I just clarify one thing for myself?
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1425.823,1427.683,That's correct.
2005.05-8794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.683,1432.888,So that there hasn't been a decision by a Federal judge on whether or not there's merit to your case.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1432.888,1434.389,That is correct.
2005.05-8794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.389,1438.827,It's just a question of which... whether you do it by way of habeas corpus or by 1983.
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1438.827,1446.25,"That is... that is correct, and it was recharacterized as... as a successive habeas petition rather than a 1983 action."
2005.05-8794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.25,1459.033,"And I suppose it's entirely possible that if the judge then decided it is really... if we said it should have been a 1983 action, the judge could say, well, okay, even under 1983 the State has the defense of laches and you still lose."
2005.05-8794,0,20793,d_todd_doss,,1464.411,1484.351,"It would go back for... for an analysis as to the equities of the situation, and... and that being an intensely fact bound procedure, the district court is actually in... in a better position to go ahead and... and be able to make that analysis there at the district court level, a Gomez analysis as to the equities that are involved within the situation."
2005.05-8794,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1516.421,1518.234,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1521.454,1525.33,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1566.995,1571.683,But there's no statute and there's no regulation that requires Florida to do that.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1571.683,1573.84,--These... there is no specific statute.
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1597.767,1600.596,"But there is no statute, no regulation."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1609.801,1621.382,"--That is correct, to the extent that there's no statutory provision or regulatory rule because, in fact, under Florida... the Florida legislature has exempted rulemaking of the Department of Corrections with regard to executions."
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1621.382,1622.835,And I suppose that's... that's the complaint.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1641.448,1676.159,"And I understand that, but the State would contend that based on the fact that there have 16 executions since the time that Sims has occurred and all those executions have been performed exactly as the manner in which Sims has occurred, and that there has not been any challenge to a deviance from that, and in fact, the Florida Supreme Court has ratified again in this case, when Mr. Hill brought his Eighth Amendment claim, that Sims was the method of execution in Florida, I think we have a very reasoned determination that, in fact, the method of execution, as it has been proposed in Sims, is currently the method of execution that we utilize."
2005.05-8794,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1676.159,1682.849,But what he... I... I take it the ripeness issue is... he delayed in bringing it because he wasn't certain what you'd do.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1689.725,1690.35,Correct.
2005.05-8794,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1690.35,1698.774,"--that says the... in the opinion of the doctors who wrote it, a significant number of executed people are conscious when they die, and that's painful."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1766.242,1776.088,"Well, my reply on the ripeness question is, first of all, that I don't believe that your scenario... while I'll accept your scenario as your scenario, it is not accurate with regard to what occurred in Florida."
2005.05-8794,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.247,1794.483,--my... my little story was inaccurate as to Florida or accurate as to Florida.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1794.483,1794.92,--I'm sorry?
2005.05-8794,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.92,1805.735,Is the kind of thing I was explaining why it would be ripe I think... is that accurate enough for the purposes of ripeness as to what happened in Florida?
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1805.735,1806.141,No.
2005.05-8794,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.813,1808.281,No.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1808.281,1809.219,--because I think it's part of the pleadings.
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1830.349,1830.787,Would he have to come up--
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1830.787,1831.584,Excuse me.
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1831.584,1835.678,"--with, as you suggest, an alternative that would be acceptable?"
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1869.42,1888.753,"Well, it seems to me, based on this Court's decision in Nelson, that that was the focal point of why relief was granted in the fashion it was, that it was a proper issue to rely in 1983 because, in fact, there might be a... he had proposed a mechanism that might be alternative mechanism that was accepted by the government."
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1892.222,1925.948,"Well, my question to you is... I take it you're answering yes, that if they prove that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, that's not good enough unless the petitioner proposes an alternative, that it's all right for the State to expose someone to the risk of what has... what has been determined to be the risk of excruciating pain as long as the petitioner himself doesn't come up with an alternative."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1925.948,1928.199,"--Well, I think the answer is twofold."
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1962.753,1964.144,"Well, because there's been no hearing."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,1990.227,1991.103,--Correct.
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1991.103,1992.54,"And the judge says, you're both right."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2001.542,2013.295,"That, in fact, I think that he has to make some colorable showing of an alternative that would be acceptable to him based on the procedures because, again, the second prong of that seems to me--"
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2013.295,2014.093,So the answer is yes.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2014.093,2015.062,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-8794,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2015.484,2025.907,"The court, having found that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, still no Eighth Amendment violation because the petitioner hasn't come up with an alternative."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2025.907,2027.501,Yes.
2005.05-8794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2027.501,2029.846,What is the source of his obligation to do this?
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2037.597,2042.567,"Well, I think the Court in its Nelson opinion suggested that that was a means--"
2005.05-8794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2042.567,2063.054,"That... that was a fact in Nelson, but my question to you is if... if we were to agree with you and say that that, in fact, is a... is an element of a 1983 action here, what would be the source of... of the... the conclusion that... that he has to propose a less painful alternative?"
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2063.054,2075.184,"--I guess part of the source would be the fact that in overcoming the qualifications... while maybe his pleading may be simple, the notion is that he has to overcome those things that may have happened in the past."
2005.05-8794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2083.216,2083.466,No.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2132.945,2147.713,"--Well, I think for one point, it would be that, in fact, if the State had chosen or selected a method or a change in the modification of the method that was not acceptable to him, then we'd be still back at square zero--"
2005.05-8794,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2147.713,2148.042,No.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2172.907,2173.642,--The principle I'm--
2005.05-8794,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2173.642,2174.47,That's what we're asking.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2174.47,2174.845,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-8794,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2186.253,2188.301,But it was mentioned... it was mentioned in Nelson.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2201.257,2215.947,"--I think the legal principle being that the individual who is coming forth and seeking to have the execution or requesting some relief... he has to come forward with some evidence, some... some body of law--"
2005.05-8794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2215.947,2227.793,But isn't there evidence in... I noticed the brief filed by some veterinarians call our attention to the statute that prohibits the euthanasia of dogs and cats unless they follow a certain procedure.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2243.391,2249.767,--And that... that has been an allegation and that has been raised before the courts over the years with regard to that.
2005.05-8794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.767,2250.376,And what's your response to it?
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2250.376,2257.159,"That, in fact, recent... recent development... and I mean, we're talking about an area that has not... we have not gotten that far."
2005.05-8794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.94,2262.989,"But your procedure, if I understand it, would be prohibited to be applied to dogs or cats."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2262.989,2273.476,"But the... that procedure... there is... there is legal information or... or scientific information out there that... or... refutes that, and that, in fact, there's a different mechanism and that's--"
2005.05-8794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2273.476,2277.289,"Well, at least it was sufficiently convincing to get the Florida legislature to pass a statute."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2277.289,2283.822,"--That's... that's correct, with regard to that particular aspect because it was one needle being used and all the drugs were being used in that needle."
2005.05-8794,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2284.994,2303.983,"Counsel, I would have thought your... your answer to the line of questioning earlier was that the reason that the petitioner has to come with this... an alternative is that otherwise it's plausible, at least, to suspect the reason he's bringing the action is as a challenge to the execution itself rather than the particular method."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2319.376,2326.909,"--And... and that is the core position the State has taken, and I'm sorry if I did not articulate that in a fashion that--"
2005.05-8794,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2326.909,2333.661,"But in respect to that core position, I can understand the State's concern with the possibility of abuse."
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2406.645,2406.942,--But--
2005.05-8794,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2406.942,2410.349,You've got the case that helps you if that occurs.
2005.05-8794,1,20091,carolyn_m_snurkowski,,2412.787,2421.679,"--Well, and the other reason we're arguing for something else, it seems to me that the basis upon which we are here today is to determine whether 1983 or habeas will lie."
2005.05-8794,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2433.792,2435.87,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2438.762,2449.592,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-8794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.673,2463.22,Why is that?
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2469.596,2477.394,"--Well, our view is that the Heck principle is not applicable here where a prisoner is seeking relief that is indisputably available in habeas."
2005.05-8794,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2505.088,2505.463,"Well... well, why?"
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2532.626,2541.94,"--Well, we do believe that where a prisoner brings an open ended claim of the type at issue here, it would necessarily prevent the State from carrying out the execution in one relevant sense."
2005.05-8794,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.441,2556.053,"Yes, and if I bring a claim that my prison cell is so cold, I actually get pneumonia and die, or near it, and then I challenge the coldness of the cell, I'm preventing my confinement in one particular way."
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2556.053,2556.724,"--Well, that's exactly--"
2005.05-8794,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.724,2557.521,It's a cold cell.
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2562.694,2565.945,"--Well, no, I don't think that that's true, and I do think that the--"
2005.05-8794,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2565.945,2567.46,My cold cell case is habeas?
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2567.46,2567.96,--No.
2005.05-8794,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2614.94,2616.471,Why more than in Nelson?
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2616.471,2623.63,"Well, in Nelson, it was important, and we would submit that it was really the dispositive factor in the Court's analysis."
2005.05-8794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.193,2634.834,I didn't... I didn't get your explanation.
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2635.646,2636.428,Yes.
2005.05-8794,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2653.698,2660.136,What about the risks that the prisoner will die an excruciating death?
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2678.984,2683.031,"Well, in that case, he may very well have a valid Eighth Amendment claim."
2005.05-8794,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2684.392,2685.002,But would--
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2685.002,2687.705,--is that he cannot proceed in a section 1983 action.
2005.05-8794,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.659,2688.987,--Why not?
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2701.973,2709.021,"--Well, again, the concern with the claim that fails to identify a permissible alternative is the risk of seriatim litigation."
2005.05-8794,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.103,2724.322,Except... let me just interrupt.
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2737.528,2740.388,"--Well, the State would at least have the option in that case--"
2005.05-8794,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.388,2741.091,Of saying no.
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2741.091,2742.091,--of acquiescing in the alternative.
2005.05-8794,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.248,2752.422,"But do you agree if he had said I propose alternative X, even though it's highly unlikely the State will accept it, that would make it a 1983 action?"
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2752.422,2754.189,That would make it a 1983 action.
2005.05-8794,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2756.673,2761.393,Even though there's no functional difference in terms of future litigation between that case and this.
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2761.393,2769.988,"--Well, the only reason that there would be no functional difference is if the State chose to, in fact, litigate the issue, notwithstanding his identification of the permissible alternative."
2005.05-8794,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.16,2784.351,"So you're saying... saying then that the defense bar, the capital punishment bar, and the prisoners are the group of people that have to go and do the research on humane methods of putting people to death rather than the government."
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2784.351,2785.242,"--Well, I--"
2005.05-8794,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2785.242,2788.774,"That strikes me as a little odd, doesn't it?"
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2788.774,2796.15,"--I would... I would respectfully submit, Justice Breyer, that that is exactly the kind of research that they would have to do in order to bring the claim in the first place."
2005.05-8794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.15,2798.119,"Well, I don't think... I don't think that's the research they would do."
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2824.485,2826.407,"Well, the alternative at a minimum has to be--"
2005.05-8794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2826.407,2829.673,It... it might be malpractice not to come up with... with an unacceptable alternative.
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2830.502,2835.315,"--At a minimum, the alternative has to be one that is permissible under currently government--"
2005.05-8794,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2835.315,2836.3,Old age.
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2839.503,2841.613,"--Well, that would not... presumably that would not be a method of execution at all."
2005.05-8794,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2841.613,2843.347,This... this is a death case.
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2860.696,2872.838,I'm not sure whether it... it would have an obligation to use the most humane method under the Eighth Amendment because this Court's cases have only suggested that the gratuitous infliction of pain is barred by the Eighth Amendment.
2005.05-8794,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2874.902,2878.169,"Well, I can define gratuitous... I don't have the dictionary here."
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2893.031,2912.52,"--Well, I think more broadly, Justice Kennedy, that one reason that States do have discretion in this area... and I think that Florida is not unusual in that regard... is that prison officials are expected to adopt to evolving methods of execution and to take into account changes that might suggest that a particular method is problematic."
2005.05-8794,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2920.646,2921.13,But is there... is there in this case?
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2972.126,2998.397,"--Well, whether or not the State has that obligation... it may very well have that obligation as a constitutional matter, but putting that to one side, it does seem as if the critical question is whether or not the State, in fact, has adopted a method that inflicts cruel and unusual punishment, and where a prisoner has a claim of that variety, a prisoner has other options if the prisoner is unwilling to identify a permissible alternative to bring that claim besides--"
2005.05-8794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.397,2999.459,"We've... we've never held that anyway, have we?"
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2999.459,3000.741,--And the Court has never held that.
2005.05-8794,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3000.741,3007.774,"That the State must, in... in imposing the death penalty, use a method that inflicts the least amount of pain."
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3007.774,3009.087,The Court has not held that.
2005.05-8794,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3009.806,3013.604,And presumably there's some range between most humane and what's cruel and unusual.
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3013.901,3025.465,"--Well, I think that that is presumably true, based on the formulations that this Court has used which have repeatedly focused on the gratuitous or wanton infliction of pain as opposed to the least painful method."
2005.05-8794,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3025.465,3040.188,"Mr. Shanmugam, several of the emergency death proceedings we've had involving this question, the district court judges have assumed that it could proceed under 1983 but then denied relief because it was brought on the eve of execution, as this one was."
2005.05-8794,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3044.204,3051.721,"It is available to the district court, and indeed, it would potentially be available even to this Court as a matter of first instance as it was in the Gomez case."
2005.05-8794,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3052.675,3053.503,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-8794,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3056.206,3068.412,"You know it... it is true that the 1983 is a civil action, and the plaintiff has the burden of proof, burden of producing evidence."
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3068.412,3070.866,That is true.
2005.05-8794,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3114.422,3123.768,Do you think there was adequate time for the district court to fully consider the evidence you intended to present and consider your claim and still proceed with the execution that was scheduled?
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3123.768,3125.988,--No.
2005.05-8794,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3125.988,3128.8,You filed your case 4 days before the execution.
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3128.8,3140.975,"No, but we were put in that posture by... by the way the State of Florida has chosen to... to vest this total discretion, shroud everything in secrecy, and then complain that we didn't bring it earlier when we--"
2005.05-8794,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3140.975,3143.788,The Sims protocol was there as a matter of public domain.
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3154.415,3157.463,"--Because at that point, I knew that they had total discretion."
2005.05-8794,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3168.731,3178.17,"Well, it seems to me that you might... you might have alleged that... that you've read articles, Lancet articles, and so forth, and that there is a substantial risk that they're going to do this."
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3180.077,3180.936,--That--
2005.05-8794,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3180.936,3186.391,"And... and it would... it would mean that the... as the Chief Justice indicates, the court has more time to look at this."
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3186.391,3210.334,"--As far as... as far as the... the ripeness issue, it's not... because of the way Florida chose to do their procedure, it was not ripe, and it doesn't comport with this Court's basic ripeness doctrine that we are going to presume it's going to be done a certain way when the State can come in and say, it's not ripe for review, we... we still have the ability to change this rather than us coming--"
2005.05-8794,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3210.334,3214.834,Suppose you... suppose you never were told by Florida what the... how exactly it was going to be done.
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3221.352,3231.151,"--If they... if they never told us, I guess we would be in... in a position of... of assuming Sims is in place."
2005.05-8794,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3245.169,3248.294,Suppose... suppose they did set it forth but reserved the right to change it.
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3266.189,3266.767,At that--
2005.05-8794,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.767,3267.549,--because they could change it?
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3267.549,3275.27,"--If Your Honor... if Your Honor's fact situation includes a presumption that that's going to be the presumption that that's going to be the presumed method, I think at that point, yes--"
2005.05-8794,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.27,3275.832,No.
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3281.302,3286.82,"--At that point, yes, because they... they are stating that they intend upon using that rather--"
2005.05-8794,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3286.82,3287.96,Don't... don't you think you... you--
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3287.96,3288.866,--rather than playing hide the ball.
2005.05-8794,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3288.866,3295.399,--don't you think effectively had that knowledge when you knew... knew about Sims and you knew about all of the cases after Sims?
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3301.307,3302.275,Absolutely not.
2005.05-8794,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3308.151,3324.999,"I... I understand your... your argument to be... and I don't think you're making it here, but I understood your argument elsewhere to be we knew about Sims, but when they stonewalled us and said we won't tell you what we're going to use, we had reason to question whether they were going to follow Sims."
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3326.328,3329.297,"Yes, and that only came into play at the point--"
2005.05-8794,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3329.297,3329.515,No.
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3335.673,3349.833,--They stonewalled us only after the warrant was signed because we couldn't do anything at... at the point before the warrant was signed to be able to try to... to gather evidence as to what it was going to be.
2005.05-8794,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3351.427,3352.131,Finish.
2005.05-8794,3,20793,d_todd_doss,,3352.131,3353.584,--we were never told that.
2005.05-8794,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3358.303,3362.303,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
