1977.76-1836,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.316,We will hear arguments next in Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay and the related case.
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,37.924,41.697,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1836,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,380.155,386.05,So there was a period when the action could have been taken?
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,386.05,387.858,Against the underwriters?
1977.76-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,404.139,407.319,They join all the other members the underwriting sequence and we could accept this one?
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,407.319,409.16,"No Your Honor, none of the underwriters were joined."
1977.76-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.16,409.726,"Oh, none?"
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,409.726,410.63,None of them of course.
1977.76-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.638,421.194,What would be the theory of proceeding against the underwriters?
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,421.194,432.596,"Well, a standard procedure in securities cases Your Honor to join the underwriters their liability is virtually automatic if you establish the other elements of liability under Section 11 for instance of the 33 Act."
1977.76-1836,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.274,451.721,Not bigger percentage that you are offering that the underwriter with respect to which the conflict existed here?
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,451.721,455.565,A small percentage Your Honor that is all.
1977.76-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,715.732,723.711,"In some court other than a federal court, they need below $10,000 in the federal court?"
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,723.711,728.842,"No, this was under the Securities Act Your Honor, so they qualify without regard in the amount of controversies."
1977.76-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,728.842,731.131,That is right.
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,731.131,735.237,"After the action was decertified they still had a claim for $2,650."
1977.76-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,735.237,737.5,But no lawyer?
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,737.5,739.526,"Well, that is not clear either."
1977.76-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.344,970.441,"The theory of the death knell is not that the order declining to certify is not capable of being changed by the trial Court, but that if it is initially entered it means the case just would not be further prosecuted?"
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,970.441,973.453,It assumes that it will not Your Honor yes.
1977.76-1836,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.453,987.052,So the fact that the trial court might if prosecution continued later changes mind does not undermine the basis for the death knell doctrine I think?
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,987.052,998.881,"Well, the death knell doctrine really is designed to make sure that the determination that this matter shall never be adjudicated on a classwide basis is somehow preserved for appellate review."
1977.76-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1028.9,1034.981,"In this specific case, the another member who declared to file during the case?"
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1034.981,1038.454,"Yes, Your Honor I see no reason by notice he could file a --"
1977.76-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1038.454,1039.743,Class action?
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1039.743,1041.703,He could certainly seek to maintain a class action.
1977.76-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1041.703,1045.531,"No, but could he maintain to that at this stage in this case?"
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1045.531,1049.582,There would be no res judicata problem with it.
1977.76-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1050.778,1053.082,And no estoppel?
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1053.082,1053.511,"No, Your Honor."
1977.76-1836,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1053.511,1055.23,And no law of the case there?
1977.76-1836,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1055.23,1056.223,"No, Your Honor."
1977.76-1836,1,36958,melvyn_i_weiss,,1718.537,1722.61,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1836,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1764.66,1767.158,"Well, that is the only question here is it not?"
1977.76-1836,1,36958,melvyn_i_weiss,,1767.158,1777.716,"That is correct Your Honor, but I think it is important to see the background so that we can determine whether it was the death knell in the context of this case."
1977.76-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1797.841,1802.672,"But upon that delay, would it a failure to move on class action?"
1977.76-1836,1,36958,melvyn_i_weiss,,1802.672,1805.738,That is not correct Mr. Justice Marshall.
1977.76-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1805.738,1806.692,"Well, correct."
1977.76-1836,1,36958,melvyn_i_weiss,,1806.692,1813.511,The Court had already certified the class after that purported delay exists occurred.
1977.76-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1818.521,1820.672,Did that help the delay?
1977.76-1836,1,36958,melvyn_i_weiss,,1820.672,1823.83,"No, it did not Your Honor, not in my view because --"
1977.76-1836,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.83,1826.297,Change in counsel does not delay a case?
1977.76-1836,1,36958,melvyn_i_weiss,,1826.297,1837.241,"No, I am saying that the nine months at the beginning of the case before the motion was made for the certification of the class did not delay the action."
1977.76-1836,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3475.003,3479.532,"Mr. Chief Justice, I just have a couple of brief points to make."
