1982.81-1020,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.903,We will hear arguments first this morning in Exxon Corporation against Eagerton and the consolidated case.
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,19.259,22.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,68.956,74.329,Is he able to pass legislation all by himself or does the legislature pass it?
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,74.329,84.857,"He can pass legislature under local courtesy if it affects only his county, he being the only representative from the county, from that district, in the State of Alabama."
1982.81-1020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.857,91.495,"But, is it actually... Is the bill actually enacted, at least in form, by the whole legislature?"
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,91.495,92.15,Yes.
1982.81-1020,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,199.935,210.072,"Excuse me, Counsel, I am a little uncertain why... If the enactment passed the legislature, what difference does it make how it got there?"
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,210.072,223.239,--It makes a difference in this respect: Our clients are non-Escambia County producers which were not expected to have been taxed under the legislation.
1982.81-1020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,275.967,279.184,What federal claim do you make out of all these facts?
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,282.698,297.178,"I realize that this Court does not, Justice Rehnquist, involved generally in statutory construction of state statutes."
1982.81-1020,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,321.027,326.524,--Aren't we bound by what the Alabama Supreme Court rules?
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,326.524,341.41,"I think we cite in our brief two cases that indicate... One is a Missouri case, the Brinkerhoff case, where this Court held that actions of the Missouri Supreme Court deprived the litigants there of due process."
1982.81-1020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.41,346.547,"Well, the Alabama Supreme Court, I take it, heard your argument on legislative history."
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,349.64,352.529,They said they could not stray into the mazes of conjecture.
1982.81-1020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.529,356.512,"Well, there are lots of opinions from this Court that say the same thing, aren't there?"
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,356.512,374.74,"Under circumstances, however, where there is uncontroverted testimony from the sponsor himself, the sole and only sponsor, that it was his intention to tax his own county to address a revenue shortfall in his own county."
1982.81-1020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.74,379.518,"I speak only for myself, but I hope you have a better federal claim than that one."
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,411.475,420.737,"Well, first, during the currency of this act, they were prohibited from passing through the severance taxes."
1982.81-1020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.737,421.737,As taxes.
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,421.737,423.298,As a tax.
1982.81-1020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,423.298,430.981,"And... So, I am curious how you establish your injury if the Commissioner's present position is correct."
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,430.981,431.606,All right.
1982.81-1020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.699,487.552,Do we have the proof in front of us that would clearly establish that your clients could not have increased the price to take care of this--
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,487.552,488.646,The contracts are in the record.
1982.81-1020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.02,495.066,--And they allow escalation of prices.
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,495.066,496.112,--The contracts?
1982.81-1020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.112,496.659,Uh-huh.
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,496.659,502.265,I am not certain whether... The price escalation was not involved here.
1982.81-1020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.42,512.261,"In other words, we don't really know whether your clients suffered any injury."
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,514.26,530.817,"--I think you do know, Justice O'Connor, that the clients who could not pass through the severance statutes as agreed upon and had to swallow that tax suffered the loss of the amount of tax that they could not pass through."
1982.81-1020,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,530.817,537.923,"But, we don't know, if I may pursue it further, whether they could have passed it on in some other form?"
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,537.923,557.665,"I think they could not have because the NGPA mandates the maximum price in both intra and interstate commerce and the contracts, some of which predated the NGPA, specified what that price would be."
1982.81-1020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,794.568,798.27,What is constitutionally in front of us about a regressive tax?
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,798.27,804.471,"Well, I think it is a question of classification and equal protection within the price."
1982.81-1020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,804.471,815.248,"Well, I suppose I agree with you, but you said you are arguing now that the tax is regressive and a regressive tax isn't an unconstitutional tax."
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,815.248,819.184,"Well, it does not apply equally even between lessees."
1982.81-1020,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,819.184,820.745,"Well, no taxes apply equally."
1982.81-1020,0,38944,rae_m_crowe,,822.886,839.097,"Well, what I am saying, I think, is, Justice Rehnquist, that the tax does not apply equally between either royalty owners or working interest owners or land owners."
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,931.17,952.568,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.814,1077.687,"That means the working interest, I think."
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1077.687,1078.0,That--
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1078.0,1080.032,Normally.
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1080.032,1085.232,"--As construed by the state, that is what it means."
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.349,1110.129,The two percent specifically excluded the royalty owner... the amendment?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1110.129,1133.696,"--Well, it depends, if the Court please, on whether they have by implication repealed the definition of producer which we do not think that they have because, among other things, the statute continues to say that the tax shall be imposed on all of the production including the share of the royalty owner."
1982.81-1020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1183.334,1197.875,Do you have a position on the question of the position now taken by the Commissioner that the tax in effect could be passed on if you call it something else and just raise the price?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1197.875,1204.121,"--Yes, I do, Justice O'Connor, and I recall your question to Mr. Crowe on that subject."
1982.81-1020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1233.844,1238.28,You think that Alabama Supreme Court opinion was equivocal on that point?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1238.28,1241.903,I do not understand the language of the--
1982.81-1020,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1241.903,1253.008,"The language, at least, does not make it crystal clear, and I wonder whether that is not a question for the state law courts rather than a question for us?"
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1253.008,1256.131,--I do not understand what the Supreme Court has said.
1982.81-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1289.493,1294.757,"Mr. Arendall, you mentioned two questions that you saw in this case."
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1307.829,1309.641,"Well, that is certainly an additional--"
1982.81-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1309.641,1311.702,I have not heard the word preemption from anyone yet.
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1311.702,1314.296,--That is certainly an additional question if Your Honor please.
1982.81-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1345.768,1348.954,"Well, are you going to discuss the preemption issue in your argument?"
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1348.954,1351.015,"Yes, I expect to, and I--"
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.015,1357.123,Well how else can you win this case except on a federal constitutional ground such as preemption?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1357.123,1359.559,"--Well, it seems to be that we have three questions."
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.132,1374.708,"And, did you present all of those to the Alabama Supreme Court?"
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1374.708,1378.004,"We presented all of those to the Alabama Supreme Court, yes."
1982.81-1020,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1378.004,1380.768,On both acts did you present the preemption question?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1380.768,1381.971,"I beg, sir."
1982.81-1020,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1381.971,1385.47,Did you present the preemption question on both Acts?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1385.47,1386.908,"No, we did not."
1982.81-1020,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1390.702,1395.919,"Well, then what right do you have to do it on the other Act here if you did not present--"
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1395.919,1396.512,"We have not, sir."
1982.81-1020,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1579.516,1581.109,--Are your clients royalty owners?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1581.109,1587.732,Our clients are lessees and also royalty owners.
1982.81-1020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1624.731,1625.935,"Please, are you going to get--"
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1625.935,1626.263,"--Excuse me, sir?"
1982.81-1020,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1626.263,1628.667,"--Please, the preemption point?"
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1628.667,1639.835,"Preemption... On preemption the NGPA... and that is the only argument that we make in our brief, and I will address that only rather than the EPAA question."
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.305,1701.357,"But, returning to Justice O'Connor's question of a while ago, if the Commissioner... the state Commissioner is correct that the law does not permit pass-throughs, as long as you do not say you are passing through the tax in so many words, do you think there is any necessary conflict with the federal law?"
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1701.357,1708.777,"Well, may I just go back again, if I may to that Page 40 on the Joint Appendix--"
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.777,1711.619,I know that.
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1733.251,1736.484,"--I think, if Your Honor please, we still--"
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.484,1739.779,You would still be making your Equal Protection Contract Clause arguments?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1739.779,1740.342,--Yes.
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.342,1742.404,You would not be making your preemption arguments?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1742.404,1754.664,"If Your Honor please, to get to the preemption question which I think is the first one that Your Honor put to me... I think, yes, we would have a conflict with NGPA."
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.664,1757.414,Because they say you may pass-through the tax?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1757.414,1758.928,"The tax, right."
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.551,1804.689,Just say yes.
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1807.969,1808.563,Right.
1982.81-1020,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.0,1811.359,Thank you.
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1811.359,1818.7,"--And, we would indeed still... even the Commissioner's argument, of course, does not get to the Royalty Owner Exemption."
1982.81-1020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1839.006,1846.159,"Counsel, are you making claim for the taxes that you did not pass-through before this latest interpretation by the Alabama court?"
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1846.159,1858.34,We have not... we are making a claim for the two percent that we have paid to the state under what we consider to be a nonseverable unconstitutional statute.
1982.81-1020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1858.34,1861.136,This is money you have already paid out?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1861.136,1864.713,We have paid the money to the state.
1982.81-1020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1868.478,1876.225,"Are you saying that if the Court interpretation is correct, you still have claim for back taxes that you should not have had to pay?"
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1876.225,1877.084,I am sorry.
1982.81-1020,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1878.131,1895.263,"Well, if you accept the new interpretation by the Commissioner that the tax can be passed through if you hide it enough, do you still have a claim assuming you accept his interpretation... for back taxes... the taxes you could not pass through."
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1898.465,1905.026,"Yes, I would say that we do because we have not, in fact, passed through the taxes, you see."
1982.81-1020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.248,1973.825,May I ask you a question about what you actually put into escrow in the state?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1996.659,1997.331,--Right.
1982.81-1020,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.331,1998.206,The whole two percent?
1982.81-1020,1,18287,c_b_arendall_jr,,1998.206,2006.078,"And the two percent, not the four percent, the two percent is paid under protest and is in escrow--"
1982.81-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.078,2007.343,I missed that.
1982.81-1020,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2007.796,2019.275,"Mr. Breckenridge, I am sure it must be apparent to you now that we are somewhat interested in the preemption question, and we want you to be sure to address that in your own time."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2019.275,2020.525,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1020,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2123.546,2135.182,Now the language of this Alabama statute says that the producer cannot pass on the tax either directly or indirectly.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2135.182,2137.666,--That is correct.
1982.81-1020,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2137.666,2141.023,"Well, you are arguing he can do it indirectly, are you not?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2141.023,2156.142,"What I am saying is that the Alabama Supreme Court, when faced with this statute... First of all, they had certain rules of statutory construction to give the Appellants equal protection and due process that they have to follow."
1982.81-1020,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2160.704,2164.374,You think the Supreme Court of Alabama really decided that question?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2164.374,2166.202,"--I believe so, yes ma'am."
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.586,2183.772,Do you have the citation to the appendix to the petition?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2183.772,2184.927,"--Yes, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.005,2187.457,Thank you.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2187.457,2188.207,Page 12.
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2210.964,2212.417,I think it is 11A.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2223.224,2226.833,--Let me emphasize the language I am speaking about.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2338.866,2348.986,"--But, Mr. Breckenridge, doesn't that mean that the only way the producer can get the increase under the federal statute is to identify it as the recovery of the severance tax?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2353.078,2356.029,"--I do not think so, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2361.902,2374.101,"If you go over the ceiling by a certain percent, doesn't he have to make it perfectly clear for federal purposes that the extra amount being charged is to recover the state severance tax?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2374.101,2374.585,--I would think so.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2374.585,2376.226,"And, is that permitted under state law?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2376.226,2377.069,"Yes sir, I would think so."
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.069,2378.366,"Well, then what does the state law prohibit?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2378.366,2397.107,"The state law simply prohibits billing the consumer, when he gets the gasoline or the fuel oil or whatever it is used for, saying the price of this gasoline is $1.09 a gallon plus 3 cents increase severance charge."
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.107,2398.529,Which is put on to recover the severance tax.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2403.949,2412.601,"But, the federal law does not prohibit... the federal law does not require that the tax be added to the maximum lawful price."
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.49,2424.674,It does say that you can raise your price by the amount of a severance tax if you have separately billed or charged the severance tax.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2424.674,2424.909,That is correct.
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2448.414,2450.46,Let me give you two examples.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2466.439,2473.513,If you say the price is a dollar plus two percent tax... as we go into a... Can I draw an analogy real quick?
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2473.513,2475.294,Perhaps you could just answer that and then--
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2475.294,2478.386,I would say that you could not do it that way.
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2478.386,2488.601,"--But, supposing you have... you bill the person $1.02 and say two cents of this is for--"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2488.601,2490.414,You could do it that way.
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2490.414,2498.599,"--But, do you think you could recover... Do you think you could raise your price under the NGPA if you did it that way?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2498.599,2499.38,"Yes, I think you could."
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2512.967,2519.59,"What is the state interest in requiring the billing procedure to follow a precise form, one form rather than another?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2529.243,2545.799,"In Alabama, we have certain rules, statutory construction, that the Commissioner of Revenue has to follow and even the Supreme Court follows these rules in Alabama and that is that you don't try to find out the motives of why the legislature--"
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.799,2548.454,You don't really care whether there is a reason for it or not.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2548.454,2551.0,--As long it is not palpably arbitrated erroneously.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.0,2554.935,"Why isn't it palpably arbitrated, say you must follow this form rather than another?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2554.935,2558.996,I think they... I think the legislature has full discretion.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2568.257,2573.068,Even if you cannot identify a rational basis for doing it for that requirement?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2573.068,2578.239,--I think a rational basis could be identified.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2579.019,2579.753,Tell me what it is.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2579.753,2581.034,--I assume that the legislature--
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.034,2584.284,What is the rational basis for saying must bill in this particular way?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2584.284,2595.137,"--I assume that the legislature of Alabama decided that they did not want to be perceived as levying another consumer tax, but wanted the tax to be upon the producers and that is what--"
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.137,2605.087,"Well, if that is the purpose, I would think it would violate the prohibition of the Alabama law however you showed the severance tax on your bill."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2624.689,2631.796,"--Let's look at what the Alabama Supreme Court, some of the rules they were fared with when they saw this conflict."
1982.81-1020,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2688.209,2699.19,"That is where I have trouble, I guess, is the quotation you read from page 12 of the Joint Appendix where you have that thrust in there."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2704.938,2711.825,That is the language that the Supreme Court of Alabama used and we assume... The Commissioner has to assume that they meant what they said.
1982.81-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.825,2726.615,"Mr. Breckenridge, does it come down to... You suggest that Alabama says tax can be ""passed on"" without saying so?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2726.615,2729.552,"No, Justice Marshall."
1982.81-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.596,2738.174,Can it be raised the amount of the tax?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2738.174,2750.981,"--It can be raised... The statute says, and I believe Alabama Supreme Court says implicitly that it can be raised an amount to recover the cost of their paying the tax."
1982.81-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2757.118,2763.772,"If you question and you say what was this two cent raise, you would say that was the amount of the tax."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2764.991,2772.784,That was the amount that was necessary... This is the amount I am allowed to recover from you for my paying the State of Alabama severance tax.
1982.81-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2772.784,2774.284,"But, it is not a tax?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2774.284,2776.409,"It is not a tax on you, no, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2778.688,2780.266,It is not a passed-on tax?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2780.266,2781.032,"--No, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2784.077,2784.748,You want us to approve that?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2784.748,2785.311,Sir?
1982.81-1020,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2785.311,2787.404,You want us to approve that?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2787.404,2788.138,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2788.138,2804.568,"Mr. Breckenridge, would it be fair to say that the Supreme Court of Alabama interpreted as narrowly as conceivable the anti pass-on provision where the legislature said you can't pass it on directly or indirectly?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,2823.562,2826.122,"I would agree with that, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3031.025,3039.505,"This assumes you get by the other grounds that would invalidate the two cent tax, the two cent increase."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3039.505,3042.129,"I am not clear, Justice White, on what other grounds you are referring."
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.129,3044.363,I mean the equal protection and the contract.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3044.363,3052.719,"If the Court rules, for instance, that the Pass-Through Prohibition--"
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.719,3059.481,The pre-emption ground wouldn't question the validity of the two cent increase?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3059.481,3063.167,--Let's look at the contract clause.
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.085,3086.392,"Well, you see, the reason I said... Suppose we thought that the Pass-Through Provisions were invalid under the NGPA--"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3086.392,3086.783,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.783,3097.059,--wouldn't we still... Would we still have to pass on the equal protection and the contract clause issues?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3097.059,3100.792,I don't understand how you could pass on the contract clause.
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.804,3117.115,"Well, how about the equal protection?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3117.115,3120.206,I can address that now.
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3120.206,3122.066,"Well, I know, but wouldn't we have to--"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3122.066,3124.706,The Court could--
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.706,3125.784,--Wouldn't we have to address it?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3125.784,3127.813,--I don't think so.
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3129.219,3144.368,"If they are right on the equal protection, if that issue is properly here, and if they are right on it, it means that the two cent exclusion of the royalty owner is unconstitutional, right?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3144.368,3145.571,"--No, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.678,3194.442,That is their due process argument.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3202.455,3203.829,If the Court decides to address--
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.829,3206.297,We have to decide it.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3206.297,3214.373,"--Justice Stevens, I would sorely disagree with you because not only do they say due process, but they say we were denied equal protection because--"
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.373,3219.76,"You may be right about the label, but let's talk about the royalty owner problem for a minute."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3229.022,3231.631,"--With regard to the royalty owner exemption, no, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3231.631,3232.426,"No, that is still there."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3232.426,3233.582,Let me reiterate.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.234,3253.902,"How do you justify... Say you have one... Two producers, one has a 50 % working interest and the other has a 75 % working interest."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3256.636,3260.196,"Yes, sir, same rate of tax."
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.196,3262.539,The same rate and the same dollar amount if they produce the same amount.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3271.692,3272.739,"I don't know, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.89,3284.968,If you have got 100 % of production.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3296.245,3297.869,--I don't understand that at all.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3301.57,3316.565,"Do you understand they are making an equal protection argument based on the exemption for the royalty interest, because the economic effect of the exemption is to produce distortions in the rates paid by those who actually produce the gas?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3316.565,3320.126,"Well, with regard to that answer--"
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.126,3322.843,"The only exemption is for royalty interest, isn't it?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3322.843,3324.358,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.358,3327.935,Is there another standard royalty rate in Alabama?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3327.935,3329.794,"No, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.883,3356.861,"So, Justice Stevens has to be correct, doesn't he, that if the tax is paid by the working interest and the royalty interests are exempt, then this tax burdens some producers more than others."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3356.861,3363.311,As the income tax burdens people with a higher income than people who make less.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3370.528,3377.509,"Well, again, what is the rational basis for charging one producer a higher rate simply because he has a different percentage interest in the lease?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3377.509,3382.35,--I don't think a royalty owner is a producer under the increase.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3385.177,3386.707,That is a matter of statutory construction.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3386.707,3387.817,That is correct.
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3387.817,3395.829,"But, if you construe the statute your way, it does have the affect of charging different producers different rates for the same amount of gas being produced."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3395.829,3396.907,If you construe it my way?
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3396.907,3397.611,Yes.
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3397.611,3402.17,I say the royalty owner for the two percent increase is not a producer so it would not--
1982.81-1020,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3402.17,3415.399,"No, but the producer... If the producer has a smaller percentage interest in the lease and they all pay two percent on total production, the producer with the smaller percentage is paying a higher percentage on what he actually earns."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3415.399,3427.269,"--If they all pay two percent on their production and one producer produces more, is a larger producer than the others, I don't see how that is a denial of equal protection."
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.258,3471.408,"Mr. Breckenridge, do your opponents say base their equal protection argument on the discrimination among producers or do they say that you may not exempt royalty owners?"
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3471.408,3472.064,They say both.
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3472.064,3473.314,They say both?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3473.314,3473.923,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3473.923,3476.734,Did they use both of those arguments in the Supreme Court of Alabama?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3476.734,3481.529,I think they did.
1982.81-1020,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3481.529,3493.555,Is this discussion of the Supreme Court of Alabama where they cite the state case of Hayden against Watson at page 9 of the Appendix?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3505.456,3508.346,"Yes, I think it was, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3508.346,3517.046,--Aren't there a lot of severance taxes that just hit the working interests around the country and exempt--
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3517.046,3517.983,Yes.
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3517.983,3520.075,--It is not unheard of--
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3520.075,3520.935,None come to mind.
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3520.935,3524.902,--It is not unheard of to exempt royalty owners from severance tax liability?
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3524.902,3525.746,That is correct.
1982.81-1020,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.197,3539.677,"That may be true, but that doesn't answer the equal protection argument insofar that it is based on a discrimination among producers."
1982.81-1020,2,28960,john_j_breckenridge,,3539.677,3551.797,"As I understand Justice Stevens' example, what we... He says you seemed to be treating smaller producers at a different rate than the larger producers."
