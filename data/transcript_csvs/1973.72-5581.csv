1973.72-5581,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.497,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-5581, Steffel against Thompson."
1973.72-5581,0,27565,howard_moore_jr,,29.568,32.856,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1564.417,1567.303,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-5581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.037,1716.984,You don’t contend then here or do you that there was no justiciable controversy?
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1716.984,1719.184,"No, we don’t make that contention Mr. Justice White."
1973.72-5581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.184,1726.407,So that the -- here is a -- here on the face of it is a case of controversy involving a federal constitutional question?
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1726.407,1732.268,Is a case of controversy involving a federal constitutional question but it is exceptionally limited constitutional question.
1973.72-5581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1746.134,1758.531,Would you say then that the Declaratory Judgment Act against Federal Courts contemplates some Federal Courts will use their discretion as to which cases of controversy is entertained which should not to?
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1758.531,1766.422,"Yes, I think there’s two principles they cut against the principle of the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, the right to choose your forum."
1973.72-5581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.657,1808.714,Would both or either of both of those take a three-judge court?
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1808.714,1812.693,"If there’s a due process argument, I would presume that would be true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.72-5581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.693,1821.394,"Well, but we -- as certainly for it to declare a state statute unconstitutional you have to have some federal constitutional grant; I think it would be due process?"
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1821.394,1835.399,"I would take it if the statute is sought to be -- if the statute's statewide implication and it’s generally in value you would need a three-judge court where it is only a single incident as we had here, there was no seeking of a three-judge court."
1973.72-5581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1836.902,1838.951,There wasn’t a contention.
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1847.466,1848.031,That’s correct.
1973.72-5581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.717,1854.8,Why didn’t this take a three-judge court?
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1854.8,1860.605,I don’t think it want a three-judge court because it’s only talking about a particular potential incident.
1973.72-5581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.212,1864.306,"A hypothetical case, would you say?"
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1864.306,1866.818,"No, I don’t consider this to be a hypothetical case if --"
1973.72-5581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.818,1868.501,Because of the prior pattern?
1973.72-5581,1,34279,lawrence_m_cohen,,1868.501,1869.441,Because of a prior pattern.
1973.72-5581,2,27565,howard_moore_jr,,3184.756,3188.686,Several things in rebuttal.
1973.72-5581,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3372.401,3379.221,"In your hypothetical case, does Mr. Steffel doing this in a cubicle rented by him or a store?"
1973.72-5581,2,27565,howard_moore_jr,,3379.221,3412.06,"He is a tenant and of course there would be greatest sensitivity and receptivity to his position because then he would also have a property right as well as a personal right of liberty but there is a tremendous danger that the Declaratory Judgment Act would be pro tanto repeal as Judge Tuttle indicated in his tremendous danger to federalism because valuable constitutional rights may be lost and there would be no remedy, no form in which they can be protected."
1973.72-5581,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3412.06,3422.235,I don’t quite see how it helps you that much to say that Mr. Steffel might be able to do something in his private quarters when we’re dealing with the case where he is not doing anything in private?
1973.72-5581,2,27565,howard_moore_jr,,3422.235,3445.852,"[Laughter]Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, the example is that it illustrates some of the harms and real issues that could flow from withholding the right to seek a declaratory judgment where there is a non-pending prosecution."
