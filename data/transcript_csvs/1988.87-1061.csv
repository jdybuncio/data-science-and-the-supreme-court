1988.87-1061,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.668,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 87-1061, National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Jerry Tarkanian."
1988.87-1061,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,13.464,29.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether the National Collegiate Athletic Association's enforcement of its own standards, among its own members, is state action for Fourteenth Amendment and Section 1983 purposes."
1988.87-1061,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.959,105.333,"The suspension from what, Mr. Lee?"
1988.87-1061,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,105.333,111.642,"From coaching, and from all involvement in booster activities and other intercollegiate activities."
1988.87-1061,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,114.189,118.233,"So the NCAA said in effect to UNLV,"
1988.87-1061,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,122.139,123.139,Not quite.
1988.87-1061,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.512,206.791,"Mr. Lee, did the injunction run against he NCAA, as well as against UNLV?"
1988.87-1061,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,206.791,207.681,--It ran against UNLV.
1988.87-1061,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,207.681,211.227,"Well, then how did NCAA get in the case?"
1988.87-1061,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,211.227,212.992,"Initially, they were not."
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1528.029,1544.632,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I'm looking at page three of our brief here, and I'm reading from the NCAA enforcement program."
1988.87-1061,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1590.893,1598.203,"There is a question that there was state action in the case in the sense that the University is a state actor, and it did the suspending."
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1601.311,1623.224,"The NCAA is a state actor because the University delegated to the Association the right to make the disciplinary standards and determinations and have a rule of conduct, as it did here... and that comes clearly under the Lugar, the delegation... there's delegation under the first prong, Mr. Justice."
1988.87-1061,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1623.224,1626.067,So this is a sort of a joint action case?
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1626.067,1627.597,"Absolute, in our view, yes."
1988.87-1061,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1627.597,1633.986,"Do you say the University delegated to the NCAA, or the NCAA delegated to the University?"
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1634.361,1660.116,"No, the University delegated to the NCAA the right to set the standards, disciplinary standards, with respect to State employees involved in the athletic program, and to make determinations as to whether there were violations of those standards, and to impose penalties against State employees for their claimed violations of these standards."
1988.87-1061,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1660.116,1667.159,"Well, did the University delegate to the NCAA the authority to make the final decision as to whether someone should be suspended or not?"
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1667.159,1697.131,"Yes, it did, and that is exactly what happened here, because the NCAA said that Coach Tarkanian would be, should be suspended for two years, and the Hearing Officer, who held a hearing under the procedures contained, under the NCAA enforcement procedures adopted, said that this is what you are, we are contractually compelled, to carry out that sanction and recommended to the President of the University that it be done."
1988.87-1061,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.093,1722.496,"When you say contractually bound, what... is there a term of years to a membership in the NCAA?"
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1722.496,1724.153,I'm not aware that there is.
1988.87-1061,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1724.153,1728.978,"And is there some liability, some financial liability, if you pull out?"
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1728.978,1734.257,There is no direct financial liability.
1988.87-1061,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1734.257,1737.349,Then how can you say you are contractually bound?
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1740.302,1741.692,But--
1988.87-1061,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1741.692,1742.13,"And said,"
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1749.641,1755.718,"--But as the record indicates, the NCAA is the only game in town."
1988.87-1061,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1766.26,1767.916,This was an adhesion contract?
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1773.226,1781.051,"Well, that's actually what happened in this instance here, but that is the only game in town."
1988.87-1061,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1823.629,1828.173,"Even if it wasn't bound, even if it could just have said,"
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1842.699,1843.168,"Yes, they did."
1988.87-1061,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1861.284,1884.276,"Well, the record looks like the University basically agreed with Mr. Tarkanian here, and did not want to fire him, and didn't agree with the NCAA's assessment of the facts, and chose not to appeal the State court decision that said the University couldn't fire... couldn't suspend him."
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1898.942,1904.361,"I submit that that, Justice O'Connor, is not really what happened here."
1988.87-1061,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1971.069,1981.844,"Mr. Lionel, are we bound by the ruling of the Nevada court that the NCAA is a party and has to be a party?"
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1985.594,2002.633,"Justice Marshall, it would appear that is a... may very well be law of this case, particularly when it came into being at the instigation of the Association."
1988.87-1061,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.147,2015.644,The amicus brief determines what we shall do?
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2015.644,2020.032,I may have to withdraw.
1988.87-1061,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.172,2025.125,"No, I don't mean not, no, I don't mean that."
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2032.044,2049.537,"It would seem to me that one could very well say that the Association should not be committed at this time to say that we claim that we were indispensable, this case has gone on for years only because the Court agreed that we had rights to protect at that time."
1988.87-1061,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.11,2063.641,I thought that's what you were saying all along--
1988.87-1061,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2112.762,2132.832,"If the NCAA is not enjoined from proceeding against the University, and to take steps which might ultimately throw the University out of the NCAA, the victory of Mr. Tarkanian is a hollow one, because there will be no basketball program anymore."
1988.87-1061,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3238.967,3240.701,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1061,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.294,3337.037,"So you say it looks like the university is looking around for a set of rules to have in its university, and it suddenly runs across the NCAA which has promulgated a bunch of rules that it recommends for universities to adopt, and so the university says, gee, here's a bunch of rules, we'll just adopt them."
1988.87-1061,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3337.037,3342.55,"No, as a condition of membership, they have agreed, as a condition of membership--"
1988.87-1061,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3342.55,3345.268,"Well, they just simply agreed to adopt this set of rules?"
1988.87-1061,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3345.268,3345.784,--That is correct.
1988.87-1061,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.758,3378.099,"Let's assume they're wrong on the state action, that Tarkanian was entitled to a remedy here."
1988.87-1061,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3386.095,3398.746,"Because the State court judge said that UNLV had acted wrongfully, and there was a derivative, there was a derivative right from the NCAA."
1988.87-1061,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3411.974,3418.55,"And do you argue that even if it's held to be a state actor, that injunction shouldn't stand?"
1988.87-1061,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3419.941,3420.3,"No, no, no."
1988.87-1061,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3420.3,3421.362,--I've never heard you say that.
1988.87-1061,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3421.362,3422.971,"No, no, no."
1988.87-1061,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.44,3424.439,But that's the argument.
1988.87-1061,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3433.389,3433.561,--I see.
1988.87-1061,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3492.349,3494.568,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
