2011.11-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-246, Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,9.672,12.624,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,44.04,71.976,"Could you tell me who you think would have a valid and timely APA action to challenge what the Secretary has allegedly done here, which is to take lands into trust in violation of the statute per our -- I know that the U.S. is challenging that assumption, but let's assume the reality of the allegation."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,76.094,78.963,There are -- there are two parts to that.
2011.11-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,98.31,98.627,"That, I understand."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,100.044,122.992,"--And the proper plaintiff for a claim under section 5 -- and, of course, there can be other claims under NEPA or the IGRA -- but under section 5 of the IRA, the proper plaintiff would be a state or local government because those are the entities that are directly affected, directly regulated by the transfer of jurisdiction to the tribe--"
2011.11-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,122.992,134.8,"Let's assume a situation where you first promise the land to one tribe, and then, in the midst of negotiations, another tribe lays claim."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,150.726,151.178,--Yes.
2011.11-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,163.736,184.733,"Mr. Miller, you -- you claim on behalf of the government that the decision of whether to take the land into trust has nothing to do with the use to which the land will be put; wherefore, these plaintiffs who are complaining about the use to which it'll be put have no standing."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,218.371,222.608,"Well, the challenge in that case was -- was not just to the use."
2011.11-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.844,230.378,"Well, wait."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,232.98,235.332,"--There was a NEPA claim, for example."
2011.11-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,250.525,255.329,"--Well, what environmental action consequences are there from the mere decision to take it into trust?"
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,260.298,262.333,"Well, that's -- that is true."
2011.11-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.877,282.246,"But the challenge was to -- was to the transfer, you say."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,282.246,286.265,"That -- I mean, that was -- the allegation--"
2011.11-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.265,288.817,"Based in part on the use to which it was going to be put, right."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,288.817,294.871,"--Right, but what -- what MichGO was seeking, what the plaintiff was seeking in that case, was an injunction barring the transfer."
2011.11-246,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,306.362,308.88,And that would be true of Mr. Patchak?
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,349.29,361.264,"--I mean, if they could establish standing, but -- if he had filed within the 30-day period, the Secretary would not take title to the land until there was a full opportunity for judicial review."
2011.11-246,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.383,366.733,But you said -- you said it was important if.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,394.652,406.71,"--There would not be standing for Patchak as a private individual, but there would be standing for a state or local government or, in the unusual situation that Justice Sotomayor suggested, for another tribe--"
2011.11-246,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,406.71,415.915,"So then you disagree with the tribe that said in no uncertain terms, in its reply brief, that this case is not about the availability of judicial review."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,420.136,425.171,--I think we don't disagree with that in the context of the discussion of the sovereign immunity issue.
2011.11-246,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,431.408,451.656,"Well, on the standing point, I mean, does the -- the distinction that you're setting up between acquisition of land and use of land -- this goes back to Justice Scalia's question -- that strikes me as artificial, that the question of when land is acquired is all tied up with the question of what use is going to be made of it."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,463.629,475.937,"Well, it is a land use statute in -- in this sense, in the sense that -- and you're right that the regulations do refer to the purposes for which the land is to be used, but that's because--"
2011.11-246,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,475.937,487.162,"And the statute as well thinks of this as a -- is a statute that's designed to promote economic development, which is dependent on some understanding of how the land is actually going to be used by the tribes."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,487.162,488.864,--That -- that is exactly right.
2011.11-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.479,512.996,Why not?
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,534.242,544.348,"--Because -- I mean, just to take the facts of this case as an example, you know, Patchak's objection is not to the jurisdictional transfer."
2011.11-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,554.22,556.656,"Just to interrupt, in other words, it's not just to the title."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,556.656,564.595,"--Well, I mean -- that is -- the relief he is trying to get is to undo that, but the -- the injury doesn't come from that."
2011.11-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,564.595,565.128,I'm sorry.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,565.128,573.2,"The injury comes from the fact that the land is going to be used for gaming, but in 1934--"
2011.11-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.2,580.121,"You could put that it way, or you could put it the injury comes from the government's taking title for gaming."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,582.889,583.723,--But--
2011.11-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.723,587.543,Inasmuch as the government always has a purpose in mind when it takes title.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,587.543,603.553,"--But for the zone of interest test, the question would be are people who may be adversely affected by gaming on Indian land within the zone of interest -- is that interest arguably something that -- Congress was speaking to--"
2011.11-246,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,603.553,604.053,I'm a little confused.
2011.11-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,604.053,608.421,On what date was it -- on what date was it clear that the use would be gaming?
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,618.726,624.264,"--I believe that in applying to have the land taken into trust, the tribe said what--"
2011.11-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.264,624.882,At the very outset.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,624.882,626.382,--it wanted to happen.
2011.11-246,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,626.382,637.524,What would happen if someone filed a challenge within the 30-day period and then the government took title to the land while the litigation was pending?
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,647.23,649.498,The regulations do not address that.
2011.11-246,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,657.52,658.62,"Well, is that enforceable?"
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,658.62,665.174,"I -- I think that it would not be, but I think that -- I guess I would say two things about that."
2011.11-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,703.346,704.132,"Well, they didn't hear."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,709.717,717.106,"And -- and it was -- it was denied, and he could have sought relief from the court of appeals, and he didn't."
2011.11-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,717.106,724.01,"But nothing -- at that point, you thought nothing prevented the Secretary from moving forward, and in fact the Secretary did move forward even though he had already filed the suit."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,724.01,725.296,That -- yes.
2011.11-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,725.296,725.862,All right.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,728.164,731.866,"Well, because this was a suit that was not filed within the 30-day period."
2011.11-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.283,732.95,So what?
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,732.95,734.235,--They--
2011.11-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,734.235,739.389,Can I -- the -- this is exactly the point that I don't understand.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,779.431,779.847,--Right.
2011.11-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,786.952,787.336,All right.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,814.937,819.674,Because at this point the question of whether to enjoin the transfer from taking place is moot.
2011.11-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,820.091,821.024,"Oh, I don't know about that."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,822.272,832.832,--The relief that's being sought now -- and this is made clear in Patchak's brief in the court of appeals -- is an order compelling the Secretary to relinquish the title to the land.
2011.11-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.472,835.328,"--Well, I don't know how -- how we should treat that."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,856.069,857.29,--No.
2011.11-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.693,864.364,They did.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,864.364,871.207,"But -- and if he wanted to appeal the district court's denial of that injunction, he could have done so as of right under--"
2011.11-246,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,871.207,872.237,He didn't appeal that.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,873.173,874.284,--He did not appeal the denial of the injunction.
2011.11-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,874.284,883.014,"Well, then your -- your argument is just one of timing and not the fact that the reliance is on the -- is on the QTA."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,895.071,897.774,"Well, the--"
2011.11-246,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,897.774,910.471,"So the fact that the QTA suddenly, deus ex machina, pops onto the scene doesn't mean that it -- that that changes his -- his ground for relief that he's -- that he's relying upon."
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,912.753,924.341,"--With -- with respect, Your Honor, once the land is taken into trust, the -- the only effective relief would be an order taking the land out of trust, and that's what brings this within the scope of the QTA."
2011.11-246,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,924.341,932.709,"Well, that depends on whether sovereign immunity is judged as of the time of the filing of the complaint or as of the time of the litigation of the sovereign immunity claim, right?"
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,935.225,936.929,We -- we think it's -- it's not properly before the Court.
2011.11-246,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.241,974.93,But the Act provides for that.
2011.11-246,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,976.1,983.38,"--Well, but that -- that's just an example of how, as -- as the parties, or the relief -- here it's the relief -- changes, sovereign immunity can bar an action."
2011.11-246,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,987.268,991.094,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,998.951,1001.232,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.92,1042.419,"Well, is -- is that in the -- is that in the Administrative Procedure Act?"
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1053.318,1054.226,The--
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.226,1064.985,"And if you're relying on the Quiet Title Act, that -- that clearly covers only suits which seek to say, I own the land rather than the government, and this is not such a suit."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1070.125,1071.841,"--For two reasons, Justice Scalia."
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.908,1101.628,"No, but the relief to be sought under the Quiet Title Act is title in the plaintiff."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1105.704,1106.125,--No--
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.125,1114.529,"Now, on the way to that, you may -- you may get some injunctive remedy, but the basis for the lawsuit is -- is not: I own the land."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1114.529,1120.136,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, you can get no injunctive relief whatsoever even if you are asserting title."
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.239,1129.428,"Relief in that kind of suit, yes."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1129.428,1129.834,Yes--
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1129.834,1132.006,Relief in that kind of suit.
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1133.566,1134.018,--But -- no.
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1149.297,1149.827,Excuse me.
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1150.982,1151.874,--I'm sorry.
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1157.041,1160.336,Okay.
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1160.336,1165.648,"And right -- subsection (a), the second line, all right:"
2011.11-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1172.443,1173.972,"Ms. Millett, it also says: ""Under this section""."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1173.972,1174.518,--Yes.
2011.11-246,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1174.518,1178.363,And the section describes the complaint.
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1202.837,1206.069,"No, Justice Kagan, in this respect."
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1257.909,1258.47,"You can say that again and again, Counsel, but it does say ""under this section""."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1263.875,1264.39,--This--
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.39,1270.263,"And if this section applies only to suits seeking to assert title on the part of a plaintiff, it's not under this section."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1270.263,1279.306,"--This section is, I think, defined by what Congress's waiver of sovereign immunity."
2011.11-246,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1287.897,1302.375,"But that -- but you don't -- you can't believe that totally because you agree there is some APA review of an action brought before the title shifts where the claim is you cannot take title, Secretary."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1303.81,1304.2,--Absolutely.
2011.11-246,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.327,1305.733,Okay.
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1335.407,1338.859,"--I think there's a constructive amendment in this sense, because if the only thing with--"
2011.11-246,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.859,1340.703,I don't know about a constructive amendment is.
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1340.703,1341.187,"--Well, let me see if I can explain."
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.87,1393.87,I thought you were going to answer how his -- his complaint constructively changed.
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1393.87,1395.695,"And so after that, he had two choices."
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.392,1423.732,"I thought you were going to tell us how it constructively changed to be an action seeking to have a decree that title was in him, which is what the QTA covers."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1423.732,1424.684,"--No, it was--"
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.684,1425.058,Okay.
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1425.058,1426.356,"--No, because the Quiet Title Act--"
2011.11-246,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.356,1429.511,"So even constructively, it hasn't turned into that."
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1429.511,1448.456,"--The Quiet Title Act, when it says -- when it says the only way we'll give you a relief is if you can establish that you have an interest in the land, forecloses suits seeking to adjudicate -- adjudicate, excuse me -- disputed U.S. title by those who don't even have an interest."
2011.11-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1448.456,1448.877,Counsel--
2011.11-246,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1448.877,1450.016,And against the back -- I'm sorry.
2011.11-246,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1450.016,1473.572,"--Counsel, you're assuming that the statute was passed against a backdrop of complete sovereign immunity; but, if you look at Larson and Malone, it appears as if prior to the enactment of the QTA people could bring suits to say that an officer had acted beyond his or her statutory authority."

2011.11-246,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.729,1646.559,"Well, but that's a question that's not before us."

2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,1871.542,1896.046,"--Justice Sotomayor, Mr. Patchak is seeking a declaratory judgment that the decision of the Secretary that it can take land into trust for this particular band of Indians is incorrect, and that, therefore, the decision to do so is ultra vires; and as an incident to that relief, now that the government has taken the land into trust, that the land now be taken out of trust."

2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2243.186,2248.372,Only to the extent that the land is taken as a result of administrative action.
2011.11-246,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2248.372,2248.388,"No, no, no."

2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2252.572,2254.273,I'm sorry.
2011.11-246,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.273,2254.276,--I thought -- I mean -- sorry.
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2316.547,2319.811,"Thank you, Justice Breyer."
2011.11-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2332.82,2334.337,Forget about the trust.
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2334.337,2335.179,--Okay.
2011.11-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2335.179,2364.698,"Because under your theory of what -- what the APA permits you to do, anytime the government takes land, whether into trust or for any other purpose, the APA permits someone within six years, with whatever definition of prudential standing you want to give it, to come in after the taking and challenge that it was ultra vires, that it was done improperly."

2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2429.594,2431.532,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.532,2431.985,Thank you.

2011.11-246,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2452.242,2459.067,But I think the government told us that the land didn't belong to the tribe in the first place.

2011.11-246,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2465.219,2470.812,"Well, the government did say that the Band was not the prior owner of the tract."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2472.859,2484.492,"--Your Honor, the -- it depends in part, I believe, at this -- at that point, based on state law, what the effect of the Court's decision would be."

2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2525.054,2529.087,"Your Honor, the land itself was partially agricultural and partially light manufacturing."
2011.11-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2533.162,2533.77,Right.
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2533.77,2534.94,But it was all owned as a single parcel.
2011.11-246,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2537.424,2542.485,"But your injury, your injury is that it's being used for gambling."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2563.991,2574.036,"--Your Honor, we -- we looked into and wanted to make an argument that somehow you could separate the trust title status and the Federal Government's fee simple interest."

2011.11-246,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2619.173,2628.574,"The Indian Reorganization Act, just to help pursue the question a little bit further, has a provision about the public interest, but not in the section which you're relying on."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2631.557,2635.445,"--Yes, Your Honor, section 463 of the Indian Gaming Act--"
2011.11-246,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2635.445,2638.35,"does, but you're going under 465."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2638.35,2639.832,"--Correct, we're under 465, our Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2664.29,2668.427,What is the specific provision of the IRA that you rely on?
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2674.674,2678.425,"--Your Honor, I agree that section 465 does not specifically reference the public interest."
2011.11-246,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2745.677,2746.35,That's helpful.

2011.11-246,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2808.435,2810.401,"But that was under the MichGO suit, not yours."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2810.401,2811.044,"No, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2814.043,2815.618,"Oh, your suit had been filed at that point."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2815.618,2816.086,--Correct.
2011.11-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2816.086,2819.008,"--Mr. Nelson, could I understand the scope of your argument?"
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2850.261,2851.774,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2851.774,2855.522,So your argument really has nothing to do with the question of timing.
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2861.227,2877.328,"Your Honor, we believe that that is a logical result; but, we do not believe that the Court needs to address that issue in this case because our argument is much stronger than that because we did, in fact, file suit before the land was taken into trust."
2011.11-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2877.328,2884.842,"Well, as I understood your brief, 49 pages of it were about one thing, and there's one footnote that's about something else."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2910.329,2937.272,"Your Honor, I would disagree that it is our weakest point, but I do agree that the -- that the logic here of the position that this is not a Quiet Title Act action means that even if the government acquires title to the land while the suit is pending, that, logically, it would then follow that the action remains an APA action, and it is not converted into a quiet title action."
2011.11-246,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.272,2938.145,I think you're right.
2011.11-246,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2943.16,2951.656,"And the proposition would be simply that the government can't go in and -- and moot out a suit that was -- by its unilateral action, right?"
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2951.656,2952.358,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2952.358,2958.621,"I mean, they seem to recognize that it would be a bad thing, since it's only by their grace, they've told us, that they don't do it right away anyway."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2959.853,2962.009,"Correct, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2962.009,2966.491,Didn't they -- wasn't -- didn't they have some encouragement from a court of--
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,2972.317,2994.558,"Your Honor, there was the Eighth Circuit decision, I believe it was United States v. South Dakota or South Dakota v. United States, in which the court there found that the lack of judicial review pushed towards the conclusion that the Reorganization Act is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority."
2011.11-246,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3005.135,3008.976,I don't think Justice Scalia's argument was a bad argument.
2011.11-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3052.973,3060.406,Is that because you don't have a theory as to why once the government takes it it's not a quiet title action?
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3060.406,3071.902,"Your Honor, the Quiet Title Act by its terms requires that the person who is asserting the action had an interest in the property."
2011.11-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3071.902,3074.854,"So answer my question, or the one that Justice Breyer has said."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3103.59,3104.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3105.591,3106.464,Absent laches.
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3108.2,3109.058,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3116.711,3139.797,"But the bottom line is, under your theory, as long as no landowner, the person most directly affected by the taking, as long as that person can't sue, but anybody who is an indirect person can sue within 6 years, anybody who says, I don't want the land, I just don't want the U.S. to have the land."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3139.797,3143.498,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3164.972,3166.551,But they can't undo the transfer.
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3167.519,3175.938,--Under the Quiet Title Act they can only -- for the 12-year period they can only undo -- they can -- excuse me.
2011.11-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3184.654,3184.981,I think--
2011.11-246,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3184.981,3185.917,Of course the government can fix that.
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3199.568,3200.847,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.847,3202.302,Totally within the control of Congress.
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3209.828,3211.516,"I agree, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3211.516,3212.047,Yes.
2011.11-246,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3212.047,3239.02,"--I suppose the question, Mr. Nelson, though, is whether you can provide us with a reason why Congress would have wanted what you call quiet title suits -- and I agree that your definition is the traditional definition; when somebody -- when the plaintiff is a -- is himself asserting a right or interest -- why those suits should be barred, but your suit involving a third party should not be barred."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3257.699,3280.285,"Your Honor, I guess I would first say that because relief under the APA is different than relief under the Quiet Title Act, someone with a right, title or interest in the property can assert the same claim that Mr. Patchak can, in spite of the fact that they have that right, title or interest, under the APA, as long as they do not seek under the APA to quiet title in themselves."
2011.11-246,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.622,3301.884,What -- what about this as a reason?
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3335.622,3337.842,Your Honor--
2011.11-246,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.842,3347.899,"Once it has told the tribe that they can have -- I mean, this suit could be -- could go away so long as the tribe does not run a casino; isn't that right?"
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3349.634,3352.336,"--That is the gravamen of the injury, yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3352.336,3364.143,"So I guess you -- you could be a happy fellow if -- so long as the tribe doesn't build a casino, whereas in -- in quiet title cases, the only way you can make a happy fellow out of the plaintiff is to give him the land."
2011.11-246,2,36423,matthew_t_nelson,,3364.143,3364.627,"Or to pay him for it, yes, Your Honor."
2011.11-246,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3372.746,3374.903,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.11-246,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3378.025,3380.635,"Mr. Miller, one -- one question, if -- if I may."
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3420.242,3426.617,"If I understand correctly, you're asking about the case where the -- the lawsuit is filed before the land has been transferred."
2011.11-246,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3426.617,3427.647,"Yes, yes."
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3427.647,3439.111,"I don't know of any basis for restricting the government's ability to do that, I mean, short of the plaintiffs obtaining an injunction from the court."
2011.11-246,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3443.845,3446.797,"Well, in other words you're -- you're sticking with your position."
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3455.322,3457.525,--That -- that is our position.
2011.11-246,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3468.459,3470.413,"All or nothing, okay."
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3470.413,3470.741,"--it would be exactly the same, even if it was filed later."
2011.11-246,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3522.124,3523.984,"Well, but -- but in saying that you have just broadened, or arguably you have."
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3544.211,3546.426,--I think for two reasons.
2011.11-246,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3578.725,3588.911,Do other consequences other than the ability of the Secretary to take land in trust flow from whether or not a tribe is recognized in 1934?
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3588.911,3593.267,--I -- I'm not aware of any.
2011.11-246,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3595.143,3595.892,All right.
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3620.961,3636.111,"--Well, this action would be barred under the Quiet Title Act because the Quiet Title Act expressly precludes this relief, where -- where Indian trust land is at issue, where the relief that's sought is an injunction compelling relinquishment of title without the option of paying damages--"
2011.11-246,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3636.111,3639.375,"Of course, that's not the only time the government takes land, right?"
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3639.375,3647.528,"--Well, and the Quiet Title Act, section (d) requires in a suit under the Quiet Title Act the plaintiff to identify his interest in the land."
2011.11-246,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3647.528,3659.648,"Mr. Miller, I mentioned earlier your footnote 1 in your reply brief about whether the time of filing question for sovereign immunity purposes is limited to diversity cases."
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3662.288,3666.581,"I'm not aware of others, but--"
2011.11-246,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3666.581,3667.564,What--
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3667.564,3670.11,--I can't say with confidence that there aren't any others.
2011.11-246,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3690.508,3697.882,"--So this suit would come out the other way if the person objecting was just over the border in -- in Indiana, instead of in Michigan?"
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3701.802,3703.615,"Well, it would--"
2011.11-246,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3703.615,3704.754,I'm assuming--
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3704.754,3708.688,--It would be still be -- sovereign immunity would still apply.
2011.11-246,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3715.404,3721.214,"--Even if it were a suit against the tribe, it would still be not a diversity action but a Federal cause of action?"
2011.11-246,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3721.214,3727.433,--Our point is that the reason it's barred is because of sovereign immunity.
2011.11-246,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3739.207,3741.253,Okay.
