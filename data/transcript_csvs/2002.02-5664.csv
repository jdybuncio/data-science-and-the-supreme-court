2002.02-5664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.589,"We'll hear argument now in Number 02-5664, Charles Thomas Sell v. The United States."
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,9.782,13.386,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,27.961,33.293,"Mr. Short, did that subject jurisdiction come up when you were in the court of appeals?"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,33.293,35.92,"It did not come up in the court of appeals, Justice O'Connor."
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,39.131,40.672,It is interlocutory?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,40.672,45.437,--It's a decision from... it's a final decision under the collateral order doctrine.
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,45.437,46.516,"Well, that's the issue."
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,47.401,49.684,"That's the issue, I believe, yes."
2002.02-5664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,49.684,51.143,No trial has taken place?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,51.143,53.498,"No trial has taken place, not at all."
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.471,128.911,"Well, that's the question."
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,140.458,145.054,"Except by that time, Justice O'Connor, his rights will have already been infringed."
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.958,149.396,"Well, but that's not the point."
2002.02-5664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.455,160.199,We held that in Riggins.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,160.199,169.259,"Riggins... Riggins was looking at a post conviction case, however, and looking only to see if his trial rights had been violated."
2002.02-5664,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,169.259,195.041,"Perhaps it depends on whether we're talking about the right to avoid medication, as opposed to the right to avoid medication for purposes of trial, and the latter would give you maybe somewhat more difficulty under prong 3, whereas the former, the right can only be vindicated by treating this as a final order."
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,207.334,209.515,I would say on all three it would.
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.126,226.583,"Well, are there... are there no ways to challenge that, except in the context of the criminal prosecution?"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,243.731,248.622,"My reflections on that, Justice Scalia, is, it would probably be too late."
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.663,288.389,"What concerns me is, you know, the Cohen doctrine is over half a century old."
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,288.389,289.042,"Yes, sir."
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.042,291.163,It has no rooting in the text.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,339.742,351.817,"Again, Justice Scalia, all I can say is, I think by the time that would be reviewed, filed, and considered, I'm afraid Dr. Sell will have been medicated, and again we've already, of course--"
2002.02-5664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,351.817,369.443,"Well, that's perfectly true, but I think the hypothesis offered by Justice Scalia, at least as I understand it, is that even if that's the case, perhaps he has to wait till the end of the criminal trial in order to appeal it because our policy against piecemeal appeals in criminal cases has been so strict."
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,369.443,374.389,"--I do... I do understand that, but... and again, I think this is unreviewable."
2002.02-5664,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,374.389,380.47,"Do you... do you equate it to bail, bail pending trial?"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,394.053,394.419,Once--
2002.02-5664,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,394.419,395.455,--restored?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,395.455,398.453,"--It's a simple statement, but once he's medicated he can't be unmedicated."
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.453,403.08,I think you're confusing unreviewable with irreversible.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,433.366,438.176,"My view, Justice Scalia, is it can't be effectively reviewed."
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.349,483.67,"That is his... if that is his objection, and if his objection is not that my criminal trial will be distorted, he should bring a separate civil action and perhaps the court would stay the criminal action until that one is, until that civil action is determined, but it's an entirely different procedure to come in in the criminal case and seek an interlocutory appeal from that order, and I just don't--"
2002.02-5664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.67,487.498,--May I ask a question about the back... about the background order?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,494.147,495.726,"Justice Stevens, that is correct."
2002.02-5664,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.726,497.578,And then you got a stay of that order?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,497.578,499.323,Yeah.
2002.02-5664,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,512.136,517.25,"But to pursue Justice Stevens' question, that order was in the context of this criminal case."
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,517.25,518.359,"--Yes, it was."
2002.02-5664,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,518.359,518.751,Yes.
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.751,522.035,The Bureau of Prisons order was in the context of this criminal case?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,528.238,540.305,"He was... he was sent to the Springfield Medical Center after being found incompetent under section 4241, in order to be treated to see if he could be restored to competency."
2002.02-5664,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.305,552.409,"--You're going to brief this issue, so perhaps we ought to, since your time is running out, hear something on the merits of your--"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,552.409,553.359,Very well.
2002.02-5664,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.359,553.775,--case.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,553.775,554.521,Very well.
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.07,589.797,"Is that a finding we have from the lower courts, that he is not dangerous to himself or others?"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,589.797,591.398,"Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor."
2002.02-5664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,663.047,673.414,"As I take it, that's try... that is tied into the competence to stand trial because he thinks that's why he is being prosecuted, is that it, that the FBI is behind this?"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,673.414,676.334,"Justice Souter, that's absolutely true."
2002.02-5664,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.334,676.586,Yes.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,676.586,678.566,That's part of... that's part of the delusion.
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.849,711.545,Then he should be able to stand trial.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,711.545,713.696,--The problem--
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.696,714.468,If he's so normal.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,714.468,720.831,"--The problem, Justice Scalia, is, because of his delusion he can't focus on the trial--"
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.831,721.143,I see.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,721.143,723.37,--on anything else other than the FBI.
2002.02-5664,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.37,725.318,"Well, what is your solution for this dilemma?"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,757.406,769.04,"Your Honor, our... because we feel that he is a) medically competent... no one has ever contended that Dr. Sell is not medically competent."
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,777.824,781.526,"But he's legally incompetent, you say--"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,781.526,781.763,--He's legally incompetent--
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,781.763,783.086,--to stand trial.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,783.086,783.801,"--Yes, but he's not mentally incompetent."
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,783.801,794.975,And is there a finding below that medication will... there's a substantial probability he would be restored to competence if there were medication?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,794.975,798.972,"The standard's changed somewhat, but the answer is essentially yes."
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,798.972,806.177,And is there a finding that no less intrusive alternative is available to restore him to competence?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,806.177,807.597,"Yes, there was such a finding."
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,807.597,811.525,And that the medication is medically appropriate?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,811.525,813.603,"Yes, there was--"
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,813.603,814.023,Yes.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,814.023,814.765,--There was--
2002.02-5664,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,814.765,820.94,"And even under those circumstances, you assert that there can be no medication?"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,820.94,822.502,--Yes.
2002.02-5664,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.817,829.546,And what is your general principle of law that justifies your position?
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,829.546,836.122,"First of all, since he is medically competent, he can make decisions about his own person and body."
2002.02-5664,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.122,843.715,"I thought that you might have gone further in your case, and to say the Government just has no right to put needles into pretrial detainees?"
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,843.715,850.754,"Well, on a... at a basic level that is, that is what... we have a... we have a nondangerous--"
2002.02-5664,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,850.754,858.194,"I mean, they can make the defendant wear a hat, put on clothes, give a voice exempt bar."
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,861.871,862.708,--This is--
2002.02-5664,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,862.708,864.475,--You don't exactly argue that.
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,864.475,866.658,"--This is very different, Your Honor."
2002.02-5664,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.456,877.92,"Well, you say he's nondangerous."
2002.02-5664,0,18059,barry_a_short,,880.575,883.177,"He was charged with that offense, yes."
2002.02-5664,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.177,886.873,He doesn't sound nondangerous.
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1602.127,1606.642,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-5664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1687.278,1695.786,"Well, it's not just they're unreviewable, Mr. Dreeben, but it would... I think we said in those cases there the claim was a right not to be tried."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1695.786,1696.833,"--Correct, and--"
2002.02-5664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1696.833,1698.106,Not to be tried at all.
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1698.106,1700.955,--that right would be lost if the trial occurs.
2002.02-5664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1708.338,1716.492,"Well, what if... what if... what if someone says, I claim a right to be tried without this evidence that I want suppressed but the court has ruled otherwise?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1716.492,1725.991,"Well, that's right and that's because the court has concluded that there is no right not to be tried in the relevant sense without particular evidence that will be suppressed."
2002.02-5664,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.253,1787.558,"Well, I... I'd be less worried if, if all that was before us here is the up or down question whether you have an absolute right to refuse medication, and once that is disposed of, the issue goes away, but that's not what's before us here."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1823.756,1849.203,"Justice Scalia, I'm a little bit less concerned about the practical consequences, although I share the view that the delay of the criminal case and, more importantly, concretely here, the delay in starting the medication is a critical problem that results from collateral order review, but there are two things that I think reduce any of the costs associated with permitting collateral order review."
2002.02-5664,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1894.661,1901.492,"But it would certainly be a new exception to the collateral order doctrine, would it not?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1901.492,1911.551,"--It would be a new exception as applied to the particular facts of this case, but the standards of the collateral order doctrine I think are met, and there is--"
2002.02-5664,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1911.551,1928.002,"Let me ask you, if we reach the question of what standards to apply, it doesn't fit comfortably in any setting with which we're familiar, strict scrutiny, rational basis test."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1938.778,1945.469,"--Justice O'Connor, I do think that a heightened form of review is appropriate."
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1972.111,1978.056,How... how do you describe the authority of the Government to make this order at all?
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1987.275,1999.89,"In order to render the defendant competent to stand trial, Your Honor, the Government would have to have some sort of a finding that would justify--"
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1999.89,2008.531,"Well, you have... you have this... this... this case, let's assume it's this person, and only with the hypothetical alteration that I've given."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2012.327,2015.77,"--Well, I don't think that that makes any difference at all, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2015.77,2022.815,"--All right, so what is the authority of the Government to go out and force him to be medicated so that he behaves the way the Government wants him to at trial?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2022.815,2034.518,"Well, the Government's authority here is the... derives from the fact that Dr. Sell has been indicted on serious criminal charges, and he has been... been found incompetent to stand trial on those charges."
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2043.704,2046.101,Could you inoculate a material witness?
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2052.504,2064.48,"It's the same due process question as presented here, Justice Kennedy, with the possible difference that our interests may be greater with respect to a person who has been charged than with respect to a person who has not."
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2067.273,2072.464,"I fully understand that, and I want to know if they can be medicated and what your authority is for doing it."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2072.464,2081.289,"Well, the authority would be an application of any principle that this Court adopts in this case to permit us to medicate the defendant."
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2098.974,2103.621,"Well, at... at the very least it seems to me that you should have statutory authority for doing this."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2108.987,2113.703,"Well, I think maybe it's important to back up and look at how this case came to be before the Court."
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2144.483,2147.071,"--But that, that was competency for trial."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2153.857,2160.4,"No, the regulations do indeed address the potential of medication for the purpose of rendering competence to stand trial."
2002.02-5664,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2185.746,2192.153,"Mr. Dreeben, can you back up just for a minute, because there's a piece of this that I'm not clear on."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2212.359,2227.748,"--The administrative order, and it's the same administrative order that I referred to in answering Justice Kennedy's question, Justice Ginsburg, does rest on both restoration of competency and to a certain extent on concerns about danger."
2002.02-5664,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2309.724,2315.738,Can we get your answer to the question that Justice Scalia asked Mr. Short?
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2325.886,2348.735,"Well, at that point, Mr. Short is correct that under 4241 he would then be referred over to the director of a medical facility where he would be held for confinement to determine, pursuant to section 4246, whether, if released, he would be dangerous to himself or others."
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.735,2350.327,"Well, all right, suppose he's not."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2351.64,2351.905,And--
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2351.905,2358.479,"And the question I would like to know is, suppose that you have a person who has very high blood pressure, a defendant."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2365.828,2372.265,"--It is not something that courts of appeals that I have seen have had to deal with, and this Court--"
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.265,2374.157,"All right, so we have exactly the same question."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2374.157,2374.554,--Correct.
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2374.554,2377.731,And so the question is not necessarily about psychiatry.
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2383.44,2386.462,I think it's a very particularized inquiry under the sub--
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.462,2388.649,I don't know why it would be... it may or may not be--
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2388.649,2388.823,--Well--
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2388.823,2426.718,"--different with psychiatry, but then the question comes back to, assuming we have the right standards, which are, I think you and the APA agree, the psychological people, I don't see much of a difference there between you, the lower courts, and the... as to the standards if you can medicate a comp... if you can medicate such a person at all, and so what we know is that you can go to the person with high blood pressure or the person who is seriously mentally ill, and you can medicate him, because the Government has a good reason, where he is going to be tried for murder, assault, et cetera, all right."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2449.137,2457.017,"--Justice Breyer, the question of what would happen if Dr. Sell were living safely in free society is obviously distinct from this case."
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2458.358,2467.919,"No, it's not obviously distinct, because I am assuming a person who is not a danger to himself or others is, in fact, in that position."
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2467.919,2473.673,And it's not distinct because you say the Government has an interest in having him medicated for trial.
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2477.004,2482.793,--I had taken Justice Breyer's question to involve somebody who's at liberty but not charged with a criminal offense.
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2482.793,2485.576,"All right, now, if you want to make a difference, fine, do it."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2514.46,2515.327,Yes to both.
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2515.327,2515.889,Yes.
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2522.397,2522.861,I... I--
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2522.861,2523.653,--If that's... if that's your--
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2523.653,2524.435,--Justice Breyer--
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2524.435,2525.116,--Yes.
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2525.116,2537.225,"--the question that you're asking is, how serious need the offense be in order to justify an intrusion on substantive due process interests, whether they be through psychiatric medication or through blood pressure--"
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2537.225,2541.266,"Oh, that's exactly right, that is my question, because I thought that's what was at issue in this case."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2541.266,2547.371,--And I entirely agree that it needs to be a sufficiently serious offense to outweigh--
2002.02-5664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2547.371,2558.218,"What is... what is the basis for the Government ordering medication in the case of high blood pressure, where... where I would think it doesn't necessarily interfere with your ability to make trial decisions?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2558.218,2570.155,"--Well, to the extent that a person was making a claim that, I'm not medically competent to go to trial because I have high blood pressure, and if I go to trial, I may have a heart attack and die."
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.559,2589.268,"Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you a question that I've been trying to... thinking about for quite a while?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2598.922,2618.253,"--It may be, Justice Stevens, relevant to the analysis to the extent that courts have held that the amount of time that a person can be held for treatment under 4241(d) cannot exceed the ultimate sentence that they would receive."
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.253,2620.242,And is that not true in this case?
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2620.242,2622.982,"No, it's not true in this case for a number of reasons."
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.916,2639.13,"It's the maximum sentence, rather than what the sentencing guidelines would provide?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2639.13,2642.561,"--Well, this Court obviously hasn't addressed the question, and it would be free to weigh in--"
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.561,2652.95,"But if you assumed it was the sentencing guidelines rather than the maximum statutory sentence, is it not true that his period of confinement has already approached that, that time?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2652.95,2653.89,"--Yes, it probably is."
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.453,2663.336,"Yes, but that was not... that was not part of the analysis, as I understood it, in the court of appeals decision."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2663.336,2663.993,"Well, to be--"
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2663.993,2665.598,It relied entirely on the financial crimes.
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2665.598,2679.213,"--You're right, Justice Stevens, but to the extent that the question is, how long can the Government hold him for treatment, he's clearly indicted for attempted murder and conspiracy to murder charges, and the length that the Government can hold--"
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.213,2686.39,"Well, is it critical to your position in this case that we take into account the indictment for... for... for attempted murder?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2686.39,2693.487,"--No, because the Government's position here is that any felony case is serious enough--"
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2693.487,2699.083,Even if the time he's already been in custody exceeds the time he would get under the sentencing guidelines?
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2699.083,2706.926,"--Well, again, if... if a court were to hold... it's not critical to my position, because my position is, it's statutory maximum."
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.17,2751.002,"May I ask this other question, just to be sure I have your understanding on it?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2756.828,2762.306,He has not been getting antipsychotic medication.
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.739,2769.224,"In other words, not getting medicine... I know he's not getting medical, medicine, but has he been getting any other kind of treatment for his ailment?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2769.224,2780.819,"--Essentially, no, and the reason is that there is no other form of treatment, standing alone, that would have any likelihood of success with a person with delusional disorder, persecutory type."
2002.02-5664,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2801.431,2806.297,"Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you to comment on this, on the question of medication?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2846.832,2859.798,"--I... Justice Souter, if a court were to attempt to make an order drug-specific for a patient it would be essentially ignoring the medical reality of what this treatment will entail."
2002.02-5664,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2920.636,2923.096,"Mr. Dreeben, isn't there something short of that, though?"
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2957.64,2963.58,"--Well, I... I think the Court should be very cautious about superimposing a judicial decision making process on a--"
2002.02-5664,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2963.58,2972.238,"But just asking the Government to identify that general class of drugs, not the court making the decision in the first instance."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2972.238,2979.837,"--The... the problem with that, Justice Ginsburg, is that the response that an individual patient has to a drug is individual-specific."
2002.02-5664,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3015.189,3022.347,"But of course, one answer to that is, this is sufficiently serious so that you ought to have to come back."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3048.158,3096.719,"That would... might be true, Justice Souter, if the Government's alternatives were antipsychotic medication and psychosurgery, so that the difference was dramatic between the two forms of treatment that are being proposed, but even looking at the, at the classes of drugs that are at issue here, the atypical drugs and the older generation of typical antipsychotic drugs, there are very important and dramatic differences between them, but they belong to a family of medications that are used for treatment all the time, and the psychiatrist's understanding of the various range of effects that might be achieved is not likely to be enhanced by subjecting that to judicial review, nor are the potential side effects so dramatically different that it calls for an entirely different substantive due process analysis."
2002.02-5664,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3096.719,3105.274,"May I ask you a different question about seriousness, and I think it was raised originally by a question from Justice Kennedy, and I'm not... I'm not sure of the facts or of your answer."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3123.232,3136.384,There is legislation that authorizes and requires the Bureau of Prisons to treat an individual to attempt to restore him to competency once he has been determined incompetent.
2002.02-5664,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3140.44,3142.565,So it's treat for purposes of competency?
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3142.565,3159.334,"--Correct, and it does not specifically refer to antipsychotic medication, but in 1984, when this legislation was enacted, it was well known that, for the kind of psychotic conditions that render a defendant incompetent to stand trial, it's antipsychotic medication or--"
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3159.334,3175.498,"But you say the Government can do this even if the defendant is, is not in custody, and just to follow this same point, suppose a defendant not in custody, at home, is undergoing a hunger strike and he's going to die before the trial."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3177.26,3202.759,"--You know, Justice Kennedy, I'll answer that question yes, but I recognize that it involves a very different set of considerations, because the intrusion through force feeding of somebody who wants to die might be considered to be a very different decision than treating an ill person's illness with medication that is the norm that's used to treat people with these kinds of disorders."
2002.02-5664,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3202.759,3216.006,"But if... but if your... but if your interest is in making the defendant stand trial, it would... it would seem to me that you could per... suppose it was for... I don't... I... we could play with the hypothetical, and your time has about run out."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3219.57,3241.883,"Well, as a matter of the organization of Government, this Court has recognized that the ability to resolve criminal charges through the mechanism of a trial is a compelling interest in maintaining social order and peace, and in order to try these criminal charges, the Government has no option but to attempt to restore competency."
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3241.883,3248.052,What's the most intrusive thing that it's clear the Government can do to get the defendant inside the courthouse door?
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3248.052,3255.786,"Well, it... it's quite clear that the Government may seize the person and hold them in pretrial detention, which is a--"
2002.02-5664,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3255.786,3258.393,"All right, physically seizing him, shackling him, I guess."
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3259.024,3276.111,"--Not that this Court has considered, but this... this kind of medication has to be judged against the backdrop of the nature of the intrusion and the efficacy of the treatment for those people who have this kind of disorder."
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3390.994,3393.693,May I ask one last question before your light goes off?
2002.02-5664,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3401.499,3402.345,"Yes, it would, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-5664,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3402.345,3402.941,"It would, okay."
2002.02-5664,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3402.941,3405.018,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
