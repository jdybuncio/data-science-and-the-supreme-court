1997.96-6839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.119,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-6839, Hugo Roman Almendarez Torres v. The United States."
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,55.137,58.14,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-6839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,163.287,171.673,But you could also say that the person described in subsection (a) shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 2 years or both.
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,172.995,178.177,"That's describing the result of the process, not the person in subsection (a)."
1997.96-6839,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,178.177,180.078,"But it's in subsection (a), is it not?"
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,180.078,197.799,"That is in subsection (a), but if you take that clause that I just read, the person described in subsection (a), and you add to it the clause that precedes it, where it says, notwithstanding subsection (a), which the Government itself concedes as a must, that that means despite subsection (a), which--"
1997.96-6839,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.799,206.457,"Well, doesn't that very clause naturally refer to the... to your maximum penalty in (a)--"
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,206.457,206.765,--No.
1997.96-6839,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.196,211.329,"--Notwithstanding that penalty, here's another penalty if these facts are--"
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,211.329,215.501,"--You have to re add words to the statute to get to that result, which is the opposite--"
1997.96-6839,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.501,216.012,"--Well, I don't think so."
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,241.77,251.845,"--First, as to the notwithstanding question, if subsection (b) was to be a penalty or a sentence for subsection (a), it's the opposite word that you would use."
1997.96-6839,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.833,456.75,"I'm not following your argument all... about all of the courts of appeals, because I thought that the Ninth Circuit is the only one interpreting this statute as established in a separate offense."
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,456.75,475.032,"--My point was that in looking at whether or not something is titled penalties, if it's in a separate subdivision, like in section... 18 U.S.C. section 1091, which says (a), basic offense, (b), penalty for basic offense, then that's a signal that (b) is to be a sentence provision."
1997.96-6839,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.468,534.76,"Mr. Fleury, would you go back over your argument about the parenthetical other than an aggravated felony?"
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,536.112,536.863,"Well, what--"
1997.96-6839,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.863,537.651,--argument on that.
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,541.625,548.491,"--Well, if it was a sentence provision, then it would just say in gradations, (a), if you've got a felony conviction you'll get up to 10 years."
1997.96-6839,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,569.454,575.608,"But you can only be sentenced under (b)(1) or (b)(2) also, under that... as it now stands, as the Government--"
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,575.608,587.824,"Yes, but there would be no reason to put... it would... you could only be... you can only get up to 10 years if it was a felony and only up to 20 years if it was an aggravated felony, with or without that clause, but it does satisfy double jeopardy concerns if you view these as offenses."
1997.96-6839,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.824,591.837,"--But the clause could... even if this is a sentencing provision the clause is necessary, is it not?"
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,591.837,592.929,"No, it wouldn't be necessary."
1997.96-6839,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,597.961,603.575,"Well, but the whole point is they want to distinguish between aggravated and nonaggravated felonies for sentencing purposes."
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,603.575,604.406,--Sure--
1997.96-6839,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,604.406,609.609,So you have to have that parenthetical or something equivalent to it in the... in (b)(1).
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,609.609,631.605,"--I don't think it would be necessary for sentencing concerns, because again, if it's not an aggravated felony it still... it's... if it's an aggravated felony, it would be a felony, and that might raise double jeopardy concerns if these are offenses, which is our view they are, because if it doesn't say other than an aggravated felony, there might... it might not survive the Blockburger test, so... but that is not one of our more important points."
1997.96-6839,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,716.229,723.643,"Mr. Fleury, would you explain to me the consequences of accepting your position in two respects."
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,749.592,754.984,The consequence of a reversal is a 2-year maximum penalty in this case to my client.
1997.96-6839,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,754.984,755.983,Because it wasn't in the indictment.
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,755.983,757.846,Because it wasn't in the indictment.
1997.96-6839,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,757.846,784.254,"Now, if it had been in the indictment, and given the certainty of the conviction, I... the defendant would end up with two offenses which would place the defendant in jeopardy of a three strikes and you're out, closer to the three, so why is it in defendant's interest to have this as a separate offense rather than an enhancement?"
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,784.254,789.136,I'm not... I didn't understand the question with regard to he would be convicted of two offenses.
1997.96-6839,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,789.136,792.068,"In other words, if you... you take your case."
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,797.701,797.962,Mm hmm.
1997.96-6839,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,797.962,808.289,"And then a separate offense is coming back after you've committed a felony, been convicted, and then been deported."
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,808.289,811.492,Subsection (a) would be a lesser included offense of (b) necessarily.
1997.96-6839,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,836.747,843.943,But you're telling me that's for sure that you'd end up... on your view of the case you can only have the one conviction.
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,843.943,845.082,Yes.
1997.96-6839,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,845.082,850.027,"And you would not be convicted separately of (a) and (b), so you wouldn't have two strikes against you, only one."
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,850.027,850.395,Correct.
1997.96-6839,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.46,870.511,"Can you tell me if in the plea, the hearings when the judge takes the guilty plea, does the judge in a case with an indictment like this one, which is unclear as to whether it covers both (a) and (b), does the judge routinely ask the defendant about the prior convictions to get that on the record?"
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,870.511,874.012,--I don't know.
1997.96-6839,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.885,898.807,"Was it clear at the time of the plea hearing, or at the time of the sentencing hearing."
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,898.807,900.988,As to the law?
1997.96-6839,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.988,902.06,As I understand the statement of fact... pardon?
1997.96-6839,0,37882,peter_m_fleury,,907.233,917.56,There was a... an inclusion in the factual resume which was... which is designed to meet the requirements of the Rule 11 factual basis that he had three prior convictions--
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1506.125,1511.288,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-6839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.876,1697.934,"May I ask, just to be sure I understand the posture of the case, the case, the hypothetical case that troubles me is one... unlike this case."
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1736.789,1742.372,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's what I meant before when I explained that this was the paradigmatic sentencing factor."
1997.96-6839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1744.372,1753.329,"But normally it's a paradigmatic sentencing factor that does not increase the range of punishment beyond the previous maximum, which was true in McMillan, for example."
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1763.627,1765.607,"--Well, Your Honor, a couple of responses."
1997.96-6839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.443,1816.763,Wasn't the argument in that case that it was--
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1816.763,1817.181,--maximum--
1997.96-6839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1817.181,1818.874,--double jeopardy to do that?
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1818.874,1820.133,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.96-6839,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.552,1847.473,Is... do you apply that to all situations?
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1881.786,1887.179,"--Your Honor, the question in that case would be, what was the legislative intent?"
1997.96-6839,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.179,1888.139,Okay.
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1888.139,1888.75,And I--
1997.96-6839,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.75,1890.502,They make it very clear.
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1896.813,1903.088,"--The second factor that Your Honor introduces is the fact of the death penalty, and different procedural protections of this Court--"
1997.96-6839,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.088,1903.328,All right.
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1907.752,1908.042,--You're eliminating most of the--
1997.96-6839,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.042,1909.164,--Yes.
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1909.164,1920.521,"--Yes, we think... I guess the... to address that question, I guess I would like to address what the Court said in McMillan, suggesting that there is a case over the line where there is some constitutional limit."
1997.96-6839,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.521,1925.914,"I'm sure there is, and I'd like to know your judgment as to what the line is."
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1925.914,1926.314,Well--
1997.96-6839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.314,1932.879,"McMillan said it was when the tail wags the dog, and the question was whether 20 years is the tail or the dog, as compared to 2 years."
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1932.879,1936.863,"--Your Honor, I think one thing that McMillan makes clear, that it's not simply the length of the sentence."
1997.96-6839,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1991.638,2004.537,"May I ask, to follow up on Justice Scalia's... supposing this statute, instead of reading, whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for three or more, it simply said, whose deportation was subsequent to the commission of three or more crimes."
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2006.249,2009.892,We think in light of all of the other factors in this case it would be.
1997.96-6839,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2018.248,2024.142,"Are you sure on that one, because there's been no trial or conviction of the previous commission of a felony."
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2038.811,2040.04,I may have misunderstood the question.
1997.96-6839,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.684,2059.445,"No, but that doesn't increase the sentence."
1997.96-6839,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2099.329,2100.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-6839,2,37882,peter_m_fleury,,2898.997,2900.096,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-6839,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3003.195,3006.097,What is the source of your traditional rule?
1997.96-6839,2,37882,peter_m_fleury,,3006.097,3009.968,"--We... in a footnote we cited numerous, numerous cases."
1997.96-6839,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3038.817,3042.549,"Well, but you don't have to do the same thing again for a recidivist statute."
1997.96-6839,2,37882,peter_m_fleury,,3042.549,3043.15,"Oh, correct."
1997.96-6839,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3043.15,3044.492,So this is a form of recidivist statute.
1997.96-6839,2,37882,peter_m_fleury,,3044.492,3057.71,"But it requires a prior aggravated felony which occurred prior to the deportation, and it has to do with somebody who reenters with the status of a felon, just like 18 U.S.C. 922(g) is concerned with the status of the person."
1997.96-6839,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3093.413,3098.436,Is it your view that also all these things in the drug statute have to be submitted to grand juries... amounts?
1997.96-6839,2,37882,peter_m_fleury,,3098.436,3105.191,That presents a much more difficult question at least in the drug cases in 21 U.S.C. 841.
1997.96-6839,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3110.484,3111.946,Is there a constitutional problem there?
1997.96-6839,2,37882,peter_m_fleury,,3111.946,3114.979,"--In our... in my view there is, but again--"
1997.96-6839,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3114.979,3116.698,So in your view it might be unconstitutional--
1997.96-6839,2,37882,peter_m_fleury,,3116.698,3117.039,--Yes.
1997.96-6839,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3117.039,3121.703,"--to... and therefore all the amounts would have to be submitted to grand juries and in the indictment, too."
1997.96-6839,2,37882,peter_m_fleury,,3121.703,3129.98,"Yes, that is correct, but again... and 21 U.S.C. 841 would present that issue clearly because there is a clear statement that that's what Congress intended."
1997.96-6839,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3129.98,3131.663,"Thank you, Mr. Fleury."
