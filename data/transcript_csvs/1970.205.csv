1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.299,"We'll hear arguments next in Number 205, Bruno against the State of Pennsylvania."
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,43.104,49.955,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,156.733,165.718,"Mr. Quinlan, how is this background relevant to the question whether he can be held in custody pending trial --"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,165.718,166.298,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,166.298,173.575,"-- while he is -- while he is under a finding that he's incompetent to be tried, that's the real issue of the case, isn't it?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,173.575,174.752,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,188.994,192.372,"Against his background, wasn't that almost imperative?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,192.372,193.076,No sir.
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,204.076,206.02,But they -- didn't they know his medical history?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,206.02,207.097,"No sir, they did not."
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,207.859,210.533,Does the record show that they didn't know it?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,210.533,212.513,At that point they didn't know it.
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,212.513,213.646,Does the record show?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,213.646,216.441,"I believe it does, Mr. Chief Justice, yes."
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,273.342,297.23,"In order to maintain that position, you would in effect be saying that a psychiatrist confronted with the statement that he did or may have committed these crimes, and that this was his explanation, would a psychiatrist would not say that this man should be subject to a further psychiatric examination?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,297.23,300.147,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and that's just what they did."
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,300.147,302.632,Shouldn't they have done so?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,302.632,304.41,Not in my opinion.
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,366.387,367.373,Mr. Quinlan --
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,367.373,376.697,"That's standing alone, wouldn't that alert any doctor even if he were not a psychiatrist to at least a strong suspicion that there was something mentally wrong with this man?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,376.697,388.581,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, except with the test for the man's competency to stand trial in Pennsylvania is whether or not he understands the nature of the proceedings against him, and does he have the ability to confer with counsel."
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,388.581,396.877,"Yes, but doesn't this put them on notice that they should make that further inquiry about his capacity to cooperate in his own defense?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,402.003,409.43,I don't think that it can be used to commit him to an institution for the criminally insane.
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,409.43,414.822,"Mr. Quinlan, how long have you had this Sanity Commission procedure in Pennsylvania?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,419.091,420.974,The Act I believe is 1951.
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,458.118,460.414,Let me follow through on my inquiry.
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,469.158,469.655,Yes sir.
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,469.655,470.527,In Pennsylvania?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,470.527,471.529,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,471.529,475.645,How do the two procedures differ?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,475.645,486.493,"Well, I wouldn't profess to be an expert on it, but basically in a civil proceeding, all you would, up until recently, all you needed is certification of two doctors."
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,516.169,523.777,"Well, do I understand that the sanity hearing and the civil commitment procedure are or are not different in Pennsylvania?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,523.777,527.049,"Well, basically now, it would be the same."
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,527.049,531.226,"At the time with this man, were they the same at the time?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,531.226,533.907,"No, they were different."
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,533.907,545.283,One further question; would he be likely to end up in a different institution under the sanity hearing than he would if he were civilly committed?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,545.283,583.497,"The net result, would be -- probably would be the same and that's why I presented the arguments to the District Attorney's and I think Mr. Chief Justice Bell and I know that the trial judge, Judge Heinemann said, that I am taken advantage of this fellow whereas I'm not because the realities of the situation are is that all they have the confession, they have a gun that they can't use and if we went to trial, based on over 20 years of experience, I don't think they would get beyond the (Inaudible), but if they did get beyond the (Inaudible) and John was convicted, what would he get?"
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,604.858,610.15,"Well, now is he likely to end there, had he been civilly committed in the same institution?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,610.15,613.085,"Under present law, if he was -- yes sir."
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,618.202,620.327,"Now, one further question and then I'll stop."
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,624.967,626.618,"No, I'm not sir."
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,626.618,638.277,"Well, my question is and I'd be interested in your reaction ultimately, is whether if you prevail here, the federal system is placed in jeopardy, constitutionally?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,638.277,641.66,And I can't answer that question because I'm not familiar with that.
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.66,660.464,"Could I then just ask you, I take it that when -- when your client was committed here that the commission that was convened found that -- not only found that he was unfit to stand trial, but that he had criminal tendencies, is that right?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,660.464,661.664,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.664,669.175,"Now, let's assume the state dropped the criminal charges against your client right now, would they have to release him?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,669.175,673.263,Yes sir and he'd be -- there's a procedure and he'd be committed to Norristown State Hospital.
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.263,689.362,"Well, you mean the commission -- the commission that is -- enough has already drawn -- enough has already happened in terms of proceedings and findings to warrant his confinement even if there were no criminal charges pending?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,689.362,690.667,Yes sir.
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.667,699.214,And so your claim really is that narrows down to whether or not you can prevent a person from having a trial?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,699.214,699.771,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.567,709.221,"Well, but if he were tried and found innocent, he stays exactly where he is?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,709.221,710.378,No.
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,711.191,711.5,Why not?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,711.5,720.139,"If he was tried and found innocent, they would have to commit him to an ordinary state hospital."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.331,732.909,"Well, I just asked you a minute ago that if the state dropped its charges against him, whether he would stay exactly where he is and you said yes."
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,732.909,733.786,I --
1970.205,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,733.786,737.088,And I thought you said the same -- gave the same answer to the question I asked you?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,737.088,741.765,"I misunderstood what the phrase “stand in the same place”, I mean he would be confined."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.125,748.989,There are enough findings already made to justify his confinement somewhere?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,748.989,750.03,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.661,765.733,Can no one who is committed by civil proceedings end up in the institution that he is now in?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,765.733,767.699,I suppose it's possible if the --
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,767.699,769.46,If they find he has criminal tendency.
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,769.46,770.2,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,770.2,773.153,But they -- the commission here found that he had criminal tendency?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,773.153,779.779,"No, Mr. Justice White but they did it on a basis of an illegal confession where he said --"
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.779,784.947,"Well, they didn't -- they didn't just rest as I understand it on the fact that he was charged with this crime?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,784.947,787.332,"Well, and his army medical record."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.709,798.568,"What's the basis for their finding, the commission's finding that he had criminal tendencies?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,798.568,807.52,"The confession where he says he killed five because they had put the evil eye on his parents and the army medical record, which said that he was schizophrenic."
1970.205,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,807.52,811.674,Were you permitted to put in evidence before the commission?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,811.674,813.354,"No, sir but --"
1970.205,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,813.354,814.298,I mean you could.
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,814.298,818.889,"I could have, but my evidence would have necessitated putting John Bruno on the stand."
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,893.735,900.438,"Well, did you -- did you undertake to have him examined by an independent psychiatrist and have a psychiatrist testify to those same facts?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,900.438,904.282,I have him examined Mr. Chief Justice but I didn't have the psychiatrist testify.
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,912.551,926.583,But wouldn't this have been the occasion for you have the psychiatrist at least indicate the objective factors that would show capacities or understand the nature of the charges and cooperate with counsel in defense?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,926.583,931.497,"Mr. Chief Justice, I didn't want -- I did not want to do it. I didn't think I had to do it."
1970.205,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,931.497,935.396,But that's the way it's done everyday in the week in a great many places?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,935.396,945.3,"I know, but there were no statutes in Pennsylvania that required that I do it that way and I felt that John had been arrested and indicted and charged with five murders that he had a right to stand trial."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.389,964.937,"Where is the Sanity Commission's report, is that in the record?"
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,964.937,965.808,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.808,967.244,In the printed record?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,967.244,967.798,Sir?
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.379,985.487,"And it's your -- it's your position I take it that in an examination such as went on here, in connection with the criminal charge to see if he's competent to stand trial that you were privileged not to have him testify."
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,985.487,985.868,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,985.868,987.207,I mean before the commission?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,987.207,987.986,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,987.986,991.583,Whereas you wouldn't have in a civil commitment case?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,991.583,992.69,That's correct.
1970.205,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.576,1016.028,You mean you can -- your position is that you can stop the psychiatrist from talking with your client in order to decide whether he was competent to stand trial?
1970.205,0,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,1016.028,1017.01,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1210.507,1213.689,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.001,1309.33,Is that the prosecuting attorney?
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1309.33,1310.104,Pardon me.
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1310.104,1312.181,"Who was the he you're talking about, the prosecuting attorney?"
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1312.181,1313.374,"The District Attorney, yes sir."
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1313.374,1314.627,"District Attorney, keep going."
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1314.627,1327.604,"Petitioned the court on his motion as I felt he was required to do to empanel a Sanity Commission under the Mental Health Act at that time, and this was opposed by defense counsel."
1970.205,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1378.123,1382.46,How -- how was that gun linked up to the defendant?
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1382.46,1388.551,"The gun was stolen from a Sears and Roebuck store Your Honor, back in 1960 or 1961."
1970.205,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1403.475,1405.08,Did ballistics tests --
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1405.08,1406.114,Balistically --
1970.205,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1406.114,1406.419,"Now, with any?"
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1406.419,1414.935,"-- it would bear out the fact that this gun, in fact, was used to kill as I recall at least three of the defendants."
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1468.769,1472.168,"Now, Mr. Moss, in addition to that, the confessions were introduced and --"
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1472.168,1472.682,Yes sir.
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1472.682,1482.98,"And there was a sanity hearing and as I understand it, your -- the petitioner doesn't quarrel with the procedural due process aspects of that hearing."
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1507.046,1507.509,Mr. Justice --
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1507.509,1511.18,And the only one as I understand as the case is submitted by the petitioner.
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1511.18,1515.459,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that that is the pinhead of this case."
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1546.364,1547.986,"Well, his point is --"
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1547.986,1549.234,To do this would subject him to an unfair trial.
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1549.234,1563.084,"That our procedure in this country and in Pennsylvania and each of the other 49 states and in the federal system that our procedure for better or for worse is an adversary procedure, an adversary system."
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1586.545,1587.174,I think that --
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1587.174,1592.302,You're on one side of the case and he's on the other and it's an adversary proceeding.
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1592.302,1593.655,I think there is certain --
1970.205,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1593.655,1595.445,And it's not your duty to look after his rights.
1970.205,1,36283,milton_o_moss,,1598.28,1605.828,"We are aware of his position, Mr. Justice Stewart, and we have opposed that for numerous reasons."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2555.174,2563.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, I reserved the ten minutes in rebuttal because I'm afraid I'm not making my point here."
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2581.839,2595.243,"But Mr. Quinlan, there the basis -- the basic finding they made was that he's not competent to stand trial that he cannot understand and cooperate, doesn't understand the nature of the charges, that's why he's being held --"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2595.243,2595.517,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2595.704,2597.953,-- not because of his confession?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2597.953,2620.461,"With the only criminal tendencies, he didn't testify, so all they had in front of them was that he said he killed five people for these crazy reasons and they had no right to conclude that he could not confer with counsel and didn't understand the nature of the proceedings because I was there and as his lawyer, I said he does understand them and he has conferred with me and I'll swear to it."
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2620.985,2625.447,Why didn't somebody have a right to conclude the five killings was enough?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2625.447,2635.453,"Mr. Justice Black, this man and the record shows this was taken into custody with his father, help for 24 hours."
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2672.914,2675.795,"Well, but counsel, perhaps you're trying to have it both ways --"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2675.795,2676.816,"Yes, that would be -- yes sir."
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2676.816,2693.288,"-- if you had taken the stand, if you had taken the stand in this hearing and testified to all that you have been suggesting to us outside of the record about his capacity, his understanding, perhaps that commission would've found that he was competent to stand trial and we wouldn't be here."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2693.288,2694.373,I offered to do that.
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.296,2701.747,Did you have associate counsel there who could've conducted the examination?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2701.747,2729.902,"No, sir and as I say, I'm sort of a volunteer in this case, but the case -- and I think the transcript of the docket entries will show it, it sort of deteriorated into whether or not Mr. Quinlan was going to force a trial on this case and whether the District Attorney was going to able to sweep under the rug the fact that he had announced publicly that five murders had been solved and he solved them with this staff, but now I'm not going to put him on trial."
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2742.95,2749.644,"Mr. Quinlan, how do you count the fact that he's still there and haven't been released yet?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2749.644,2753.176,"Mr. Justice Thurgood Marshall, they'll never, they'll never release him."
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2754.839,2759.783,"If he is insane and if he never gets sane, they will not release him."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2759.783,2761.258,"No, they won't."
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2761.258,2767.092,But this is the independent hurdle which is the hospital.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2778.004,2780.224,This of course asserted by him for trial.
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2780.224,2781.45,That's what I mean.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2782.346,2786.472,I don't get any information from this state institution under the present --
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.472,2788.558,"Now, all state institutions aren't illegal?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2788.558,2793.485,"Well, I don't mean that but they don't send me reports."
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.848,2800.734,"And I also understand you haven't tried to get it, you said that."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2800.734,2802.481,"No, I didn't."
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2802.481,2805.021,"Didn't somebody on this Court asked you, if you tried --"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2805.021,2806.878,I said I did not try to get one.
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2806.878,2807.498,You did not.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2807.498,2811.54,"Now, when this case has been in litigation up to 1969."
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2811.54,2823.405,"Well, assume now that this Court grants you the relief you want, and he is brought back in, where is he going to be brought, to the criminal court?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2823.405,2825.376,"If I get the relief that I've asked for, yes."
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2827.883,2837.714,"And suppose they -- obviously, they're insane in the courtroom than what happens?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2837.714,2839.381,If it's obvious that he's insane?
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2839.381,2842.354,"Yeah, six psychiatrists waiting to testify to say that man --"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2842.354,2844.515,"Well, it's not going to -- it wouldn't happen that way."
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2845.608,2847.154,How do you know?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2847.154,2847.67,"Well, I consulted --"
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2847.67,2850.082,"You're not a psychiatrist, are you?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2850.082,2851.03,"No, Mr. Justice Marshall but --"
1970.205,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2851.03,2852.771,How do you know that they will say that --
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2852.771,2854.013,Because on the right procedure --
1970.205,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2854.013,2856.281,"Before they're going to interpose the defense in insanity, isn't that right?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2856.281,2858.167,I have not pleaded the defense of insanity.
1970.205,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2858.167,2861.111,"And until unless you do, there will be no psychiatrist around."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2861.111,2861.784,Exactly.
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2861.784,2864.811,The prosecution made the psychiatric testimony.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2864.811,2892.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, there was a very solution to this whole case which I proposed under our rules that a jury could've impaneled and the commonwealth could have put their psychiatrist on the stand and without any other testimony the trial judge could've said I declare this man not guilty by reason of insanity and this fellow would've been committed to an army hospital in Coatesville, Pennsylvania with maximum security."
1970.205,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2949.456,2958.05,"Mr. Quinlan, as I understand that the relief you're requesting is an order requiring that he'd be put to trial."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2958.05,2959.197,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2959.197,2971.509,"Now suppose that this relief were granted and the state moved as Mr. Moss said, he had the power to move for a civil commitment, would you oppose this?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2971.509,2975.774,Not if they first directed a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.
1970.205,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2978.892,2980.679,"Well, they do have to do this?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2980.679,2982.877,Well either that or put him on trial.
1970.205,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2982.877,2992.748,"Let me get back to my question. Suppose they moved for a -- started the machinery running for a civil commitment, what would be your response as his counsel?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,2992.748,3005.205,"I would object it because they would have him civilly committed to an ordinary mental hospital and through their inter hospital procedures, they would transfer him to back -- transfer him back to Farview."
1970.205,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.205,3008.043,So that he end up exactly where he is now?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3008.043,3009.335,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3009.335,3010.017,Unless you deal with that.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3010.017,3019.393,"Well, I guess, he's filed more petitions for writs of habeas corpus, the way I've been doing it so far, though I haven't been too successful."
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.971,3035.287,"Mr. Quinlan, suppose instead of that route that Justice Blackmun suggested, suppose the state now, decides to give up and they put -- bring your man into the common police court for trial."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3050.356,3050.655,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3050.655,3059.48,"And then if he decides that he's not competent to stand trial, he's put right back where he is now residing, isn't he?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3059.48,3061.776,"Yes sir, except for this though."
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3079.53,3083.711,"Yes, but you just have the dissenters on your side."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3083.711,3096.2,"It's been my role in this whole case and we've lost over time that -- as I say, if they can do this John Bruno, they can do it me on my home when I cross the county."
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3120.8,3127.057,And the record seems to show that he stated a number of times that an evil eye is on him.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3129.31,3134.32,"They say that in the confession, he said, “Do I know it?”"
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3134.896,3139.069,Do you know whether or not he thinks that the evil eye is on him?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3139.069,3139.639,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3141.165,3149.646,"Well, do you not think it's your duty instead of trying to get him to tried by the Court, to say to the court, that you think he is insane?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3149.646,3155.283,"Well, I don't think you're going to have five indictments because I know Bruno, I know his father, and his -- his father believes the same thing."
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3158.094,3160.002,I'm not talking about who killed.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3168.387,3169.546,Should be committed?
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3177.52,3179.72,Why do you want him to tried?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3179.72,3185.089,Because the army will not so commit him as long as there's a pending criminal charge against him.
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3185.089,3187.546,You want to get him committed to another place?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3187.546,3188.36,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3188.36,3190.324,And that's all it's about?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3190.324,3191.335,"Well, would you put him out on the street, no."
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3191.335,3191.846,But you put him on arrangement.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3191.846,3193.912,No it's not all that it's about.
1970.205,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3196.768,3202.956,"You want to get these criminal charges disposed of because until they are, the army will not take him, isn't that quite right?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3202.956,3203.302,That's correct.
1970.205,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3203.302,3205.782,And that's the reason you're making this claim in this case?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3205.782,3206.996,One of them.
1970.205,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.996,3210.476,"And you would be satisfied if they didn't try him, they didn't filed (Inaudible) the charge."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3210.476,3211.201,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.201,3213.374,He'd still stay where he is.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3213.374,3214.958,"Well, I don't think so."
1970.205,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.528,3234.294,You don't think that Pennsylvania has gone through without proceeding without waiting to hold him except during the pendency of the trial?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3234.294,3238.109,This thing has been going on for five years now.
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3248.755,3252.452,"You think he's not guilty on the ground of insanity, I get it."
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3252.452,3254.499,"No, Mr. Justice Black --"
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3254.499,3255.845,They just can't prove the charge.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3255.845,3260.637,They just can't prove it and I'm not sure in my own mind whether John killed these five people or his father did.
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3260.637,3263.314,They can't prove he's insane?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3263.314,3265.723,"How are they going to prove he's insane, I wouldn't put him on a --"
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3265.723,3266.631,I understood it.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3267.068,3269.21,"The realities of it is, what really annoys the commonwealth."
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3269.21,3271.908,You think that an evil eye was chasing him all around?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3271.908,3283.106,"Well, really the practical problem here is that John Bruno and his lawyer Quinlan win no matter what happens because if they convict him in front of a jury."
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3293.952,3304.669,"Have you tried to arrange with the prosecuting attorney or the judge to do something with the case that would permit the army, to put him in as an insane man?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3306.342,3307.709,I did that Mr. Justice Black.
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3314.782,3317.955,"But you don't have to bring him to trial, do you?"
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3317.955,3319.849,"Well, either that or now press the indictment --"
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3319.849,3322.007,Suppose the Government would agree to take him --
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3322.007,3323.108,They won't though.
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3323.108,3324.101,Have you tried it?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3324.101,3324.972,"Yes, sir."
1970.205,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3327.863,3331.215,Did the District Attorney agreed to help you on that or not?
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3331.215,3334.094,He flatly said no.
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3338.23,3339.106,I think your time is up.
1970.205,2,21396,daniel_l_quinlan,,3339.106,3339.512,"Thank you, sir."
1970.205,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3339.512,3340.806,"Mr. Quinlan, thank you."
