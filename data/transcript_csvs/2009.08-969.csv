2009.08-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.92,"We'll hear argument this afternoon in Case 08-969, Hemi Group v. The City of New York."
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,9.122,11.891,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,99.497,102.299,Why -- why isn't the money property?
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,102.299,110.971,"Money in the bank would be property, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, but an opportunity to collect money is an inchoate interest, and so it would not be property at that point."
2009.08-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,112.923,119.41,"Well, isn't a lawsuit with a potential recovery regarded as property of an individual?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,119.41,131.051,"The lawsuit would be -- the lawsuit itself would be property, but the -- but any recovery would not be property until it became choate, until there was an amount of money assigned to it."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,131.051,136.455,"There is no such adjective -- I know we have used it, but there is no such adjective as ""choate""."
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,141.49,142.24,All right.
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.24,144.24,Any more than the -- I don't know.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,144.74,146.156,"Well, I'm wrong on the -- on the--"
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.156,146.99,Exactly.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,149.223,150.025,"--But I think I am right on the law, Your Honor."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.025,150.608,Exactly.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,153.144,153.927,"Is ""gruntled""."
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,172.355,184.013,I thought the status of taxes owing for wire fraud purposes was settled in Pasquantino.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,208.279,225.74,"--Justice Ginsburg, Pasquantino, the holding there was -- it was a criminal prosecution by the U.S. Government, and it dealt with the term 1964(c) requirement of injury to business or property."
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.446,239.083,"Well, there are certainly differences from this case, and it wasn't a RICO case, either."
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,256.211,261.929,"Justice Ginsburg, once the amount owed is assessed, once there's a determination of the amount owed--"
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,261.929,264.948,There was no assessment by Canada in the Pasquantino case.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,264.948,265.867,--There was--
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.867,276.273,They said the -- the defendant was smuggling liquor into Canada and getting it there without paying the Canadians' exorbitant taxes.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,276.273,284.777,"--The prosecution on the mail and wire fraud criminal -- well, criminal standing was not an issue there."
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.795,290.247,"But we're talking about -- only about property, not standing or anything else."
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,309.041,311.243,"--Yes, Your Honor, for wire fraud purposes."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.378,317.147,So why is this different?
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,327.003,332.257,"For purposes of the -- of the Mail and Wire Fraud Statute, this Court has held that property can be for purposes of--"
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.257,333.359,So it can mean that.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,336.061,376.519,"--At the time, because of the overlying standing requirement Congress placed in RICO of injury to a person's business or property, and because of Congress's reliance at that time on the antitrust laws and the general understanding at that time that business or property did not include the type of sovereign interest in an opportunity to collect tax, as confirmed by the Ninth Circuit and this Court in Hawaii v. Standard Oil of California that this Court affirmed, where the sovereign opportunity to tax is much difference -- different from the actual collection of a -- of a set amount of tax that the government knows it has coming."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,376.519,378.971,"Is the word ""property"" used in the antitrust laws?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,378.971,380.423,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.541,384.641,What does it say?
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,384.641,388.41,The standing for purposes of the antitrust laws is injury.
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,399.718,408.99,"And it -- and it's clear that for purposes of the antitrust laws, property does not include the government's entitlement to income from taxes?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,408.99,410.525,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-969,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,412.658,415.66,The Hawaii case didn't involve a claim to taxes.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,415.66,420.214,"--Justice Stevens, it was a claim of injury to the general economy, which included--"
2009.08-969,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,420.214,423.083,"Right, and parens patriae for the community at large."
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,423.083,424.0,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-969,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,434.224,436.108,But none of them involved a claim to taxes.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,436.108,450.833,"It was my understanding that the injury to the general economy, the underlying claim was that by losing that economic engine, that the State itself would be injured because of the loss to the economy and in its governmental functions."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.869,453.302,"Yes, but that -- that's something different."
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,469.997,474.631,"--Justice Scalia, it's not an identified sum of money."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.789,492.493,"Well, it might have been inchoate but still -- they would have to be prove that, I assume, in the litigation here, wouldn't they?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,499.433,503.968,--They would have to -- they would absolutely have to prove that for purposes of damages.
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,503.968,505.17,So worry about that later.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,517.477,525.481,"The -- the -- what they've alleged here is not that they've lost the taxes, but that they've lost the opportunity to tax."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.287,534.154,That's a different issue.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,534.154,535.106,--It is a different issue.
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.106,536.306,"You're going to talk about that one, aren't you?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,536.306,538.741,"I was hoping for a smooth transition, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.741,539.624,You've got it.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,539.624,552.432,"The -- the injury to the city is much like the injury in Holmes, where the city claims to be at the tail end of the chain of causation."
2009.08-969,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,587.351,613.653,"Putting aside the fact that the Jenkins Act information would be sent to the State rather than the city, why -- how can you -- how can it be said that at this stage of the litigation that it's farfetched that having a statement on the website ""No taxes due"" is -- doesn't cause people to purchase those cigarettes for the very purpose of avoiding the taxes?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,613.653,618.271,"--Well, Justice Alito, the allegations here are not that there were no taxes due."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.248,640.7,"What is it, a user tax once it gets into the city?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,640.7,642.133,"Exactly, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.183,643.985,Like automobiles.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,643.985,645.018,--Pardon me?
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.018,646.102,Just like automobiles.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,654.606,655.208,That's right.
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.664,670.8,"And that's all it was alleged that these websites said, ""tax-free""?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,672.65,674.352,"""Sales are tax-free""."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,674.352,676.068,"""Sales are tax-free""."
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,676.734,678.151,"And ""no tobacco tax""."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.353,683.219,"No -- ""no tobacco tax""?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,683.219,683.855,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.855,686.257,"But there is a tobacco tax, isn't there?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,689.209,692.161,"No, Your Honor, it's specifically not a tax on tobacco."
2009.08-969,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,695.779,701.932,"Why isn't that just a question -- a substantive fraud question, rather than a proximate cause question?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,701.932,703.399,The--
2009.08-969,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,703.399,715.574,"Is it -- is it fraudulent to say ""sales are tax-free"" as opposed to, you know, saying no taxes are due?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,715.574,723.596,"--Well, it has to do with the intervening, Justice Alito, with -- with intervening causes of the city's failure to collect these taxes."
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,742.343,746.211,It was injured because it couldn't find its citizens because it didn't know who they were.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,756.984,758.936,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-969,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,766.959,782.051,"Well, suppose -- suppose you had a case in which an individual that lives in New York goes to a person with a supply of cigarettes outside the State and says: I want to buy a lot of cigarettes and I don't want to pay taxes; can you help me?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,798.361,815.287,I would say that there is no proximate cause for a lawsuit under RICO against the seller who the person went to and said: My goal here is not to pay taxes; can you help me figure out a way to get them into the city in a way that I don't have to?
2009.08-969,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.287,823.56,And you think the city -- and you think the city cannot show proximate cause in a suit for its injury against the seller of the cigarettes?
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,827.194,834.367,"Yes, Your Honor, I would say that there would be an intervening, Justice Kennedy, there would be the intervening cause of the person's decision."
2009.08-969,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,837.319,842.89,"Even though those are the only two people that have made the arrangement, and that was the whole purpose and intent of the arrangement?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,845.925,860.166,"Your Honor, the intent to injure, even if specific, as the Court held in Associated General Contractors, is not itself sufficient to change -- to give someone standing under RICO."
2009.08-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,860.166,871.89,Does your answer to Justice Kennedy depend upon a notion that the causation standard as -- in RICO is different than general proximate cause standards in tort law?
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,871.89,883.031,"No, Your Honor, because I believe that the proximate cause standard that the Court has adopted rests at its core in proximate cause analysis in tort law."
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,934.233,942.07,Can you go back to the question I had asked you and was not finished getting your position on.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1004.227,1012.233,"Justice Ginsburg, Congress could have given the States power to share those lists, but it did not under the Jenkins Act."
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1015.868,1029.111,Is it -- we're told that New York City and New York State have a tax informationsharing agreement pursuant to which the State does share this information with the city.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1029.111,1040.585,"--The -- the agreement, and it's quoted on page 6 of the response -- and I want to get this right -- says, Justice Ginsburg in paragraph 1 of the quote, in footnote 6:"
2009.08-969,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1049.858,1053.16,"Well, what do you do with -- what do you do with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1065.718,1079.127,"Yes, it would be different, because in that instance the city would be the -- would -- would as -- would -- would be the direct victim, would be within the zone of interest of the statute."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1079.127,1086.214,"Are there any sanctions for failing to comply with the Jenkins Act, just on its own, without having to go through RICO?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1086.214,1092.018,"Justice Scalia, it's a misdemeanor violation and it has to be prosecuted by the U.S. Government."
2009.08-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1204.941,1213.381,But you don't -- you don't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with respect to the person who is supposed to be paying the taxes?
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1225.622,1236.346,"It wouldn't automatically be outside the scope of proximate cause, but if -- if it was action that made it more or less feasible."
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1302.455,1313.095,How many people who buy cigarettes out of State come back to their home State and voluntarily pay the use tax?
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1313.095,1322.451,"In the response to the petition, the city said it's a fraction, I believe, of the people."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.218,1326.837,"Isn't there some exemption, anyway, for a couple of cartons?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1326.837,1329.605,"--There is an exemption, yes, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.605,1330.807,"For what, two cartons?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1330.807,1332.307,Two cartons of cigarettes.
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1349.936,1352.471,But it needs the names so it can collect anything.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1357.458,1360.576,--It would rely on its citizens to step forward and pay it.
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1360.576,1361.46,And they don't.
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1361.46,1362.393,And they don't.
2009.08-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.23,1375.753,"It would probably cost them more to collect than -- than it's worth the money, don't you think, to sue individual citizens after they get the names?"
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1375.753,1381.489,"--It's a very expensive process, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, and it -- it's tedious."
2009.08-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1399.451,1415.228,Do we know if these Jenkins Act lists -- are they in fact maintained by the State?
2009.08-969,0,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,1415.228,1424.333,"It -- it's my understanding, Justice Ginsburg, that the State would receive Jenkins Act reports from some vendors."
2009.08-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1532.252,1533.002,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1536.704,1538.656,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.768,1585.401,Excuse me.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1593.54,1594.191,--No.
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.191,1594.992,Well--
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1594.992,1600.46,"The -- it was just -- I was just going to -- yes, it was just a discussion of what was the nature of Wyoming's interest."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1672.509,1674.293,"I'm sorry, because of -- because of what?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1674.293,1675.61,--The fraud of the defendant.
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1689.287,1695.191,"Before you get to Anza, this might be a good time to ask because I don't think we focused on this in Pasquantino."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1715.536,1717.854,As long as they meet the definition of--
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1717.854,1735.916,"--Well, that would mean the States have a new method, which I don't think they use, a new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who makes two false statements or a false statement in two income tax returns, and it would seem to me that would have vast repercussions."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1740.487,1741.653,--If people--
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1741.653,1743.672,"--How, how -- why would it not be--"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1743.672,1744.205,--Why would--
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1744.205,1748.243,"--But they left -- they don't have the RICO predicate, not paying your State taxes."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1752.695,1754.397,--This is precisely what happened in Anza.
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1754.397,1757.264,"That may be, but nobody focused on this issue."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1764.435,1764.868,If you're--
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1764.868,1765.501,Or is there one?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1777.809,1779.011,--But they're suggesting--
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1779.011,1779.711,Or focused on.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1781.212,1787.45,--But they're suggesting a stopping place which is inconsistent with the actual language of the RICO--
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1787.45,1789.516,So in your view California--
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1789.516,1790.318,"--Well, may I--"
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1790.318,1803.626,"--which has a $10 billion deficit, could go through, find every instance where a corporation made two false statements in two tax returns, one in each, and collect treble what they're owed."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1803.626,1807.614,"--If there is a systematic understatement under the statute, that's exactly--"
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.614,1809.164,It doesn't say systematic understatement.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1809.164,1809.614,--It says--
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1809.614,1810.38,It says two--
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1810.38,1810.982,--Correct.
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1810.982,1811.732,--predicate acts.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1811.732,1812.449,And in these--
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1812.449,1815.534,And the predicate acts are a deliberate false statement.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1815.534,1818.236,--And indeed that -- that is what Congress intended.
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1818.77,1822.373,"If they did, then why didn't they put in not paying your State tax returns as a predicate act?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1822.373,1826.991,"--Well, in fact what they put in in 1978 was the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking--"
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1826.991,1828.36,"Oh, well, that cuts against you."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1828.36,1828.943,--No.
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1828.943,1833.979,"Because if they put in one, your theory -- they don't even need, whether they need that or not."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1837.133,1842.085,"Well, the reason they put it in was to increase the criminal penalties as well as recognize the civil penalties."
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1842.085,1843.037,"No, but go back to my question."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1843.037,1844.187,The importation -- yes.
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1844.187,1847.472,"My question is, forget the cigarette taxes."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1866.45,1867.216,"Yes, that's correct."
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1867.216,1868.833,"Well, that's a pretty far-reaching--"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1868.833,1869.3,Well--
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1869.3,1870.985,"--Do you know anybody, any court that has ever said that?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1870.985,1872.937,"--Well, the issue hasn't been raised."
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1895.017,1895.6,Why would--
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1895.6,1896.302,--Why should that help?
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.302,1904.456,"--If Congress wanted that result, why didn't they put in as a predicate act not paying your income tax or not paying your State tax?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1904.456,1909.527,"Because they had a more general definition, and they wanted the broadest possible interpretation."
2009.08-969,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1941.248,1959.31,"Yes, but Congress said -- we were just told by counsel for the Petitioner, Congress said you can only -- only the Federal prosecutor can sue for violations of Jenkins--"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1959.31,1960.06,Correct.
2009.08-969,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1960.06,1961.745,"--not New York City, not New York State--"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1961.745,1962.278,Correct.
2009.08-969,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1962.278,1964.697,--and it's a misdemeanor.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1964.697,1965.53,Correct.
2009.08-969,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1965.53,1980.539,And now you -- you are saying the Jenkins Act gives you a basis to go after what are basically aiders and abettors of use tax violations?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,1980.539,1981.089,No.
2009.08-969,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2036.06,2038.662,But do you know -- do we know that?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2050.135,2050.852,--No.
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2065.645,2066.595,All right.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2078.37,2079.322,Correct.
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.322,2081.239,So all of these would be mail fraud.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2121.716,2130.822,"But in the antitrust case in the State of Hawaii, the reason there that the State was not allowed to sue was not because of the injury."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2147.681,2153.235,But it was injured by the consumer's failure -- it was injured by the consumer's failure to pay the taxes.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2156.203,2157.222,--Correct.
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2157.222,2160.174,"Now, why shouldn't that be the end of the causation chain?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2160.174,2170.863,"Because it's -- while the consumer has failed, we are suing the seller because he set up the ambiance, the environment for the consumer not to pay."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.899,2173.982,You're suing him for setting up the ambiance?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2173.982,2174.515,--Yes.
2009.08-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2188.759,2198.966,"In order to -- in order to -- to prevail on that theory, would you have to prove that these -- these alleged misrepresentations in fact caused people not to pay taxes?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2198.966,2199.566,--Yes.
2009.08-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2199.566,2200.982,You would have -- you would have to prove that?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2200.982,2203.334,"Yes, and that's something we could establish at trial, Your Honor."
2009.08-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2203.334,2204.37,And you think you could prove that?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2204.37,2215.326,"Absolutely, because the response rate of individuals on their own when the Jenkins report is not filed is extremely low."
2009.08-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2218.511,2232.038,What -- what percentage of the -- of the residents of New York State or New York City voluntarily pay a use tax on their income tax returns for items that they purchase on the Internet?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2232.038,2234.139,--I don't know the answer to that.
2009.08-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2235.722,2237.007,Would you make a guess?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2237.007,2238.807,--Probably very low.
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.143,2255.136,"So how can you call it -- I mean, part of the problem with calling it property is there -- there is such a low chance of recovery of the amount owed here."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2272.079,2274.098,--But we do have a cooperation agreement.
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.098,2279.168,"Well, that may be, but the State isn't required to, and the State can terminate that agreement whenever it likes."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2285.905,2298.998,"If you look in footnote 8 of our brief, we point out, even in this case, when we've settled with parties and they've turned over the information we have been able to recover significant amounts of the taxes owed."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2298.998,2313.592,"Does it -- does it affect your ambiance theory that the website has the language that your friend told us is on it, that you have to -- you know, this is -- viability varies from State to State or whatever the exact language is?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2313.592,2313.924,No.
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2313.924,2315.241,That still creates the ambiance?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2315.241,2330.117,"When you look at the website and you have flashing lights that say ""No taxes required"", indeed we allege in the complaint that the entire business model is predicated on the fact that they don't have to pay State and city taxes."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2339.04,2340.159,Yes.
2009.08-969,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2340.159,2362.405,"Could you satisfy Justice Breyer's concern -- and maybe the answer is not -- by saying that if there were a corporation that went around to California taxpayers and said, we have a way to avoid taxes, that then there would be a RICO violation, and that would be closer to your case?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2362.405,2376.748,"It would be -- it would be easier to prove, but I can't dispute Justice Breyer's fact pattern, that if you had an underpayment through a fraudulent return that it may be a predicate for RICO, and indeed--"
2009.08-969,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2376.748,2380.45,"Well -- well, you're certainly consistent and persistent on that point."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2380.45,2381.267,--Yes.
2009.08-969,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2383.486,2389.74,But it -- it would seem to me -- it would seem to me that I gave you a way to differentiate this case.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2394.71,2404.332,"--Well, I do want to reiterate the fact that, apart from the general language in this case, we do have this Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act, which I alluded to earlier."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2462.438,2469.192,"Well, but the definition and giving scope and meaning to the concept of proximate cause is one that's in our bailiwick."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2469.192,2495.909,"--It is, but if you look at -- Chief Judge, if you look at how you've applied proximate cause in the past in Anza, in Holmes, what you said is that there are other factors that are not associated with the unlawful act, and therefore you didn't want courts or juries to have to parse -- parse out legitimate business problems and illegitimate business problems because they become too complex."
2009.08-969,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2501.979,2521.909,"Do we know -- you gave an instance in your brief or two instances of successful attempts to recoup from the taxpayer, that is the cigarette buyer."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2531.248,2549.829,"In the particular cases that we mentioned in footnote 8, they were parts of settlements for the people who had, similar to this particular defendant, had advertised as tax-free, and we had settled with those people to get the reports, and then, based on the reports, we were able to track them down."
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2557.9,2566.255,"Well, you follow up by writing them a letter and what your footnote 8 says is, when you wrote them a letter, about half of them coughed -- coughed up the tax."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2566.255,2566.855,--Correct.
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.855,2568.371,They may have been the foolish half.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2569.371,2569.89,No.
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.89,2572.759,Were the other -- were the other half pursued by the city?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2572.759,2574.175,"Not yet, no."
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2574.175,2575.075,Not yet.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2576.211,2577.594,But that -- but--
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2577.594,2578.561,--It can't be worth it.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2579.996,2590.034,--Here's what would be worth it: If we can stop the fraudulent practices that these sellers represent through the treble damages.
2009.08-969,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2597.707,2620.74,"--Why is what they're doing any different from what out-of-State mail order houses have done in -- they set -- they set up in States without a sales tax, they ship into a State that has a compensating use tax, that, apart from automobiles, I don't know is ever collected."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2620.74,2630.761,"Well, I would like to think that those out-of-State sales entities don't exist solely to try to deprive receiving States of tax."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2650.775,2660.281,"Well, but that's because in every one of those cases, or at least in many of them, we kind of wring our hands and say, well, we don't have any choice, this is what Congress did, and we're faithful to that intent."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2677.159,2686.615,"--But in the proximate cause equation, as you yourself have defined it, meaning the Court, you've talked about unlawful issues and lawful issues."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2700.108,2701.475,No -- I don't understand that.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2707.196,2723.973,"And I -- that's -- that's the way you frame it, I understand, but it can be equally framed by saying the injury is caused by the seller's misrepresentation, which encourages the purchasers not to pay taxes."
2009.08-969,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2727.509,2733.413,So do you say then that proximate cause is in part established because of the specific intent?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2734.979,2735.698,--No.
2009.08-969,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2737.315,2743.352,"--Well, I'm glad -- I'm glad you said that, because the Associated Contractors said specific intent is not--"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2743.352,2743.785,--I know.
2009.08-969,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2753.742,2763.515,"--But in -- in the world and in the lexicon of proximate cause, why is there proximate cause because this was the business model?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2767.586,2773.906,There are no other intervening causes between the fraud and the injury to the city.
2009.08-969,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.106,2777.108,I know.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2798.069,2802.204,"--Because in this case, they don't have any other reason--"
2009.08-969,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2802.204,2808.775,"Okay, and in terms of proximate -- the universe of the law that we call proximate cause, how do you explain that?"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2810.777,2822.668,"--The law of proximate cause in the case you described, you would have to consider all of the issues, some related to the transaction that you're suing on, some not."
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.758,2836.808,Reason on whose part?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2858.008,2864.412,--Except that the buyer -- the seller is advertising it as tax-free.
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2866.678,2875.451,"So it's a mail order house and they put a little line on it, says: By the way, if you live out of State, no taxes, no sales taxes."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2879.171,2889.61,"--As I said, it's a harder case because there may be other reasons why that mail order house is -- is successful, just like you said in Anza, just like you said in Holmes."
2009.08-969,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.597,2896.131,"Well, maybe that isn't completely true."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2907.672,2912.993,Except that the seller -- that's not the facts in this case.
2009.08-969,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2922.598,2923.366,"Well, we were--"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2923.366,2940.226,"--by deliberately not filing as required by Federal statute, and places us in a -- in the position in the circle of having no knowledge of who the buyer is, having affirmative misrepresentation, and we are the only one in this transaction who are directly injured."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2940.226,2943.344,To whom was the affirmative misrepresentation made?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2943.344,2945.211,The customers.
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2945.211,2952.8,Usually you're not liable for misrepresentation unless it causes -- it's relied on.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2966.674,2968.909,"Yes, because of the representation that--"
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2968.909,2969.376,Really?
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,2969.376,2974.03,--they would never contact the State with any information concerning the transaction.
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.934,2990.409,"No, I am sure the purchaser knows: I'm not going to pay taxes, even though I should pay taxes."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3005.751,3016.774,"What I'm telling you, that it's probably easier to go to the corner store and obtain a package of cigarettes than order it over the Internet."
2009.08-969,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3024.796,3039.223,"--But what if the seller didn't make those misstatements but just says -- the whole operation is set up exactly as this one is, but they don't have that statement in there; they just say: Get advice from your lawyer about whether you need to pay taxes or not."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3047.495,3056.351,"I think it's a question of proof, and if we're able to show that these individuals thought it was tax-free, then we should be able to pursue -- let me just say, forget the Jenkins Act."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3091.107,3098.178,"I don't want silence to be interpreted as acquiescence, but--"
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3098.178,3098.861,"No, no, no."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3101.363,3102.013,--Yes.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3102.013,3103.498,--I'm just trying to--
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3103.498,3113.021,"Just to get back at maybe the same point Justice Kennedy was raising, which is you're focusing on -- you keep saying: The whole purpose of this, look at their website."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3132.601,3141.207,"--But we're seeking -- the injury is the opportunity to collect, which we've been denied, which is the Cigarette Traffic Act contemplates."
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.621,3163.271,"Well, I'm -- I'm not sure."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3183.384,3183.767,Yes.
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3183.767,3190.771,But there is no applicable State or local cigarette tax upon the shipment of these cigarettes.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3190.771,3197.258,"But if the shipment is done with the intent of avoiding taxes, which was contemplated by this statute--"
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.258,3198.158,That's not what it says.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3205.947,3206.414,--That's correct.
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3207.214,3209.482,--there is no applicable taxes at the time that they ship it.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3209.482,3212.434,"But if you look at the legislative history, it was directly--"
2009.08-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3212.434,3214.117,"Oh, I don't look at legislative history."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3214.886,3216.102,--May I address the rest of you?
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3216.102,3220.22,"Well, why is it that you haven't argued -- why haven't you--"
2009.08-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3220.22,3246.788,"I don't see a difference -- would appreciate if you would tell me the difference between your argument as to this situation and the typical Internet site where I think a lot of people buy goods on the Internet, because they're convenient and also because they know that they're not going to have to pay State sales tax when they make those purchases."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3246.788,3261.397,"In those cases, you have established companies and you may have to look behind to see what is the reason; why are they at -- I assume they have other businesses that are legitimate."
2009.08-969,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3266.868,3270.57,--Why is that relevant as far as cause is concerned?
2009.08-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3270.57,3294.268,"You have a company that is selling cameras, televisions, whatever over the Internet and they -- you know, you put your -- you put in your credit card information or whatever, and then it tells you, ""sales tax due"", and if they have no outlet in the State, it says ""sales taxes due: Zero""."
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3297.803,3301.422,"Well, first of all, in time, the Internet has raised many issues."
2009.08-969,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3343.082,3364.346,Judge Winter in the Second Circuit said the State appears uninterested in enforcing the Jenkins Act and may not collate or maintain accurate records of reports from out-of-State vendors.
2009.08-969,1,34723,leonard_j_koerner,,3369.9,3376.922,"The State has records, but they -- they've been uninterested in this issue for political reasons."
2009.08-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.922,3379.105,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3383.909,3385.695,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3425.086,3431.724,"On cause, why isn't it a causal connection for them to say, look, your clients don't tell them who's bought it."
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3439.263,3444.734,That would be but for; But for your failure to give us the names--
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3444.734,3445.167,Yeah.
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3445.167,3445.884,--we would have collected.
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3445.884,3449.202,"But why isn't that a direct applicant action, but for foreseeable?"
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3449.202,3452.571,"This Court said, in Holmes, that but for is insufficient."
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3452.571,3452.737,Yeah.
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3460.825,3462.927,"This was an Internet website, Justice Breyer, that--"
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3462.927,3464.16,Forget the website.
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3465.879,3467.831,--Was it foreseeable--
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3467.831,3477.702,"Is it foreseeable that, when they don't know who owes the money, that the people won't pay, but when they know who owes the money, they can write them a letter, and half pay?"
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3477.702,3483.07,--And is it foreseeable that no one will pay or that some will pay?
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3483.689,3484.322,Some pay.
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3486.891,3491.676,It's -- it's foreseeable that some won't pay.
2009.08-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3492.545,3494.578,So you get half-treble damages.
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3497.03,3504.352,"--But, at that point, it becomes speculative, Justice Scalia, and it's -- it's foreseeable that some won't pay, but it's also foreseeable that some people won't pay--"
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3504.352,3508.071,"And, if you put people in front of railroad trains and half survive, then it's speculative?"
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3508.071,3509.354,--I'm sorry?
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3509.921,3515.808,"I mean, if you put somebody in front of a railroad train and half survive because they jumped, does that make it a speculative cause?"
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3515.808,3524.933,"--No, Your Honor, but, in that instance, I would be the one pushing the person, and not the one -- I would be the person, as in Pasquantino, who did not--"
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3524.933,3528.218,And you say it's foreseeable that they won't get a lot of money.
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3529.951,3530.468,--Yes.
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3530.468,3531.52,"Now, what's the answer to that?"
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3531.52,3533.955,That it's foreseeable that they won't get a lot of money?
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3533.955,3538.757,"The reason is because of what your clients did, so it's but for and foreseeable."
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3538.757,3547.862,"It's but for, and it is foreseeable that some -- some taxpayers in New York will not pay."
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3549.148,3549.848,End of case.
2009.08-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3550.914,3557.487,"But for -- no, no, your response is, but for, plus foreseeable, is not a definition of proximate cause."
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3557.487,3559.237,But it's not a definition of proximate cause.
2009.08-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3559.237,3560.104,You need more than that.
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3560.104,3563.122,"That, itself is not--"
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3563.122,3564.991,I took torts a long time ago.
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3566.008,3575.13,"--What -- what the Court said in Associated General Contractors is, even if it's not only foreseeable, but that's your intent, but that--"
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3575.13,3575.597,"No, no."
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3587.421,3588.721,--But--
2009.08-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3588.721,3591.473,No policy reason or others for cutting the chain.
2009.08-969,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3595.925,3610.368,"Isn't it -- well, I don't know, maybe it's more -- but isn't it a proposition that you don't rely on illegal conduct, that the -- the assumption of illegal conduct cuts the chain?"
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3623.008,3630.345,--It -- if we assume that -- that the assumption that they will pay their taxes breaks the proximate cause?
2009.08-969,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3630.945,3634.114,"No, that you have to -- in order to maintain -- this is a helpful question."
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3634.614,3635.149,"--Yes, sir."
2009.08-969,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3637.199,3644.854,"--In order to maintain the chain of connection, I thought you cannot rely, for one of those links in the chain, that a party is going to commit illegal action."
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3644.854,3645.637,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3645.637,3646.623,"Well, that's wrong."
2009.08-969,2,38704,randolph_h_barnhouse,,3685.081,3687.264,"That's a great argument, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-969,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3687.95,3689.933,And a good place to end.
