1956.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,39.418,"Number 63, Federal Trade Commission versus National Lead Company."
1956.63,0,22586,earl_w_kintner,,42.721,47.267,May it please Your Honors.
1956.63,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,135.436,150.777,"Mr. Kitner, did they break it down within the zones so that there could be a great many different prices within this zone depending upon what each other charged or -- or was it blocked out zone by zone where there must be one price?"
1956.63,0,22586,earl_w_kintner,,150.777,154.586,"It was blocked out, Your Honor, zone by zone."
1956.63,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,290.202,295.101,Is the crucial part of the order in issue here what you've got quoted at page 6 of your brief?
1956.63,0,22586,earl_w_kintner,,295.101,295.654,It is sir.
1956.63,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,295.654,300.915,That it --
1956.63,0,22586,earl_w_kintner,,300.915,314.022,The court below sustained the Commission's portion of the order as to conspiracy and that is not at issue here.
1956.63,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1057.493,1061.928,"Is is your position that without this, you cannot have an effective order?"
1956.63,0,22586,earl_w_kintner,,1061.928,1065.382,Exactly sir.
1956.63,1,21890,eugene_z_du_bose,,3358.899,3363.738,Your Honor.
1956.63,2,22586,earl_w_kintner,,5318.104,5342.805,"Turning to the matter of which Mr. Justice Frankfurter has -- has mentioned, it's a position of the Commission that the purpose of this order is to prevent each respondent from using this own delivered pricing system in order to systematically match the prices of their competitors."
1956.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5387.026,5406.337,Does that mean -- does that mean that if they -- let's say they were required to do so that you would have to establish in order to drag them up to determine the disobedience of the order and that (Inaudible) that the burden would be on that they have -- they have systematically tried from that.
1956.63,2,22586,earl_w_kintner,,5406.337,5417.632,"Yes sir that there, they had devised this system and we'e using it for the purpose and with the effect of systematically matching prices and thus depriving the public of price competition."
1956.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5417.632,5422.197,"Now, would you state negatively what they are not prevented from doing by this order."
1956.63,2,22586,earl_w_kintner,,5422.197,5443.563,"Well, they are certainly not prevented from going back, returning to -- to methods of pricing which existed in the industry prior to 1933 where National had 589 different pricing points in 40 states which should have varied from time to time and where Eagle-Picher had a somewhat similar but different pricing system."
1956.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5471.139,5478.381,"What could they do (Inaudible) not to offend your view of the order, and he thinks --"
1956.63,2,22586,earl_w_kintner,,5478.381,5500.873,"That -- that is somewhat difficult for me to answer, if they have -- if -- if two of the respondents have -- have a common production point, I think it's -- it's likely that there would be a tendency that for sameness in price."
1956.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5541.063,5558.037,"Mr. Kintner, may I ask you what Chief Justice's concurrence, if you will be good enough to look at your brief and see if you want to add anything by way of a memorandum to the court on what you conceive to be, the -- the requirements of this contested provision."
1956.63,2,22586,earl_w_kintner,,5574.538,5576.553,We'd be very glad to do that.
1956.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5576.553,5583.322,When the Commission that make -- makes the orders did not even sometimes say what -- what an order doesn't forbid.
1956.63,2,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,5583.322,5595.428,"And Mr. Du Bose raised a question that he has to do the same that this would only affect the nationwide zoning -- zoning prices, is that your understanding?"
1956.63,2,22586,earl_w_kintner,,5595.428,5604.355,"If that is his understanding of my statement to this Court, he is in error and I was an error in making the statement if I may --"
1956.63,2,15037,sherman_minton,scotus_justice,5604.355,5606.46,"Well, I thought that's what he said in his (Voice Overlap)"
1956.63,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5606.46,5607.745,But you have covered that in --
1956.63,2,22586,earl_w_kintner,,5607.745,5621.686,What the -- what the Commission has sought to prevent here is a continuation of a systematic matching of prices by zone delivered pricing system.
