1963.7,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.539,2800.759,What --
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2800.759,2801.761,They said we --
1963.7,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.761,2803.206,-- what happened in the state court?
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2803.206,2817.288,"Oh, they said this is the same argument that was made previously in the -- the Fife case, which was 27 years earlier and while they say that there's progress in the science, we expect that there's just a more elaborate demonstration."
1963.7,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2823.394,2826.401,There's no evidence taken in the state courts.
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2826.401,2845.152,"All that was (Inaudible) Mr. Chief Justice, was that counsel presented a motion for summary judgment with a lot of documentation, medical reports and files and even moving pictures as I understand it, which had relation to the function of the human body under X-rays, X-ray moving pictures."
1963.7,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2858.032,2864.794,(Inaudible)
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2864.794,2867.903,"Oh, I beg Your Honor's pardon, please permit me --"
1963.7,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2867.903,2882.626,(Inaudible)
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2882.626,2882.898,Well --
1963.7,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2882.898,2884.49,(Inaudible)
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2884.49,2885.521,If Your Honor please --
1963.7,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2885.521,2890.874,(Inaudible) federal court --
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2890.874,2891.206,No.
1963.7,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2891.206,2895.617,-- but I don't think that you clearly stated that your evidence has never been included.
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2895.617,2915.181,"I think if Your Honor will look at -- if Your Honor will look at the state court decision, which I believe is in the record, you'll find that they said, ""We apprehend that this is not a new approach, but simply a more elaborate demonstration."""
1963.7,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2917.295,2920.529,But you don't think that they did (Inaudible)
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2920.529,2923.421,I'm saying that they didn't look at it.
1963.7,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2924.621,2926.274,Where is in the record show that?
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2926.274,2931.846,"I -- well, I'll have to say this, Mr. Justice Black."
1963.7,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2953.827,2956.437,Does it say that they did not consider the evidence?
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2956.437,2968.073,It says that -- it's claimed by the plaintiffs here that there has been a great new development in the field of chiropractic and it has made great progress and so on.
1963.7,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2985.771,2988.42,That seems to me to indicate they didn't look at the evidence.
1963.7,2,38625,russell_morton_brown,,2988.42,2989.623,They -- they simply presume.
