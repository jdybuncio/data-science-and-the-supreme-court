2006.06-413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.542,"We'll hear argument next in 06-413, Uttecht versus Brown."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,8.602,11.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,104.797,110.795,"Counsel, may I ask you one thing, which I have assumed, and I think it is correct, but I'd like to be sure of it."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,127.071,129.068,"Not exactly, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,137.814,141.565,Were they told what the... I forget how many factors are enumerated under the Washington law?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,142.845,148.249,"No, Your Honor, it was more a general instruction regarding how the system operates."
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,148.249,148.889,Okay.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,148.889,153.793,In the individual voir dire of Mr. Deal--
2006.06-413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,153.793,166.257,"But one piece of evidence that... one piece of information that wasn't given apparently to those jurors, they didn't know about it, was that life meant life without parole."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,171.942,177.752,"--Your Honor, he learned an hour before his questioning that that was the law."
2006.06-413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,191.857,193.074,And how did he learn that?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,193.074,202.506,He learned that from the instructions given by the trial judge as well as through the statements by defense counsel and by the prosecutor.
2006.06-413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.558,231.855,He gave that as an example.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,239.352,260.594,"That is correct, Your Honor, but the prosecutor in viewing Mr. Deal's responses through the course of the voir dire, the prosecutor viewed Mr. Deal as saying the only time, or I would have great difficulty in imposing the death penalty, unless the person would be released and would be in a position to... to reoffend or kill again."
2006.06-413,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.594,266.232,"Did he say, ""for example"", with regard to the quotation that Justice Ginsburg mentioned?"
2006.06-413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,268.716,272.479,He was asked to give an example.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,281.132,282.614,"That is, that is correct."
2006.06-413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,331.549,352.634,"Would you agree that if we grant your position and grant you relief, that it would be something of an extension over Witt and Darden, in that the jurors in Witt and Darden had fixed views, that they were as a matter of conscience opposed to the penalty?"
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,352.634,359.927,"--Your Honor, I would agree that the statements given by the jurors in Witt and Darden were not exactly what Mr. Deal said."
2006.06-413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.628,368.439,I understand that.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,380.465,382.134,"They were, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,422.322,430.694,"One thing I couldn't clearly discern from your brief is the significance you attached to the defendant's, defense failure to object."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,432.664,436.13,"Your Honor, there's two points made from the failure to object."
2006.06-413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,455.168,462.476,It seems to me on that point that the State is somewhat surprised and whipsawed.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,470.646,471.472,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.502,477.313,How late in the process was... was Deal considered?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,479.797,481.969,He was one of the... the early jurors.
2006.06-413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.95,491.012,This was about a 17 day voir dire?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,491.012,492.12,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,492.978,495.758,"Well, that cuts a little bit against the peremptory."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,501.007,508.081,--Well the peremptories were not exercised until the death qualification and the other for-cause checks are were done.
2006.06-413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,508.081,509.083,"Oh, I see."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,511.832,512.471,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,528.229,532.012,May I go back to the Chief's question about the failure to object?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,555.125,558.704,"I would... I would disagree with that, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,577.928,602.667,"I thought Justice Stevens's articulation of Judge Kozinski's opinion was exactly right but I thought you would in response cite us to page 208a where the Washington Supreme Court said that those jurors' views, including Mr. Deal, would have prevented or substantially impaired their ability to follow the court's instructions and abide by their oaths as jurors."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,606.309,607.822,"They did, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.651,613.772,Is it a finding?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,658.317,662.708,It is from all the facts that the State Supreme Court had before it.
2006.06-413,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.635,696.115,"Well, aren't we obliged under AEDPA to give deference to any reasonable conclusion from the facts?"
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,696.115,697.035,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.035,702.596,"So even if it is just a conclusion, AEDPA still applies to it unless it's a totally unreasonable conclusion, right?"
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,702.596,704.565,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,704.565,710.938,"But the point stands that the court of appeals was just incorrect in, in, in not noting what's there too late."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,713.812,714.607,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,727.666,736.49,"Is this something particular under Washington procedure, this summary and conclusions section at the end of the opinion?"
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,736.49,737.645,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,743.721,744.723,All right.
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,744.723,768.805,"I take it your position is that if the State courts had made or had expressed no conclusion other than the final conclusion that he is impaired, that that conclusion itself would be entitled to AEDPA deference if the record could be read to support it; is that correct?"
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,768.805,769.663,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,770.646,777.287,"If that's the case, then AEDPA deference is more than deference, isn't it?"
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,799.386,813.193,"--Your Honor, we're not saying that there will never be a case where the deference given to a trial judge and the deference given to a State court in factual determinations can be overcome."
2006.06-413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.002,822.033,Isn't this perhaps just such a case?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,835.948,838.354,It is correct the State Supreme Court--
2006.06-413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.354,849.287,"So if we disagreed and thought there was not evidence in the written record that would support that conclusion, we should not give deference to that appellate court finding."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,849.287,864.001,"--Your Honor, but the appellate court finding also was based on the trial court finding of fact, and the State Supreme Court recognized, as this Court did in Witt, that deference must be given to the trial judge, who did have the opportunity to observe the juror."
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,864.001,867.826,But the trial judge made no conclusion about demeanor.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,869.67,872.014,"No, Your Honor, and neither did the--"
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,872.014,878.464,If we're going to get... that takes... it seems to me it takes deference yet one further step.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,897.033,902.563,"--Your Honor, there's no evidence on demeanor because the defense counsel did not object."
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,902.563,906.201,Why is it the defense counsel's obligation to object?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,920.946,921.962,Your Honor--
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,921.962,922.82,Wouldn't there be?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,937.456,950.745,"--Your Honor, as this Court explained in Witt, when there is no objection or no dispute as to the factual issue in the trial court, the judge has to reason to elaborate on his finding and therefore he has no obligation to do so."
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,950.745,989.167,"But that means that the, that the argument for sustaining the trial judge's action on the ground that the trial judge could observe demeanor in effect is the elimination of judicial review on that subject, because we know that if the venire person was present in the courtroom and the judge was present in the courtroom, the judge probably looked at him, and if that is enough to sustain judicial action on the grounds that we defer to demeanor then there's no judicial review at all."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,990.637,998.085,"Your Honor, if there is absolutely no evidence to support the trial judge's conclusion in the record--"
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,998.085,999.711,I'm talking about demeanor.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,1003.506,1004.223,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.769,1019.704,"And if there is no requirement that there be anything on the record about demeanor, then there is no judicial review on that point at all, is there?"
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,1019.704,1025.78,"Not on demeanor, but there can be judicial review on the other facts that are presented in the record."
2006.06-413,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.78,1026.279,Of course there is on demeanor.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,1042.131,1045.189,It is the burden on him to present clear and convincing evidence.
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1045.189,1045.675,And the question--
2006.06-413,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.675,1061.247,"And secondly, he could present such evidence if he showed that there was absolutely no ambiguity in what the person's statements said, so that demeanor could not have made a difference."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,1080.615,1081.489,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1087.596,1094.124,--Is there any way that he can show that demeanor didn't make a difference when the record is absolutely silent on demeanor?
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,1095.687,1103.26,"--Your Honor, he could attempt to bring evidence in a State court collateral... he actually filed a motion for reconsideration as to another juror."
2006.06-413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1104.605,1109.07,"May I ask to be sure I understand the record, because I did miss something before."
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,1119.988,1124.204,The trial judge made no such express finding because there was no objection raised.
2006.06-413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1125.144,1126.828,So that's the point of the absence of objection.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,1129.453,1130.217,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.217,1131.344,Because the judge didn't make the critical finding.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,1131.344,1134.546,He would have made a finding if there was an objection.
2006.06-413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1135.341,1137.322,You may reserve the remainder of your time for rebuttal.
2006.06-413,0,33020,john_j_samson,,1137.322,1138.029,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1138.029,1144.058,Mr. Dreeben.
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1144.058,1145.681,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please--"
2006.06-413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1145.681,1149.241,Please finish up the thought because you're equally well prepared.
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1153.382,1163.018,"--Justice Stevens, this is a record in which the trial judge showed that he was meticulously careful in applying the standard from Wainwright versus Witt."
2006.06-413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1176.841,1185.775,"Does that respond to the possible suggestion that Judge Kozinski made that what he really did was act on the basis of no objection, rather than on the basis of a finding that he failed to make?"
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1185.775,1198.473,"--I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because it's very clear that he told the parties, if you have any question, if you have any problem with any of the objections that are made, speak up and I will intervene and question the juror myself and clarify it."
2006.06-413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1257.272,1260.63,"Well, what is... I know, Justice Breyer; just on this point."
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1264.082,1265.848,"Said ""We have no objection""."
2006.06-413,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.086,1303.3,"What has this to do with the... aside from the explanation, when I read through the transcript, as I have, it seemed to me in the transcript he didn't say a word that suggested he's against giving the death penalty."
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1371.829,1375.514,"--Justice Breyer, I think your question goes to the heart of the case."
2006.06-413,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1375.514,1376.844,"Well, that's probably right."
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1376.844,1393.417,"But the reason it goes to the heart of the case, Justice Breyer, is that you and I and every other appellate lawyer and judge who have looked at this is dealing with a cold record, but the only person who actually saw and heard this juror give the responses was the trial judge."
2006.06-413,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.417,1395.133,So what is it that he could have done?
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1401.458,1402.145,"Well, Justice Breyer--"
2006.06-413,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1402.145,1416.782,"If something like that happened, isn't a prosecutor of any sense going to say, I want it noted for the record that the witness while he said these words was chortling inwardly or something like that?"
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1416.782,1429.262,"--Well, Justice Breyer, there were five separate occasions during Juror Deal's voir dire in which he expressed either uncertainty or a misconception about what the death penalty should be exposed for when measured against Washington law."
2006.06-413,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1452.736,1455.264,"If there is confusion, is that grounds for excluding him?"
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1455.264,1456.515,Confusion alone is not.
2006.06-413,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1463.027,1469.571,"But even at this point, this juror, he doesn't know anything about aggravating circumstances."
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1510.866,1513.413,"I think that that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-413,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1551.351,1554.928,Is there anything in this record to indicate that the judge did rely on demeanor?
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1554.928,1556.226,What is... no.
2006.06-413,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1629.618,1636.364,"But he had not been given, as I understand it, the explanation of what the... I keep saying nine factors."
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1640.736,1647.814,"No, but I think the important point, Justice Souter, is that under Washington law there were really two alternatives, life without parole or death."
2006.06-413,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1647.814,1658.463,"Yeah, but the... the questioning was what grounds are you going to look to make that decision; and he had not been instructed on Washington law on that at all."
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1658.463,1669.568,The concern that I think the prosecutor had and that the judge accepted is that this juror's vision of when capital punishment is appropriate is when somebody will get out and kill again.
2006.06-413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1678.596,1689.812,"But doesn't it follow that his limited cases, the views about when the death penalty is appropriate would translate into views of whether he could or could not impose the death penalty if instructed properly by the court?"
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1689.812,1691.811,"--Not... not automatically, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.794,1696.261,Doesn't it have to be automatic in order to justify the result in this case?
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1696.261,1696.76,--No.
2006.06-413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.455,1734.62,"Isn't there a world of difference, at least it has been my experience in trials like this of what a juror will do on his own and what he thinks the law might be, and what is fair, and so forth, as opposed to what a, the juror will do in response to proper instructions?"
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1734.62,1735.276,--Yeah.
2006.06-413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.276,1737.541,The jurors mostly are pretty conscientious.
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1737.541,1738.384,"Yes, they there are."
2006.06-413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1738.82,1740.599,Is there any reason to believe this guy wasn't?
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1740.599,1742.318,--Well the judge found one.
2006.06-413,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1744.49,1746.397,Well... without... because there was no objection.
2006.06-413,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1746.397,1757.14,"--Well he made clear, if I may conclude, he made clear at the outset as I think I did when I started my presentation, that this record shows a judge who was conscientiously applying the Witt standard."
2006.06-413,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1757.14,1759.14,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,1764.202,1767.228,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1853.102,1855.567,"But that's the beginning of the questioning, isn't it?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,1864.346,1865.971,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1897.086,1902.143,After several times saying the only time he would consider it is if the person is going to reoffend.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,1910.438,1914.216,"No, Your Honor, but I don't think he only said it once out of those times."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1938.471,1940.846,But look at page... look at page 262.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,1947.846,1950.173,"But that is one of, under--"
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1950.173,1951.375,There are others.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,1951.375,1952.56,--Washington law it's an appropriate consideration.
2006.06-413,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1978.613,1996.106,"What do you make of the fact that twice just before his final statement he's given exactly the question whether he could... whether he impose the death penalty in any situation other than when the person might get out and kill again, and he... his answers are at best equivocal."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2010.724,2028.279,I make of those answers as being entirely appropriate under the questions given and also demonstrating that he's clearly not a juror who is substantially impaired or whose views would prevent him from considering the instructions that would be given to him at the end of this case.
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2029.73,2036.149,"What if the... what if the voir dire... what if the juror said just what he said on a few occasions, that I would consider it if the person would reviolate?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2039.916,2045.333,"--Under your hypothetical, no."
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.045,2075.37,"Well, you... you... you insist that he come out and say in so many words, I am going to be an unreliable juror."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2096.19,2111.731,"Well, Your Honor, I agree that nobody is going to say that, although in other cases, in other records and other cases cited by the State here, in fact, trial judges have made records of those kinds of situations, which are not present here."
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.383,2122.786,Why... why was there no objection if this was so clear?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2130.425,2132.207,It is not required under Washington law.
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2133.892,2137.499,"It may well be objected, there were 12 instances--"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2137.499,2137.92,--That is corrected.
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2137.92,2145.572,"--in which the prosecutor wanted to excuse; in seven of those, there was an objection."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2145.572,2147.385,That's correct.
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2147.385,2149.038,So he certainly knew how to object.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2161.72,2162.921,Well the question--
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.921,2172.135,Judge Kozinski thought the reason there was no objection was that this juror came across as being pro-death penalty.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2175.804,2176.494,--That's what he said.
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2177.087,2179.228,You don't go as far as Judge Kozinski?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2180.226,2182.772,--On two points I don't go as far as Judge Kozinski.
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.361,2236.547,"Well, that's fine."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2262.022,2263.707,"Well I think he made a mistake, then."
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.707,2265.832,"Well, he made the same mistake the judge did."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2272.266,2280.483,"Well, Your Honor, the only basis we have for the trial judge's ruling is the objection made by the prosecutor."
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.688,2319.42,Where... where are you quoting from?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2319.42,2321.03,--I'm quoting from page 675.
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2322.262,2323.873,75 of the--
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2323.873,2325.058,--Of the joint appendix.
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2335.336,2339.022,And incidentally the court did not say are there any objections?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2340.598,2342.005,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.324,2357.276,"Well, but the court didn't say is there an objection?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2358.181,2359.167,I'm sorry.
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2362.209,2383.438,"Now on the that, just the language you just focused on, on page 75, if that was correct, you disagree with it, but if if the court concluded that the juror had not overcome the idea that he must kill again before imposing the death penalty, that would be a sufficient basis for excusing him?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2383.438,2402.506,"--Under Washington law, I think there would be a sufficient basis for excusing juror Deal if he said I now know what the statutory scheme is, and only if there's some possibility for release of Mr. Brown and the opportunity for him to kill again, would I impose the death penalty."
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.41,2447.394,You think he could have imposed the death penalty in this case?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2447.394,2447.959,Yes.
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2447.959,2452.113,"What's the harm then in replacing him, from your standpoint?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2452.113,2456.156,The harm?
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2456.156,2462.247,You're complaining about the excusal of a juror who by your own submission would impose the death penalty.
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2464.887,2466.2,Because you don't know--
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2466.2,2468.306,I would like to hear the answer.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2468.306,2470.572,My answer is because it's a--
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2483.882,2493.221,"--You, according to this structural error, so you have a death case, and so you have this kind of error you don't have to prove."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2493.221,2498.392,"Under Gray versus Mississippi, I don't have to... Mr. Brown does not have to prove that it's harmless."
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2498.392,2532.048,"And then you're zeroing in on this particular juror and the colloquy, but shouldn't we look at the entire proceeding of the jurors, including that there were... what was it... seven attempts by the prosecutor to have a for cause excusal?"
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2532.048,2534.392,"There were actually 12, I think."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2556.08,2562.893,I can't say in the vast universe of capital cases in Washington whether that's extraordinary or not.
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2562.893,2563.517,Thank you.
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.517,2564.858,--How many days did this take?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2564.858,2567.311,"17, I believe."
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.311,2568.076,17 days?
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2570.138,2571.701,Yeah.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2574.248,2576.712,"I didn't count on a daily basis, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2583.29,2588.364,But it does seem that this trial judge was doing a conscientious job.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2600.203,2601.295,I think seven.
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2601.295,2605.386,He objected in seven and in five of those--
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2605.386,2606.307,No.
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2610.712,2611.383,"--Well, I'm not--"
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2611.383,2612.085,No.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2617.412,2618.114,Excuse me.
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2647.898,2655.475,"In your view, do we look at this any differently through AEDPA than if we were looking at this on direct review?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2655.475,2658.661,"--Well, yes."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2661.754,2665.548,So that makes a difference in the standard of review that we apply in this case?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2665.548,2674.704,"Well, there is... prior to the enactment of AEDPA, there was... this Court said you give deference to the trial court's findings."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2685.727,2688.243,"So, does that mean we give a greater degree of deference?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2688.243,2703.565,"I don't think this Court has said what, on balance, what the difference between the kind of deference that was required under Witherspoon is, as laid against the kind of deference now."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2721.965,2733.271,I'm just trying to get a handle on your view as to whether the standard of review with respect to deference to the State court is different in this respect than it would be on direct review?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2733.271,2733.882,Yes.
2006.06-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.36,2754.671,"May I ask, one of the most troubling parts about this case is the failure to object."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2766.557,2769.053,I don't think so.
2006.06-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2784.69,2803.478,"Do you have any response to Justice Kennedy's concern that this really allows for a mouse trapping of the trial judge who very likely would have paid less attention to the issue as long as any counsel doesn't object, just as a realistic way that this kind of thing is handled?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2803.478,2817.285,"Well, I respect his concerns about bushwhacking or mouse trapping, but the fact of the matter is that that's Washington law and the judge was well aware of it, as were the parties."
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2817.285,2825.595,"Well, let me put it to you this way: There's no demeanor finding here."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2835.652,2836.198,Yes.
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2836.198,2845.569,"And if the objection is what prevents the demeanor finding, then maybe we should be able to consider the fact there was no objection, even though Washington law doesn't require it before we consider the issue."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2845.569,2855.91,"But there's nothing in the record that says that the reason that the judge didn't mention the demeanor, or the prosecutor who made the objection didn't mention demeanor."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2872.76,2880.04,I thought your brother made the point that there was a more elaborate explanation of the trial judge's determinations when there had been an objection.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2880.04,2885.227,I do believe that he had a more lengthy explanation where there were objections.
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2894.894,2899.58,"Well, but he said for one of the other witnesses, I just don't... I don't believe him."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2904.888,2913.432,"Well, presumably then, he would have said that in response to the prosecutor's objections, which was not that we don't believe that Juror Deal could be credible."
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2913.432,2918.758,Not if there's no opposing objection by defense counsel.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,2929.194,2931.487,"That's correct, and here he didn't."
2006.06-413,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.826,2951.589,"The law on this, and you've read the cases more recent probably... I've skimmed through some but not read them all, as I'm sure you have."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3002.255,3004.037,That is still a valid statement of the law.
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.037,3005.456,Of what law?
2006.06-413,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3005.456,3006.521,Of Washington law.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3009.158,3012.254,"This Court, which has been shortened into a--"
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3012.254,3015.813,Substantially impaired.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3015.813,3017.311,--substantially impaired test.
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3017.311,3020.028,Which is a lot different than irrevocably committed.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3020.028,3026.822,"Well, it's substantially impaired to prevent or substantially impaired, the ability."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3027.418,3030.713,You would agree that substantially impaired is not the same as irrevocably committed?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3030.713,3038.396,"--Yes, I would agree, because you could say I favor the death penalty, as this juror did, and still sit on the jury."
2006.06-413,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3038.396,3041.878,This doesn't say... that's one of the things it says.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3063.777,3065.356,"No, Your Honor."
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.49,3085.44,"Well, he said that, but elsewhere he sort of indicated that he couldn't consider it unless it were a situation in which this person would be able to commit the crime again."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3085.44,3093.734,"But none of those statements indicated he would be prevented from voting for the death penalty, or that he was substantially impaired from doing that."
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.734,3099.013,"They did indicate that unless that was the situation, he wouldn't consider imposing the death penalty."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3101.169,3109.21,"Well, if it means only that he would consider the issue of future dangerousness, it wouldn't prevent him under Washington law."
2006.06-413,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.605,3140.855,I like recidivate by the way.
2006.06-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3143.448,3146.54,If I can get back to my concern about the failure to object again.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3153.992,3158.738,I think he's a hanging juror?
2006.06-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3158.738,3167.235,"In other words, he thought contrary to the prosecutor, his appraisal of this man was that he's going to be pro-death penalty, and he let that be known."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3169.049,3170.983,"Well, I think that--"
2006.06-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3170.983,3175.826,I don't think it would under Washington law.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3176.902,3183.18,"--Well, if the juror said... it would make a difference under Morgan if the juror said I'm not going to consider any mitigating factor."
2006.06-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3183.18,3183.586,"No, no."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3197.02,3197.488,Oh.
2006.06-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.488,3198.33,Would that make a difference?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3198.33,3205.611,"It wouldn't make a difference under Washington law because it could be raised for the first time on appeal, yes, if that wasn't what the record demonstrated."
2006.06-413,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3209.514,3210.076,You did.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3214.233,3223.321,"I don't think there's anything in the record to suggest that, but for lack of his objection."
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3235.067,3246.984,"Does the fact that this is structural error, that there's no harmless error analysis, mean that we should be very careful to give substance to the rule that there's deference to the trial judge?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3262.072,3263.822,Absolutely.
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3269.226,3275.957,"What presumes that there is that judgment made by the district judge, whether or not it's mentioned?"
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3277.688,3292.261,"Well, what Judge Kozinski says about that is if on the record... you have a cold record here which demonstrates in our view that the juror is completely qualified to serve, and nothing about him would prevent him from serving."
2006.06-413,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3304.63,3308.724,Should defer to Judge Kozinski's observation or to the Supreme Court in Witt?
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3308.724,3317.752,"--You should defer to the Supreme Court's observation in Witt, but only I think if there's some indication on the record that there is demeanor."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3318.22,3324.015,"Well, there's a third choice which under AEDPA is the Washington State court decision to which we should defer."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3324.015,3326.468,--The Washington State Supreme Court decision?
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3326.468,3326.889,Yes.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3326.889,3345.755,"The Washington State Supreme Court decision suffers a different problem, I think, Your Honor, which is that what the Washington State Supreme Court said on page 173 was that on voir dire he indicated he would impose the death penalty where the defendant, quote, ""would reviolate if released"", which is not a correct statement of the law."
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3358.596,3371.168,"On page 208, though, the Washington Supreme Court also stated the standard, as I understand it from Witt, that Mr. Deal's views would have prevented or substantially impaired his ability to follow the court's instructions."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3371.168,3375.465,But... I agree that there is a summary that says that.
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3385.412,3396.612,"--Isn't the number of the page that you gave telling this is an appeal from a capital sentence, and there are umpteen challenges made."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3428.471,3434.406,"--Well, if you're... you mean in terms of the... in the trial court?"
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3436.375,3436.89,In the Supreme Court.
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3473.499,3486.418,"Yes, and so if you then turn to the end of the opinion, if that's what you're asking, at 208, there's kind of a summary of their basis for all of the challenges made by Mr. Brown to all sorts of things in the case."
2006.06-413,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3507.331,3517.684,"Well, my point is simply that where the court is faced with so many challenges, this particular one, there had been no objection at the trial."
2006.06-413,2,41263,suzanne_lee_elliott,,3522.979,3525.322,That is true.
2006.06-413,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3572.897,3573.677,"Thank you, Ms. Elliott."
2006.06-413,3,33020,john_j_samson,,3576.348,3579.238,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-413,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3652.969,3654.077,"Thank you, counsel."
