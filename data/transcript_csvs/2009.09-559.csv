2009.09-559,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 09-559, John Doe v. Reed, Washington Secretary of State."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,8.337,28.233,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: No person should suffer harassment for participating in our political system, and the First Amendment protects citizens from intimidation resulting from compelled disclosure of their identity and beliefs and their private associations."
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,28.233,33.868,What -- what about requiring disclosure of campaign contributions?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,33.868,34.72,"Well, the--"
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,34.72,36.253,Do you think that is unconstitutional?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,36.253,42.157,--This Court has upheld the disclosure in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976.
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,42.157,42.39,Right.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,52.179,53.096,"Well, it could--"
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,53.096,53.965,--his political beliefs?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,53.965,81.865,"--It could potentially, and -- but this Court subjected those requirements to the appropriate constitutional First Amendment analysis, found that there was sufficiently important governmental interest, some of which are not present when we're talking about a referendum or initiative, and then also created an exception from even a generally valid statute where there is a reasonable probability of harassment of that particular individual or -- or group."
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,97.392,111.632,"I'm -- I'm trying to separate out the harassment aspects of this case from the working proposition that there's some sort of freedom of association, of privacy."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,134.581,135.081,--No.
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,135.081,135.665,That's unconstitutional?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,135.665,135.915,No.
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,150.406,152.358,Explain to me the difference.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,178.156,182.127,"Well, we believe it would be subject to First Amendment analysis."
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,185.912,188.845,So explain to me what the difference is in those three situations.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,188.845,191.714,"--Well, one is you have candidates involved--"
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,191.714,193.232,With -- with the State's interest.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,193.232,195.184,--One is you have candidates involved.
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,224.434,244.597,"You don't think that -- putting aside this kind of referendum, just a hypothetical referendum having to do with a certain tax scheme -- you don't think the voters would be interested in knowing what kinds of people in what occupations are interested in that particular tax benefit or not?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,244.597,248.733,"Well, a few -- few might be, but we think this is marginal information."
2009.09-559,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,268.13,268.697,Counsel--
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,268.697,270.597,And that -- and that--
2009.09-559,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,270.597,272.315,"--I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your answer."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,272.315,282.204,"--And that limited governmental interest is to preserve State money, to not conduct an election on the matter unless there is sufficient public support."
2009.09-559,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,282.806,289.21,"Now, counsel, the responses you have given to a couple of the questions has been that the First Amendment analysis would apply."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,309.772,316.608,"--Well, we're only challenging the application of the Public Records Act to petitions and referendum petitions."
2009.09-559,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,321.993,333.968,"So we have to decide, in assessing your claim that, no matter what the referendum issue was, that there's a significant intrusion on First Amendment rights?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,333.968,334.634,Yes.
2009.09-559,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,334.634,346.442,"So that if, for example, the referendum involves a bond issue as to which people may have particular views, but they're not going to get terribly excited about it, we'd still have to say that that's protected under the First Amendment?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,346.442,370.724,"Well, actually, under -- with modern technology, it only takes a few dedicated supporters, and a computer, who are willing to map -- to put this information on the Internet, MapQuest it, as they did with respect to the contributors of Proposition 8, which resulted in -- and then encourage people to harass and intimidate them, which resulted in hundreds of examples of harassment--"
2009.09-559,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,370.724,377.961,"Well, my point is, though, you're not likely to get that with respect to, you know, a debt issue, raising the debt ceiling from 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,381.846,386.234,"--Well, it may not manifest itself in -- in any particular initiative."
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,398.291,402.759,But -- but don't you have -- I thought we were dealing with count 1 of the complaint.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,402.759,403.443,--Yes.
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,403.443,417.336,Count 2 would be the counterpart to the exception that's made from the disclosure requirement with regard to contributions with certain organizations whose members might be harassed.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,417.336,418.169,"Well, with this--"
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,418.169,423.59,That's -- that's not -- that would still be open if you lose the first part of this case.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,441.201,443.403,--Buckley dealt with that exact question.
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.478,470.388,"So, that's why I'm asking you why, on the first part, should it be any different, as long as you have the door open to show that if you were going to suffer reprisals, harassment, that an exception would have to be made?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,470.388,478.176,"Well, we don't think that the exception is a substitute for considering the initial validity of the law, which--"
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.176,485.147,"May I -- may I ask you one -- something that was not in your brief, but was in the Secretary's brief."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,529.657,530.474,--Yes.
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,530.474,531.14,Yes?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,531.14,533.676,"Yes, this is an act of private association."
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,543.532,547.0,"They don't say: Now, I agree you can use my name for fundraising purposes."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,553.403,553.82,"--Well, what--"
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.82,562.326,"--signature collector can sell the names, use them for its own fundraising purposes?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,562.326,571.365,"--What is implicit is they are associating with this group for a purpose, and that is support for, in this case, Referendum 71."
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.219,588.827,"Mr. Bopp, do you have any case in which we have held that the First Amendment applies to activity that consists of the process of legislation, of legislating--"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,588.827,590.262,"--Yes, Buckley II."
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.262,591.329,--or of adopting legislation?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,592.262,592.845,Buckley II.
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.432,600.899,That is--
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,600.899,601.951,That is a process--
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.951,606.753,--Soliciting signatures is not taking part in the process of legislating.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,606.753,607.022,--Well--
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.022,617.127,"The person who requests a referendum is taking -- when there's a certain number of signatures required to achieve it, is taking part in that."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,665.124,665.874,"--Well, the--"
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.874,670.528,You are asking us to enter into a whole new field where we've never gone before.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,670.528,680.317,"--Well, with all due respect, you have already opined in Buckley II that the person on the other side of the clipboard is protected by the First Amendment."
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,680.317,682.917,I don't think that's -- that's true of Buckley II.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,725.26,726.945,That is true.
2009.09-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,741.787,755.279,"Well, let me -- let me ask you, could the opponents of a particular ballot measure organize a boycott for -- and picket businesses whose managers had supported that boycott?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,755.279,755.714,--Yes.
2009.09-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.714,756.881,Had supported that initiative?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,756.881,757.314,Yes.
2009.09-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,758.481,778.311,"Well, if that's so, then under Claiborne Hardware, which I -- I notice you didn't cite in your brief, but if -- if that's so, then it seems to me that the State's -- or that -- that the signers' interest in keeping their names private is somewhat diminished."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,778.311,778.561,--Yes.
2009.09-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,778.561,779.829,It's a First Amendment activity.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,779.829,789.352,But what we're -- but what is involved here that is not involved there is the requirement by the government that you publicly disclose your identity and beliefs on a matter that then--
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,789.352,790.602,But -- just--
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,814.551,815.118,--That is--
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,815.118,826.858,"Or it could even be, you say, that this solicitor is pesky, and in order to placate the solicitor, to get rid of the solicitor, we'll just sign."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,838.749,841.032,"--But, with all due respect, we did not say the third."
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,862.18,865.648,May I call your attention to page 20 of your reply brief?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,885.628,889.913,"I acknowledge that we said that, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-559,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,904.423,920.384,"Well, Mr. Bopp, if a voter -- if the legislature passes a statute and someone is -- is satisfied with that statute, how likely is it that that person is going to sign a petition to have a referendum to see whether the statute should be blocked?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,920.384,921.418,--I think it's very unlikely.
2009.09-559,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,924.686,925.003,It's possible--
2009.09-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,925.003,925.353,But--
2009.09-559,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,925.353,939.18,"--but if you were in the real world, if you were to poll the people who sign a referendum petition with respect to a statute that was passed by the State legislature, what percentage do you think would be opposed to that legislation?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,939.18,940.046,Very few.
2009.09-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,940.046,952.003,--And so Justice Alito's question points out that this would be a very slim basis upon which to rest a holding in your favor.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,992.545,1000.614,"Well, actually, after your Buckley II decision, the Ninth Circuit struck down the requirement of disclosing the paid circulators."
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1004.118,1005.868,They did that.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1012.622,1015.057,"Well, the Ninth Circuit thought it was Buckley--"
2009.09-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1015.057,1018.609,"Correct me, but the point is, isn't -- isn't there an interest in knowing this information?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1019.709,1021.275,--There is no evidence--
2009.09-559,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1021.275,1021.811,We'll leave that out.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1024.763,1031.25,"--There's no evidence in the record that that is pertinent information, and, at most, we think it is marginal information."
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1031.25,1039.356,"Counsel, if we create this right of -- this constitutional right of association in the manner that you are describing it, why is it limited to the voting area?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1059.484,1061.202,"Well, potentially."
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1069.808,1071.058,So you're -- you're suggesting--
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1071.058,1071.424,--the right of private association.
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1071.424,1087.251,"--that when a petitioner or a person engages in political discourse with the government, that they -- when they choose to do it, because the government is not compelling them to write to it; it's not compelling them to sign the referendum."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1088.953,1091.887,"And they're not compelling Ms. McIntyre to distribute her brochure, either."
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1094.589,1101.843,--But it's -- but Ms. McIntyre wasn't asking the government to engage its process in her favor.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1110.766,1113.401,"--Well, the government, you know, has a lot of options."
2009.09-559,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1124.539,1147.368,"Well, to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's question, do you think an agency could say, if you want to comment on proposed -- on a proposed rule, you have to disclose to us your name and your address and your telephone number and your political affiliation, and all sorts of -- your marital status and your income level and all sorts of other demographic information?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1147.368,1149.754,"--And your employer, as in this case here."
2009.09-559,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1149.754,1150.154,Could they do that?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1150.154,1154.724,"No -- no, because there is no sufficient governmental interest that would justify it."
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1154.724,1161.212,"Not even just your name, so they can check that this thing isn't phony and that all the names on it aren't -- aren't made up by one person?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1161.212,1163.33,"They, of course, can -- can check that."
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.33,1163.68,"Of course, they can."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1165.014,1166.866,"Yes, they can get your name--"
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.866,1167.266,Okay.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1167.266,1169.834,--and we're not objecting to filing of a petition.
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.834,1177.673,"But you're objecting to the public being able to check whether the agency is indeed finding out whether this is a genuine petition or not, correct?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1177.673,1178.106,No.
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.689,1179.173,Really?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1179.173,1183.291,They have procedures to check and verify these signatures that do not involve public disclosure.
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.291,1183.957,"Didn't you have some options, too?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1190.278,1196.265,"California law does not require disclosure of the petitions, and that has been upheld by the courts of California."
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.551,1199.001,I don't understand.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1200.551,1203.636,"Well, but you asked about California--"
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.636,1203.836,--I'm sorry.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1204.369,1205.238,--if I heard your question.
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.238,1205.738,Washington.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1206.221,1206.521,Okay.
2009.09-559,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1207.088,1207.857,Can you go back--
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.857,1219.83,"The people of Washington -- the people Washington evidently think that this is not too much of an imposition upon people's courage, to -- to stand up and sign something and be willing to stand behind it."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1219.83,1220.314,--In a sense--
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.314,1225.466,"Now, if you don't like that, I can see doing it another way."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1230.286,1230.886,"--Actually, for--"
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.886,1234.222,And you're saying that the First Amendment absolutely forbids that.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1234.222,1236.79,"--Actually, for a century, they chose not to do this."
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1238.54,1238.74,That's fine.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1239.606,1244.21,--They did not publicly disclose the petitions for a century.
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.21,1245.527,It might have been a good idea.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1245.527,1246.512,Well--
2009.09-559,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1246.512,1254.133,"I suppose the -- a majority of the voters in Washington decided that, and one of the purposes of the First Amendment is to protect minorities."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1254.133,1256.852,"--Well, only in the most general sense."
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1265.755,1270.223,"Mr. Bopp, this is not a peculiar thing to the State of Washington; that's correct, isn't it?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1281.579,1282.031,That is true.
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1295.255,1308.413,So -- but what you're saying with respect to Washington would go for most of those other States that have -- that have public disclosure of initiative and referendum petitions.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1308.413,1322.256,"Well, one -- one thing we say is different between Washington and these other States is that Washington provides no way for the public, even if they get access to the petitions, to participate in the verification process."
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1330.112,1347.39,I thought that there were instances where the State official missed something and a member of the public who had access to the list of signers said: Wait a minute; I know so-and-so was my neighbor who died 5 years ago.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1347.39,1349.474,--That's not allowed in the State of Washington.
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1356.912,1358.662,But you mean if -- that was over.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1371.236,1377.14,--There is absolutely no procedure under Washington statute to do anything with that information.
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1377.14,1377.656,"Well, we'll ask -- we'll ask the--"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1377.656,1378.056,Nothing.
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1378.056,1381.174,--We'll ask the Attorney General of Washington.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1381.174,1381.574,Yes.
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1381.574,1395.101,"Weren't two of the Petitioners here -- weren't two of the Petitioners here seeking the list so that they could go over the certification process the State had done to ensure that they had certified all the right people, et cetera?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1395.101,1406.14,"Well, one of -- one of the intervenors sought an exception from the -- from the injunction, which we did not object to, that -- that they would have access to the list."
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1409.259,1410.861,I'm not going to the privacy questions.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1423.751,1425.351,"--With all respect, I didn't say that."
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1425.351,1425.786,Oh.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1425.786,1429.822,What I -- what I said is there's no role for the public in verifying signatures.
2009.09-559,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1432.874,1436.309,"That's assuming the answer, meaning if they don't have the right to access, they can't."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1447.198,1453.019,--The only thing that they could do is request that the court does its own count.
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1474.665,1476.117,Why would you involve the court?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1485.406,1489.025,"Well, the observers can observe the process, and if they feel--"
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1489.025,1490.644,"No, this is after the observers."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1491.11,1491.627,"--Well, but--"
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1491.627,1498.464,--We're talking about a member of the public noticing that there are people on the list who shouldn't be there.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1498.464,1514.425,"--Well, the -- the observer -- under the Washington procedure, observers can observe the process, and if they feel, or if anyone feels, that there has been an inadequate job in -- in verification, then they can ask for judicial review."
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1516.527,1522.515,"Why would they ask for judicial review instead of going first to the State's Attorney General and saying, look, you -- your people missed it?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1522.515,1523.948,"--Well, there's no procedure for that."
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1523.948,1524.248,Why involve the court?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1524.248,1527.067,That's not -- there's no procedure for that.
2009.09-559,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.626,1543.178,Isn't there another--
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1543.178,1544.361,--to be involved in verification.
2009.09-559,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.361,1546.88,--Isn't there another possible public interest?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1561.973,1567.21,"Well, it's possible, but we think this information is marginal."
2009.09-559,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1569.829,1574.531,"Well, it does identify people who have a -- a particular point of view on a public issue."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1581.303,1583.803,"--Well, we -- we think it's a -- a very marginal interest."
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.877,1599.329,What about just -- just -- what about just wanting to know their names so you can criticize them?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1600.179,1601.929,Well--
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.929,1604.214,Is -- is that such a bad thing in a democracy?
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1604.214,1612.653,"--Well, what is bad is not the criticism; it's the public -- it's the government requiring you to disclose your identity and beliefs."
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1612.653,1619.891,But part of the reason is so you can be out there and be responsible for the positions you've taken.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1619.891,1621.259,"Well, then why don't they require both sides?"
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.259,1623.659,So that people -- people can criticize you for the position you have taken.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1623.659,1625.21,Then why don't they require both sides if that was the purpose?
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.21,1625.76,"What do you mean, ""both sides""?"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1629.179,1629.546,"Well, but the other side--"
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.546,1632.816,"When they sign something, they'll be out there for public criticism as well."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1632.816,1633.683,--Okay.
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.033,1641.304,"Oh, this is such a touchy-feely, oh, so sensitive about -- about any--"
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1653.314,1663.685,"I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, but the campaign manager of this initiative had his family sleep in his living room because of the threats--"
2009.09-559,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1663.685,1664.502,"Well, then that's--"
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1664.502,1665.304,"Well, that's bad."
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1667.687,1668.656,--And -- and--
2009.09-559,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.656,1677.345,--but just because there can be criminal activity doesn't mean that you -- you have to eliminate a procedure that is otherwise perfectly reasonable.
2009.09-559,0,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1677.345,1684.749,--But all we're asking for is a First Amendment analysis of the compelled disclosure of the identity of these people and whether or not these interests are sufficient.
2009.09-559,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1686.082,1686.832,"Thank you, Mr. Bopp."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1694.021,1703.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with the question of how the public can bring to the attention of the government that errors and fraud have been discovered."
2009.09-559,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1734.16,1736.676,How much time are we talking about in those processes?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1736.676,1739.445,"--The verification process, Justice Sotomayor?"
2009.09-559,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1739.445,1739.945,Yes.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1739.945,1745.366,The verification process will depend on how many signatures have been submitted--
2009.09-559,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1745.366,1745.666,"No, no, no."
2009.09-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1758.489,1760.072,That's what you've just said--
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1760.072,1760.858,"--Yes, they're--"
2009.09-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1760.858,1771.63,"--that they're -- that they are immediately available on the disk, and so while the checking is going on by the Secretary, the public has the list."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1772.749,1773.032,"--Yes, that's correct."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1787.759,1788.092,Would these records--
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1788.092,1790.475,Was that pursuant to the Public Records Act that we're talking about--
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1790.475,1791.044,--Yes.
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1791.044,1797.865,--or was that part of the initiative and referendum structure before the Public Records Act was passed?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1797.865,1800.4,"Justice Kennedy, this is part of the Public Records Act."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1804.285,1804.785,--Counsel--
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1804.785,1805.201,So -- all right.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1821.645,1822.145,"Yes, that's correct."
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1822.145,1828.382,So there was a judgment at one time by the State of Washington that it didn't -- that it didn't need the public records disclosure?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1828.382,1837.404,"Well, when the initiative and referendum processes were created by public vote on a constitutional amendment of 1912, there was no Public Records Act at all."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1846.693,1856.449,"--Counsel, if the State had a law that you could disclose voters and for whom they voted, would that implicate First Amendment interests?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1856.449,1867.721,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we would -- we do believe that First Amendment interests would be implicated by revealing how people voted, and we don't see a legitimate State interest in knowing how people voted, only in who voted--"
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1867.721,1873.625,So the country was acting unconstitutionally for a whole century before we adopted the Australian secret ballot?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1875.641,1875.958,--No.
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.743,1877.643,That it was unconstitutional--
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1877.643,1878.293,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.293,1880.612,--for a whole century not to have a secret ballot?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1880.612,1885.164,"No, Justice Scalia, I didn't say that I thought that the secret ballot was constitutionally required."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1889.816,1891.483,What would the First Amendment interests be?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1891.483,1894.619,"Well, the First Amendment interest in how you vote?"
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1894.619,1895.119,Yes.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1895.119,1900.923,"You know, it might be implicated by a potential chill from voting, if you know your vote is going to be revealed."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1900.923,1906.391,Do you think having your name revealed on a petition of this sort might have a chilling effect on whether you sign it?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1906.391,1916.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, some chill may result, just as some chill may result from having your campaign contributions disclosed or the fact that you have registered to vote and provided your name, address, your voting history is being disclosed."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1922.465,1927.285,"You don't think revealing that you're a voter has the same chilling effect as revealing how you voted, do you?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1927.285,1927.919,"No, I do not."
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1950.383,1950.867,--in the last questions--
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1950.867,1959.323,"Well, I thought you told me that the First Amendment interests were implicated with respect to the secret ballot, that you couldn't require people to reveal how they voted."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1959.323,1965.727,--We don't -- we don't know if this Court would rule that the vote could never be revealed.
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1981.319,1983.935,"--Well, I'd like to know how far you -- you are -- you want to go."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2009.867,2014.871,--It -- it would depend on the strength of the State interest in having the telephone number.
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2025.477,2035.618,I thought that you were saying that one of the interests that's served by this is to allow people who -- to allow Washington citizens to discuss this matter with those who signed the petition.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2039.32,2042.855,"--It -- yes, it probably would make it easier for people to contact."
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2042.855,2043.605,So you would--
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2043.605,2044.022,But the policy--
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2044.022,2044.723,--You would endorse that?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2044.723,2049.108,"--That would be a policy determination for the legislature to make, Justice Alito."
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2049.108,2050.458,"No, I'm not asking the policy question."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2052.726,2055.945,"I believe it could permit that, yes, Justice Alito."
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2055.945,2070.104,"Now, one of your Co-Respondents says that supplying this information provides insight whether support comes predominantly from members of particular political or religious organizations."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2077.525,2079.71,"No, I do not believe it would, Justice Alito."
2009.09-559,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2079.71,2104.176,"Suppose that in 1957 in Little Rock, a group of Little Rock citizens had wanted to put on the ballot a petition to require the school board to reopen Central High School, which had been closed because there was a sentiment in the community that they didn't want integration."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2125.672,2128.624,"Justice Breyer, that is count 2."
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.368,2163.531,"So you -- you would have no objection to as an-applied challenge to disclosing the names of individuals to a particular cause, where it is demonstrated that the opponents of that cause are violent and will do violence to the people who signed the petition?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2163.531,2164.483,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2171.637,2172.42,What about a business boycott?
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.42,2177.305,"So this is just a general challenge to ever, ever disclosing the names of petition signers?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2177.305,2179.824,--Of any type of petition including nominating petitions--
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.824,2180.224,Right.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2180.224,2181.442,"--initiative petitions, and the rest."
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2181.442,2182.559,What about a business boycott?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2187.861,2202.954,"Well, of course, boycotts have been upheld under the First Amendment in Claiborne Hardware, and so if someone wanted to boycott a business because it turned out that the manager of the business had been a supporter of a particular ballot measure, that would be allowable, of course, to that person choosing to boycott."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2202.954,2207.756,"Counsel, your answer to Justice Breyer was that they can bring an as-applied challenge."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2215.094,2215.427,Yes.
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2215.427,2221.998,So you think a stay should be granted in this case to allow the Petitioners to pursue an as-applied challenge.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2221.998,2229.318,"Yes, of course -- yes, they could apply for another preliminary injunction if this Court upholds the court of appeals."
2009.09-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2240.292,2240.625,And that would--
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2240.625,2249.231,"Do you think that the disclosure of the names, pending the resolution of their as-applied challenge, would subject them to incidents of violence and intimidation?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2249.231,2252.033,We -- there is no evidence of that in the record.
2009.09-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2253.217,2253.552,--Does -- is it--
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2253.552,2257.004,There's no evidence -- there's no evidence of episodes of violence or intimidation?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2257.004,2259.556,--Involving the Referendum 71 signers?
2009.09-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2276.481,2278.314,--Is that because nobody got to count 2?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2285.587,2286.387,"Yes, that is -- yes, that is correct."
2009.09-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2286.387,2288.705,And count 2 is the one that deals with the harassment.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2288.705,2289.722,"That is true, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2309.302,2319.508,"Well, let's say somebody is thinking of circulating a petition on a sensitive subject and fears that people may be dissuaded from signing because they fear retaliation."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2337.885,2344.889,"--Justice Alito, it would be possible procedurally for them to bring the motion for an injunction even before collecting the signatures--"
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2344.889,2345.373,And how would they--
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2345.373,2346.241,--if they had sufficient evidence.
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2346.241,2353.412,"--How would they prove that there's -- that there's a -- a threat, a sufficient threat of harassment in that particular case, before the petition is even signed?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2353.412,2368.239,"I believe that the sponsors of the measure would bring to the court evidence, if they have any, of -- because of the controversial nature of that particular measure, that is based on what's happened to some of the people who were planning to put the measure on the ballot."
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.239,2369.472,But -- but you -- you've rejected that here.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2377.695,2378.295,Right.
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2378.295,2380.729,"Of course there isn't, because the names haven't gotten out yet."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2388.918,2390.354,One could look to--
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2390.354,2396.424,"Or otherwise, don't insist upon evidence that these very petition signers will be harassed."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2396.424,2401.976,"--I imagine, Justice Scalia, that the individuals moving for that preliminary injunction would do what the Petitioners have done in this case."
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.094,2409.713,And you think that would be an acceptable type of evidence?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2409.713,2411.248,They could bring it into the court.
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.498,2417.616,"Well, if you don't think it's acceptable, then -- then -- then you're not making an argument."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2417.616,2420.668,"--Justice Scalia, I didn't say it couldn't be acceptable."
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2425.037,2435.244,"Well, the -- the hypothetical is that before this petition is circulated, the supporters came into court, and they said: Look what has happened in California with -- with Proposition 8."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2443.267,2449.687,"Justice Alito, I think that the evidence would have to be very strong."
2009.09-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2466.761,2476.95,"Is it -- the State has had this procedure now for some time, and there have been controversial ballot initiatives."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2483.789,2490.109,"There has not, Justice Ginsburg, and that's even though a half a dozen initiatives on a variety of topics have been released."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2491.609,2496.346,What -- what's the most sensitive similar petition for a referendum?

2009.09-559,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2511.772,2512.772,Proposition 8?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2512.772,2513.974,--Well--
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.974,2515.907,"No, I'm talking about in Washington, counsel."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2515.907,2516.557,--In Washington State.
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2526.115,2529.817,Was the referendum in favor or opposed to assisted suicide?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2529.817,2533.769,"It was -- well, the referendum challenges the assisted suicide law."
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2542.791,2548.16,"This case will likely be controlled by our First Amendment precedents, because that's the most fully developed."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2558.967,2559.367,Yes.
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2559.367,2560.586,And I tried to look it up.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2571.458,2587.318,"Justice Kennedy, we have considered the history of the Petition Clause, and we see a basic difference between the kinds of petitions under the Petition Clause and the petitions at issue here because, essentially, petitioning the government under the Petition Clause is asking the government to do something."
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2610.18,2615.001,"But, of course, that can cut the other way, too, because then it's more like a vote."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2622.838,2631.092,"And, Justice Kennedy, I'd like to speak to that question, because several Justices asked: Well, what can we tell from what, you know, someone who signed?"
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2659.426,2671.234,What percentage -- what percentage of the people who signed this petition to put this law on the referendum do you think signed it because they think these sort of things should be generally put to a public vote as opposed to because they opposed the law?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2671.234,2678.721,"The percentage of people who believe simply that there should be a vote held has not been quantified by the research, except that several scholars indicate that it is significant."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2682.958,2688.577,You think as much as 20 percent of the people who signed this petition are actually in favor of the law that it's aimed to repeal?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2688.577,2691.045,--It is possible.
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2714.575,2714.791,Can I ask you this question?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2776.714,2780.683,"Justice Alito, the -- just to be clear, you are right."
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2821.576,2822.226,"Well, what's the answer to my question?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2836.586,2836.87,Yes.
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2836.87,2839.003,--whether you -- somebody signed your name to the petition?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2839.003,2840.955,"Yes, Justice Alito, that -- that could be done."
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2851.513,2869.391,Do -- do we take this case on the assumption -- do you make the contention before us that the Secretary of State and those who assist it are not capable of determining whether the petition signatures are valid?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2869.391,2873.193,"No, we are not taking that position, Justice Kennedy."
2009.09-559,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2873.943,2875.728,I mean without public disclosure?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2875.728,2893.423,"--What we know, Justice Kennedy, is that in dozens of States around the -- around the country, as recently as 2009 in Maryland, 2006 in Massachusetts, and so on, it was the -- it was the public who requested ballot petitions by public records request who found significant fraud and error."
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.568,2914.919,Sometimes the public may not trust the Secretary of State.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2914.919,2915.686,"--Yes, sir."
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2917.954,2927.327,"It -- it may be an issue in which his administration has taken a particularly firm stand, and the public may not trust the job that the Secretary of State does."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2927.327,2931.529,"That goes to the heart to the Public Records Act, Justice Scalia: Trust but verify."
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.083,2938.333,Trust but verify -- I like that.
2009.09-559,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2940.868,2946.939,You did say something about this category of speech.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2965.399,2974.338,--The speech element could be construed in the fact that someone has chosen to sign a petition which we know means they want something to be put on the ballot.
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3001.921,3008.741,"Well, what is the -- to finish your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, what is the non-speech component of signing a petition?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3008.741,3018.533,--The non-speech component is suspension of law in the case of a referendum or the legislative effect.
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3021.735,3026.37,And what's the State's interest in regulating the non-speech component?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3043.329,3050.068,"--The interest, Justice Alito, is knowing, first of all, that there were a sufficient number of signatures submitted to qualify the measure for the ballot."
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3050.068,3051.085,It's the fraud interest?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3051.085,3051.668,That's the fraud interest.
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3057.072,3058.205,"Well, but how far does that go?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3091.873,3093.925,"--No, Justice Alito, we don't need to know that."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3114.137,3128.913,"I thought one of the reasons you wanted to do this was so people would have information that would allow them to participate in the civic process, and there are people who -- might think it makes a difference whether a referendum was requested by -- primarily by members of a particular ethnic group or not."
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3134.483,3138.435,--I don't see what the valid State interest would be of knowing the ethnicity of the person.
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3152.39,3158.812,Then I don't understand what information is being -- what information you think you're providing to the public.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3166.383,3171.685,"Well, Justice Alito, it might -- if you know John Jones, that would tell you something."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3195.182,3195.665,How can they--
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3195.665,3196.465,--able to provide that information.
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3196.465,3201.336,"--How can they find that out with just the name and address, that a large number of people from a company signed it?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3201.336,3201.919,Well--
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3201.919,3204.203,"You don't have to put on who you work for, do you?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3204.203,3204.554,"--No, you do not."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3219.61,3219.776,I'm sorry.
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3227.597,3237.988,"--Well, a voter who -- who works at that same company or does business with that same company might know that, gosh, I know these employees, and they've -- they have all signed this petition."
2009.09-559,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3289.352,3303.843,"You know, if somebody called your office and said I'd like the -- the home address of all the attorneys who work in the Attorney General's Office because we want to -- we want to go to their homes and have uncomfortable conversations with them--"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3307.397,3308.563,"We would not, Justice Alito."
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3317.186,3323.757,"Isn't that information, at least the names of those people -- isn't it probably public information anyway?"
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3323.757,3325.025,"Yes, it is, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-559,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.025,3327.811,Can it be obtained under the Freedom of Information Act in this case?
2009.09-559,1,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3327.811,3328.027,"Yes, it can."
2009.09-559,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3336.114,3337.549,"Thank you, General McKenna."
2009.09-559,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3339.918,3345.036,Thank you.
2009.09-559,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3427.773,3428.956,But that's out of the case up till now.
2009.09-559,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3434.027,3434.71,--Actually not.
2009.09-559,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3436.077,3438.296,So everybody agrees that that's still in the case.
