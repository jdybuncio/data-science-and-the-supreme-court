1997.97-300,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,2.183,"We'll go on to Number 97-300, Terry Stewart v. Ramon Martinez-Villareal."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,4.468,8.67,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,61.805,73.798,"Well, do you think that Congress may have been trying to tighten up the court's abuse of the writ standards in passing AEDPA?"
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,73.798,74.664,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.676,103.9,"Before we had AEDPA, did courts, do you think, apply abuse of the writ standards to Ford claims at all?"
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,103.9,107.369,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.369,109.069,I don't think they did.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,132.568,133.753,"Well, yes and no."
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.827,145.46,Mm-hmm.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,145.46,158.285,"And it was indicated by five justices here that that was, in fact, a contention that was subject to abuse of the writ analysis, and so even before AEDPA there had been the indication that in fact that kind of a claim might well be--"
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.285,175.247,"What do you think we do post-AEDPA with claims that really arise later, such as claims arising out of the establishment of good time credits or something of that sort?"
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,185.971,186.887,--It may well be.
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.754,198.11,"Is that the position you take, that AEDPA goes that far and that it extends to even those things that could not have arisen before--"
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,198.11,198.843,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.843,199.36,--the claim was made?
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,199.36,201.895,Because of the plain language of that second exception--
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.895,202.795,Uh-huh.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,202.795,214.135,"--which says that if it is a matter which you could not have brought the facts forward before, nonetheless, if it does not go to guilt-innocence determinations, then it's excluded."
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.135,217.237,How about a Rose v. Lundy problem?
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,239.603,245.507,We have to distinguish your hypothetical as one where the entire petition was dismissed.
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.507,246.107,"Mm-hmm, yes."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,246.107,252.01,And our position is in that situation it is in effect not an application which is meaningful.
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.447,287.168,Was the Ford claim made in the petitioner's first petition?
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,287.168,288.868,"--It was, and found not ripe."
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.868,294.487,"And the Federal court said no, we can't deal with this now."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,294.487,295.023,That's correct.
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.023,296.973,But we'll deal with it later.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,296.973,298.641,"That was the anticipation, yes."
1997.97-300,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.641,305.878,"Are you saying that that determination should have been appealed, i.e., he should have said yes, it is ripe?"
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,305.878,317.269,"Well, as a matter of fact that question was raised in the Ninth Circuit and they agreed that that particular claim was properly dismissed as being premature, because there was no warrant for execution."
1997.97-300,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,320.487,322.339,So what more could he have done?
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,322.339,332.962,"Under pre-AEDPA he did what he could, and I want to emphasize that this is not a situation where the State somehow inveigled him, or mouse-trapped him."
1997.97-300,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,366.433,393.433,"In view of your answer about exhaustion, failure to exhaust, so it's dismissed, and then it comes back after AEDPA, and you said effectively that would not be a successive petition, suppose the Ford claim were the only claim brought up in the first habeas, and the district court says, it's not ripe, you get a competency hearing in the State court... it's so close to exhaustion."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,398.904,399.287,--Right.
1997.97-300,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.287,401.856,Suppose it had been only the Ford claim.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,401.856,412.462,"If it were exclusively the Ford claim and it had been dismissed at that point, then we would not consider that a successive application, because there had been no determination on any merits issue."
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,412.462,416.014,"Well, except that... yes, there was a decision."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,432.808,437.279,"Because we are giving meaning to every word in the statute, including application."
1997.97-300,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.113,465.747,But suppose--
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,478.606,479.272,Well--
1997.97-300,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.272,480.139,I wouldn't call that case a nothing.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,484.593,486.41,"--Well, sometimes there is much ado about nothing."
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,513.243,514.695,Let me ask you another question.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,527.003,528.537,"--No, ma'am, I don't believe it can, because--"
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.537,529.539,Why not?
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,529.539,543.965,"--Congress, which, of course, is the author of both of these remedial schemes, if you will, has, I think, made it clear that everything to do with capital punishment and capital sentences is to be litigated by way of habeas."
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.01,572.466,"Well, except this person is not before the courts arguing that he is being held in violation of Federal law."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,578.536,588.994,"Well, what this Court indicated in Gomez v. U.S. District Court is that section 1983 is not a device to circumvent rules against successive petitions."
1997.97-300,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,593.195,594.897,I don't know that it's a circumvention.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,603.003,613.793,"--Well, to the extent that Congress has indicated this is the way it should go, particularly by the addition of Chapter 154--"
1997.97-300,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.793,629.82,"We've used habeas for all sorts of matters relating to the propriety of execution, haven't we, whether it's cruel and unusual punishment, whether certain procedures have to be used, and that doesn't relate to the detention of the individual."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,629.82,630.704,--That's correct.
1997.97-300,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.704,637.658,"I sort of favor using habeas for what it ought to be used for, but I think we crossed that bridge a long time ago."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,637.658,642.395,"Well, in effect I would suggest that this Court has determined this question already."
1997.97-300,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,642.395,653.87,"But if that's so... if that's so, then isn't what's before the Court not... he's not challenging his underlying conviction, and he's not challenging the sentence he got."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,673.6,678.485,The application is successive because it is the second time he has come to the court.
1997.97-300,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,678.485,696.029,But you've already told me that you don't take that so formally that in dealing with the dismissed case because of exhaustion for... that technically that's a second... it's the second time he's filed.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,716.777,733.471,"It is successive because it goes ultimately to that very same sentence that was imposed upon him in the first place, and therefore he is coming a second time to in effect get a Federal court to say, you cannot execute this person."
1997.97-300,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.471,737.606,Is there any reason to think that Congress wanted the result that Justice Ginsburg is discussing?
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,777.767,779.05,"Okay, two answers to that."
1997.97-300,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.168,822.546,"I thought your answer was going to be simply section 2244(b)(2)(B), which makes it very clear that the mere fact that something couldn't have been raised earlier, because the factual predicate did not exist, is not alone enough."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,824.814,825.331,--Exactly.
1997.97-300,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,825.881,833.254,"In addition to that, the fact... those new facts have to show that the defendant was innocent of the underlying offense."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,833.254,837.222,"--That's essentially what I was trying to get at, that this is the plain meaning of the statute."
1997.97-300,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,837.222,846.412,"If you're trying to get at that, I was talking about a claim that not only couldn't have been raised earlier, but one that had nothing to do with the trial or the appeal process."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,860.071,868.927,"If it is something which relates to the determination of guilt or innocence, yes, then that would be permissible, assuming that, again, there were some newly discovered facts."
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,868.927,876.264,"May I ask... maybe I'm going to pose the same kind of question that's been posed before, but let me pose it in a slightly different way."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,889.256,889.756,Okay.
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,889.756,897.177,"If that's what I assume to begin with, then I'm faced with the following kind of question:"
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,959.185,988.27,"Well, I would suggest that it would not be capricious at all, because in effect what we're finding here is that t he individual is going to have virtually the same kind of review that he would have had without AEDPA, because competency is a factual matter, and for example in Demosthenes v. Baal and Maggio v. Fulford this Court made very clear that, even without AEDPA, there's a factual issue which the courts, the Federal courts must defer to, and so this Court on--"
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,988.27,993.924,"Well, that doesn't go to the jurisdiction of the Federal court ultimately to entertain the claim."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,993.924,1005.566,"--What I'm saying, though, is that it is consistent to say that this is an appropriate way to limit the kinds of issues that are going to come in front of the district court, which doesn't drastically--"
1997.97-300,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1005.566,1008.001,But it doesn't... I have the same question as Justice Souter.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1015.254,1015.604,--Right.
1997.97-300,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1015.604,1019.725,"That's all he brings, and the State comes rushing in and says, premature, and it's dismissed."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1043.257,1060.718,"Well, I think the bottom line is it's a choice that Congress is entitled to make, that we are dealing with a statute... this is where the entitlement comes from, that it is a statute which Congress can say, we will allow the courts to hear certain types of claims, just as this Court said, we're not going to let you hear Fourth Amendment claims any more."
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1060.718,1071.258,"well, if Congress had said that in any direct way, you'd be well on the road to your argument, but you're basically saying... in fact, you said literally a few moments ago, this is just like McCardle."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1128.863,1150.376,"Well, I have to disagree with you on that, because this Court has repeatedly made clear, for example in Moralis v. TVA... excuse me, TWA, legislative history need not confirm details of changes in the law before we interpret it according to its plain meaning, and there are other cases which show you don't have to find that Congress--"
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1150.376,1150.826,Well--
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1150.826,1152.745,--looked at the nitty gritty of every possibility--
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1152.745,1176.86,"--we're back to plain meaning again, and I think the... as I said, I realize that you and I do not agree entirely on that, but if we don't think that a simple, literal plain meaning analysis is going to be applicable here because of exactly the case that you concede would be allowed as a second shot, then I think the question is more pointed than, or more difficult than you're admitting."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1185.799,1186.499,--That's correct.
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.499,1198.94,"What is your theory on why we have jurisdiction, given the plain language of the statute that says the grant or denial of a successive application shall not be appealable and shall not the subject of a petition for rehearing or writ of certiorari?"
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1198.94,1206.063,"Because of the very specific manner in which the Ninth Circuit ruled, it seems to take it out of the ambit of that preclusion."
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.646,1214.55,"Well... it's... under your view, it is a second, successive, right... second or successive application."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1214.55,1215.418,"--Yes, sir."
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.418,1221.889,"And it was granted... the court of appeals said it shall be granted by the district court, they shall entertain it."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1221.889,1226.107,But it said that we're allowing you to do this because we're not going to find it was--
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.107,1228.226,"Well, they say... but you say they were wrong on that."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1228.226,1228.926,--Exactly.
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1228.926,1230.345,"I mean, you can't say they're both right and wrong."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1238.434,1239.867,Two answers.
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.822,1273.422,"Well, I know that's... but I'm taking you at your word, not them--"
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1273.422,1274.024,Right.
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.024,1274.924,--because you're saying they're wrong.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1274.924,1299.055,"And the second point is that, because... first of all, those cases would indicate that statutory cert is appropriate to review the overall construction of the statute, but secondly, as I pointed out, and why we brought a combined petition in the first place, is that the issues in this case are of such importance that they warrant review under the extraordinary writ if somehow they don't fall under the statutory writ."
1997.97-300,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.055,1316.101,"Well, I guess we permit such inconsistent pleading, if you want to call it that, all the time when we reverse a court of appeals which has decided a case that the petitioner claims... for which the petitioner claims there was no jurisdiction."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1330.425,1334.396,"Well, again, that is why we presented it in both lights."
1997.97-300,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1335.029,1340.966,"May I ask again about the distinction between the one who brings just the Ford claim, which you say that's okay."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1383.126,1383.995,--Yes.
1997.97-300,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1383.995,1396.403,"--as being okay, but the one who combines it with others is not being okay, is a little hard for me to grasp, and I was thinking that well, maybe wouldn't any sensible lawyer say, he's got some good claims."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1398.353,1405.509,"Well, again I think part of the answer is that at stage he doesn't have a claim that he can present anyway."
1997.97-300,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1407.694,1409.777,"Yes, but then he wants to be able to come back."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1409.777,1429.29,"And Congress has now said that the appropriate means of dealing with that is through the kind of Ford evidentiary hearing that we had in the superior court in Arizona, plus Arizona supreme court review, plus cert to this Court, much like the pattern that has followed for Federal prisoners."
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1450.287,1451.854,"General Ferg, can I clarify one thing."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1469.165,1474.569,"If the whole thing is dismissed out so there's no action, no adjudication, then that would not be a successive application."
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1474.569,1475.588,In your... okay.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1517.748,1519.867,"Indeed it would, and--"
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1519.867,1528.973,"But isn't that the policy that the careful lawyer who wants to avoid your argument, and... particularly if it's successful, is in fact going to take."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1532.775,1555.79,"--He might well be barred that way and also, as the Ninth Circuit pointed out, that when you come in you get the automatic stay the first time around for those other nonmental issues, then you've automatically rendered the issue nonripe again, and so what we're actually doing is saying, we want to get the mental competency issue done in an expeditious manner."
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1555.79,1563.96,"No, but that's the point, it can't be done at all unless it is done in relation to competency at time of execution."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1563.96,1564.479,Right.
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1564.479,1573.185,"And if somebody comes in before an execution date is imminent, then that's why it's not ripe, and you don't... I mean, you don't want to promote nonripe claims."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1577.87,1578.906,That's correct.
1997.97-300,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1589.945,1595.665,"Right, but that then undercuts the point that Congress wanted these things litigated early."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1600.069,1601.669,--Well--
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1601.669,1608.841,"But it's your position they're... they would be left to the State procedure, but what if the State decided they won't have a procedure, which I suppose they could do under your view?"
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1608.841,1612.71,"--Well, that very denial would itself be grounds, I would suggest, to come before this Court."
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.939,1634.473,"Yes, it would be, but that claim wouldn't be ripe at any time."
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1636.742,1638.11,--At that point it would be ripe--
1997.97-300,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1638.11,1638.51,Yes.
1997.97-300,0,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,1638.51,1639.76,--because the execution would be imminent.
1997.97-300,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.912,1643.712,"Very well, Mr. Ferg."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1647.883,1650.668,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.329,1723.966,Because it was premature it would have to be decided closer to the time of execution?
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1723.966,1757.02,"That's exactly right, Your Honor, and that's what the court decided and it dismissed it without prejudice and everybody knew that, at the time of that dismissal, if Mr. Martinez-Villareal were to lose, ultimately... remember, at that time he had won on an ineffective claim at sentencing, which the court of appeals later reversed on a procedural default, but everybody knew at that time that Mr. Martinez-Villareal would be back if, in fact, he didn't prevail in the court of appeals to litigate this very claim that everybody agreed he could litigate at the proper time."
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.293,1770.011,Was AEDPA in effect at the time of the first raising of this claim in the district court?
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1770.011,1784.838,"No, it was not, Your Honor but, as Justice O'Connor mentioned, all the courts had held at that time, before AEDPA, that Ford claims were not subject to abuse, and that they were routinely raised for the first time in second or successive petitions."
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.674,1796.312,"But you don't make any claim that AEDPA shouldn't apply to this case, I take it?"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1796.312,1803.149,--It has... what... our position is that this case doesn't fall within 2244(b).
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1804.084,1815.124,But you have not argued here or below that the statute that Congress passed in the form of AEDPA does not apply to your case?
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1815.124,1816.659,--Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1816.659,1817.659,You say--
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1817.659,1818.292,We do--
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.292,1821.061,--that it is not a successive petition under AEDPA.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1821.061,1822.063,--That's right.
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.353,1835.12,And you're--
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1903.597,1905.366,There's two answers to that.
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1918.924,1921.059,Would you be precise as to which statutory section?
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1921.059,1921.693,--I'm sorry.
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1932.867,1934.284,It's on page 3 of the red--
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1934.968,1935.535,--Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1935.535,1936.252,"Of the red brief, okay."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1936.252,1942.456,"And it starts out a claim... or, I'm sorry."
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.338,1965.504,"Well, I--"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,1965.504,1965.971,--not facts.
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.971,1967.221,--You're mistaking my point.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2008.331,2016.854,"And that situation, it seems to me, that Congress envisioned was a petitioner, the same petitioner coming back and attacking the same judgment."
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.469,2056.412,"Well, I do think it's significant, and don't you think it's significant that this whole new legislation does not mention the magic word successive, you know, which had been the buzz word for our prior jurisprudence."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2058.114,2060.566,"They do mention successive, Your Honor."
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.566,2060.9,I mean--
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2074.29,2089.819,"I believe this Court looked at that in Felker and said this is a modification on the abuse of the writ doctrine, so I think this is... I agree, it goes far beyond what the abuse of the writ doctrine was before under McCleskey, which was--"
1997.97-300,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2089.819,2093.437,"No, but you have... may I interrupt you just with this question, because I'm going astray here."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2138.466,2138.85,--Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2139.25,2139.752,--Okay.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2139.752,2140.585,"That's true, and the--"
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.585,2141.918,"Of course, it doesn't have to be a successive petition."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2146.822,2147.406,--Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.575,2158.396,"Oh, you think second or successive means second, comma, that is to say, comma, successive?"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2158.396,2158.846,I--
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.846,2161.415,Second or in other words successive?
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2161.415,2169.537,--I think it means that it was a claim that was presentable in a prior petition.
1997.97-300,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2174.822,2189.399,"So you read the statute as if it read, a claim presented in a second or successive application, paren, assuming it was then presentable, close paren?"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2189.399,2199.504,"I believe that's read into it by saying, a claim presented, which by its terms doesn't include a claim that was never presentable."
1997.97-300,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.504,2214.781,"Presentable doesn't work, because you could easily have new evidence discovered related to the trial, you know, and it wasn't discovered until November, and by that time the person has filed 13 petitions, and clearly that falls within (b)(2)."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2216.149,2216.833,That would--
1997.97-300,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2216.833,2225.239,"--thing you can do only under certain circumstances, yet it wasn't presentable earlier because you never had the new evidence earlier, or the Brady material early, so it must have to do with the nature of the word claim."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2236.629,2237.129,--Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.129,2238.179,In principle.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2241.248,2256.71,"Again, the best that I can do, Your Honor, is to say that what they were talking about here when they were... when they use those words, a claim presented, is that it was something that the... that could have been presented."
1997.97-300,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2257.81,2258.91,You'd say in principle or something.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2258.91,2259.593,--That... pardon?
1997.97-300,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.593,2268.332,"The kind of claim that was in principle presentable earlier but not the kind... even though this one couldn't have been, a Brady claim is the kind that in principle could be--"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2268.332,2268.832,"Yes, and--"
1997.97-300,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.832,2269.618,--presented earlier.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2269.618,2269.984,--Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.984,2272.82,A Ford claim is not the kind that in principle could have been presented earlier.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2272.82,2274.286,"Yes, that's right."
1997.97-300,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2274.286,2276.622,"So then you say it's not a claim, or that it's not successive?"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2284.275,2285.093,Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.093,2288.762,--in... compared to a claim that could have been presented.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2288.762,2296.185,"Well, in here what we're looking at is second or successive to what, and we have a completely different judgment."
1997.97-300,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2312.695,2335.326,"And what makes you even in a better position, I suppose, than the person who brings a first petition and says... in the Federal court and says, go away, you haven't exhausted, comes back with a number 2, but it's not successive because there was no adjudication of the first one, but still that is going to... that is going to the original conviction and sentence."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2344.916,2346.099,--That's exactly right.
1997.97-300,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2360.276,2378.053,"Well, can you tell me, won't there be cases... maybe this case as well... in which the evidence of the incompetency, the symptoms, the clinical manifestations of the mental disturbance were apparent as of the time of the first petition?"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2378.053,2378.703,Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2378.703,2381.439,"They might not have been as aggravated, but they were apparent ones."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2393.599,2415.278,"I think that that's going to have to be something that the district court, which is something typical that district courts do, will need to decide, but that's right, there are those type of cases where the evidence would be so apparent that counsel is under an obligation to raise that, and the mental illness is such that's not going to change."
1997.97-300,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2415.278,2422.666,So you acknowledge that there will be then some litigation over whether or not this particular competence claim should have been brought earlier.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2422.666,2423.701,I think that's true.
1997.97-300,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2437.426,2444.496,"Now I'm beginning to lose you, because I thought that the problem here is that you couldn't bring it up earlier because it wouldn't be ripe until the date of execution is set."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2444.496,2445.263,--I--
1997.97-300,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2445.263,2448.965,"Because there's always hope that somebody will, maybe through a miracle, be cured."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2448.965,2449.9,--And that's right.
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2491.244,2506.07,"Well, what if it were a claim, not for lack of competency, but that the Arizona clemency proceeding which he had applied to denied him due process in some way, would that, too, be raisable at this point?"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2510.338,2520.33,"I would think that would probably be a better claim to be raised in a 1983 than in a 2254, the clemency attack."
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2520.33,2524.115,--You don't think... you think it could be raised in 1983 rather than habeas?
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2524.115,2531.452,"Yes, I would think so, because that's what their... they would be attack... I guess you could go under either a 2241 or a 1983."
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2531.452,2534.404,"Well, that... now, that's supposed to be impossible, I thought."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2534.404,2534.821,Oh.
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.821,2536.673,That you couldn't... you could not do both.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2536.673,2540.725,I have... I am not sure.
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2642.692,2652.731,"Again, that is simply not compatible with 2244 (b)(2)(B)."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2652.731,2653.333,--And I--
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.333,2658.719,In some cases under (b)(2)(B) you're not going to have a first bite at the apple.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2658.719,2671.377,"--If you're attacking the same judgment and it's... again, I think what they are trying to get at there is, they are concerned about delay, and what they're telling lawyers, you better take a look at this."
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2677.781,2678.281,"Well, it--"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2691.79,2701.646,"And I will say I think that some... some... but it's not this case, but I think the case that may be in front of you at some point, that you're going to have to decide whether that's constitutional."
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.646,2706.2,"Well, but it makes it hard for you to argue that Congress always wanted people to have one bite in Federal court."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2722.976,2726.762,"That's true on the same judgment, and as I said, it's--"
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2726.762,2728.345,"Well, I'm not sure it's even true there."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2740.67,2745.372,"--That's right, and that's why it's still... the abuse of the writ is still in here, but it's very, very restricted."
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.855,2746.521,It may be a claim that doesn't go to--
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2746.521,2747.221,--you have to meet these conditions.
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2747.221,2748.638,--It doesn't go to innocence at all.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2754.425,2763.381,"That's... this Court, of course, hasn't decided whether it includes a claim that goes to punishment or not under Sawyer v. Whitley and the miscarriage of justice--"
1997.97-300,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2763.381,2767.518,I'm not sure it's helpful to say it's an attack on a different judgment.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2775.79,2776.34,"--No, because--"
1997.97-300,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.34,2778.909,And so I don't think that gets us very far.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2778.909,2787.432,"--Well, that's because, Your Honor, that judgment is still attacking the judgment of guilt and the sentence."
1997.97-300,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2817.467,2818.551,"Well, that's not a new judgment."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2825.271,2835.846,"It's a new constitutional... the constitutional violation, that's when it occurs for the first time, is based on that order, based on that judgment."
1997.97-300,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2838.948,2846.102,"Well, maybe this is the kind of claim that should be raised in a section 1983 action, not habeas at all."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2846.102,2848.47,"--Well, Ford disagrees with that."
1997.97-300,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2871.436,2876.823,"Well, but you're not asking that he be released from custody, just that he not be executed."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2876.823,2879.942,"That's true, and it's there... pardon?"
1997.97-300,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2879.942,2881.358,Temporarily.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2881.358,2889.23,"And that's very similar, Your Honor, to the challenges made to death sentences in cases all the time."
1997.97-300,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2902.473,2909.461,"I think it is, because you're not asking that the penalty be changed, just that it be postponed."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2909.461,2910.977,"--Yes, that's true."
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2951.471,2958.891,"Well, Ms. Young, ordinarily we grant certiorari to decide what we regard as an important question of law, often because of a split between courts of appeals."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2964.945,2966.481,--Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.783,2971.966,"If that's correct, perhaps we never should have granted certiorari."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2971.966,2973.134,--And I agree with that.
1997.97-300,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.734,2990.429,"Well, I'm sure it's still available to you to argue that even if we disagree with you on the important question that we took the case to decide, we should remand to let the court of appeals consider whether a waiver would produce the same result."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,2993.314,2994.681,Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3005.356,3009.724,"Ms. Young, may I ask you another hypothetical about your definition of presentable and presented and so forth and so on?"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3009.724,3010.158,--Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.158,3035.958,"Suppose a person on death row who has never filed any habeas corpus petition files one that contains nothing but an exhausted Ford claim and the district court says, there's merit to the claim, quash this death warrant, postpone the execution, and they do that, and with no change in facts whatsoever the same man comes back... they issue a new death warrant 10 days later."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3042.545,3045.247,"Now, in the first... I'm sorry, I need to... in the first--"
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3045.247,3045.933,He won the first time.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3045.933,3047.733,"--He won it, can he come back in the second one?"
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3047.733,3051.837,Can he come back 30 days later if they try to execute him without any change in his condition?
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3051.837,3053.653,"Oh, without any change in his condition?"
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.653,3054.153,Yes.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3054.153,3055.788,And raise claims other than his competency?
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3055.788,3056.504,"No, raise the same claim."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3056.504,3065.644,"Well, I assume he could come back and try, but he certainly would have a huge burden to overcome, because... oh... oh, without any change."
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3065.644,3065.727,Yes.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3065.727,3066.277,I'm sorry.
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.177,3068.596,"In other words, he would have won on--"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3068.596,3068.896,Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.896,3070.129,--It's clear he would win on the merits.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3070.129,3070.996,So they found him incompetent--
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3070.996,3071.798,But he can't establish innocence.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3077.35,3078.168,"--Yes, he could--"
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.168,3079.068,He presented it and he won.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3079.068,3093.394,"--He could come back, because again there would have been a new judgment, the execution warrant saying that now we're going to go execute you, and as we've been talking about, it's that piece of paper that would allow him to come back in and not be a second or successive--"
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3093.394,3093.911,"Well, I know, but--"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3102.067,3105.602,--It is something sort of out of the 1800's.
1997.97-300,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3119.779,3134.454,"In Justice Stevens' case, would it be fair to say that he doesn't have to bring a new habeas petition at all, all he needs to do is bring a petition to enforce the judgment that he already has, since that judgment covers what the State now proposes to do?"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3135.304,3136.49,"Yes, he could."
1997.97-300,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3160.106,3174.263,"Well, but wouldn't you take the position that in that circumstance the State has the burden to come in, to come forward and vacate the judgment that the court had already... and ask for a vacation of the judgment that the court had already rendered and until it did that, you wouldn't bring new habeas."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3174.263,3174.596,--No.
1997.97-300,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3174.596,3175.615,"You'd just say, enforce what we've got."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3175.615,3176.148,"That's right, yes."
1997.97-300,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3193.16,3198.481,"Are you going to stand by your argument that this Court has no jurisdiction, the one that you made last instead of first?"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3210.871,3229.0,"Well, Your Honor, what we... what we are saying at this... that (b)(3)(E) is getting at is telling this... is Congress telling this Court that they don't want you messing around with the authorization decisions no matter what the result is, that those are proceedings that they don't want to have delay from."
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3233.302,3237.789,"--If we're getting to the purpose of Congress, I thought it was your theory that this was not a successive--"
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3237.789,3238.322,--It is.
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.322,3241.824,"--Therefore, we have ordinary certiorari jurisdiction under your view."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3241.824,3242.591,Yes.
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3243.176,3245.293,Only if you say... go the other way do we not have jurisdiction.
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3245.293,3264.106,"--That's... that's true, but I'm also offering you another way of looking at that statute, which is that any gatekeeper decision, which is what this was... it was a gatekeeper decision saying, you didn't need to come here, by the way, that any gatekeeper decision, Congress is saying that this Court does not have cert jurisdiction over."
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3274.112,3280.699,"Well, it seems to me that both for the merits issue and the jurisdictional issue the first thing we've got to decide is whether it's a second or successive petition within the meaning of the act."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3280.699,3281.735,It--
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.735,3285.003,"And you just take the position it isn't, he takes the position it is."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3285.003,3299.679,"--Except that I believe that this statute can be read, the jurisdictional portion of the statute can be read to say it covers any authorization decision made by the court of appeals, that this Court is to stay out of that, because they want to expedite the procedure."
1997.97-300,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.014,3308.868,"I don't know why you make that argument, because if you're right on the other argument you're going to win on the merits, too."
1997.97-300,1,21730,denise_i_young,,3308.868,3314.189,Then I will stick with the argument that you have just... that's fine.
1997.97-300,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3319.843,3321.326,"Thank you, Ms. Young."
1997.97-300,2,17605,bruce_m_ferg,,3323.562,3341.756,"Very briefly, Your Honor, as Ms. Young's argument conceded and as... similar to what her brief was, this case hinges to some degree on whether or not successive in the current statute has the same meaning, the same term of art that it was before, and I want to show you that it does not."
1997.97-300,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3373.042,3373.875,"Thank you, Mr. Ferg."
