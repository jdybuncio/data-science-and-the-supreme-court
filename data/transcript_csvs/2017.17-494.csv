2017.17-494,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.44,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-494, South Dakota versus Wayfair. General Jackley."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,7.44,34.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two very significant consequences brought about by Quill: First, our states are losing massive sales tax revenues that we need for education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Second, our small businesses on Main Street are being harmed because of the unlevel playing field created by Quill, where out-of-state remote sellers are given a price advantage."
2017.17-494,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,34.44,35.08,I'm sorry.
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,53.72,70.24,"Justice Sotomayor -- Sotomayor, we believe that we have a right, because we have a statutory scheme in place that is nondiscriminatory, there aren't apportionment issues, it's a fair scheme, it has safe harbors in place to allow our state to --"
2017.17-494,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,70.24,71.0,Your scheme.
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,154.12,165.36,"Justice Sotomayor, we would encourage using the doctrines that are already in place with Complete Auto when it comes to a tax assessment to look for discrimination, to look for apportionment issues, to look at that substantial nexus."
2017.17-494,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,165.36,166.44,How about economic?
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,166.44,168.28,Certainly economics.
2017.17-494,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,178.88,188.08,"So how many sales does it take? You're at 200,000, I believe, or 200 sales, and I don't remember the monetary amount."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,189.32,193.92,"In South Dakota, it's -- it's set at 200 sales, or --"
2017.17-494,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,193.92,194.92,I know what it was set at.
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,199.0,204.4,"The minimum would be one sale because, if you look at Complete Auto, that creates the nexus."
2017.17-494,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,205.08,210.52,So what are we going to do with the costs that you're going to put on small businesses?
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,210.52,214.52,The small businesses are the ones that are affected most by Quill.
2017.17-494,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,222.6,234.76,"Actually, they're put at disadvantage, not by Quill, but by the fact that there are massive discount sellers, not just on the Internet, but even in stores now."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,251.76,257.88,"That brief left out that it begins -- it's to scale, and it begins at $12 a month for 30 transactions."
2017.17-494,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,263.0,265.56,That doesn't include auditing.
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,283.04,297.28,"One thing to look at is the fact that all these sellers, at least in the 45 states with a sales tax, already have a collection and a remittance obligation and already have in place the software that is able to calculate --"
2017.17-494,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,297.28,302.76,I'm sorry. There's five states that don't centralize the state and local.
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,302.76,307.12,"With those five states, as -- as indicated from the briefing, it's to scale."
2017.17-494,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,331.88,349.72,"Well, but did I understand you to acknowledge that there would be a constitutional minimum with respect to the burdens? In other words, that some businesses would not -- you could not impose the obligation on some small businesses?"
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,349.72,356.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, certainly, that's what Pike is for, is to determine in a balancing if there is a constitutional concern, if there is a Commerce Clause concern."
2017.17-494,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,356.8,358.32,Sounds -- sounds more --
2017.17-494,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,358.32,375.76,"Well, in anything -- the other areas you just mentioned, I don't know that we've recognized a -- a lowest level for things like a physical presence, right? I mean, isn't it one person, one building? So that -- that would be another special rule in this context, wouldn't it?"
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,375.76,384.56,"You know, certainly, that's one way to look at it, yes, that when you look at the burdens and you look at really physical presence, there are a lot of things that can trigger it."
2017.17-494,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,408.44,434.88,"If you have -- if there are two options, let's say option A is eliminate Quill and states can do whatever they want with respect to retroactive liability and with respect to the minimum number of sales that are required in the state in order for the sales to be taxed, in order to require them to collect the tax."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,444.16,445.04,Option A.
2017.17-494,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,458.64,480.4,"But, General, usually, when somebody says something like that, that Congress has not addressed an issue for 25-plus years, you know, it -- it gives us reason to pause, because Congress could have addressed the issue and Congress chose not to. This is not the kind of issue where you say: Well, probably didn't get on Congress's radar screen or maybe Congress was too busy doing other things."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,496.12,498.4,This is a constitutional interpretation.
2017.17-494,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,513.16,531.04,"That was -- Microsoft was just a statutory interpretation question where we might expect Congress to come in. But, here, I take it that your point is Quill, right or wrong, was this Court's decision."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,547.44,549.44,"It is, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.17-494,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.44,558.04,"If that's your answer, isn't it normal that we treat a dormant Commerce Clause case the same way we treat statutes? I mean, I think the examples are legion."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,571.96,575.88,"Justice Breyer, I would still say there's a difference because this is a constitutional interpretation."
2017.17-494,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,575.88,578.56,"No, no, but the word constitutional is not magic."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,595.6,601.76,I think the reason to treat it special is because we have a situation where Congress has had 26 years.
2017.17-494,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,601.92,608.48,"Well, we have briefs from three Senators and Congressman Goodlatte that says Congress was about to act."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,613.0,613.28,I --
2017.17-494,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,613.28,615.56,Now that's -- that's their view of it.
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,632.44,642.24,Congress doesn't have an incentive in this instance to take action in something that could be perceived as a tax when yet they don't get the opportunity to use the revenue.
2017.17-494,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,642.24,676.48,"Well, as things stand now, it seems that both the states and Internet retailers have an incentive to ask for a congressional solution to this problem. So the Internet retailers will have to deal with statutes like the Colorado reporting statute and with aggressive moves by the states to try to bring taxation within Quill in some way. And the states, obviously, have an incentive to require retail -- Internet retailers to collect the tax."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,686.08,700.32,"Well, certainly, if -- if Quill is overruled, the states will have their constitutional responsibilities to follow Complete Auto and to follow Pike. I mean, what really has happened here is, in Quill, this Court set the default."
2017.17-494,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,712.04,721.88,Can I ask you the questions that I -- two or three brief questions? You answer them when you wish and if you wish. And the reason I'm asking like this is because I read through these briefs.
2017.17-494,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.08,729.4,All right.
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,780.64,783.36,Use Respondents' numbers.
2017.17-494,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,826.96,831.52,And that is something that Congress could take care of if we overturn Quill?
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,831.52,832.16,Absolutely.
2017.17-494,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,833.6,850.24,"But in terms of -- in terms of the economic impact, I mean, the suggestion in some of the briefs is that this is a problem that has peaked in the sense that the -- the bigger e-commerce companies find themselves with physical presence in -- in all 50 states."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,867.68,878.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, because I think it's because of e-commerce. E-commerce is now 9 percent of the market, and it's rapidly growing. If you look at the numbers, it's been challenging for the states to collect on that e-commerce."
2017.17-494,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,880.48,886.72,"Sure, e-commerce is expanding, and companies like Amazon account for a large part of that."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,902.28,914.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, certainly, it's expanding, but what remains is that $100 billion loss over the next 10 years. Mr. Chief Justice, if I may please reserve the remainder of my time."
2017.17-494,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,914.76,915.52,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.17-494,0,62972,marty_j_jackley,,915.52,916.64,Thank you.
2017.17-494,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,916.64,928.16,Mr. Stewart.
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,928.16,977.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start by making two brief points about the stare decisis and the wisdom of leaving this matter to Congress. The first point I'd like to make is, whatever this Court decides, whether it overrules Bellas Hess and Quill, whether it leaves those in place, whether it does something in between, Congress can act. Congress can impose whatever solution it believes is appropriate. And, indeed, if states are given greater latitude to experiment in this area, to devise different schemes that would balance the interests of out-of-state retailers against the interests of consumers within the states' brick -- brick-and-mortar retailers, the states' own interest in -- in acquiring funds, if states can experiment, Congress will have a wider variety of models to look at to decide what aspects of each it would like to -- to choose. The second thing I'd say about stare --"
2017.17-494,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,977.64,992.16,That doesn't do anything -- that doesn't do anything for the interim period and for the dislocation and lawsuits that will -- it will engender until there is a congressional settlement.
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,992.16,1007.44,"I mean, the second thing I would say about Quill is that Quill has come to be understood to stand for the proposition that an out-of-state retailer cannot be made to collect state sales tax unless it has employees or a physical facility within the state."
2017.17-494,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1108.64,1133.8,"Mr. Stewart, do -- do you believe that there is a constitutional minimum so that even a company -- a small business using the Internet may have greater burdens than Amazon and, therefore, they have a constitutional claim under your position, or, under your position, can the states impose the burdens on any -- any micro-business, I guess is what the term has been used?"
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1133.8,1176.92,"I think our view as to the -- the correct answer, the -- the answer that is most consistent with this Court's -- the body of this Court's dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence is there's no constitutional minimum, that if you have an out-of-state retailer who is deliberately selling a particular physical good within the state, shipping the good into the state for delivery to the customer and transfer of title, that that is a sufficient basis for subjecting that retailer to the tax collection obligation in the same way that if that single good turned out to be defective, the state could be subject to the -- I'm sorry, the retailer could be subject to regulatory burdens imposed by the state, conceivably could be hauled into -- to court to answer for the --"
2017.17-494,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1176.92,1185.08,"Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, isn't that the very kind of question that Congress would be equipped to deal with, establishing a minimum?"
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1185.08,1196.04,"Certainly, the fact that we don't think there's a constitutional minimum doesn't mean it wouldn't be a good idea and it wouldn't hinder Congress's ability to decide that a minimum -- minimum should be establish --"
2017.17-494,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1196.04,1203.08,"But isn't that essentially a reason why we should leave this to Congress? In other words, from this Court's perspective, the choice is just binary."
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1231.76,1266.32,"I -- I would certainly agree that Congress has a broader range of options available to it than does the Court and an ability to devise more nuanced solutions. I don't think, with respect, that it's accurate to characterize the choice before the Court as binary; that is, although it would not be our preferred constitutional rule, it would be open to the Court to say physical presence in the form of employees or physical facilities within the state is not an ironclad requirement and yet not go as far as -- as we've advocated; namely, that anything --"
2017.17-494,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1266.32,1267.0,All right.
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1267.2,1270.04,-- within the state is -- is sufficient.
2017.17-494,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1294.92,1295.08,All right.
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1360.2,1362.04,"Well, let me say two or three things about that."
2017.17-494,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1371.56,1372.16,"Oh, is that it?"
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1372.16,1405.84,"So it's -- it's big companies, but it's not just the -- the four or five biggest giants. And so the question is kind of how far down the line do you go? How small does a company have to become in order for the -- the burden of collecting state sales taxes to -- to be substantial as -- as a practical matter? And, you know, our front-line answer is the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't entitle a fledgling business to the ability to make a profit if the obligation to collect sales taxes in various states pushes it from making a profit to -- to sustaining a loss."
2017.17-494,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1426.04,1429.12,But the South Dakota law is obviously a test case.
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1450.12,1504.72,"And -- and, certainly, if the Court issued a decision that said physical presence is no -- that adopted our -- kind of our view of the correct answer that said you sell -- you make one sale into the state, you are obligated to collect the sales tax, I have no doubt that if the Court issued that ruling, many states would adopt regimes that are less hospitable to retailers, unless they were stopped from doing that by Congress. My -- my point, though, is that there are various contexts in the -- the dormant Commerce Clause, particularly in determining whether a state's tax is likely to cause duplicative taxation, in which the Court says: What if every state were to do this? Wouldn't the burdens on interstate commerce be exorbitant? I have my doubts that that mode of analysis applies here, but even if it -- if it did, what the retailers are asking for is something more -- much more than that."
2017.17-494,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1523.12,1523.88,So even if --
2017.17-494,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.88,1523.92,Well --
2017.17-494,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1523.92,1525.2,"Well, on the issue of duplicative --"
2017.17-494,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.2,1525.56,Go ahead.
2017.17-494,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1525.56,1537.48,"-- duplicative taxation, does the government have a position on the question whether retroactive application of -- of this would be constitutional?"
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1537.48,1548.92,"In our view, it would be constitutional, in -- in part because, as I was saying earlier, we don't understand Quill to have issued an in -- inadvertent holding with respect to Internet presence."
2017.17-494,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1570.12,1571.64,"Mr. Stewart, may -- may I just ask --"
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1571.64,1572.16,-- the law was sustained.
2017.17-494,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1572.16,1583.36,"-- before you finish, what is the government's position on the prospect of prospective overruling of Quill? Then we would have no retroactivity problem."
2017.17-494,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1583.36,1608.92,"I -- I think the Court has eschewed prospective announcement of constitutional rules in the following sense: That is, the Court has determined, certainly correctly I -- I believe, that the Court's role is to interpret the Constitution, not to amend it. If the Court says in June of this year that the dormant Commerce Clause means X, it can't say that up until now the dormant Commerce Clause meant something else."
2017.17-494,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.92,1645.72,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Isaacson."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1645.72,1659.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court: I'd like to direct my initial responses to some of the questions that Justice Breyer was asking counsel."
2017.17-494,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.08,1711.8,That -- that wasn't the problem really.
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1777.32,1781.72,"Well, part of that problem, Justice Breyer, is the fact that there's no record in this case."
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1798.16,1834.48,"But how about going back to the very basic issue? An -- assertion is that asking an out-of-state seller to collect tax on goods shipped in-state discriminates against interstate commerce. But, I see it, why isn't it, far from discriminating, equalizing sellers; that is, anyone who wants to sell in-state, whether an in-state shop, an out-of-state shop, everybody is treated to the same tax collection obligation."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1847.28,1886.12,"Well, the -- the dormant Commerce Clause takes as its principal objective the maintenance of a single national marketplace that is free and accessible to all participants. And the Court found back in the Bellas Hess decision in '67 that the existence of 2300 different sales and use tax jurisdictions with varying rates, varying exemptions, varying taxability items, varying filing requirements and audit obligations, was a burden on in-state commerce. In 1992, when Quill was decided, that figure went from 2300 to 6,000."
2017.17-494,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1904.68,1914.6,"I -- I -- I don't think you've quite addressed Justice Ginsburg's question, though, which is brick-and-mortar retailers, if they choose to operate in any given jurisdiction, have to comply with that jurisdiction."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,1944.68,1949.2,"Thank you, Justice Gorsuch. Borders count."
2017.17-494,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1996.08,2005.92,"I accept that, but it's still not responsive, counsel. You're -- you're -- you're just merely pointing out that more Internet retailers are moving toward brick and mortar."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2013.6,2021.44,So the -- the United States has suggested that even one sale into the state would require collection.
2017.17-494,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2027.48,2028.24,Not necessarily.
2017.17-494,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2028.24,2057.36,"You may know the answer -- you may know the answer, but, I mean, with all these numbers, I mean, one part of the answer to that in my mind or, not an answer, but help resolve it, is what does it cost for a mandolin seller who sells mandolins on the Internet to sell them in 50 states? How much does it cost him to enter that market? How much did it cost Sears, Roebuck? You know, that's an ancient name, but they did all right. (Laughter.)"
2017.17-494,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2057.36,2074.52,"And, by the way, how much does it cost Amazon voluntarily to comply? And I -- I mean, see, there are empirical questions that I think are -- would help me reach an answer."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2087.56,2088.24,So one of the reports --
2017.17-494,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.24,2091.16,Do you know? Do you know what it costs Amazon?
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2091.16,2115.08,"I do not know what it costs Amazon, but I do know that in the Kavanagh report, which we cite in our -- in our briefs to the Court, indicated that the cost of just implementation and integration of a software system, before you're dealing with any of the other issues, costs up to $250,000. That the maintenance of a system --"
2017.17-494,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2115.08,2116.84,"Well, but it starts at $12."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2170.4,2173.72,The Colorado regime is much less burdensome.
2017.17-494,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2173.72,2178.16,Do you have any data on that? Is there anything at all that tells us that?
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2178.16,2181.28,"Well, that law has only gone into effect this year."
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2203.08,2218.12,"And then the state has the burden of going after consumers, I mean, just in the real world, it's much more efficient, much more likely, to yield funds if you go after the seller than if you go after the individual consumer."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2218.12,2224.4,"And I think that speaks, Justice Ginsburg, to the value of a congressional solution."
2017.17-494,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2342.32,2350.76,Can you imagine us saying anything -- assuming we were -- and it's hypothetical to accept your position.
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2356.76,2368.24,I would welcome a decision from this Court that would indicate that Congress should move forward with consideration and action upon legislation.
2017.17-494,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2369.24,2369.6,Well --
2017.17-494,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2369.6,2382.24,"I'm sorry. Maybe they already -- maybe they already have and they've made a decision or at least majorities have made a decision that this is something they're going to leave the way it has been for, whatever it is, 25 years."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2389.76,2396.92,I certainly -- I certainly wouldn't advise this Court on -- on how it should relay to Congress.
2017.17-494,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2417.56,2435.44,"But you say that -- that congressional action should be taken against the background in which this Court has made a statement of constitutional law that is -- has now, especially in light of the cyber age, proven incorrect."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2454.84,2461.6,I'm certainly not suggesting that Congress should be acting to correct this Court's Quill decision.
2017.17-494,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.08,2475.52,But -- but the assumption of many of these questions is that Quill is incorrect but that that doesn't make any difference.
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2494.92,2517.68,"I think that then introduces the issue of stare decisis, because the standard of stare decisis is that, even where the Court has ruled incorrectly, there's a value in settled expectations and standing by the decision previously. And that is most powerful when Congress has the ability to correct an error if that error existed."
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2523.76,2550.72,"But if the Court is responsible for Bellas Hess, and there was from the very beginning strong dissenting opinions, and there was a suggestion that there be a test -- a test case, why shouldn't the Court take responsibility to keep our case law in tune with the current commercial arrangements? It's been said that that has been done in the antitrust area."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2558.44,2564.48,"Well, first, the Quill Court did not invite test case litigation on the issue."
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2570.24,2571.2,Yes.
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2571.2,2614.96,"But I think the main reason, Justice Ginsburg, is because of the power of stare decisis, especially on the issue of reliance. If this Court decided to overturn Quill -- and I think Justice Alito giving the -- the two alternatives, either a -- an immediate overturning of Quill or -- or turning to a congressional solution -- the result would be chaotic. It's interesting, if you take the statement of Colorado's only member of the House of Representatives, Katie Noem, said, ""If the Supreme Court rules in South Dakota's favor, it could become a marketplace free-for-all."
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2628.04,2629.0,"Under Brohl, don't --"
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2629.0,2629.96,-- State of South Dakota.
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2629.96,2642.28,"-- you think there's enough incentive in the system that if we did overrule Quill, that entrepreneurs would produce software that would meet the market need?"
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2642.28,2649.44,"The notion of software being a silver bullet, I -- I think, is -- is a -- is a real misapprehension."
2017.17-494,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2700.52,2700.8,I think what --
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2700.8,2701.16,Why is it --
2017.17-494,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2701.16,2736.64,"-- Justice Ginsburg was perhaps suggesting was that all these functions would be essentially taken over by companies like Amazon and eBay and Etsy, that they would do it for all the retailers on their system. Now there's something a little bit ironic in saying the problem with Quill is that it benefited all these companies, so now we're going to overturn Quill so that we can benefit the exact same companies. But -- but I think that that's the idea; that, in fact, this would not fall on individual entrepreneurs, that it -- instead, they would pay fees to companies like Amazon."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2736.64,2744.0,"The -- the problem, Justice Kagan, is that a number of the functions that I described simply cannot be performed by software."
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2796.24,2811.24,"But they say if they open a store within the state, then they're hit by these remote -- remote sellers, and so their store in the state is suffering. It is the small business person inside the state that's suffering."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2811.24,2819.72,"It's interesting, Justice Ginsburg, that, currently, over 70 percent of all small businesses have a website."
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2907.16,2921.36,"But that would be really something that would appeal to Congress to fix, because the whole picture, Congress doesn't want to look like it's increasing taxes, but fixing something like that would not encounter the same hurdle."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2921.36,2973.88,"The absence of any incentive of the states to seek a congressional resolution in the event that Quill was overruled, I think, is a major impediment to the notion that Congress would come in and fix the problem. And as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, what happens in the interregnum, what happens in the one- or two- or three-year period before Congress acts and companies are confronted with this dilemma of collection? The notion of a chaotic period preceding Congress coming in to address the issue is as daunting as any in terms of what the consequence of overruling Quill would be. I do want to place special --"
2017.17-494,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2973.88,2982.44,"We saw today, from the announcement today, that Congress can sometimes act with -- with rapidity."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,2982.44,3064.2,"Well, in -- in this instance, leading state leaders -- for example, the Director of Tax Policy for the Conference of State Legislatures has publicly stated that if this Court were to overturn Quill, there's no reason that the states would favor federal legislation. So that dynamic is one which I think would likely stalemate Congress rather than encourage Congress to act. I do want to make special emphasis on the issue of -- of stare decisis because, since Quill has been in place, and there's been a clear explanation of what the standard is for tax jurisdiction, literally thousands of companies have conformed their conduct to the standard that was -- was established. Justice Scalia's concurrence in the Quill case said that, where that kind of reliance is present and companies have ordered their economic affairs in that reliance, that the adoption of stare decisis is at its acme. And he also pointed out that that is especially so where Congress can address the issue. If Congress were to address the issue, I think there would be no doubt that it would be purely prospective."
2017.17-494,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3081.68,3082.4,What is the reliance --
2017.17-494,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3082.4,3084.36,When you say -- I'm sorry.
2017.17-494,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3084.36,3088.52,"What is the reliance you're talking about, other than the retroactivity question?"
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,3088.52,3097.2,Companies have made their investment decisions based upon a business model understanding what the Quill standard requires.
2017.17-494,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3097.52,3104.04,"But the -- the assumption, when you're talking about stare decisis, is that the decision was wrong."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,3116.04,3116.96,"Yeah, I think --"
2017.17-494,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3116.96,3124.16,"In other words, the benefit comes from them, not just from the fact that they don't have to collect, but from the fact that most people aren't paying use taxes."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,3124.16,3143.08,"I think Justice Kagan's decisions in Bay Mills and in Kimble make clear that the application of stare decisis is not dependent upon the correctness of the decision which is being followed. In fact, if a decision is correct, stare decisis isn't necessary."
2017.17-494,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3177.56,3187.48,Is there any brief I can read or any source to determine what constitutes a small business in America? I don't even have the answer to that.
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,3216.36,3230.28,"The Small Business Administration defines small business in various categories of -- of business activity. So that's certainly a source that you could look at. The figure of 200 transactions, I think, needs to be put into -- into clear perspective."
2017.17-494,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3273.48,3282.84,"Is the same true of Colorado's reporting requirements? I mean, if we're going to compare barriers to entry, we have to compare apples to apples."
2017.17-494,2,56047,george_s_isaacson,,3293.68,3293.96,I don't.
2017.17-494,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3302.6,3306.2,"Thank you, counsel. General Jackley, five minutes remaining."
2017.17-494,3,62972,marty_j_jackley,,3306.2,3312.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Justice Breyer, I owe you an answer to your third question, and that is what rule would apply."
2017.17-494,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3331.52,3338.8,"I -- I'm sorry, you said earlier one sale is enough for -- to justify a state imposing the reporting requirements."
2017.17-494,3,62972,marty_j_jackley,,3340.12,3340.28,No.
2017.17-494,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3341.12,3345.32,What does Pike give us that -- if you're saying one sale is enough?
2017.17-494,3,62972,marty_j_jackley,,3345.32,3347.04,I think it gives you the nexus.
2017.17-494,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3356.8,3392.92,"But where -- what Complete Auto is, it's -- it's a nexus such that the benefits of state revenue do not outweigh the compliance costs associated with the tax collection obligations that the state has imposed. Now that seems like a sensible test, until I suddenly think of 10,000 cases being brought by 20,000 lawyers on one side and another 20,000 on the other to decide jurisdiction by jurisdiction, case by case about whether that test is met. Now that's -- that's -- that's why -- that was my problem with Complete Auto."
2017.17-494,3,62972,marty_j_jackley,,3392.92,3396.04,Complete Auto addresses every other tax situation --
2017.17-494,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3396.04,3396.56,That's true.
2017.17-494,3,62972,marty_j_jackley,,3396.56,3397.48,-- other than sales tax.
2017.17-494,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3397.48,3398.76,That's a very good point.
2017.17-494,3,62972,marty_j_jackley,,3398.76,3403.8,And Pike addresses every other state regulatory system under the Commerce Clause.
2017.17-494,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3530.32,3537.76,So why is it that the states are doing it? The other side pointed us to a number of states that are already making it retroactive.
2017.17-494,3,62972,marty_j_jackley,,3537.76,3537.84,I believe --
2017.17-494,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3537.84,3538.84,"So, I mean --"
2017.17-494,3,62972,marty_j_jackley,,3538.84,3561.8,"Justice Sotomayor, I believe that the other side pointed to one state, Connecticut, whose low-level representative sent a letter asking it to apply prospectively from here forward. And I would point out that Attorney General Jepsen, who signed the 45 state amicus briefs, will actually be making that decision. And the true problem with retroactivity is, is what's at issue? What's at issue is not an assessment."
2017.17-494,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3606.76,0.0,"Thank you, General. The case is submitted."
