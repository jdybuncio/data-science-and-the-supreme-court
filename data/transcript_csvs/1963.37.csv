1963.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.961,"Number 37, Gene Durfee et al., Petitioners, versus Julia E. Duke."
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,21.937,25.088,"Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen."
1963.37,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,76.179,79.204,(Inaudible)
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,79.204,80.56,"None, Your Honor."
1963.37,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,80.56,83.284,(Inaudible)
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,83.284,86.925,I understand there's no such contention.
1963.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.964,376.036,"The -- the boundary between the two States, Mr. Ross, is the Missouri River at that point."
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,376.036,377.064,"That is correct, sir."
1963.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.064,379.159,Is the midstream of --
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,379.159,379.321,Midstream --
1963.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,379.321,379.844,-- in the Missouri River --
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,379.844,380.47,-- of the Missouri River.
1963.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,380.47,381.544,-- is not one bank or the other?
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,381.544,382.018,"No, sir."
1963.37,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.018,382.47,Midstream.
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,382.47,390.392,Midstream is the boundary line between the States of Nebraska and Missouri.
1963.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.045,450.695,May I ask you?
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,450.695,450.896,Sure.
1963.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.896,466.002,(Inaudible)
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,466.002,472.762,"I can't say that -- obviously, of course, we have no authority to intervene."
1963.37,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,483.247,487.697,(Inaudible)
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,487.697,493.906,"Well, that, of course, would conclude the boundary line but I don't think that it would conclude the rights of the parties particularly."
1963.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,518.734,530.469,"Well, what would happen if Missouri did bring such an action in this Court and -- and this Court found that the property was in Missouri, what would happen to your judgment?"
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,530.469,532.397,"Your Honor, I don't think it would have any effect on."
1963.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,533.502,535.818,You'd -- res judicata would still apply?
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,535.818,537.578,"I -- I think -- that is correct, Your Honor."
1963.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,550.075,557.118,Is that to say (Inaudible)
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,557.118,557.979,"Sir, I didn't understand you."
1963.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,557.979,567.422,Is that -- is that -- is it -- is the answer you just gave to the Chief Justice mean that you say your title is good whether the land is in Nebraska or in Missouri?
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,567.422,569.724,That I -- I'm sure is the result of -- that's our position.
1963.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,569.724,570.848,"That would be, I see."
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,570.848,571.19,"Yes, sir."
1963.37,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.19,578.165,"If you win here, it won't make any difference whether the land is in Missouri or Nebraska, you alone."
1963.37,0,16787,august_ross,,588.117,591.66,"I think that's correct, Your Honor, I can't see how it would be otherwise."
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1475.044,1479.78,"Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen of the Court."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1933.589,1934.573,May I ask you a question?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1934.573,1936.972,"You certainly may, Justice Black."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1936.972,1938.77,Is this really the boundary between the two States?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1938.77,1946.205,"The Missouri River at that point is the boundary between Missouri and Nebraska and further south, it is the boundary between Missouri and Kansas."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1946.205,1949.401,What does the title depend on as to States?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1949.401,1951.472,The title to the States?
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1951.472,1957.771,What does the title of anyone of this land depend on as to the States?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1959.08,1962.008,"Well, the -- I -- if I understand you --"
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1962.008,1963.652,If it's in Missouri?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1963.652,1964.664,It's Missouri land.
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1964.664,1965.935,And if it's in Nebraska?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1965.935,1966.845,It's Nebraska land.
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1966.845,1970.771,And what court has jurisdiction to determine that boundary there?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1970.771,1973.403,"This Court, the Supreme Court."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1973.403,1976.996,It is your argument that one of the two States can do it or that others can do it?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1976.996,1983.794,It's my -- my unqualified opinion that either State has a right to file an original action in this Court to determine the boundary line.
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1983.794,1992.943,"But lacking that, how can either one of the States or in the judgment that's final in determining the boundaries?"
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,1992.943,1994.924,I don't think it can.
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1999.344,2003.604,I had an idea that one of you was saying if Nebraska could do it and the other one was saying Missouri could do it --
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2003.604,2005.459,"Oh, no, no, you misunderstood me, sir."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2014.575,2020.592,"Well, does the -- does the -- who own -- does this depend entirely on which State it's in?"
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2020.592,2025.312,This -- this particular case depends entirely upon which State the land was in.
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2041.408,2043.26,"Well, you're asking for the affirmance of the --"
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2043.26,2045.81,I am asking for the affirmance of the opinion on the Eighth Circuit.
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2045.81,2051.447,On the ground that he has -- that Court had a right to determine that it was land belonging to Missouri?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2051.447,2059.313,"That Missouri had a perfect right to determine Missouri's -- the title of Missouri residents to Missouri land within the jurisdiction of the courts in the State of Missouri, yes, sir."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2059.313,2061.185,And they're claiming the same thing with reference to Nebraska?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2061.185,2062.915,They claim the same thing in Nebraska.
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2062.915,2065.797,"But it finally gets back to which State the lands in, doesn't it?"
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2065.797,2066.969,"Yes, it does."
1963.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2071.219,2075.074,"Well, what were you about to say anything about the original action, Mr. --"
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2075.074,2077.119,"Well, the -- the original action in Nebraska?"
1963.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2077.119,2078.414,"No, no, in this Court."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2078.414,2078.902,Yes.
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2078.902,2087.739,"I think to determine the actual boundary between the two States, Nebraska and Missouri, an action would have to be filed by one of the States in this Court."
1963.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2112.025,2119.344,"See, what bothers me is and on your premise, this whole thing depends on which State the land lies in."
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2119.344,2120.152,No question about it.
1963.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2120.152,2126.611,"I can't understand how this litigation has any status at all, the litigation that to -- to our argument."
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2126.611,2128.635,"Well, you gentlemen accept the certiorari."
1963.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2129.715,2132.328,"Well, is that's why we made it up, that's why we accepted it."
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2132.328,2139.232,"Well, that -- that may well be and that's the reason I'm here to try and prove to you that you were mistaken and you're accepting it."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2139.232,2142.797,You want us to all hold the State case that is in your State.
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2144.763,2146.619,"I want you to hold, Justice Black."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2151.885,2153.705,"What about them, about this statement?"
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2156.412,2158.462,Obviously not and in a case cited here and I have --
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2158.462,2164.745,"In other words, you say that this is not to be given full faith and credit and neither is there, so we'd settle nothing do we?"
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2164.745,2171.616,You -- you settle nothing so far as the boundary line between the two States is concerned.
1963.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.546,2199.065,But he could then go on back into the -- the Nebraska courts then we re-litigate it again?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2199.065,2200.914,"No, I don't think he could Mr. -- sir, Mr. White."
1963.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.914,2203.851,"Well, why is this been anymore final than the other?"
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2203.851,2215.328,"Well, I think when you get a final decision on the facts, if you -- if they seem to pursue that, in the Supreme Court in United States, I think that would be binding on everybody."
1963.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2218.716,2224.197,(Voice Overlap) can we take it from an appellate -- from a state court or do we have to do it originally that I'm suggesting?
1963.37,1,38640,robert_a_brown,,2224.197,2227.884,"Well, you -- Mr. Ross was asked whether you can obtain it from the Supreme Court in Nebraska."
1963.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2244.519,2244.869,"Well, after all that --"
1963.37,2,16787,august_ross,,3103.936,3116.68,"First place, I like to point out that patents had been issued by the United States Government in the State of Nebraska to people of Nebraska on this ground so that the title did emanate from the United States of America."
