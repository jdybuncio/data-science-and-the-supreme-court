2009.08-1107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-1107, the Hertz Corporation v. Friend."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,8.487,11.189,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,92.807,102.162,"Counsel, the problem with every test is that you can find an exception that makes the application ridiculous."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,116.672,117.138,--Sure.
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,117.138,117.655,All right.
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,120.005,120.94,Right.
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,120.94,131.313,"--because whether California has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent, to me the differences are not terribly substantial."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,189.132,190.482,"We would, Your Honor."
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,222.386,231.642,"But you have not articulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle in which to set that exception."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,241.433,242.417,--Sure.
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,243.4,255.241,"Because I don't know the difference between one headquarters and two places to do business or three, but I can still see that some factoring has to be done when the places of business are more limited."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,255.241,263.013,"--Well, I -- well, we think first and foremost that the headquarters' role would apply even in Your Honor's situation, and I will get to that to the exception -- fashioning the exception in just one second--"
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,263.013,301.739,"But your case doesn't call for that judgment, because you have a multistate corporation, and it -- I assume you would be satisfied with saying that when a corporation has dispersed operations, it doesn't have its business center or its headquarters -- doesn't have its business center dominant in any one State, that it's dispersed, then you take the headquarters, because there's no way to pick among -- choose all the others, and it certainly isn't worth the labor to try to do that."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,311.827,313.113,"--No, absolutely, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.837,328.554,"Well, why would we say that?"
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,338.61,339.979,--Right.
2009.08-1107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.979,350.934,"And to talk about the whole State of California as the principal place of doing business -- I mean, if Congress meant that, it would have said, the principal State in which business is done."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,350.934,352.302,"That's -- that's correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1107,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.302,354.238,"You don't want to throw away that good argument, do you?"
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,354.838,355.638,We certainly don't want to throw it away.
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.606,361.958,You would never get to California's thing about State.
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,368.779,369.979,--Yes.
2009.08-1107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,376.549,380.917,Were you done with your -- were you done with your answer to Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical?
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,380.917,383.536,"--I don't know that I, in fact, started the answer, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,421.928,423.061,So what constitutes headquarters?
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,423.061,423.863,--I'm sorry?
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,423.863,425.946,How many executives have to live there?
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,433.401,433.818,Right.
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,512.985,516.622,"Why did the others all go through some through total, totality of the factors test?"
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,543.753,553.877,"--Well, first in a situation with a multistate corporation with dispersed operations, as we point out in footnote 2 of our reply brief, I think the courts of appeal are generally in agreement that the headquarters would control in that situation."
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.01,581.211,But is it -- they -- they do it in different ways.
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,581.211,582.244,They do.
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.244,585.432,"Some say business operations, some say headquarters."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,585.432,587.698,There -- there is a variety of different approaches.
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.621,598.656,How does -- how do the bankruptcy courts do it?
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,622.188,627.425,"--Well, the bankruptcy courts -- I think the fairest assessment of the bankruptcy courts as of 1958 was that it was a model."
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,696.804,718.0,"In the case -- this is purely hypothetical, but suppose Hertz were to be bankrupt, file a petition in bankruptcy, where -- New Jersey would be the place, on your -- or the assets are dominantly someplace else, so it would be another place?"
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,718.0,732.827,"--Well, I think, if -- if what you are asking, Justice Ginsburg, is, where would the principal place of business be under the bankruptcy statute, the majority rule now, under the Fifth Circuit case Commonwealth Oil Refining and the Seventh Circuit case Peachtree, would show that the majority rule now is that the principal place of business would be New Jersey."
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,858.443,876.137,"Counsel, all you are talking about is not necessarily nerve center, because in reading the examples in your brief, what you are talking about is: Where is the place where they have the most important, significant, influential contact?"
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,907.525,919.666,"There does, Your Honor, and we think -- I guess the -- the comparison I would make is to an individual, because an individual can't declare that he or she is a domiciliary of a particular State and have it be so for citizenship purposes."
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,922.285,923.252,That's -- that's the point.
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,923.252,925.737,"Exactly, and we -- we share that view."
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,933.926,948.067,"Is there -- is there something to a rule that says headquarters is presumptively the nerve center, but a challenged party, whoever that is, can rebut it?"
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,948.067,952.054,--I think certainly it would be a vast improvement over what the Ninth Circuit has.
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,967.78,973.884,"Well, that's the point that I raised, which is that the headquarters is not an important, consequential, or substantial."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,978.603,979.038,--Yes.
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,996.999,997.716,"Well, but--"
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,997.716,999.016,So I guess that's where I would place the load-bearing weight.
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1000.118,1012.593,"--That's the problem, which is, the party comes in, alleges by summary judgment that -- in a summary judgment motion: This is my corporate headquarters."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1015.628,1016.178,--Right.
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1016.911,1019.263,So that it's always a rebuttable presumption.
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1019.263,1034.189,"--There is, Your Honor, and if the other side were able to show that the location that the party identifies as -- as its headquarters does not, in fact, function as a headquarters, in the sense that suppose there is no executives there, or suppose that the officials that are there in fact don't direct and control the company's operations in other locations."
2009.08-1107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1048.366,1053.586,"I actually do not know whether public filings define what ""headquarters"" mean."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1065.911,1067.429,"--Well, they -- they do in the following sense, Your Honor."
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1085.557,1090.843,"I know, but didn't Congress pick ""a principal place of business""?"
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1130.15,1145.846,"--Well, in -- in response to the latter point, Your Honor, I think the one thing we do know from 1958 is that Congress didn't think that a corporation should be disabled from getting diversity jurisdiction anywhere where it does a substantial business, because it had that proposal before it, and it rejected it."
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1145.846,1146.529,"It rejected it, yes."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1146.529,1155.701,"It instead chose an approach whereby a company is disabled from getting diversity jurisdiction in one, and only one, jurisdiction, the jurisdiction in which it has its principal place of business."
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1296.06,1305.416,"What about her argument that -- that Hertz has this New Jersey headquarters, but its reservation center is in Oklahoma?"
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1305.416,1310.404,"--Sure, and -- and, again, I would look at the public filings."
2009.08-1107,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1415.702,1428.295,Not all diversity suits have major law firms in them and a lot of resources to spend in -- in discovery to determine more complex tests.
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1428.295,1428.979,--That's right.
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1503.943,1518.869,"Even -- even when the direct -- the -- even subject-matter jurisdiction is precluded after final -- final judgment after direct -- so that's a little extreme, the example you gave."
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1518.869,1524.255,"Well, I think -- I guess my point is that precisely because subject-matter jurisdiction can be raised at any point--"
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1524.255,1529.058,Not any point in the direct -- up to denial of cert on direct review.
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1535.878,1537.414,"--Sure, right."
2009.08-1107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1549.222,1549.772,Yes.
2009.08-1107,0,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1549.772,1555.809,"And there is a case that we cite in our brief, the Diaz -- Diaz versus Pep Boys case, that involve that situation."
2009.08-1107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1558.828,1559.694,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1565.329,1566.031,Thank you.
2009.08-1107,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1591.963,1595.533,Is -- is that a fair description of what the Ninth Circuit did here?
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1601.104,1617.197,"The -- the Ninth Circuit specifically in this case noted that 43 percent more employees for Hertz are in California, 75 percent more property, 60 percent more revenue, and--"
2009.08-1107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1617.197,1620.999,"More than -- more than what, more than any other single State?"
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1620.999,1622.6,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.6,1626.569,"But it doesn't say the -- the ""principal State of business""."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1631.706,1634.742,"I think I have two answers to that, Your Honor."
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1678.021,1680.471,Why -- why didn't they say place of doing business?
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1683.489,1686.091,"They didn't, and Congress was--"
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1686.091,1694.114,That would be more consistent with an aggregation of -- of all of the factors the Ninth Circuit starts with.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1694.114,1705.254,"--Your Honor, Congress chose the phrase ""principal place of business"" because, to quote the legislative history, there were many cases on the books, and it was an easily understood phrase."
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1715.36,1732.672,"Counsel, what's very clear from all of the articles I have read in the lower court decisions is that Congress may have thought it was picking a well-defined phrase, but, in fact, it wasn't, that the Courts below are confused about what they were doing before the statute."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1740.512,1751.283,"--Your Honor, in answer to Justice Scalia's question, I believe it was clear, from all of the case law, that we were talking about place equalling an aggregation of all of the activity in the State."
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1794.146,1817.595,"So why do you -- why do you think that the circuits courts -- the vast majority of them, the third, the first, the second, the fifth, they all start with the proposition that, if a place has far-flung businesses, then the nerve center test should start the inquiry and control it more than in a situation where there are lesser places of business?"
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1817.595,1818.228,--Yes.
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1840.377,1842.143,"Well, that's a big difference."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1842.143,1850.899,"--It asks the same question, whether or not there is a -- a substantial predominance -- finds substantial predominance, not just predominance, but substantial predominance."
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1850.899,1856.22,"I -- you know, to me, the word 50 percent."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1877.733,1882.304,"I think, to understand it, one must look at the purpose of diversity."
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1896.214,1911.306,"Well, but that's what -- but that goes back to the point, if we are talking about shields or swords, Congress had before it a provision that would say, anywhere you do business, you are not a foreigner, because you are there."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,1944.861,1954.133,Courts have found that corporations are best known where they have most of their people and their property.
2009.08-1107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1975.916,1990.675,"The problem with your -- your approach -- and California is unique in this respect, is -- California is a very large State, lots of business, and you are comparing to the next State that has the next number of employees -- you know, Florida."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2055.701,2060.003,"That is correct, Your Honor, unless, of course, Hertz were to change its place of incorporation to New Jersey."
2009.08-1107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2060.003,2078.947,"And why do you say, well -- why is it that the Ninth Circuit's method, California versus Florida, instead of California and let's see what the rest of the business is -- is, in the whole United States?"
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2078.947,2094.326,"I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, to that question goes back to how the phrase ""principal place of business"" was looked at under the Bankruptcy Code, and in the Bankruptcy Code, it was, in fact, a State-by-State analysis, rather than a State versus country analysis."
2009.08-1107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2130.249,2151.512,"I don't understand why, somehow, a Californian is more likely to identify with Hertz, simply because there are more Californians and, hence, more Hertz outlets, than a New Jerseyite is likely to identify with Hertz."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2181.032,2197.024,"Congress made a decision in rejecting the any place where you are doing business test, that it would not prevent corporations from removing cases in any State where they are doing business."
2009.08-1107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2222.79,2227.627,But they cannot be advised by the State court in New Jersey either.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2259.598,2262.55,"--Congress had two goals, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2268.871,2271.173,But that would be a phony headquarters.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2278.809,2282.694,--But even a -- even a real headquarters wouldn't prevent gaming of the system.
2009.08-1107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2299.722,2300.538,Is that phenomenon?
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2314.232,2320.034,"--Because the test is only a Seventh Circuit test, it wouldn't do any good for a corporation--"
2009.08-1107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.034,2323.504,"Well, it is one of the factors in other -- in other states as well."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2329.325,2331.092,"--It would, but it wouldn't be dispositive."
2009.08-1107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2338.848,2351.421,But why would they move simply to avoid a Federal court or to gain access to the Federal court in a particular State?
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2351.421,2362.296,"--There is -- as witnessed by congressional findings in the Class Action Fairness Act, there is a perception that State courts in certain States are not good for corporations."
2009.08-1107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2383.876,2384.942,But we are not talking about all.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2422.083,2427.202,"With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe that the case law has borne that out."
2009.08-1107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.962,2454.019,"We don't worry about private individuals gaming the system, do we, by -- you know, in -- in order to get into or out of Federal court, establishing residence in a different State?"
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2456.319,2458.321,"We do, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2465.391,2466.077,Sure.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2484.372,2491.608,"I do believe it is less likely that an individual would either have the sophistication or, frankly, the litigation volume to make such a decision?"
2009.08-1107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.827,2497.679,I know some rich individuals that might have the incentive.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2497.679,2515.843,"I would like to turn, if I may, to the second reason that Congress passed the '58 amendment and that was because of the notion of overcrowding of the Federal docket because too many diversity cases -- because there were too many diversity cases because most litigation was happening far away from the facts."
2009.08-1107,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.804,2537.57,"Mr. Schneider, can I just inject this thought?"
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2574.762,2590.891,"--The -- again, for 50 years, Justice Stevens, plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers have been able to under the various tests figure out where corporations are citizens."
2009.08-1107,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.891,2598.628,But you must acknowledge that it's a lot easier for a plaintiff -- there is some place to get on the internet and say where is their principal place and they get a simple answer.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2606.651,2610.103,"It may or may not be, depending upon the corporation."
2009.08-1107,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.554,2629.064,"--of an interstate business who are commonly defendants in a lot of lawsuits -- in a personal injury suit, and the question is, can I easily decide what the place of incorporation of that defendant is."
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2629.064,2630.43,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-1107,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2645.859,2650.644,"Where is -- under the Ninth Circuit test, where is -- what is the principal place of business of Starbucks?"
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2650.644,2660.083,"Under the Ninth Circuit test, the principal place of Starbucks, there is a case that says Starbucks is in California."
2009.08-1107,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.718,2663.82,That's a surprise.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2665.437,2667.789,--I was -- I was surprised as well.
2009.08-1107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2672.676,2674.393,Where is -- where is its headquarters.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2674.393,2676.711,"Headquarters is in Seattle, Washington."
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2681.282,2682.715,That's the very first little shop was there.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2682.715,2684.984,"That's my understanding, yes."
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2690.988,2692.922,Can you tell me what 100 percent means?
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2700.76,2703.362,I don't know the total numbers of the workers.
2009.08-1107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2703.362,2704.228,--Isn't that important?
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2720.24,2723.609,"I -- I don't know the raw numbers from Starbucks, I'm sorry."
2009.08-1107,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2746.824,2749.693,"What about, I guess, mail order houses?"
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2754.395,2760.032,"It would -- it would be, Your Honor, wherever there is a substantial predominance of its people and property."
2009.08-1107,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2770.69,2777.426,"Would -- would it make a difference if, say -- it may well be the case, 30 percent of their business is in California?"
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2777.426,2778.043,No.
2009.08-1107,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.545,2781.128,Yes.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2781.128,2785.866,"The test we posit, Your Honor, focuses on people and property."
2009.08-1107,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2805.513,2807.296,I don't know.
2009.08-1107,1,43342,todd_m__schneider,,2814.369,2815.136,Okay.
2009.08-1107,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2823.141,2824.841,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1107,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2828.443,2833.997,"Your Honor, just one point and I will be brief."
2009.08-1107,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2863.968,2867.936,That means that its principal officers and their families have to move.
2009.08-1107,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2867.936,2868.603,--It does.
2009.08-1107,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.603,2870.805,That's the biggest disincentive it seems to me.
2009.08-1107,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2870.805,2872.488,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2874.407,2875.674,"Thank you, counsel."
