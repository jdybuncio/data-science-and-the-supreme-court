1980.80-802,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.158,We'll hear arguments next in National Gerimedical Hospital v. Blue Cross of Kansas City.
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,64.506,67.125,May it please the Court:
1980.80-802,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.745,312.052,"But in a sense it would place the consumer in the long run at an advantage, would it not, in that a lot of unneeded medical facilities would not be built?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,312.052,316.522,That may or may not be the case.
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.657,376.411,"Mr. Griswold, does the state even now have a statewide planning agency?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,376.411,376.778,Yes.
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,380.197,381.382,When did that come into being?
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,381.382,384.167,"Effective October, 1980."
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,393.706,402.478,"Well, at the time it applied, at the time it sought an arrangement with Blue Cross, there was no state backing?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,402.478,405.514,--There was no Missouri statute restricting--
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.514,414.353,"And is this legislation enacted under the spending power, this?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,414.353,420.274,--I would guess it would be under the commerce power.
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,420.274,425.328,"Well, does it involve federal money going to the state?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,425.328,447.007,"The states are encouraged by the statute to have a state health planning and development agency which would have power to grant certificates of need, but the states are not required to have that."
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.007,463.953,"If a state says, I don't want anything to do with this, I don't want to participate in this program at all, nevertheless, you think the statute is applicable in the state, in the sense that the regional planning agency should be formed?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,463.953,469.689,"On the contrary, our position is that the statute is not applicable in the state unless the--"
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.689,472.139,"Well, it would be if it was under the commerce power."
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,472.139,479.562,"--Unless the state... well, it would be that the power of Congress might be under the--"
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.562,481.078,But they didn't intend it to be?
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,481.078,495.172,"--But they didn't intend it to, and I didn't quite complete my answer, which is that there is a paragraph in the statute which says that if the state doesn't choose to have a state agency, then it will not get certain grants."
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,506.38,517.936,"Is it your position that this regional planning agency, one of the named coconspirators, what's... the initials are too complicated--"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,528.643,536.232,It had authority to operate under the federal law for the purpose of making plans and recommendations.
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.232,539.601,Even though the state didn't want anything to do with this at the time... with the statute?
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,539.601,549.723,It seems to me it's a little like the American Law Institute which proposes a federal securities code.
1980.80-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,616.451,619.819,"Mr. Griswold, can I interrupt you to get something out of the way for me?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,645.052,645.754,I'm not sure that I can answer that.
1980.80-802,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,668.986,674.806,"Isn't one of the objectives, Mr. Griswold, to avoid the proliferation of unused beds?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,674.806,683.496,"That is the reason for having a certificate of need statute, but Missouri didn't have one and chose not to have one."
1980.80-802,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,703.307,710.146,Do you suggest that the situation might be different now after the 1980 development?
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,712.363,723.121,"Missouri now has a planning, but it also has a statute which says that National Gerimedical shall be deemed to have a certificate of need."
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1056.85,1057.969,Psychologically sound.
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1057.969,1074.831,And if the Court will cross out the bottom two thirds of page 8a and the top half of page 9a it will avoid a confusion for which I apologize.
1980.80-802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1074.831,1081.218,"Now, let's see, that's strike out all of (b) and (1) at 8a, is it, Mr. Griswold?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1081.218,1088.889,"On 8a, you strike out everything below the black letter heading, 300m> [""]."
1980.80-802,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1088.889,1093.458,Is this a commitment not to charge this as a taxable cost if you prevail?
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1093.458,1105.516,"We certainly cannot appropriately, except that briefs don't come within taxable costs, and so I'm afraid we'll have to pay for it."
1980.80-802,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.266,1465.834,"Well, Mr. Griswold, what if the Missouri Legislature had taken up a proposal for the formation of a state regulatory body and come to the conclusion that 95 percent of Missourians were Christian Scientists, and so they simply didn't want anything to do with this and they didn't want any hospital building in the state; and so they enacted a statute saying, there will be no hospitals constructed in the state for two years?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1465.834,1473.888,"Well, then they would have determined by legislative action the policy of the State of Missouri."
1980.80-802,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1516.745,1525.786,"You wouldn't think that, apparently, that Justice Rehnquist's hypothetical enactment was a valid zoning ordinance?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1525.786,1534.892,"Well, I think it would be very similar to enacting a valid zoning ordinance."
1980.80-802,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1615.11,1619.178,"Mr. Griswold, you keep on saying Missouri chose not to."
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1625.299,1635.588,"No, on the contrary, I think Missouri did have one for a while and repealed it, which would be a choosing not to."
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.419,1777.047,"Mr. Griswold, I take it there's no provision or indication in the federal law that if Blue Cross had chosen to make a contract with this hospital, despite the refusal of a certificate of need from MAHSA, that there would have been no violation of federal law?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1777.047,1782.184,"Well, let me say, MAHSA never refused to issue a certificate of need."
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.184,1783.034,"Well, assume it had, though."
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1783.034,1785.17,Assume it had?
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1790.957,1802.515,"Yes, but suppose MAHSA had refused to certify this, what did it do that led Blue Cross to refuse to make the contract?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1802.515,1817.007,"--It did that thing which I read from the record in which it said that they... well, what MAHSA did was to put out an elaborate health planning thing which occupies hundreds of--"
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.007,1820.393,"And Blue Cross read it as saying, as meaning it wasn't needed."
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1820.893,1824.095,--Blue Cross read it as meaning--
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.095,1836.505,"Well, what if it had read it as meaning that this facility wasn't needed, exactly the way it read it now, but had said, well, nevertheless, we're going to make a contract with the... that would not have violated any federal law?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1836.505,1837.538,"--No, it wouldn't have violated any--"
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.538,1840.207,It might have made MAHSA mad but--
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1840.207,1844.425,--It would not have violated any federal or state law whatever.
1980.80-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.425,1860.368,"--Mr. Griswold, supposing, though, that Missouri had authorized the program and then the planning agency, whatever its proper name is, refused to designate the hospital, give it the certificate, and thereafter Blue Cross entered into the contract with them."
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1874.11,1880.698,"I don't recall, Mr. Justice, at this point, any provision of the federal statute which that would have violated."
1980.80-802,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.698,1882.348,"Well, it would have resulted in cutting off funds."
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1882.348,1883.9,"No, not in my understanding."
1980.80-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1883.9,1885.6,We're not talking about federal funds.
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1886.002,1886.768,Not in my understanding of what--
1980.80-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.768,1889.454,"--Would it violate the statute for Blue Cross to say, well, we'll go ahead and insure you anyway?"
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1889.454,1900.076,--The federal funds are cut off from the state only if it doesn't have a state health planning and development agency.
1980.80-802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.928,1903.295,"Well, then, the one that operates according to federal rules."
1980.80-802,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1903.295,1911.9,"--In the case put by Justice Stevens, the state has a state health plan, so the state funds would not be cut off."
1980.80-802,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1973.441,1976.71,"Very well, Mr. Griswold."
1980.80-802,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1984.166,1987.55,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.714,2071.973,Do you think this disfavor of implied repeal is stronger in the case of antitrust laws than in the case of other regulatory laws?
1980.80-802,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2071.973,2079.377,"I think it may well be, perhaps, just because of their age and their fundamental nature."
1980.80-802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2080.995,2084.114,"How about the Logan Act, passed in 1796?"
1980.80-802,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2084.114,2086.816,"Well, I just don't think we have to decide that here."
1980.80-802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2403.189,2420.132,"General McCree, was there any finding in the district court or court of appeals that the actions of the Blue Cross in effect violated the antitrust acts here, or was it just the whole thing turned on whether they were exempt from the antitrust acts?"
1980.80-802,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2420.132,2422.551,"The latter, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-802,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.855,2463.644,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask the same question I asked Mr. Griswold, what is your understanding of the statutory purpose of a certificate of need?"
1980.80-802,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2474.366,2502.869,"Well, first let me say that I'm not altogether clear either in my understanding of it, but it is not, it is not a compulsion of the Federal Government, which was part of Mr. Justice Stevens' inquiry, because it can only be accomplished by a state agency which was not in place at the relevant time of the refusal, alleged refusal to deal here, but it has since come into being."
1980.80-802,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.891,2513.291,"Well, let me rephrase the question."
1980.80-802,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2533.803,2536.255,I'm not aware of any federal law that it would violate.
1980.80-802,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.707,2542.758,Nor would it violate a federal law if Blue Cross made a contract with it?
1980.80-802,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2542.758,2544.794,I would agree with that too.
1980.80-802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.224,2726.944,Mr. Greenberg.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2726.944,2729.896,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2773.59,2777.642,"Mr. Greenberg, under what authority did Congress take that action?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2777.642,2783.279,I think that the authority was generally under the spending authority.
1980.80-802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2790.65,2795.853,It simply provided that if the states didn't comply they would not get the funding?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2795.853,2798.555,--That is correct; that is correct.
1980.80-802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2827.639,2828.555,Where are those words?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2828.555,2830.941,These are words in various sections of the statute.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2831.607,2832.693,It's an awfully long statute.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2832.693,2836.395,--I'm going to have the same problem Mr. Justice Rehnquist had earlier.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.67,2858.843,"But the one, I'm particularly interested in the one about reducing the amount of hospital services or whatever it was."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2858.843,2859.376,"It says,"
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.645,2864.062,"And, in particular, where is that?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2864.062,2867.447,300L-2(a)(4).
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.447,2869.382,300L-2(a)(4).
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2870.568,2872.168,"These statutory words, planning--"
1980.80-802,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2872.168,2875.37,Where do we put our finger on that correctly here?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2875.37,2879.155,--In our brief it's at page 15.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2879.155,2885.743,You can't tell the players without a program.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2888.712,2889.345,Fifteen.
1980.80-802,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2889.345,2891.481,Fifteen.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,2895.783,2898.401,These are short words.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3189.871,3194.409,"What is the scope, Mr. Greenberg, of the implied repeal."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3203.865,3212.621,"With respect, sir, the certificate of need is only a matter of state law, and I think it points up what was going on here."
1980.80-802,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3213.337,3220.341,There was no provision at the time of the operative facts here for a state certificate of need.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3220.841,3221.491,--That's absolutely correct.
1980.80-802,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3222.359,3224.626,"So there was none, but there couldn't have been any?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3224.626,3225.311,--Pardon me?
1980.80-802,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3225.311,3228.763,"There was no certificate of need, but there couldn't have been any?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3228.763,3231.299,There could have been a certificate of need in Missouri.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3234.883,3236.916,Absolutely; did not have one.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3244.172,3255.361,"The scope of the exemption should be related to the facts of our particular case, and the facts of our case can be ascertained not from statements of it being certified by the State of Missouri--"
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.361,3258.848,"Well, I mean, let's say, instead of Blue Cross, say it's a group of contractors?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3258.848,3266.002,"--We have specific facts here, and the specific facts here are, according to the complaint, according to the very complaint--"
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.002,3272.056,"But, no, the thrust of my question is, what is the exemption that you contend Congress created?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3276.21,3282.547,"--I think they had in mind this situation, this kind of situation, where the health systems--"
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.547,3285.149,"--What I want to know is, what is the scope of the situation they had in mind to grant an exemption?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3285.149,3286.299,--I understand.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3287.282,3287.849,What is it?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3289.268,3290.501,"--Oh, no; oh, no."
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3290.501,3307.412,"Would it cover then, say, a group of contractors who refuse to build a hospital or a group of doctors who refuse to offer their services unless they get... would it cover all kinds of collusive activity or cooperative activity designed to prevent the construction of a new hospital?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3307.412,3323.774,"Provided that... the answer is yes, provided that, key, provided that, that the health systems agency, the federally created, the federally funded agency... 34 this isn't some private interloper; it's supervised by the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.704,3348.489,But it had no power to require Blue Cross--
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3348.489,3349.589,That is absolutely correct.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3349.589,3358.947,"--And if it talked the pharmaceutical people into refusing to sell a new hospital drugs, I suppose you would say the same thing?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3358.947,3359.53,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.53,3364.148,"Anything that MAHSA could talk anybody into doing, whether they were required to do it or not, is exempt."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3364.148,3368.469,Is exempt because that's what Congress wanted to have done.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.469,3369.552,"Yes, your answer is yes."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3369.552,3370.369,The answer is yes.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3370.369,3373.338,Could they have turned it over to a subsidiary?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3373.338,3376.39,A subsidiary of whom?
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3376.39,3383.145,Blue Cross turn it over to a subsidiary called the Hospital Opportunists Association?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3383.145,3387.363,I don't have to reach that question on these particular facts.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3387.363,3390.149,"Would you mind, would you mind meeting it?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3390.149,3395.619,I think that that would surely be a broader exemption than is being called for here and might not be covered.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3395.619,3399.088,"But this is a purely private organization, isn't it?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3399.088,3401.873,Are we talking about MAHSA or Blue Cross?
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3401.873,3403.54,MAHSA.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3403.54,3405.989,"MAHSA is not a ""purely private organization""."
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3417.883,3422.786,Is it a public or private organization?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3422.786,3425.055,It's a state incorporated organization.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3425.055,3426.455,I thought it was a private organization.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3426.455,3429.255,It is private but federally funded.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3429.255,3436.977,"American Tel and Tel is a state incorporated organization too, you know, but is it a private corporation or a public corporation?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3436.977,3438.529,It's a private corporation.
1980.80-802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3450.62,3455.288,"Well, is it entirely accurate to say it's created by federal authority?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3456.824,3457.807,"--It's authorized, established."
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3462.628,3465.33,It isn't even told very specifically what to do.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3508.073,3518.779,"It would be authorized only in the event, only in the event that it was authorized by the statute and in the supervision by the Secretary of Health and Human Services was determined--"
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3518.779,3528.051,"Well, is that any... that certainly isn't any farther outside the scope of its authority than going to Blue Cross, is it?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3528.051,3529.42,"--No, it would not be here."
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3574.531,3580.601,"Is it true that Blue Cross could not have done this without MAHSA, whatever this thing is?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3580.601,3581.585,Pardon me?
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3581.585,3587.355,Could Blue Cross have acted without MAHSA and you still have your same position?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3587.355,3589.291,No.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3589.291,3596.795,"So, is it not true that MAHSA is giving antitrust exemptions?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3596.795,3598.747,That is correct.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3599.797,3601.599,"No, no, that wasn't my question."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3603.165,3603.782,--I understand.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3625.279,3629.832,"But Mr. Greenberg, there's a difference between saying you don't want a duplication and saying, we want a reduction."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3632.365,3633.284,"--No, it doesn't."
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3634.234,3636.434,Is there anything in the statute that says there are too many hospital beds?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3636.434,3642.621,--reducing... it talks about reducing documented inefficiency and it talks about the unnecessary duplication of health resources.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3642.621,3650.177,There's no statutory finding that I've been able to find that says there are too many hospital beds; nothing in the statute.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3665.954,3668.288,There are various things at stake.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3676.577,3677.877,Or in any specific place.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3677.877,3678.929,Or in any specific place.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3694.67,3696.072,But Congress didn't say that.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3696.622,3697.139,But Congress said--
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3697.139,3703.126,"--And Congress didn't say that nowhere shall there be any more hospitals unless they're approved, did it?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3703.126,3718.404,"--No, but what Congress did say is, we are going to create 205 health systems agencies and they're going to determine within each standard metropolitan area... as the Solicitor General points out, MAHSA covers Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri."
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3740.584,3750.023,"Well, no, it's not a due process claim, but I'm still puzzled as to what, even if everything were in place, what is the legal effect of one of these determinations?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3753.558,3755.61,It is positively a recommendation.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3757.029,3760.997,"If it's just a recommendation, how can it possibly give an exemption from some legal?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3760.997,3762.683,Because Congress went further.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3771.955,3773.605,Only by recommending them.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3773.605,3776.591,"No, it says, shall seek to the extent--"
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3776.591,3780.395,"Oh, I know, but they didn't have any authority to bind anybody."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3780.395,3780.828,--That is correct.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3780.828,3781.628,They could only recommend.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3781.628,3782.828,That is correct.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3802.408,3820.136,"Suppose, Mr. Greenberg, that a state law set up a state health planning agency and authorized it to make some plans about hospitals and avoid having too many hospital beds and authorized it to seek the cooperation of private interests in effecting its recommendations."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3833.377,3835.146,I think not.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3836.362,3841.216,But you say that precisely the same thing is an implied exemption under this federal law?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3841.216,3842.766,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3852.606,3854.891,"Well, it's rather difficult for you, I would think."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3854.891,3857.242,--I understand.
1980.80-802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3857.242,3862.796,I have not understood your argument as a Parker v. Brown immunity.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3862.796,3863.496,"It isn't, it isn't."
1980.80-802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3865.081,3874.887,"But as an implied exception or pro tanto repealer, which I in my limited knowledge of antitrust law have thought of as two two different things."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3915.181,3915.981,--We agree.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3963.962,3965.964,This was two alternative ways?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3965.964,3967.181,That's correct.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3988.997,3993.481,Can I back up a minute to my MAHSA point?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,3998.018,3998.835,That's correct.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3998.835,4002.837,But aren't you trying to make it binding on us?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4006.472,4007.141,With respect--
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4007.141,4014.245,"You say it wasn't binding on Blue Cross or on anybody else, but we have to take it."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4015.964,4023.001,"--That's correct, but I say that that's what Congress said in the 1974 act in the 28 words."
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4023.001,4025.603,"Oh, you're back to the 28 words?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4025.603,4026.903,"Oh, yes; oh, yes."
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4032.44,4035.208,"If you lose one of them, do you lose?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4035.208,4036.31,Pardon me?
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4036.31,4039.262,Suppose you've only got 26 of them?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4039.262,4047.649,"It depends... well, let me do something."
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4109.606,4117.712,"Mr. Greenberg, suppose that MAHSA instead of being what it was, was Blue Cross."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4129.953,4131.855,It can be any particular entity.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4131.855,4140.978,"So, what if Blue Cross had volunteered to be the HLS or the... whatever it is... HSA?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4145.295,4145.964,"No, it could not."
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4145.964,4146.464,Why not?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4146.464,4149.999,Because the HSA had to have as its governing body--
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4149.999,4151.016,I see.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4153.718,4154.185,--Providers.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4154.185,4155.07,--I see.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4155.07,4158.172,And it had to have a majority of consumers.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4199.182,4226.749,"So you're saying this is no different than if the statute had authorized the secretary of one of the departments to go out in the field and try to talk people, private parties into preventing excess hospital beds, and the Secretary of Health went out to the pharmaceutical convention and persuaded them not to sell to the new hospital?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4226.749,4227.899,That is what Congress wanted.
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4229.568,4243.378,"And so you think, then, that the pharmaceutical people, although they weren't required to do that at all, by the federal law, and couldn't have been told to do it by the Secretary, they're nevertheless exempt?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4243.378,4244.545,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-802,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4244.545,4281.268,"Mr. Greenberg, suppose... I'll try a hypothetical... that the Federal Government, the Congress, developed the idea erroneously or otherwise, that the country needed more lawyers, and provided for $500 million for matching grants to the states to build additional law schools but required that no grant would be made to a state unless the bar association of that state certified that there was a need for a law school and specified the size and capacity of that law school."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4285.605,4287.59,"With respect, no."
1980.80-802,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4332.686,4355.617,"Well, is there any analogy with respect to a bar association being a private entity as against a governmental entity, and yet having in mind that the bar association would probably be about as qualified to determine need for a new law school as anyone could possibly be?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4355.617,4373.679,"If what Congress did, as I said, we will establish you and we want you to go this route, bar associations, and we're going to supervise you... which were the facts here... by the Attorney General of the United States, then you would have an analogy to what we have here."
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4373.679,4375.865,"Mr. Greenberg, am I oversimplifying your position?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4393.49,4394.776,Yes.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4394.776,4396.944,It surely could have said it more simply.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4396.944,4397.544,Pardon me?
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4397.544,4399.813,They surely could have said that more simply than they did.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4407.4,4407.967,"Oh, yes."
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4412.054,4413.021,"But once they say, in effect--"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4413.021,4414.49,"--here, is all of the other baggage around it."
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4414.49,4422.66,"--They are to be kind of a licensing authority, really, for the area over which they have special planning interests and the like?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4422.66,4423.896,This was what Congress said.
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4424.662,4430.849,"It didn't say it in so many words, but you say that's a fair reading of the entire conglomerate of--"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4430.849,4439.571,"--I think it does say it in those words, because it says, they shall have planning, they shall have documents, and they shall seek to implement it."
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4439.571,4446.525,"--And not only shall they seek to implement, but no one shall build in contravention of any of their plans."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4447.911,4450.263,"No, Congress does not say that, because what--"
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4450.263,4452.346,"Yes, it does, if you are right."

1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4456.083,4467.54,"Well, I mean... or there is open season on other hospitals can get together and take whatever anticompetitive measures are necessary to prevent any building that is not approved in advance by the agency."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4468.957,4494.692,"Well, what Congress is saying is, that in the particular circumstances of the hospital industry... which is the wrong word; remember that back in 1974, virtually all hospitals were nonprofit hospitals, they were nonprofit hospitals with boards of governors composed of distinguished members of the community, and what was intended here, the whole theory was, we need cooperation from people like this."
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4538.471,4541.589,"--Well, there would be no antitrust risk if they merely made plans."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4544.558,4547.826,"Well, what was Blue Cross supposed to do in this situation?"
1980.80-802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4602.06,4604.845,"Well, all I'd suggest is you're confusing two different problems."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4617.837,4618.537,--That's correct.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4777.707,4779.857,"If you accept that, you're in a little trouble too."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4779.857,4780.625,--Pardon me?
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4780.625,4787.412,"If you accept that, you're in a little trouble too, because you said there was no antitrust involved."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4787.412,4792.232,I said there was no antitrust involved on the specific facts of this case.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4792.232,4792.682,"No, no."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4799.553,4800.905,That's correct.
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4800.905,4806.726,"But you now say that you agree with the Solicitor General, there were some, didn't you?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4806.726,4807.292,"No, no, no."
1980.80-802,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4808.026,4809.109,"Oh, I misunderstood you."
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4809.109,4817.448,"What the Solicitor General is saying, the Solicitor General is acknowledging that there was some implied repeal."
1980.80-802,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4831.824,4860.194,"Well, is your suggestion that after Blue Cross had sat on the board of MAHSA and the MAHSA as a unit had said, the number one priority is oversupply of beds, it would have been in effect reneging on its role in MAHSA if it had gone ahead and paid the plaintiff in this case?"
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4860.194,4879.872,"It would have been encouraging another 120 unnecessary beds in the community, which would add to costs, which would add to possible morbidity, mortality, and all of the other things that MAHSA and most particularly that the Congress of the United States found in the statute in 1974 and throughout the legislative history."
1980.80-802,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4879.872,4883.476,But it would have been no violation of federal law if it had done that?
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4883.476,4889.63,That's correct.
1980.80-802,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4940.06,4941.644,Now what happens if there's a--
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4941.644,4942.312,--It varies.
1980.80-802,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4943.912,4945.564,--I see.
1980.80-802,2,30597,joshua_f_greenberg,,4945.564,4948.632,--it's hard enough going through the '74 and '79 acts.
1980.80-802,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5448.949,5459.922,"Mr. Griswold, I think you have three minutes remaining."
1980.80-802,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5459.922,5467.762,In the brief time remaining I would like to cover a couple of points.
1980.80-802,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5561.138,5564.107,"There was no mention of the antitrust laws, but one--"
1980.80-802,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5564.107,5566.092,"""Under any law of the United States. """
1980.80-802,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5568.878,5570.83,--One can argue whether or not health--
1980.80-802,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,5570.83,5571.663,--that was what was involved.
1980.80-802,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5729.382,5730.317,"Thank you, gentlemen."
