1973.73-362,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,0.0,44.64,"We’ll now hear number 73-362, Morton versus Mancari and 73-364, Amerind versus Mancari."
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,46.72,51.235,Mr. Acting Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,232.036,234.407,Aren’t there a good many on the Indian Reservation?
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,234.407,236.393,"Yes, about to get to that."
1973.73-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.294,295.779,Do you have any statistics on the comparison of the number of Indians with the number of employees in the Bureau of Indian Affairs?
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,295.779,313.427,"Yes, in the record, the total number of Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs is 57%, I believe it is, which has arise from some 40 somewhat percent, 20 to 30 years ago."
1973.73-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,313.427,320.256,"Well, what I meant was the total number of employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as compared to the total number of the Indians?"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,320.256,321.515,"Oh, in the nation?"
1973.73-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.515,322.512,Yes.
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,322.512,348.769,"Well, there about 600,000 Indians under direct regulation or supervision, or assistance from Bureau of Indian Affairs and there may be another 400,000 who would say that they’re Indians, but who are not affected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs."
1973.73-362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,351.909,353.442,"So, a total of a million?"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,353.442,359.995,I think they’re about a million people who answered the last census and said that they were Indians.
1973.73-362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,359.995,360.853,"Of whom 600,000 are --"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,360.853,377.302,"But there was no precise definition for that because 600,000 who are members of federally recognized tribes, who either lived on reservations or off reservations, but have property that is being managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs."
1973.73-362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,377.302,383.982,"And I think about 600,000, as you see it, who are entitled to the preference --"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,383.982,387.783,That’s correct and it’s not just as I see it.
1973.73-362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.864,404.261,That’s the way they’re administering it?
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,404.261,408.532,"That’s right, but it’s not contested this time that, that is the way they are administering it."
1973.73-362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.532,409.854,But that [Voice Overlap]
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,409.854,410.683,"And, we can --"
1973.73-362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,410.683,411.931,The statute maybe broader --
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,411.931,416.416,The statute is capable of a broader interpretation.
1973.73-362,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.646,422.44,"But that whether it is or not that issue isn’t here, I guess."
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,422.44,424.835,"That’s correct, that’s correct."
1973.73-362,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,424.835,429.764,"Although, there was one sentence you didn’t quite finish, it was the last word “tribe.”"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,429.764,435.736,"I am not sure which sentence was, and the last word was probably tribe, what was the sentence?[Laughter]"
1973.73-362,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,435.736,438.32,I want to be sure what your position was and --
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,438.32,455.47,"Our position is that an Indian does not have preference, unless he is member of a federally recognized Indian tribe and also, is of at least one-fourth Indian blood."
1973.73-362,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,455.977,464.196,"Incidentally while I have you interrupted, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act has some exceptions in it, doesn’t it Mr. Sachse?"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,464.196,465.225,"Yes, it does."
1973.73-362,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,465.225,472.085,"But, it makes not exception for Indians or the Indian preference laws, do you have any explanation for that?"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,472.085,482.268,"I do and I’d like to say this though, that I would like to spend most of my time, if I can on the statement of the case and the constitutional issues here."
1973.73-362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,719.947,733.39,"The reduction that you just mentioned in land holdings, does that -- was that a total reduction in all lands held by any Indians, in any capacity or was that a reduction in tribal holdings?"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,733.39,735.022,"No, I think it was the latter."
1973.73-362,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,740.521,740.865,Reform?
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,740.865,745.17,Reform.
1973.73-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.118,902.484,"Does the Bureau, Mr. Sachse, have much responsibility outside of the administration of tribal affairs? [Voice Overlap]"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,902.484,903.68,"Well, it does in this sense."
1973.73-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.732,934.914,"And an allottee, if he meets the other requirements could qualify under the preference?"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,934.914,940.118,"That’s correct, that’s correct."
1973.73-362,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1118.305,1127.937,"Of course, the other side of that same coin is that if they had intended otherwise they would have relatively exceptions, written into the exceptions."
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1130.969,1150.897,"Unless, you focus on the purpose for those exceptions, which are not really exceptions at all, but simply a delimitation of the Executive Branch of the Government and at the outer limits of the Civil Service Commission Authority."
1973.73-362,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1160.131,1163.574,"It seems to me, you are cutting right into it, when you made the up closing statement here?"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1163.574,1169.344,"I am afraid I did, and I know you are unhappy with me for saying it all."
1973.73-362,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1182.091,1184.714,In United States you are speaking here with one voice.
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1184.714,1192.61,For a change. [Laughter]
1973.73-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.039,1353.825,"It isn’t quite as simple, as if they had a preference for farmers in the Agriculture Department?"
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1359.379,1362.577,"Well, I put this the other way, that I think [Voice Overlap] this is--"
1973.73-362,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1362.577,1363.979,Do you think you’ve got an easier case?
1973.73-362,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,1363.979,1397.403,"I think I have an easier case from that, because the special treatment in the constitution itself of Indians, the Indian -- the Commerce Clause and the long history of special legislation in dealing in Indian affairs and I point out in light of recent decisions of Court in Arnett II that perhaps a non-Indian employee doesn’t have a vested right and there’s a job in the BIA or if he does, it’s under the terms that comes in under."
1973.73-362,1,28146,harris_d_sherman,,1425.627,1429.82,Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court.
1973.73-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1796.475,1807.694,"Mr. Sterling, I am not sure that I understand what you say as being the same as what Mr. Sachse say about who qualifies for the preference."
1973.73-362,1,28146,harris_d_sherman,,1819.005,1829.494,"My understanding is the way the Bureau interprets this statute, you do not qualify for any Indian preference unless you are a present member of federally-recognized tribe."
1973.73-362,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.494,1832.054,Now that doesn’t you have to be in the reservation?
1973.73-362,1,28146,harris_d_sherman,,1832.054,1836.033,"It doesn’t mean you have to have to be on the Reservation, that’s correct."
1973.73-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1836.033,1839.532,"And you have to be also, at least one-quarter Indian-blood?"
1973.73-362,1,28146,harris_d_sherman,,1839.532,1842.582,"And you must be one one-quarter Indian-blood, that’s correct."
1973.73-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.353,1922.441,"(Inaudible) and this person who is a member of recognized tribe and one-quarter Indian-blood in an ordinary job, he has the protection of OEO?"
1973.73-362,1,28146,harris_d_sherman,,1922.441,1925.667,"Well, I think he would also have the protection of the Office of the Office [Voice Overlap]."
1973.73-362,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.667,1927.33,"So, he had both."
1973.73-362,1,28146,harris_d_sherman,,1927.33,1931.664,"So he would have both protections, I presume, because he is a member of minority, that’s correct."
1973.73-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1931.664,1938.054,"Well, he has -- and he has more than the protection of OEO, a private employer can discriminate in his favor."
1973.73-362,1,28146,harris_d_sherman,,1938.054,1940.527,Only a private employer who is on or near reservation.
1973.73-362,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1940.527,1942.058,Alright.
1973.73-362,1,28146,harris_d_sherman,,1942.058,1943.229,But that’s in the private sector.
1973.73-362,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2228.805,2231.511,Thank you.
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2240.197,2244.928,Mr. Justice Douglas and may it please the Court your Honors.
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.099,2349.715,"[Voice Overlap] those preferences are all limited to Indians, aren’t they??"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2349.715,2355.549,"They are limited to Indians, yes, Your Honor, but they are services rendered to Indians."
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.549,2357.122,But to nobody else?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2357.122,2361.637,Not to nobody else through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2361.637,2368.513,And would you suggest there’s also a constitutional question about those services?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2368.513,2371.105,"No, Your Honor Justice White."
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.787,2383.889,But you are here to argue that the constitutionality of a preference in employment for Indians --
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2383.889,2384.323,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.323,2388.633,A preference in the sense that they will hire only Indians for certain jobs?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2388.633,2389.9,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.243,2401.247,You would not think of any constitutional question about furnishing schools only to Indians or the furnishing water or a lot of other services only to Indians?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2401.247,2415.437,"No, Your Honor I don’t and for this reason, Justice White, I think that it’s clear and it has been clear that Congress’ power with regard to Indians is almost plenary."
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2479.77,2492.195,"Anything wrong then, if there is a vacancy in the BIA then there are two applicants, one an Indian and one a non-Indian, to give the job to the Indian?"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2492.195,2495.037,Everything else being equal if he is qualified.
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.14,2500.804,"Well, I will just ask you again."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2505.391,2512.933,"Not so long as, Your Honor, the Indian is qualified and can pass the civil service examinations."
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2512.933,2513.304,"Well, no."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2514.79,2515.642,"Oh, yes I do."
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2518.206,2527.622,What rights has the non-employee got that’s being taken away from him by giving preference to the Indians?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2527.622,2535.811,The right that the non-Indian employee has in the BIA is his right to his job.
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.624,2539.678,"Well I know but we are talking about, we are talking about vacancies."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2549.172,2560.52,"If they are applying for the job and they are qualified for the job and there are no qualified Indians available for the job, they have a right to get the job."
1973.73-362,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.52,2562.247,Do you say they have the right under the Civil Service Law?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2562.247,2570.318,Certainly and they have a right to their promotions when those become available which have not been applied as far as the way this Act is presently being applied Your Honor.
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2570.318,2574.808,What do you do with veteran’s preference?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2574.808,2585.294,Your Honor I am not here to argue the matter of veteran’s preferences and I am really not as familiar with veteran’s preferences with regard to these kinds of Acts.
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2585.294,2588.105,Haven’t you heard that -- haven’t you heard that they exist?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2588.105,2590.394,"Oh, I realize that they exists your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2592.973,2600.989,[Voice Overlap] equally qualified people and the veteran automatically gets the preference.
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2600.989,2619.668,"The thing that makes this matter unconstitutional, Justice Marshall, is not so much giving a qualified Indian job over a qualified non-Indian, but when they are both already employees of a Federal agency --"
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.668,2624.149,I am talking about those that are applying for the job?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2624.149,2630.983,We are talking here in this case Your Honor not for people that are applying for the job but promotions within the agency itself.
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.873,2635.711,I know that.
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2645.537,2648.393,If the qualifications are equal Your Honor.
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2658.33,2666.472,You don’t believe that the BIA could say as a matter of policy there is no civil service required?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2666.472,2667.078,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2672.469,2690.565,"Well, we got -- in the BIA we got a $100,000.00 and these are small figures because I cannot understand big ones [Laughter] for water and health facilities and $100,000.00 dollars for employment."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2700.679,2701.159,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2706.851,2716.533,"But the BIA says we are going to put a $100,000.00 into a water purification plant on the Jacob's reservation."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2716.533,2717.51,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.51,2726.261,"And none of that water can anybody else than the Indian touch and that's solely for Indians, that’s okay?"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2726.261,2727.429,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2727.429,2737.162,"And if the BIA said we are pouring a hundred thousand dollars for employment of Indians only, that is wrong?"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2737.162,2738.308,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2738.308,2740.32,Why?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2741.381,2743.624,The appellees in this case are all [Voice Overlap].
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.624,2747.587,[Voice Overlap] about a hundred thousand dollars is all we are talking about the whole case is?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2747.587,2769.799,"What we are talking about here though, Your Honor, in deference to -- in deference to what your first problem was is that in this case all of the appellees in this case are non-Indian employees of the BIA right now and they have been denied promotions in their jobs."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2774.76,2776.872,And they knew it when they took the job?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2776.872,2777.798,No your Honor.
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.774,2792.688,When was this preference act passed?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2792.688,2795.031,1934 Your Honor.
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2795.031,2798.791,"Well, aren’t so many of these employees hired since 1934?"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2798.791,2799.864,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2799.864,2803.808,"This promotion is a new policy, isn’t it?"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2803.808,2804.405,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2805.394,2807.25,It was always thought applicable to --
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2807.25,2808.304,Just the initial hiring.
1973.73-362,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2808.304,2809.196,Initial hiring but the --
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2809.196,2810.888,Not as to promotion.
1973.73-362,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2814.652,2818.816,"And because the statute seems to be so confined, does it not?"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2818.816,2820.819,That’s true.
1973.73-362,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2820.819,2827.403,I take it we do not have here any question about present employees being displaced at all.
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2829.843,2833.422,I don’t know whether we have had any displaced employees.
1973.73-362,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.431,2856.458,"Mr. Franchini, did I understand you to say it would be unconstitutional for the Government not to apply the civil service rules to the Bureau of Indian Affairs?"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2856.458,2869.689,"We are saying that the entire Indian Preference Statute that was passed in 1934 is no longer necessary in 1974 and that it is in fact unconstitutional, Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-362,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2870.844,2880.995,"Well, but certainly one argument I assume you make is that it’s close enough to a distinction based on race or color, so as to come under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2897.638,2902.879,"No, but that is not the case that we have before the bar, Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-362,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2910.869,2911.632,Mr. Franchini.
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2911.632,2912.109,"Yes, Justice Blackmun?"
1973.73-362,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2912.109,2921.701,"What about the change and added to within the part of the Bureau in 1972 as to promotions and things, what was it that triggered that?"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,2921.701,2924.626,I do not know exactly what triggered it Your Honor.
1973.73-362,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3263.503,3268.273,How about the Indian Education Act that was passed in 1972?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3268.273,3293.103,"Again, Your Honor, this is an Act of Congress giving the opportunity to Indian young men and women to become educated so that they can go back to the Indian schools and teach the Indian-Americans what life is like outside of that reservation; that non-Indian world and that is perfectly alright."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3349.652,3354.931,"Mr. Franchini, you said there is a great difference between when the Preference Act was passed and the present time."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3357.602,3358.662,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3422.413,3426.249,And what was the percentage when it was passed?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3426.249,3446.281,The percentage was much lower as was counted by -- as was stipulated by a counsel in his opening remarks in 1930 and between 1930 and 1934 there were very few Indian employees in what was then called the Indian service.
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3452.498,3454.226,"You go ahead, but I am not interested in that."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3458.652,3459.78,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3462.363,3464.192,"Oh, sure!"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3465.875,3467.539,[Laughter] I think so.
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3467.539,3469.848,I hope.
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3469.848,3486.941,"Justice Marshall, recently in the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the United States, where in the 1940s, I think the average age of the Indian-American who died was 40."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3488.922,3494.566,Is any movement to repeal the Preference Act or you want us to repeal it?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3494.566,3495.164,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3500.192,3503.83,I thought you said you wanted us to rule it unconstitutional?
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3503.83,3511.317,"That is the second argument, Your Honor and I am going to get to that very shortly."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3520.196,3525.715,"You came by one word in that Act that suggests it,right?"
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3525.715,3526.196,Pardon Your Honor?
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3526.196,3532.017,There’s not one word in the Act that suggests the repealing.
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3532.017,3533.689,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3533.689,3546.472,"The only word you have is the word of Senator Bird where he said, “all others” and you say that includes Indians."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3546.472,3546.884,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3546.884,3549.903,You don’t repeal Acts that way.
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3558.412,3561.46,"Yes, Your Honor, I am really serious that I think that it repealed it."
1973.73-362,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3561.46,3565.776,I suppose the court below was very serious when they held it was repealed and now [Voice Overlap].
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3565.776,3566.728,"[Laughter] That’s true, Your Honor."
1973.73-362,2,25263,gene_e_franchini,,3578.358,3580.128,They were convinced that it was repealed.
1973.73-362,3,28145,harry_r_sachse,,4533.067,4537.116,I may have about 30 seconds.
