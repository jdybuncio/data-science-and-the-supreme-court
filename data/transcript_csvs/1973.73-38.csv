1973.73-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.195,"We will hear argument first this morning in 73-38, United States against Marine Bancorporation."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,18.772,22.645,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,250.777,252.308,It’s the acquiring bank?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,252.308,253.335,The acquiring bank.
1973.73-38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,253.335,253.841,Right.
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,253.841,265.229,That the acquiring bank is the substantial competitor and it eliminates potential competition which it would supply in the market into which it goes through the acquisition.
1973.73-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,647.763,648.506,Excuse me.
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,664.07,668.365,Let me deal with that right now Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.73-38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,765.152,768.942,Was there a legislative change after the Philadelphia Bank case?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,768.942,781.477,"There was a legislative change Mr. Justice to this extent that after the Philadelphia Bank case, Congress, in the 1966 Bank Merger Act, added the convenience and needs defunct."
1973.73-38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,826.518,827.301,By convenience and needs.
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,827.301,829.5,"By convenience and necessity, yes."
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,831.063,841.103,"Mr. Friedman, if you lose on the question, which you said that it was left open in the Falstaff, is that the end of the case, as far as you are concerned?"
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,843.502,844.035,Yes that --
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.035,847.456,"If you lose on the question, should the judgment be affirmed?"
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,847.456,848.395,No Mr. Justice --
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.395,849.669,"Alright, that’s all what I want to know."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,849.669,858.317,We’ve discussed this in our brief that we also claim that this was a perceived entry but the major thrust of this case in the District Court was on this theory.
1973.73-38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,868.117,876.733,"There are two aspects, there is the actual potential entry and then there is the perceived entry, is that right?"
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,876.733,877.888,That’s right.
1973.73-38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,877.888,878.137,And they are separate.
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,878.137,880.789,And the question which is left open in Falstaff was the former.
1973.73-38,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1112.112,1115.164,You have eliminated the competitor in the market?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1115.164,1117.388,"No, you’ve eliminated the potential of --"
1973.73-38,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1117.388,1121.619,"Well, you only done one thing, you have just eliminated the potential of a new entry."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1121.619,1124.334,Of a new entry.
1973.73-38,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1124.334,1126.066,You just have a different competitor in the market.
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1126.066,1129.868,You have a different competitor in the market but you have no new competitor.
1973.73-38,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1133.312,1140.008,"He may act differently but for your purposes, you’re assuming that he will be exactly the same?"
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1140.008,1144.043,We say basically there’s been no change in the obstructure of this market.
1973.73-38,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1144.043,1144.23,Yes.
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1144.23,1148.547,It’s the same as it was before with four or five or whatever number it is.
1973.73-38,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1157.924,1175.999,"Mr. Friedman, a new competitor would be a stronger bank, what is the Government’s position as to whether or not competition with the new bank in there would be more effective than it is at present?"
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1175.999,1195.857,"Well, Mr. Justice, we think that Congress in Section 7 has made the judgment that you cannot justify an acquisition coming into a market in the normal situation on the claim that you will be able to compete more effectively against the large bank."
1973.73-38,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1237.803,1255.625,"You lose me a little bit when you say that the -- and the action said the opposition is that the Government is interested in improving competitive conditions and yet if a stronger competitor enters the market, you don’t lose a competitor, you obtain a stronger one."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1258.359,1266.428,"I think Mr. Justice because the stress of Section 7 is on the long-term picture, on the long-term picture."
1973.73-38,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1392.988,1400.125,"Mr. Friedman, you commented earlier about the Government’s view of the desirability of de novo entry."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1407.967,1412.226,"Not in Spokane Mr. Justice, but let me explain --"
1973.73-38,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1412.226,1418.174,Does the record show anything about the history of de novo entry into the banking market in Spokane?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1418.174,1440.091,"No Mr. Justice for the reason that under state law, a bank that has its headquarters in one city is not permitted to branch outside of that city or the county where its headquarter is or into an incorporated village that does not have a bank."
1973.73-38,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.863,1470.852,Is that concededly legal under the laws of Washington?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1470.852,1472.972,There’s a dispute to that.
1973.73-38,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1650.489,1656.006,Did CNB acquire this bank that you say was sponsored by it?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1656.006,1658.292,That has not yet come to past?
1973.73-38,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1658.292,1661.11,What is it require in terms of waiting period?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1661.11,1678.71,"There is no waiting period with respect to federally chartered banks with respect to state chartered banks, there is a requirement that accept with the consent of the State Superintendent of Banking, “no bank can sell any of its shares that controlling it for ten years from the time of acquisition”."
1973.73-38,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1704.831,1706.847,Can I conceal your intentions?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1706.847,1711.714,"Well, I wouldn’t say conceal, I wouldn’t conceal Mr. Justice."
1973.73-38,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1722.78,1730.791,What’s the total number of banks in that are established as banks and later acquired by the other bank?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1730.791,1734.469,I could not tell you -- I couldn’t tell you exactly that.
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1759.752,1774.393,"Well, Mr. Friedman, Even if the acquisition doesn’t take place, the fact of organization of the new bank via the efforts of an established organization is undisputed."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1774.393,1775.564,I am sorry.
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1781.317,1785.041,And which is a substantial benefit in itself in term of --
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1785.041,1788.816,In the organization of bringing a new competitor in.
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.816,1792.76,In terms of correspondent advantages and things like that.
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1799.8,1801.499,"There is not question for that, yes."
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.499,1804.473,Which makes your point just as well doesn’t it?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1804.473,1805.884,I’m not certain Mr. Justice.
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.884,1810.273,"Well, if it’s a new bank, it’s gonna be a new entry?"
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1810.273,1811.704,It provides --
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.704,1820.337,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked you about de novo entry, which is much broader question an entry by an existing organization."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1825.137,1826.627,One new bank that I know.
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.627,1829.15,Has been organized as started from scratch?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1829.15,1830.983,Started from scratch.
1973.73-38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1833.696,1834.58,The 1950s?
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.58,1835.748,That was at 55 --
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1835.748,1844.27,1955 and this is one of the banks as I will come to -- that we think was available as a toehold entry by this bank.
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.27,1852.554,But there is no particular legal barriers to new entries in the Spokane area by this new banking organization?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1852.554,1866.858,"No, this new banking organization -- in fact, this banking organization now has four branches since it started with a single and it’s grown and now it has four branches which is only three fewer than the Washington Trust Bank."
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.858,1878.888,"Well, now why do you say Mr. Friedman that your point isn’t made as well whether or not the newly organized unit is later acquired?"
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1878.888,1895.691,"Well, I think if the newly organized unit is not later acquired, you don’t -- and it maybe more difficult to say that the putative acquiring bank is eliminated as a substantial competitor, that is -- what I am suggesting is if it’s --"
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.691,1908.685,"Well, this eliminated, certainly is eliminated as a possible source of the impetus and energy and perhaps support to organize a new bank."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1908.685,1917.209,"Well, if the new back is -- once the new bank has been organized and once the new bank is in the market, that --"
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.209,1918.812,That is a competitor?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1918.812,1919.993,That is a competitor.
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.155,1932.212,This would go back and organize another one to compete with its new bank --
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1932.212,1938.835,"Well, the basic problem there, I suppose, is whether the market would stand two additional banks."
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1966.977,1979.229,"I doubt if the bank here NBC acquires the bank in Spokane, which it has or wants to, is about to turnaround and organize another bank --"
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1979.229,1981.175,Surely not.
1973.73-38,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.175,1982.657,Whether it ever acquired it or not?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1982.657,1983.666,Surely not.
1973.73-38,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1983.666,2001.642,"Mr. Friedman, I had understood that the Government, in effect, conceded that it has no case under the theory of potential competition unless it is legally feasible and economically justifiable to enter the Spokane market."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2005.946,2009.021,I think that is correct Mr. Justice.
1973.73-38,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2015.425,2025.091,"Right, but you have suggested two methods of entry and you have been talking so for the sponsor method and your other suggested method is that you acquire some smaller bank."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2025.091,2031.662,"That’s right, and we think there are two banks in the market that it could have acquired."
1973.73-38,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2110.249,2126.154,"Mr. Friedman, supposing that the National Bank of Washington had decided to absorb the 65-form bank, the American Commerce Bank in Spokane, you say there is only three fewer branches in Washington trust."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2130.981,2133.066,"No Mr. Justice, no Mr. Justice."
1973.73-38,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2160.938,2167.702,"Well, then It just becomes a question of decree, doesn’t it, and the District Court has got to have some latitude in making a finding one way or the other."
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2167.702,2176.763,"Well, the District Court did not find Mr. Justice, the District Court did not find that this was no difference than a toehold acquisition."
1973.73-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2415.69,2425.79,"Well if they have been wanting this for 35 years Mr. Friedman, that means they have been keeping their eyes open for opportunities I assume, does it not?"
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2425.79,2440.5,"Yes, and one example I suppose Mr. Justice, one example, was their attempt shortly before this merger took place to purchase the stock of the American Commercial."
1973.73-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2440.5,2447.745,But you don’t suggest there is anything per se wrong or questionable of they’re wanting to get into that market?
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2447.745,2448.151,No.
1973.73-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2450.982,2451.775,Well --
1973.73-38,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2451.775,2453.953,We’re not suggesting there is anything wrong.
1973.73-38,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2485.109,2489.2,Very well Mr. Friedman.
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2490.992,2495.033,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2708.008,2709.148,"It’s required by law, as I understand it."
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2709.148,2711.359,That’s required by statute of the State of Washington.
1973.73-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2711.359,2712.254,Right.
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2712.254,2726.949,"And that period will expire in 1975, but of course, the National Bank of Commerce or no one else has any knowledge or information at this time that that bank will be for sale at the end of the ten year period."
1973.73-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2754.437,2755.892,Then there is the other but the other is small.
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2755.892,2757.301,Farmers & Merchants Bank.
1973.73-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2760.496,2761.237,In the suburbs?
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2761.237,2770.837,"The Farmers & Merchants Bank has a branch in the shopping center about five or six miles east of the Center of Downtown, Spokane."
1973.73-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2791.328,2795.523,"Once you were there, would the law forbid 20 year --"
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2795.523,2799.183,"Once you were there, you still can’t get into the City of Spokane."
1973.73-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2799.183,2800.545,Same county or --
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2800.545,2801.864,It’s in the same county.
1973.73-38,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2812.294,2822.642,If you acquire a bank by merger that becomes a branch of the acquiring bank from which no other branches can be put under Washington law.
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2822.642,2823.726,That is correct.
1973.73-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2852.553,2857.484,You made a pass at acquiring Farmers & Merchants?
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2857.484,2862.793,There are -- there were negotiations for the purchase of the Farmers & Merchants Bank that didn’t even get closer to the price.
1973.73-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2883.508,2888.917,"And how long before this present acquisition, those negotiations occur?"
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2888.917,2894.529,I would say maybe a year or two.
1973.73-38,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2904.933,2915.317,"So that the National Bank’s acquisition of Farmers & Merchants Bank, if it had come about, would not have been a realization of there desire to get into the City of Spokane?"
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,2915.317,2928.631,It would not if given the main consents of the City of Spokane.
1973.73-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3334.066,3343.267,"Mr. Moen I am having a little trouble with you say you can help the bank and assist the new bank, but you don’t sponsor it."
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,3346.948,3351.104,The word “sponsor” as we have used it means to aid or assist.
1973.73-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3357.087,3358.371,But which one are you talking about?
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,3367.84,3379.155,"Well the sponsored bank procedure, as referred to by the Justice Department, means to have control of it."
1973.73-38,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3404.314,3408.075,And just the interest of building that competition?
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,3408.075,3412.297,"No, that did it to satisfy a commercial customer."
1973.73-38,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3420.071,3424.188,Is this the suburb bank that was referred to?
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,3424.188,3427.714,"No, it’s just -- we referred to the suburb bank of Farmers & Merchants."
1973.73-38,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3427.714,3429.622,This is in the City of Spokane?
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,3429.622,3437.671,"No, I think what Mr. Justice Marshall is referring to is a bank in Central Washington."
1973.73-38,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3437.671,3438.625,Columbia.
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,3438.625,3440.945,"At Columbia Center, yes."
1973.73-38,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3608.276,3611.198,"Where is it, down on the Columbia River there?"
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,3611.198,3620.746,It’s down in Kennewick or in the Richmond area which is near the Columbia River area.
1973.73-38,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3872.606,3874.931,You’re now moving into Mr. Loevinger’s time Mr. Moen.
1973.73-38,1,40067,r_a_moen,,3874.931,3876.274,Yes I’m afraid I am.
1973.73-38,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3899.761,3901.421,Mr. Loevinger?
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,3901.421,3904.028,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-38,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3930.594,3932.638,"Well, let me ask what is the authority of the --"
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,3932.638,3933.163,Sir?
1973.73-38,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3933.163,3937.443,What is the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency to represent himself in this Court?
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,3937.443,3939.016,"Statutory, Your Honor."
1973.73-38,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3939.016,3940.33,What does it say?
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,3940.33,3967.031,"I don’t have the statute at hand Mr. Justice, but it is our statutory authority of the Comptroller to appear in these cases and as such he represents the interest of the Government embodied in both the banking and the antitrust laws as I shall hope to demonstrate the Comptroller is interested not simply in banking interest but also in competitive interest and therefore represents the entire public interest which I believe is the viewpoint of the Government and --"
1973.73-38,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3967.031,3971.107,"So I should ask the Department of Justice what there authority is, I suppose?"
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,3971.107,3972.194,Perhaps sir.
1973.73-38,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4131.951,4135.154,"Mr. Loevinger, you keep saying plaintiff, who is the plaintiff?"
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4135.154,4138.466,The plaintiff is the antitrust division under the Department of Justice represented by the solicitor general.
1973.73-38,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4138.466,4143.471,"Well, I know but your brief says the United States of America."
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4143.471,4149.752,"That is a formality Your Honor in a sense, the Court is the United States of America."
1973.73-38,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4154.529,4160.033,"And your brief said, your brief says your brief is to the Comptroller of the Currency?"
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4160.033,4162.863,"Yes sir, and the Comptroller of the Currency is an agency --"
1973.73-38,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4162.863,4167.171,United States of America is the appellant.
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4170.549,4174.2,I mean the interest represented by Mr. Friedman and the antitrust division sir.
1973.73-38,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4181.742,4193.497,I think it’s more than the formality because usually the question up most in my mind is who represents “the United States of America”?
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4193.497,4200.811,"Well sir the Comptroller has been representing the United States of America since about 1863, which is long before Sherman Act was passed."
1973.73-38,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4203.14,4208.041,How many times that the Comptroller of the Currency argued in this Court in all of those hundreds of millions and years?
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4208.041,4210.306,I don’t know.
1973.73-38,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4216.345,4222.902,I don’t know as of now what the position of the Government is.
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4222.902,4224.336,May I proceed with my argument Mr. Justice?
1973.73-38,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4224.336,4226.503,"Well, of course."
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4226.503,4235.467,"I would like to point out that the Department’s position is that Section 7, in effect, supersedes the Federal banking statutes."
1973.73-38,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4325.442,4332.373,"But that’s then was about the defensive part of the -- that was added in 1966, was it not the basic competitive analysis?"
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4332.373,4344.556,"If that the -- apparently the Court said that the basic competitive analysis was to be made first, then the public interest was to be determined on the basis of the competitive analysis as balanced against the other interest."
1973.73-38,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4406.37,4409.293,But there would be true just of a nationally chartered advantage?
1973.73-38,2,34774,lee_loevinger,,4409.293,4417.235,"No sir, that would be true of both national and state banks as was pointed out in the Philadelphia case because the standards are essentially similar."
1973.73-38,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5205.854,5207.052,Thank you.
1973.73-38,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5210.754,5214.295,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-38,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5474.484,5475.823,Thank you Mr. Friedman.
