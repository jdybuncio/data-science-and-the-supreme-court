1969.71,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.144,Gutknecht against the United States.
1969.71,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,9.288,11.814,Thank you.
1969.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,52.168,54.507,There almost 10% of all federal prosecutions?
1969.71,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,54.507,60.053,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, 9.7% I believe in the last report."
1969.71,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,100.575,103.597,What was the petitioner's classification at that time?
1969.71,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,103.597,112.922,"At that time Mr. Chief Justice he was classified 1-A, although he had an appeal pending, which meant that he could not be inducted."
1969.71,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,112.922,122.076,Does the record show anything about how long the time is involved in processing appeals in that particular board?
1969.71,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,122.076,124.076,"No, Mr. Chief Justice it does not."
1969.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,180.868,183.792,"Now, was his appeal still pending from his 1-A classification?"
1969.71,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,183.792,187.597,"No, if it had been pending Mr. Justice Stewart, it would have been illegal."
1969.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,187.597,187.749,Right.
1969.71,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,187.749,188.493,Under the regulations.
1969.71,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.493,189.235,But it was not?
1969.71,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,189.235,192.762,It was not pending.
1969.71,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,304.247,312.987,How much of your case depends upon whether he did or did not have a right to a hearing at that time?
1969.71,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,312.987,318.299,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would say our case depends not at all upon that point."
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1489.155,1493.981,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1605.023,1605.522,Where?
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1606.701,1611.809,"That's on page 41 of our brief, Mr. Justice Stewart not in this brief."
1969.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1611.809,1615.253,Thank you very much.
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1615.253,1632.825,"Now, this as the boards in the Selective Service System had this directive or had this joint memorandum of General Hershey and then Attorney General Clark before them after they had the Hershey directive before them."
1969.71,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1682.221,1685.685,I thought something different was involved?
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1716.956,1724.76,"Mr. Justice Douglas that is certainly part of this case, but what I am attempting to do at the outset is define narrowly just what it is involved here."
1969.71,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1724.76,1731.349,"It seems to be that would be the narrowest one, -- as a matter of statutory, not constitutional."
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1731.349,1747.653,"I think that's correct Mr. Justice Douglas, they have launched in their brief a rather massive attack on the delinquency regulations themselves saying that they were not authorized by statute that even if they were authorized, the statute is so vague, it's to be devoid of standards, then --"
1969.71,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1747.653,1765.905,"I don't know why, I spent a lot of time in the Oestereich case, reading the brief filed by the Solicitor General and it didn't seem to be that the attack made by this petitioner was more massive and the one made by the Solicitor General who I see is absent from this particular brief."
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1765.905,1778.496,"Mr. Justice Douglas, the Solicitor General in his brief, in Oestereich suggested that sound arguments could be made along the lines that petitioner here makes them."
1969.71,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1795.244,1802.16,I think you're protected by the First Amendment.
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1802.16,1806.755,"Now, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1851.344,1860.69,"In this case, the man had actually has his draft card stolen from him, or burned, or lost?"
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1860.69,1866.364,If it were burned without his consent or without his knowledge.
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1872.926,1878.609,"The notice says this didn't come to him, the only thing came to the board's attention was he didn't have his card."
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1887.557,1895.006,"I think it is possible that a board could do so, but I think if they did Mr. Justice Marshall, it would be a clear abuse of their discretion."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1900.201,1901.162,Why not?
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1901.162,1906.29,Because we would have confessed there prior to coming here.
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1939.809,1942.333,Was he have offered a new draft card?
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1942.333,1945.12,"He was not offered a new draft card, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1945.12,1947.341,Have you ever suggested that he apply for one?
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,1947.341,1955.188,But on page 44 of the appendix is a copy of the delinquency notice that was sent to Mr. Gutknecht in this case.
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2009.335,2014.386,"The regulation don't get any of that protection, none."
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2014.386,2014.945,I --
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2014.945,2017.029,It leaves it up to the board.
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2017.029,2020.378,"Well, I respectfully would state Mr. Justice --"
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2020.378,2030.443,"Just in point at words, may as if the authority that the board has, uncontrolled authority."
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2030.443,2041.702,"Well, the board has given discretion without question under the regulation, but I think like any discretionary grant, there is -- there are times when that can be abused."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2054.841,2061.889,"I wonder if the Breen case, I would assume that he couldn't get into Court before that, could he?"
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2065.632,2070.608,"In Breen he could bring himself back into compliance, by simply agreeing to --"
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2070.608,2077.079,But I mean when he was classified and gotten -- that notice in five days to report.
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2078.772,2081.896,"No, he was not -- in Breen, he has never been given an induction."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2081.896,2082.913,"No, I mean in this case."
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2085.241,2089.167,"He has never been given -- Yes, he has never been given a notice of induction."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2089.167,2096.931,"Well, how can this man in this case test out the discretion of the draft board, legally and of course --"
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2096.931,2101.203,"He's doing it in a criminal action, which were here before this court, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2101.203,2102.701,It's the only way he could.
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2102.701,2112.638,"That's right, under the regulation, under the law, under Section 10 (b) 3 this is the vehicle which he can use to test his rights."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2137.842,2141.917,But that won't help this man's four years.
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2141.917,2164.731,"Mr. Justice Marshall, what I'm saying is that attempting to focus what Mr. Gutknecht could have done in order to bring himself back into compliance and to focus on the fact that if the draft boards, if the boards themselves do not permit him to come back into compliance, we're prepared to confess error, we're prepared to admit that they have abused their discretion."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.555,2194.047,"My real difficulty is that as to whether or not the Government confesses error is up to one person, the Attorney General of the United States, his uncontrolled discretion."
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2207.979,2216.476,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I don't think that we can look at a discretionary grant assuming that is going to be abused."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2270.932,2276.789,I only raised it because you said that's what cured the discretion of the draft board.
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2279.569,2282.463,"I don't think that's only thing that cures it, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2283.518,2287.114,You think case like this could cure?
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2287.114,2287.765,Could cure?
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.765,2289.376,Sure.
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2289.376,2291.073,"Well, he has the right --"
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2291.073,2291.395,To raise --
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2291.395,2292.555,That's it.
1969.71,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.555,2293.853,Nobody blocks it?
1969.71,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.802,2324.52,"Mr. Ruckleshaus, are you saying to us that any registrant, any draft registrant who loses his card or is otherwise dispossessed of it through inadvertence and not intent has the key to the solution of his problem by simply getting another card and putting himself back in compliance at any stage."
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2324.52,2327.215,"Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, this is our position."
1969.71,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2833.32,2835.351,"That is in this criminal trial, you mean?"
1969.71,1,45944,william_d_ruckelshaus,,2835.351,2836.995,"Yes, that's right, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1969.71,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2971.332,2972.527,"Thank you, Mr. Ruckelshaus."
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2979.144,2982.5,"Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.71,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3026.591,3057.172,"What he had this -- I'm looking at page 30 of the appendix, which is an opinion of the Court of Appeals, which indicates that there was contained in the Selective Service board file in this case, the information as to the circumstances under which the petitioner separated himself from his draft card."
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3057.172,3063.774,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, there is on page 42 and 43 that information, it consists of the appendix."
1969.71,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3078.898,3092.834,"There was information in the record, if this is accurately reproduced here in the appendix as to the circumstances under which this man and his draft card became separated, is that correct?"
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3092.834,3093.528,It is correct.
1969.71,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3093.528,3100.063,"Indicating a willful separation on his part, is contrasted to a careless or negligent or accidental one."
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3100.063,3103.371,It is true Mr. Justice Stewart that there is evidence in the record.
1969.71,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3105.265,3107.925,"I understood you say that there was none, I just wanted to be sure."
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3107.925,3116.205,"Yes, I misspoke myself, our position would be and it is there is not sufficient evidence to warrant a finding by the board of willfulness."
1969.71,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3121.724,3129.989,"Do you think that in the trial, in the District Court there is a factual basis for finding of willfulness?"
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3129.989,3139.766,"There is Mr. Chief Justice, a factual basis there, but the review of Selective Service decisions is on the file made by the Selective Service System and the registrant."
1969.71,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3167.79,3173.851,"And by the same token the standard of proof on the Government is infinitely higher, is it not?"
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3173.851,3178.387,"But only as to factual issues, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.71,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3200.592,3212.898,Was Mr. Gutknecht alluded in the defense that he was allowed to tender during the trial of this case?
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3221.111,3222.386,"Yes, the First Amendment claims were raised --"
1969.71,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3222.386,3224.328,The Court of Appeals had written that he was permitted to do so?
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3224.328,3226.791,Yes.
1969.71,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3229.789,3231.714,And was in time to present.
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3232.801,3233.336,"Yes, he was."
1969.71,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3235.894,3237.699,What is your position?
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3247.632,3253.986,Our position then Mr. Justice Black is that the regulations are invalid as not having been authorized by Congress.
1969.71,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3269.25,3271.804,"Are you saying, valid because of what?"
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3271.804,3285.062,"That the regulations here, the delinquency regulations, the Hershey Memorandum and the local board memorandum taken together, are a scheme for regulating dissent, which is unconstitutional on it's face."
1969.71,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3292.947,3308.528,"I would understand that argument a great deal better if you were arguing to us that when he received his delinquency notice, he had asked for a hearing and had been refused a hearing but he did not ask, did he?"
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3308.528,3328.721,"Mr. Chief Justice, the regulations do not provide for a hearing, a fair reading of Regulation 1642.14B establishes that in a case such as this, where the registrant is already 1-A, that the only hearing, that can be granted repossess in the absolute unfettered discussion of the local board."
1969.71,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3329.839,3334.92,"But that is not tested out by asking for it, was it?"
1969.71,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3334.92,3338.072,"My response to that would be twofold, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.71,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3362.616,3364.138,"Thank you, Mr. Tigar."
