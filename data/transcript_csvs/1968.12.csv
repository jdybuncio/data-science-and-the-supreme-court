1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,20.195,"Number 12, Samuel Desist et al., petitioners, versus United States."
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,21.641,26.052,"Your Honor, this is my colleague, Mr. Markowitz."
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,26.052,26.661,Yes.
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,26.661,27.231,It's strong.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,27.231,36.679,It's strong.
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,36.679,45.429,Mr. Chief Justice and associate justices and my -- Mr. Beytagh.
1968.12,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,201.132,203.014,"Well, is none of this stuff marketed?"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,203.014,203.685,I beg your pardon?
1968.12,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,203.685,206.122,Was none of this heroin marketed at all?
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,206.122,207.403,No.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,281.285,289.898,"But when you say the-- that none of these petitioners had any contact with this heroin, I suppose you mean physical contact."
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,289.898,291.327,Physical contact with it.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,291.327,295.378,Not their contact in the arranging for it or any-- to come over anything at that time--
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,295.378,296.718,"I'd go further, Your Honor."
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,296.718,297.458,I beg your pardon?
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,297.458,301.584,"I'd go further, although I didn't wish to interrupt Your Honor, I would go further."
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,328.139,331.458,"Well, now, you're arguing to us the sufficiency of the evidence, are you?"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,331.458,332.264,Not really.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,336.618,337.011,"Well, I'm not --"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,337.011,341.27,That you shouldn't feel too badly about letting them go if you apply Katz.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,342.721,349.332,"Well, $9 million worth of -- $9 million for the heroin is quite a sizeful project, as you might --"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,349.332,350.127,Of course.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,350.127,371.794,"Realize, but what I was asking you was this, when you said that these defendants had no contact with the heroin, you meant by that I assume the physical contact and you didn't mean -- not mean that this was a Louisville versus Kentucky case that there was no evidence in the case --"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,371.794,374.359,"No, this is not a Louisville versus Kentucky case, no."
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,374.359,374.819,Yes.
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,374.819,378.604,"I think if it had been that, you'd have a brief from me on it."
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,385.753,386.427,Yes.
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,386.427,387.192,Shall I continue?
1968.12,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.192,389.247,About this matter of interest--
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,389.247,389.982,I beg your pardon?
1968.12,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.982,393.419,"The Chief-- as a matter of interest, the Chief Justice said $9 million."
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,397.351,402.298,"$100 million is -- yes, that figure, I've read also."
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,408.041,409.951,I just thought mixed up on my ciphers.
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,415.602,418.946,"Shall I continue now, Your Honor?"
1968.12,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,587.102,589.317,I guess the position would be that --
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,589.317,590.17,I beg your pardon?
1968.12,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,590.17,597.976,I suppose the position would be -- that you're arguing would be that Katz was always the law.
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,601.786,609.623,"I -- I see Your Honor smiling, and I'm smiling not only in neutrality, but because I have a very pleasant things to say."
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,785.508,788.918,You may hand it to the clerk if you have something solid.
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,788.918,794.504,"There are some photos here, which are government exhibit, showing illici -- showing the way this was done."
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,794.504,796.67,"Yes, the marshal --"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,796.67,806.907,One of those photos shows a towel draped over the -- over something.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,811.322,813.066,Were these exhibits in Court?
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,813.066,816.351,Yes.
1968.12,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,881.566,890.585,"Well, except, Mr. Glasser, haven't you left out the fact that, on the motion to suppress before Judge Palmieri, the judge himself went up to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel --"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,890.585,891.265,I have left that out but --
1968.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.265,891.981,And you reconstructed the --
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,891.981,893.31,Yes.
1968.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.31,901.69,"They reinstalled the listening device and reconstructed the whole thing, and he saw it with his own eyes and he spent two or three days canvassing all of this on motion to suppress?"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,901.69,903.114,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1968.12,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,921.18,925.329,"Well, we're hardly in the position to decide whether or not you're right or wrong about that."
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,926.761,939.564,"Yes, it has, but we have briefed it here in a way that we think entitles us to have this Court consider it on review."
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,990.439,992.009,Is that in the record?
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,992.009,993.176,This is not in the record.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,993.176,995.63,"Well, then we will hear from the Government on that before you pass it around."
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,995.63,996.805,All right.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1056.923,1067.82,"Mr. Glasser, may I again ask you, are you arguing to us the credibility of those witnesses as against the finding of the courts below?"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,1067.82,1075.402,I am arguing the credibility of the narcotic agent witnesses in the motion to suppress hearing.
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1146.423,1148.595,"On evidence, that is not in the record?"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,1148.595,1149.282,I beg your pardon?
1968.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1149.282,1151.969,"On evidence, he wants to decide on evidence that is not in the record?"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,1151.969,1169.07,"We would contend -- we would be content to -- well, here, we made motions and filed affidavits in the Circuit Court of Appeal -- in the Court of Appeals during dependency of the appeal asking them to pick up the Schipani task."
1968.12,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1186.487,1187.601,So it wasn't Schipani --
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,1187.601,1188.743,Asking -- I beg your pardon?
1968.12,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1188.743,1194.865,"Wasn't Schipani a case where the government came forward and said, yes, we were frankly --"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,1194.865,1195.949,"I'm sorry, did the government --"
1968.12,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1195.949,1197.68,Illegal bugging.
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,1197.68,1199.494,Did the government acknowledge illegal bugging?
1968.12,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1199.811,1205.775,"And here, the finding of illegal bugging is against you, and that's where it went down to --"
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,1205.775,1206.237,No.
1968.12,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1206.237,1207.127,Try the case?
1968.12,0,16105,abraham_glasser,,1207.127,1212.386,"No, but I guess I have to really call a space -- spade then."
1968.12,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1599.695,1605.737,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1968.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1694.605,1715.968,"There's another way of looking at this case, isn't there, Mr. -- is there or am I mistaken, in the cases like Linkletter, Mapp, that whole area, the police knew what they were doing was a constitutional violation whether under Wolf against Colorado --"
1968.12,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1715.968,1716.115,"Yes, sir."
1968.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1716.115,1716.855,They knew it was wrong.
1968.12,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1774.762,1774.985,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1774.985,1775.582,"So, that --"
1968.12,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1775.582,1776.168,"And, I think --"
1968.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.168,1779.403,"And, that's an argument available to you in this case."
1968.12,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1790.2,1790.716,The Court has made --
1968.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1790.716,1793.684,"It certainly was not available in Linkletter, isn't that correct?"
1968.12,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1793.684,1812.917,"Yes, Your Honors, as I'm sure you're aware and this is what you really refer to, the Court has noted this fact in subsequent cases holding decisions not to be retroactive that, in the Linkletter situation, that the law enforcement officials, in light of Wolf, knew what they were doing."
1968.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1818.807,1825.168,"I suggest it really analyzed, as I've tried to suggest in my question, it isn't a matter of retroactivity."
1968.12,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1829.77,1830.564,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1830.564,1848.273,"Now, if the policemen did it now, tomorrow they would do what they did in the light of a Katz decision and their conduct -- the reasonableness of their conduct would have to constitutionally be measured against the standard of the Katz decision."
1968.12,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1865.195,1882.588,"Yes, Your Honor, but the reason we haven't pressed that argument at length is that, it seemed to us, the Katz opinion itself suggested that it was not sufficient that the agent's conduct there was reasonable and, therefore, we have not felt that we could press that argument here."
1968.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1882.588,1896.224,"Well, as Stovall suggested, this Court is constitutionally charged with the duty of deciding cases, but the policemen act in light of the state of the law."
1968.12,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1896.224,1896.762,I understand.
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3575.916,3577.677,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1968.12,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3619.365,3627.814,"Well, they didn't get -- they didn't make any tapes at all or get any recordings, did they, in that second incident to which you refer?"
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3627.814,3641.293,"They -- the agent who ran it said he didn't get the tape, and I think one other agent who was in the car with him said they didn't get any effective audible results."
1968.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3807.271,3809.381,What did the Alaska Court held in Fuller --
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3809.381,3809.626,The Alaska Court never --
1968.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3809.626,3811.358,With respect to the 605 violation?
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3811.358,3814.582,Never touch this problem that I'm talking about now.
1968.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3815.264,3816.672,What did it involve with respect to the 605 violation?
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3816.672,3823.286,"Yes, they touched the 605, but they didn't touch the problem of subpoena pursuant to 605."
1968.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3823.286,3827.318,What did the Alaska Court hold with respect to the 605 violation of Fuller?
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3827.318,3830.974,They held that -- let me think.
1968.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3832.332,3833.97,"There's a dissent, but the Court held that --"
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3833.97,3844.084,"They -- oh, they held that 605 does not apply to states that they adopted the basic Schwartz line."
1968.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3844.084,3844.358,Yes.
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3844.358,3849.007,"Now, I have here a copy of the Alaska opinion."
1968.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3851.659,3852.367,I can find it.
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3852.367,3852.663,Alright.
1968.12,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3852.663,3853.406,Thank you.
1968.12,2,16105,abraham_glasser,,3853.406,3857.149,I'm sorry that my recollection is fuzzy on that.
1968.12,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3879.951,3881.963,"No, your time is up."
