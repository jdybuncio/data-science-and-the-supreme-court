1986.85-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Number 85-637, Donald P. Hodel versus Mary Irving."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,11.372,22.996,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on direct appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit."
1986.85-637,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,52.449,56.337,"Is that a very accurate term, ""escheat"" to the tribe?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,56.337,60.955,"--Yes, I think escheat is an accurate term."
1986.85-637,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,82.385,85.32,"Well, is the tribe regarded as the state?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,85.32,90.188,--The tribe is not guardian of the individual Indians' estate.
1986.85-637,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,92.724,97.294,"No, is the tribe for purposes of escheat regarded as the state?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,97.294,98.161,"Oh, I am sorry."
1986.85-637,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,131.515,134.467,You wouldn't care if we just called it a reversion?
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,134.467,137.086,I don't think the label is important.
1986.85-637,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,137.086,138.788,But the statute calls it escheat?
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,138.788,139.955,The statute does call it escheat.
1986.85-637,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,163.42,166.122,"Incidentally, how big are the portions generally?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,166.122,183.317,"--Under the Act the only thing that escheats is an interest that represents 2 percent or less of the overall allotment and has earned less than $100, or in fact under the amended Act is incapable of earning in the next five years more than $100."
1986.85-637,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,183.317,186.519,Does that suggest that the acreage in each instance is very small?
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,186.519,189.22,"Well, the allotments, yes."
1986.85-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.032,210.448,Are these undivided interests?
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,210.448,211.364,These are undivided interests.
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,422.617,427.937,"Mr. Kneedler, can I just ask one question about the authority to dispose of property by will?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,437.091,439.876,There are several restrictions.
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,454.303,456.588,"--Before the Act was passed, what was the restriction, if any?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,456.588,467.11,"--The principal restriction derived from Section 4 of the Indian Reorganization Act, which has recently been amended, but in general provided for the property to remain in Indian hands."
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.168,485.69,"But could an owner, for example, give all of his interest to his oldest child, or something like that, in order to try and prevent the division into very small interests?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,485.69,487.424,"Yes, he could do that."
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,544.145,546.895,"May I ask about that statute, because there is one thing that puzzles me on it."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,553.518,554.334,--In this case?
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,554.334,557.286,"--Well, both in this one and the earlier statutes you just referred to."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,557.286,558.119,The 1942 one?
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.119,558.536,Yes.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,558.536,560.654,The 1942 one I don't know.
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,569.26,569.843,Then what about this one?
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,569.993,604.064,"In this one soon after the Act was passed the Bureau of Indian Affairs sent out to all area supervisors and to all superintendents, there are, I don't know, 12 or 13 BIA areas, and then superintendents are responsible for particular reservations, instructions explaining the way this would work and some of the alternatives that could be pursued by individuals to avoid escheat, and then the instructions encouraged the area superintendents... or the superintendents and the area directors to notify people on the reservations of the consequences of the Act."
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.064,608.718,"--If someone died in the interval between the instructions were out, the Act would have become effective immediately?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,608.718,616.372,"Yes, the Act was effective on its effective date, but that is not unusual with respect to laws governing the distribution of property at death."
1986.85-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,652.811,668.673,"Mr. Kneedler, are there any limits in your view as to what the government can do or change concerning the descent of property belonging to Indians?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,675.41,679.028,"No, our submission does not go nearly that far."
1986.85-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,701.894,705.763,"Well, do you take the position that it can be abolished?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,705.763,710.084,"That is not part of our submission here, no."
1986.85-637,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,734.865,737.567,May I follow up on the question asked by Justice O'Connor?
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,781.013,788.417,--I don't... we did not intend for that language to be taken to its full implications.
1986.85-637,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,788.417,790.469,--You didn't intend for it to be taken the way it reads?
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,792.152,810.616,"Well, this is... Congress obviously can... I think there is an element of reasonableness in anything Congress does in a situation such as this in terms of defining who may be qualified to take property, what sort of property can pass, and within reasonable limitations."
1986.85-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.863,843.719,"Mr. Kneedler, does it make some difference in your submission that the statute here did not provide for it to escheat or whatever you want to call it to the United States but to the tribe?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,843.719,845.837,"Yes, we think that is an important element of it."
1986.85-637,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,877.106,879.641,"Mr. Kneedler, the property goes to the tribe."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,887.378,899.436,"The tribe, just as the individual who owned it, would need the consent of the United States to either sell it or to lease it, so that the property remains restricted whether it is in individual hands or tribal hands."
1986.85-637,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,899.436,904.09,"Well, it wasn't given to the tribe outright."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,904.09,904.673,"Not outright, no."
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.292,920.634,"You said a little bit earlier that, and your briefs maintain this position, that the prospective heir has no property right--"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,920.634,921.284,Yes.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.284,925.753,--which could form the basis of an action for taking by the United States.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,953.106,958.408,"Well, this... there is some question about that."
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.439,991.645,But they are contending that the unconstitutional taking occurred when the statute was passed.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,998.366,1015.41,"Well, the taking-I think they would say occurred when the property escheated, not because the land might have... the decedent might have done something between the time of the passage of the Act and the time of death to provide for an alternative disposition of the property."
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.41,1017.946,The taking occurred at the time of the escheat?
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1017.946,1021.898,Because it could be avoided between the time of the passage of the Act.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.991,1042.061,"Well, you are saying then they do have standing in their own capacity."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1042.061,1057.737,"--No, they are still asserting the rights of the decedent to dispose of the property in the way that he chooses, but their claim is, because the decedent is not alive any longer to assert his interest in doing that that they should be permitted to assert that right on his behalf."
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.737,1059.439,And the government accepts that.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1066.009,1071.247,"Well, I am not sure that I would... I am not sure what the full ramifications of that--"
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1071.247,1071.797,I'm not either.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1071.797,1083.637,"--but in this case where the property would... where the person asserting the right would receive the property but for the operation of the statute, it was our view that at least--"
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.637,1086.589,"Why, because that party should have standing?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1092.326,1096.128,--He didn't have a property right but he had an interest.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.262,1129.433,"I am still trying to find out what it is that distinguishes this case from other third party standing cases which, you know, pose a real problem."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1139.122,1145.859,But beyond injury in fact there is a nexus between the decedent and the plaintiffs in this case.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.751,1163.571,That relationship being that some of them would have been the intestate heirs but for the statute.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1163.571,1165.456,--Or devisees but for the statute.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.456,1167.756,And some of them would have been devisees but for the statute.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1167.756,1170.408,"That's right, but it does--"
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.408,1193.674,"Mr. Kneedler, isn't there some tension between your suggestion that presumably the decedents would have wanted to do something different and your suggestion that the decedents presumably understood the statute, because part of your argument was that if they wanted to do something different they have got every right to do so, but you must be assuming there were a lot of decedents who didn't really have notice of what the statute was going to do to their interests."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1193.674,1195.626,"--No, I didn't mean to suggest that."
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.385,1214.92,"If you presume they knew, and say we are talking about people who wanted to do something six months later, what is the injury then?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1222.609,1229.18,"--Well, if not happy, at least not concerned enough to do something about it, yes."
1986.85-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.545,1262.853,But your willingness to recognize standing would treat the strongest case as the Indian who did not realize that such a statute had perhaps affected his property rights.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1275.994,1282.148,"--As we have submitted, we don't believe that notice is an element with respect to a statute of this sort."
1986.85-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1294.205,1306.18,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you think that the lack of notice problem might somehow enter into the balance that the Court has to employ in determining the validity of this provision?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1306.18,1333.949,"It might be an element, yes, and certainly in a case like Lock and Texaco versus Short it was an element, but again, in a situation where you have property passing at death, the ownership of the property passes anyway, and it is a particular transaction that is traditionally the subject of the sovereign's power, and the idea of notice, I think, is a less important element in that setting."
1986.85-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1333.949,1346.774,Has this Court ever held that lack of notice was a defense on the part of someone challenging the constitutionality of a statute governing the descent of property upon death?
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1346.774,1348.459,Not to my... not to my knowledge.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.459,1356.113,"Mr. Kneedler, I hate to come back to the same thing, but I am still hung up on the standing point."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1377.728,1378.178,Right.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.178,1388.501,"Now, there are some particular problems in this case as to whether Congress has prescribed compensation, but let's assume that it hasn't."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1399.059,1401.261,But then that compensation--
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1401.261,1403.777,"To their estate, and not to these plaintiffs."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1403.777,1405.463,--But it would pass through the estate.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.463,1414.734,"No, it wouldn't, because you validate the statute by awarding compensation for the statute, right?"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1414.734,1415.334,Yes.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.334,1419.472,So the compensation would go to the decedent's estate.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1419.472,1420.322,Yes.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1420.322,1423.84,Whereupon it would pass pursuant to the statute.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1423.84,1430.428,The compensation would pass pursuant to the heirship statutes or pursuant to the will.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.428,1441.302,"My point is, the compensation would go to the decedent and would not necessarily reach these plaintiffs, which makes it very--"
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1441.302,1453.026,"It may not necessarily, but the premise of the argument as I understand it is that heirs and devisees they would receive the real property, so I believe it would be part of their claim that they would receive the substitute for the real property in the form of compensation."
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1453.026,1455.478,"--Yes, if they were asserting their rights, but they are not asserting their rights."
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1460.899,1461.299,Yes.
1986.85-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.299,1461.899,Not these plaintiffs.
1986.85-637,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1469.155,1491.818,"It is unusual, but then the operation of the statute is unusual, and we are not urging a broad theory of third party standing here, and we have... Congress enacted a statute whose constitutionality we believe should be sustained by the Court, and it has been our... the Court of Appeals reached the merits."
1986.85-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1501.959,1504.442,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1506.861,1530.86,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, what I first want to place before the Court today is the significance of these property interests in terms of the decedents, Charles Pumpkin Seed, Chester Irving, Edgard Pumpkin Seed, and Geraldine Cross, and then also in terms of the appellees who, but for Section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act, would have inherited these interests."
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1567.069,1572.888,"Are you saying, then, Ms. War Bonnett, that these were not undivided interests, that they had been partitioned?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1572.888,1575.072,"No, I am suggesting that."
1986.85-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1687.479,1692.482,Is there anything in the record that shows the dollar value of this land?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1692.482,1694.334,There is.
1986.85-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1724.104,1727.389,"The four and a half acres you were talking about, what is the value of that?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1727.389,1734.911,"--Okay, that would have been Charles Pumpkin Seed on Page 34, it is the John Shot allotment."
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.911,1740.732,Why don't you come back to the microphone when you reply?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1740.732,1741.965,"Oh, I am sorry, Your Honor."
1986.85-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1741.965,1752.271,Taxable value was 432 million.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1759.36,1760.41,Okay.
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.962,1870.331,That right didn't arise in 1889.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1871.533,1891.078,"I think looking at the historical record the decedents... I mean the allottees were in the process of gaining their approval because this statute, the Sioux Allotment Act of March 2nd, 1889, only went into effect if the Sioux agreed to allotment."
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1892.713,1895.315,"It went into effect long before 1910, didn't it?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1899.183,1914.609,"--Right, though talking in terms of the Sioux people and what they understood and what benefit or what the terms of the bargain should be with the Federal Government now, it is clear that the Indian people understood that what they were doing was protecting a land base."
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1944.128,1946.145,Are you in effect claiming a breach of contract?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1946.145,1947.83,--What I am saying--
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.83,1949.949,"A breach of the 1889 treaty, in effect?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1949.949,1954.401,"--is basically not the 1889 treaty, but the 1889 statute--"
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1954.401,1954.834,Yes.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,1954.834,1984.27,"--in terms of relying on the holding of Choate v. Trapp, which was a similar situation in which the Indians were allotted, and it is true that in the case of Choate v. Wright what was before the Court was a tax exemption for a period of 25 years which was only to the allottee, but it is our submission that the same principles apply here where you have individual Indians who, to acquire this allotment, gave consideration."
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.859,2000.549,"But, Ms. War Bonnett, there is no question here, is there, that Congress intended the result which it produced in this most recent statute?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2000.549,2002.299,No.
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2005.101,2005.334,Yes.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2005.334,2008.821,--to escheat and not to go to either the heirs or devisees of--
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.821,2020.795,"Yes, so there is no way by interpretation that we can say that whatever inconsistency there was between this statute and the 1889 statute and 1910 statute can be somehow read favorably to the Indians."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2022.595,2024.58,--My claim is a constitutional one.
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2050.562,2059.252,"But I was interested in getting your answer to one of Justice Stevens' questions where he asked you, do you claim a breach of the 1889 statute or treaty, and you said yes."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2065.554,2065.84,Right.
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2071.744,2071.909,Right.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2071.909,2075.779,--and it is our position here today that the interests here taken should be compensated.
1986.85-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.138,2096.172,"Ms. War Bonnett, do you ask for compensation as opposed to striking down the statute?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2096.172,2109.183,"We are asking that this be recognized as a Fifth Amendment taking which would hold this provision unconstitutional and that if Congress attempted this type of legislation again, that it would take from--"
1986.85-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.183,2113.135,"No, but in this case do you want compensation or do you want the statute struck down?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2113.135,2115.42,--We--
1986.85-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.42,2122.174,"And my next question is going to be, if you want compensation, who ought to be compensated, because you are asserting before us the rights of the decedents--"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2122.174,2123.541,--That's correct.
1986.85-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2123.541,2125.543,--not the rights of your clients.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2125.543,2134.715,"But we feel that in terms of the standing analysis, that in looking at the decisions of this Court there is a two-pronged test."
1986.85-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.571,2142.904,"Well, never mind the standing analysis for the moment."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2148.558,2161.199,"--To the decedents' estates, and then based upon the procedure that is in place through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the estate, that will be another element of the estate, just as these particular--"
1986.85-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.199,2162.482,To be distributed under the valid statute.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2162.482,2176.291,"--No, to be distributed under the terms of either the will, as Geraldine Cross had, or under the intestate succession scheme which is the laws of the State of South Dakota for Sioux Indians."
1986.85-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.291,2176.374,"Well, you can't have both."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2186.663,2199.537,"That's correct, but if you get compensation then the Court is recognizing that the statute as it was originally enacted was unconstitutional because it took an interest without paying compensation."
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.537,2202.072,But the tribe would get the property.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2202.072,2204.024,"Right, but the tribe--"
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2204.024,2206.31,And the heirs would get the money.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2206.31,2207.543,--Right.
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.095,2211.145,But the property would--
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2211.145,2213.98,--Would escheat--
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.98,2214.916,--escheat to the tribe.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2214.916,2216.916,--Right.
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.566,2219.284,Like the statute says.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2219.284,2220.986,And that is one of--
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.986,2222.02,Like the statute says.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2222.02,2228.307,"--Right, and that is one of the... I mean, obviously one of the goals of this legislation was to reduce a fractionated heirship problem which does exist on Indian lands today."
1986.85-637,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2250.522,2263.147,"Ms. War Bonnett, may I ask, prior to this Act, I think it's agreed that the heirs had the right to sell these fractional interest."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2269.651,2276.221,"One of the problems of selling interests is, as we have discussed, is that these are undivided interests."
1986.85-637,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2276.221,2276.721,Yes.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2276.721,2283.457,And it is difficult to interest probably anyone but other people holding interests in the allotment or the tribe.
1986.85-637,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2322.582,2328.903,So there is nothing in the record that tells us whether in fact these interests could be sold?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2328.903,2333.271,"Certainly they could be sold, but the question would be where the buyer would come from."
1986.85-637,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2333.271,2345.179,"Yes, in theory, but economically I suppose the record is simply silent with respect to whether or not they could in fact be sold as you find buyers who were willing to buy fractional interests."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2345.179,2345.429,Right.
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.233,2357.721,May I ask if the tribe has ever participated in this litigation and taken a position on this issue?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2357.721,2364.742,"The Oglala Sioux Tribe filed an amicus brief in the Eighth Circuit, and they did not participate at this level."
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.659,2367.361,What position did they take in the Eighth Circuit?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2369.794,2385.24,"--They were... I don't think that they are against getting the property, but they are against this matter, the way that this statute does it because they view it as inherently unfair in terms of taking property from individual Indians without any compensation."
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.06,2396.881,"Well, if they don't want the property why couldn't they just reallocate it in accordance with the desires of the former owners then?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2396.881,2408.069,"There is a statute which requires the Secretary of Interior and regulations which require the Secretary of Interior to approve transfers of the tribe... of tribal property, so you would get back to the--"
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.069,2413.521,"I know, but if there are transfers that would produce property interests of more than 2 percent the Secretary presumably would approve--"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2413.521,2427.964,"--But the tribe and what they would propose to do and indicated at the Eight Circuit was to basically give these people their property back so that they would not be consolidating, and I doubt seriously that they would have gotten the approval of the Secretary of Interior to transfer back to exactly where they were--"
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2427.964,2428.564,--I see.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2428.564,2429.565,--ahead of time.
1986.85-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2429.565,2436.386,Of disposing of this undivided property before death?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2436.386,2437.588,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1986.85-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2437.588,2439.071,Before death.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2439.071,2439.688,Uh-huh.
1986.85-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2439.688,2442.79,What did you do with the undivided interests?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2442.79,2444.908,Before death what did these individuals do?
1986.85-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.908,2445.125,Yes.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2445.125,2450.246,They basically held them as undivided interests and got lease income each month... each year from them.
1986.85-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2450.246,2451.046,Could they be disposed of?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2451.046,2463.47,"There are... the government has repeatedly indicated in terms of the named decedents here that they had the opportunity to sell, they had the opportunity to partition their land, they had the opportunity to do gift conveyances."
1986.85-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2509.767,2515.254,"Ms. War Bonnett, you didn't make a due process attack on this statue in the courts below, did you?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2515.254,2520.742,--This was initially... the plaintiffs did not.
1986.85-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2526.646,2530.431,"Well, the parties that you now represent made no such claim in the courts below."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2531.298,2545.608,"--That is correct, and the reason that we have brought this factual record to your attention is to counter the fact that the government has repeatedly said that this statute offers a lot of... given the circumstances here there were a lot of other remedies that people had and they could have--"
1986.85-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2545.608,2549.326,"Well, you are not suggesting that this Court should go off on some due process ground, are you?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2549.326,2550.511,--I don't.
1986.85-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.396,2569.306,"Counsel, may I ask about your assertion earlier that the outcome here should be affected by the fact that in 1889 the Indians weren't given the land for free, but in effect gave compensation for it."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2591.671,2601.794,I would think that we view this situation as completely unique in terms of the contract and the consideration that was given here.
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.847,2641.068,"How do you distinguish Texaco, or do you?"
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2643.937,2653.459,"Justice Stevens, that particular case is different in that it does not deal with a devise situation."
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.271,2705.759,"The net effect of the statute, the state statute in Texaco, was that the property interests were lost."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2705.759,2707.026,--That's correct.
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.69,2733.761,"Well, here the property owners could have saved their property by taking some steps."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2733.761,2746.501,"There was no meaningful time period for those particular decedents, I would argue, because of the time period between the time that the statute was passed and the time of their death."
1986.85-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.501,2751.869,That's the only real point of distinction between this case and Texaco?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2751.869,2759.456,"Well, in Texaco I feel that, you know, there was a provision for a grace period, and there was none here in terms of people affirmatively protecting their rights."
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.456,2760.423,To the extent--
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2768.229,2774.449,Certainly that's a factor that has to be balanced in determining the situation.
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.991,2818.145,But if your claim... you stress so much the lack of notice.
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2849.047,2863.607,"I would say that the notice provision is important only in response to the government saying that people could have... in their reply brief they seem to say that our people acquiesced, the decedents acquiesced in what happened."
1986.85-637,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2866.376,2871.613,"Counsel, the government in its primary brief didn't even cite Texaco."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2871.613,2873.581,That's correct.
1986.85-637,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2873.581,2875.681,So are they relying on it?
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2878.716,2898.546,I think they are responding to my factual statement which I put forward in our brief that the circumstances here would prevent... would have in all likelihood prevented these people from availing themselves of the remedies that the government has always said individuals had under this to avoid the effects of the statute.
1986.85-637,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2898.546,2903.6,"Maybe I should ask the question of your opponent as to why they didn't cite it if, as Justice White indicates, there may be some precedent there."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2929.815,2930.833,That's correct.
1986.85-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2959.651,2961.52,"Well, they paid for the property in the Texaco case, too."
1986.85-637,1,46685,yvette_hall_war_bonnett,,2965.389,2980.933,"--In terms of how they paid for it or what they relinquished, I think that this case presents distinguishable facts from someone who goes to the state of New York and pays the appraised value for a piece of property, but I will leave that decision up to the Court."
1986.85-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3057.516,3059.783,"Thank you, Ms. War Bonnett."
1986.85-637,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3062.835,3065.837,"Yes, I do have several points I would like to make."
1986.85-637,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.334,3102.395,"Let me ask, since you have mentioned Texaco, which probably is not one of the most widely read opinions that we have ever issued, by the way, that if your opponent did now rely on a due process rationale, trying to defend the judgment below, would that argument be open to your opponent, do you think?"
1986.85-637,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3102.395,3103.129,--I think not.
1986.85-637,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3114.515,3118.883,Do you think it would be open to the Court to affirm on that ground if the Court thought there were merit to the argument?
1986.85-637,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3118.883,3122.002,I don't think the Court could affirm on that ground.
1986.85-637,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.573,3134.726,"Isn't the respondent entitled to support the judgment on any ground that is apparent from the record, or not?"
1986.85-637,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3136.261,3143.182,"I think it would not be apparent from the record, and it does come a bit late at this point."
1986.85-637,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.367,3144.917,"Well, I know."
1986.85-637,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3150.354,3176.403,"--As we say, this is not a situation like Texaco where notice is an important ingredient, we think, because laws regulating the descent of property typically happen automatically at the moment of death, and the legislature does not normally provide a grace period when it changes the rules of descent, even though they might substantially unsettle the decedent's expectations of where his property was going to go."
1986.85-637,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3340.604,3342.239,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
