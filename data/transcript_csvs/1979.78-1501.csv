1979.78-1501,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,52.535,"We will hear arguments next in 78-1501, McLain against Real Estate Board."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,55.448,58.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.857,231.002,"Mr. Vinet, let me make sure I understand your contention."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,246.891,248.793,I'm not sure that I understand Your Honor's question.
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.476,278.23,"What is your position with respect to the necessary connection with interstate commerce, which the trial court found was lacking?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,291.736,292.748,"It's a little bit of both, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,313.878,319.124,So your answer is that the district court on the facts before it should have ruled for you?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,319.124,325.132,"Yes, Your Honor, but not because it found facts that didn't exist, but because it applied a standard that wasn't broad enough."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.132,330.603,"Well, that's--but on the facts, if it had applied the right standard, you should have won?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,330.603,331.895,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,331.895,338.971,"And by the right standard, do you mean the standard that--or something like the standard that was applied in Goldfarb?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,338.971,342.978,"Your Honor, Goldfarb is distinct from this case."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.635,390.305,But that's basically a factual question.
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,399.177,409.418,"We have a factual finding to the effect that real estate brokers don't stand in quite the same relationship to the transaction as title lawyers do, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,420.674,423.705,You say they should have applied a different standard?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,423.705,424.348,"That's it, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.947,432.998,And supposing we agree with you?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,438.835,449.103,"On, no, Your Honor, I believe that the evidence we've developed, taken in conjunction with the allegations of the petition, for which there was neither evidence nor discovery, would support a jurisdictional finding."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.101,467.104,"Well, didn't we say in the Rex case a couple years ago, written by Justice Marshall, that summary judgment rulings, rulings on a question as a matter of law, were not favored in this kind of a case?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,467.104,469.705,"Indeed you did, Your Honor; that's very correct."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.705,475.975,"And what you're asking us to do is to make--to find a summary judgment, is to enter summary judgment here."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,475.975,479.237,"Well, no, Your Honor, we weren't seeking a summary judgment."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,489.246,494.559,"Yes, but weren't there factual disputes even on the jurisdictional issue?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,494.559,497.312,"I don't know if there were factual disputes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.053,536.461,You say your opponents in effect concede that?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,541.59,558.066,"Well, I think that they would--they have, in fact, testified that the majority of real estate transactions, in fact 60 percent of real estate transactions in New Orleans -- I'm sorry, in a majority in New Orleans, they testified, are handled through real estate brokers."
1979.78-1501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,586.462,593.173,What is the -- what is the brokerage rate in --
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,593.173,595.177,"In New Orleans, Your Honor, it's 6 percent."
1979.78-1501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.177,605.397,And you're essentially claiming that -- that the absence of competition between real estate brokers has an affect on interstate commerce?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,605.397,606.096,"Indeed we do, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.096,609.911,In terms of -- absence of competition in terms of rate?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,609.911,610.418,"Well, Your Honor, we can't --"
1979.78-1501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.418,619.74,"Price-fixing, price-fixing among brokers in terms of their brokerage rate, their charge, the 6 percent, affects interstate commerce; that's your --"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,619.74,621.074,"Yes, Your Honor, we taken that position."
1979.78-1501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.017,636.811,"And if they were competing, if they were free, if each individual was free to reduce his rate, what would happen?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,636.811,643.542,"Well, Your Honor, I think the housing prices would largely go down, particularly in the houses which are the easiest to sell."
1979.78-1501,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.451,648.833,"And therefore, what?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,659.194,660.232,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,669.586,677.077,"Well, how would the price going down for a particular house affect the mortgage market?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,677.077,677.333,Okay.
1979.78-1501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,680.406,684.09,I mean the interstate -- getting money interstate for loans.
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,685.547,685.888,Okay.
1979.78-1501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,705.251,707.363,It's going to be harder to finance?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,707.363,708.026,"That's it, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.807,736.744,Do the -- do they supply the brokerage rates for raw land?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,743.225,743.674,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,754.856,759.149,"Or even just lots that are -- I suppose real estate brokers handle those, don't they?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,759.149,761.343,"Real estate brokers handle those, but I don't know --"
1979.78-1501,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,761.343,762.998,They're not involved in this case?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,762.998,765.279,"No, sir, it has nothing to do with the case."
1979.78-1501,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,766.364,777.401,"Yes, may I ask this question Did the discovery order of the district court limit your depositions to evidence relating to in-commerce?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,777.401,780.294,"Yes, Your Honor, that's true; that's correct."
1979.78-1501,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,780.294,782.042,Did you object to that?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,782.042,783.267,"Yes, Your Honor, we did."
1979.78-1501,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,786.326,788.051,It involved it?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,788.051,788.333,I beg your pardon?
1979.78-1501,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,788.333,792.944,You wanted evidence with respect to the effect on commerce as well as in-commerce?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,792.944,793.898,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,793.898,797.207,And the district court refused to allow you to introduce that evidence?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,797.207,805.205,"Well, yes, Your Honor, we were not able to go beyond the scope of trying to bring the case within the factual pattern of Goldfarb."
1979.78-1501,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,805.205,806.354,Which was in-commerce?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,806.354,808.683,"Which -- well, it turns out to be that way."
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,815.81,825.35,The depositions you introduced seem to me to address primarily the theory of in-commerce rather than the effects upon commerce.
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,825.35,826.194,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,850.959,865.845,"Well, Mr. Vinet, there's no indication in the Court of Appeals opinion, which I just read over, that your claim was that you were limited in your deposition to showing only whether or not this was in commerce."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,878.196,883.366,"If Your Honor please, I don't think we were, at that time, characterizing Goldfarb as an in-commerce as opposed to an affection --"
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,883.366,891.06,"Well, no, I'm referring to my brother Powell's question as to whether or not your grievance is that you were limited in your discovery."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,891.06,893.563,We -- that is not our primary grievance.
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,893.563,895.832,That's not what was dealt with in the Court of Appeals opinion at all.
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,895.832,899.146,"Oh, yes, Your Honor, there is in fact a section --"
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,899.146,901.171,"Well, they deal--they talk about the fact --"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,901.171,901.539,Right.
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,901.539,908.051,"-- of price-fixing, the fact that this may be a gross price-fixing doesn't affect the jurisdictional question at all."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,908.051,909.261,"Well, that's the position that they take."
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,909.84,910.181,"Well, I know."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,915.964,917.873,"Well, Mr. Justice Brennan, the rest of that --"
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,917.873,920.07,My name is Stewart.
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,920.07,920.742,"Oh, pardon me."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,920.742,921.922,That's all right; it's a mirror image.
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,925.787,945.124,"Mr. Justice Stewart, what I was going to say -- Your Honor, we took the position throughout in the Court of Appeals that if we could have had discovery to show that these realtors -- and produce evidence that these realtors engaged in price-fixing, we could have beat the jurisdictional issue."
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1037.296,1044.156,"Technically, doesn't a realtor earn his commission when he brings a willing seller and a willing buyer together?"
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,1044.156,1046.07,"Your Honor, there are some Louisiana cases which say --"
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1046.07,1047.777,Isn't that the law in Louisiana?
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,1047.777,1048.544,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1062.847,1064.794,"He's still owed his commission, right."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,1064.794,1086.537,"As a practical matter, however, the purchase agreement -- we have deposition testimony in the deposition of Mr. Derbes, page -- Appendix page 263, to the effect that the listing agreement, or the purchase agreement will provide that a good faith effort has to be made to get the loan, but payment of the commission is contingent upon the obtaining of financing."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1181.223,1183.146,"Mr. Vinet, let me ask you one more question."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,1208.305,1211.783,"Well, Your Honor, it's the right language, but it wouldn't make sense."
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.783,1217.007,"Well, then you're attacking a factual finding."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,1217.007,1217.124,"Well, no --"
1979.78-1501,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.124,1219.58,And two courts have decided against you.
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,1219.58,1227.286,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what I'm saying is that ""substantially affects,"" for the purposes of the Court of Appeals and the lower court, meant the same thing as ""in commerce."""
1979.78-1501,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.68,1292.697,"Your time has expired now, counsel."
1979.78-1501,0,40672,richard_g_vinet,,1292.697,1295.801,Thank you.
1979.78-1501,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1295.801,1311.395,Mr. Easterbrook.
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1311.395,1314.822,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1349.612,1356.412,But you say that real estate was what the Court of Appeals thought was involved.
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1364.834,1366.846,"I understand that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.846,1368.209,How do you explain it?
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1368.209,1372.211,The Court of Appeals opinion is internally inconsistent in that respect.
1979.78-1501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1441.906,1453.63,"Is it your understanding of Rex that it held, as a matter of law, that there was jurisdiction, or simply it said that the trial court should have decided it as a factual question?"
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1453.63,1456.763,It said that it had to be decided as a factual question.
1979.78-1501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.319,1574.563,"Well, but that's not the same standard as you use on an anti-trust case."
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1580.901,1594.27,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it's one of the oddities, I think, of the Sherman Act cases, that that is the standard at the same time as the holding is that the Sherman Act expresses all of the power that Congress has to exercise."
1979.78-1501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.486,1595.834,But is it nonetheless --
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1595.834,1597.632,It is nonetheless the holding.
1979.78-1501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.41,1686.467,"Well, would you say it's impossible to logically conclude that the real estate board of Greater New York City is engaged in activities which affect commerce, but the real estate board of a town in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia is not engaged in those activities?"
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1686.467,1698.527,I think it would be extremely difficult to do that unless the real estate board of the small town in that hypothetical was able to show that no one had moved into or out of that town within the period of the statute of limitations.
1979.78-1501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.527,1702.164,So there's no substantial requirement at all?
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1702.164,1719.57,"The requirement, I think, and it's a way that the failed conspiracy cases can be dealt with at the same as cases like Rex Hospital, is that the commerce subject to the conspiracy be substantial; that is, in the failed conspiracy cases, one of those failed conspiracies was the business of oil."
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1744.804,1750.534,"Mr. Easterbrook, I want to be sure I understood your answer in your colloquy with my brother Rehnquist."
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1780.022,1781.995,I think that to be the holding in Perez.
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.995,1787.136,"That is, I take it, the holding in Perez from which you know I -- with which you know I disagreed."
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1787.136,1789.39,Yes.
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.39,1800.174,"Is that a different test from the ordinary, traditional under test under the--of whether or not something is in, or affects, interstate commerce under the anti-trust laws?"
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1800.174,1801.144,It -- the test --
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1801.144,1802.17,Logic aside.
1979.78-1501,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1802.17,1802.976,"Logic aside, the test had been applied differently."
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1802.976,1804.404,Do you concede that this--the test was quite different?
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1804.404,1808.21,"Oh, yes; the two have certainly been applied differently."
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1844.03,1856.069,"Well, in the Perez case, Congress might have worded the criminal statute to have said that loan-sharking that affects interstate commerce shall be a criminal offense."
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1861.852,1862.239,Right.
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1862.239,1863.499,That would -- that would make it a --
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1863.499,1869.273,"Of course, and that's what most of the gun cases say, guns that have travelled in interstate commerce, or things of that sort."
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1869.273,1869.656,Well --
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1869.656,1870.292,But there's --
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1870.292,1871.558,-- that are in or affect?
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1871.558,1877.031,"Uh-huh, but there's been an interesting difference even between those cases and the Sherman Act cases, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1907.908,1908.707,Right.
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1908.707,1910.878,Even though the language of the statutes is very similar.
1979.78-1501,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.878,1926.4,"You read the -- you seem to read the Fifth Circuit holding as meaning -- as holding, in fact, that under no circumstances can the real estate brokerage business ever be read as in or affecting interstate commerce."
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1926.4,1928.575,I think that's what the Court was saying.
1979.78-1501,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1941.336,1952.734,"Well, then, what do you think -- on page 39A, the paragraph that was read to you before, ""With our endorsement of the district court's determination that this particular real estate activity."""
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1962.6,1965.294,"Certainly, the New Orleans real estate brokerage business, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1501,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1965.294,1967.515,All New Orleans real estate?
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1967.515,1968.975,I think so.
1979.78-1501,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1982.375,1984.847,"That is, some allegations of the price-fixing?"
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,1984.847,1985.577,Yes.
1979.78-1501,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.384,2036.124,Did the plaintiffs take that unanswered question to the judge?
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2036.124,2037.783,"I'm sorry, Mr. Justice White?"
1979.78-1501,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2037.783,2041.729,"Well, did they attempt to get an order to answer the question?"
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2041.729,2053.339,"The judge, after receiving the response, simply took the case under advisement, and then dismissed it under Rule 12, without ever dealing with the objection to the taking of the interrogatories."
1979.78-1501,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.339,2053.842,"Well, before --"
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2053.842,2055.844,There was no motion to compel discovery.
1979.78-1501,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.844,2058.716,And the plaintiff didn't assign that as error?
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2058.716,2068.309,"He -- on appeal, the plaintiff did not assign as error any of the particular refusals to answer, but instead made the more general argument that he was entitled to a trial."
1979.78-1501,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.415,2094.378,"I take it the--on the theory the Court of Appeals used, if the brokerage rate, agreed-upon brokerage rate, was 20 percent instead of 6, or even 50, that the result would have been the same?"
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2094.378,2097.79,"I think the result would have been quite the same, from the Court of Appeals point of view."
1979.78-1501,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.79,2102.108,And I take it your argument would be the same if it was 1 percent?
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2102.108,2107.489,If -- it would be the same if the fee were increased by any amount by the price-fixing.
1979.78-1501,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.489,2108.765,Yes.
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2108.765,2111.168,"Let me suggest, by the way, that that's an important difference between --"
1979.78-1501,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.168,2123.197,"Well, you -- I take it your assumption that inevitably the price is higher than it would be if the agreed rate -- the price of real estate is higher that if the agreed rate were one percent?"
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2123.197,2124.606,"Yes, yes."
1979.78-1501,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.197,2129.977,"And that if there was competition, prices would be lower in some cases?"
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2129.977,2132.196,"Yes, that's certainly our assumption."
1979.78-1501,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.034,2172.532,"Well, to the contrary, there's -- you'll find statements in there also that no lawyer felt free to charge anything less than the fixed rate."
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2172.532,2173.424,"Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1501,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2173.424,2184.304,"And the evidence in the case was, that of all the 36 lawyers who were fooled, as it were, they all said they were not free."
1979.78-1501,1,23879,frank_h_easterbook,,2184.304,2188.107,"Oh, I'm not disputing that in any way."
1979.78-1501,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2215.433,2222.946,Mr. McCall.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2222.946,2227.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2416.779,2431.023,"So you don't read the Fifth Circuit opinion as your friend does, namely, that the brokerage business, real estate brokerage business could never be shown to affect interstate commerce?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2431.023,2441.945,"I think the answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, lies in the portion that was read either by yourself or one of the Justices, namely, on this particular case."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2442.809,2445.093,"I didn't quite say, on this particular case."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2445.093,2446.223,Or these particular circumstances.
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2446.223,2453.498,"It's page 39, ""this particular real estate activity."""
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2476.336,2481.925,"I stand corrected, Mr. Chief Justice, on the language in the Court of Appeals decision."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2517.495,2541.003,"In this sense, is it your position that this is roughly parallel to a complaint and a showing where there -- depending on diversity of citizenship, there's either a flawed or no allegation of diversity, and nothing to supplement that, and the court then decides that this is not a diversity case, and therefore, no jurisdiction?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2544.43,2546.819,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.207,2710.679,Mr. McCall --
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2710.679,2711.704,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.704,2715.47,-- you have referred a couple of times to trying to case on one theory.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2718.045,2721.255,"Mr. Justice Stevens, there was no trial as such."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2721.255,2723.288,There was a granting of a motion to dismiss.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2723.288,2730.441,But what there was was that the motion to dismiss was predicated on evidence submitted by these petitioners.
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.441,2737.295,"Well, the court treated it as though it was in the nature of a motion to dismiss supported by affidavits, which is treated as a motion for summary judgment."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2737.295,2739.094,"Well, more than an affidavit, Your Honor."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.094,2739.666,"Well, depositions."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2739.666,2741.157,"Mr. Justice Stevens, there was actual evidence taken."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.157,2749.171,But isn't it true that in that kind of disposition all factual inferences are taken most favorably to the losing party?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2749.171,2750.437,I would think not.
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.571,2761.266,Were there any findings of fact made?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2761.266,2763.287,"Not as such, no."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.287,2767.945,No proceedings in -- before the trial judge of cross-examining witnesses or anything like that?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2767.945,2768.667,"No, sir."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.158,2782.419,"But it seems to me normally, when you have a motion to dismiss supported by affidavits and treated as a summary judgment, you basically say, well, the issues are either undisputed, or if there is a dispute, you take the view of the facts most favorable to the losing party."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2784.926,2786.839,"In general, I think, yes, that is the rule."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2786.839,2788.245,Then why wouldn't that rule apply to this case?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2788.245,2797.017,"But I don't think it applies in this case, because you don't have a motion to dismiss or summary judgment in the conventional sense."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2804.037,2809.746,"And the judge, in effect, says, ""Well, I take everything you have proved, and assuming it to be true, it's still not enough."""
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2811.493,2816.58,"Not where evidence is submitted by both sides, as I appreciate it, as it is in this case."
1979.78-1501,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2816.58,2827.081,"Well, but the trial court can't resolve factual disputes, if the plaintiffs' affidavit shows one thing and the defendants' another, he can't make a finding of fact."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2837.623,2842.942,"That is correct, where you have affidavits, as I appreciate it, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1501,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2847.141,2853.248,"Well, how -- I'm not -- I don't think I fully understand that."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2880.933,2891.782,"Well, it's our appreciation of what happened is that the trial judge first, the motion to dismiss was submitted on affidavits."
1979.78-1501,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2891.782,2893.55,Whose motion to dismiss was it?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2893.55,2898.583,It was the motion to dismiss by the respondent realtors.
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.583,2899.85,Supported by affidavits?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2899.85,2900.637,Yes.
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.451,2922.444,"And there couldn't have been an issue of material fact, or the judgment--or the court couldn't have entered a judgment, could it?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2922.444,2924.533,"At that point, I think that's correct."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2924.533,2932.018,"Well, after the argument on whatever was submitted, there couldn't be an outstanding issue of material fact, could there?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2932.018,2932.484,"No, sir."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2932.484,2935.823,And have -- permit the court to enter judgment?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2935.823,2937.494,"At that point, that's correct."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2937.494,2945.967,So where was it -- what factual finding did the court come to except that there is no factual issue?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2945.967,2946.872,Well --
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.872,2958.465,"He came to a legal conclusion that there was no showing of an effect on commerce, or there was -- or whatever, his standard was, he didn't think the facts in the record satisfied it."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2958.465,2959.326,That is correct.
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2959.326,2962.633,"Well, is that a -- is that what you call a factual finding?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2962.633,2965.872,"Yes, if you will bear in mind that subsequent to the hearing--"
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2965.872,2969.583,A factual finding although he wasn't entitles to make factual findings.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2969.583,2974.257,"Well, that's where I -- with all due respect, Mr. Justice White--you and I disagree."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.257,2974.709,Yes.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,2974.709,2987.675,"Because following the hearing on the motion on the affidavits, there was an order permitting these plaintiffs to take evidence, which they did."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2997.392,3002.81,"Because, at the very end of the trial court's opinion, in footnote 7, after all this took place."
1979.78-1501,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3026.007,3029.702,"I'm afraid, Mr. Justice Stevens, you have me on the hip there."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.702,3030.355,I think I do.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3030.355,3031.599,He did so find that.
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3031.599,3032.297,Yes.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3032.297,3054.536,"But let me then suggest to Your Honors that even if you treat it as a motion for summary judgment on which you resolve the issues most favorably to the person against whom the decision goes, that you still have a decision which is correct on the facts and on the law."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3054.536,3066.299,But is it a factual -- is it any kind of a factual conclusion that is entitled to the respect of a two-court fact finding?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3070.174,3074.12,"I'm afraid I have to back down on that one, Mr. Justice White."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3075.501,3079.183,"No, I wouldn't think you would."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3079.183,3083.166,But I can't answer your question any other way.
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.595,3210.17,"Well, what if it --what if real estate brokerage were 50 percent?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3234.872,3240.217,I think that the question would be somewhat more difficult in that case.
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.217,3242.429,So is it the question of what is substantial?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3242.429,3246.095,I think that addresses the question of substantiality.
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3246.095,3247.443,And so it does that?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3251.262,3254.414,"Let me say, with reservations I will agree to that."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.414,3257.282,"And six percent, doesn't have enough of an effect?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3257.282,3270.831,"Well, the point that I wanted to make that is -- and I'm sorry not to answer your question more briefly and directly -- is that what we're talking about is the six percent commission on the first $100,000."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.853,3294.251,Let's don't skip over one --
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3294.251,3295.159,All right.
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.159,3298.738,Do you agree that it has an effect on house prices?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3298.738,3300.297,"No, I would not agree to that."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3300.297,3308.027,"If there was no agreement, and people were free to compete, you don't think house prices would ever be lower?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3308.027,3313.35,"Well, the way you have stated it, Mr. Justice White, I think I would have to say, yes, they might be."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3314.082,3324.906,"If some broker decided to cut his rate to two percent, I suppose a seller might be willing to cut his price some."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3324.906,3325.528,"Well, let me --"
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3325.528,3326.701,Is that right or not?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3326.701,3329.249,I think this is a possibility.
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3336.019,3349.275,"Does this record, Mr. McCall, show the aggregate amount of commissions in New Orleans- in a given year on all real estate transactions in which a broker was involved?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3349.275,3349.858,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3349.858,3354.649,"It would run into, I would assume, a good many millions of dollars, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3354.649,3356.572,"Not, the commissions, no, sir."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3356.572,3357.506,Not so?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3357.506,3366.355,"No, I would be greatly surprised if six percent commissions amounted to that much, to millions of dollars."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3370.375,3378.873,"Well, then, it's quite different from Washington, D.C., because the aggregate commissions here must easily match the figures in this area."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3380.003,3382.592,"I won't dispute that, because I don't know."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3382.592,3388.46,"Well, let's assume it's $5 million in a given year."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3405.746,3415.922,"What I think I said, and what I would like to say, is that I would have to accept the possibility, but I would say that I don't believe it."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3449.418,3454.538,"Well, it doesn't have to, because in a dollar amount, it goes up."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3454.538,3456.73,"It does in dollar amount, that's true."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.238,3472.123,"Well, you wouldn't ask -- you wouldn't ask for independent proof if the rate was 50 percent, would you?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3474.404,3477.76,"All right, sir, I won't ask for proof on 50 percent."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3479.832,3482.342,Hasn't the rate itself gone up?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3482.342,3482.542,"No, sir."
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3482.542,3487.474,It has in most places from 5 percent to 6 percent in the last ten years or less.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3487.474,3491.525,Let me say that the record is silent on that.
1979.78-1501,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3491.525,3491.643,Well.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3492.306,3493.543,But I don't think it happened.
1979.78-1501,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3493.543,3505.543,"Wasn't the question, wouldn't there necessarily be an effect on the price of housing if you had free competition by contrast with a price-fixed commission?"
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3506.737,3508.127,Yes.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3508.127,3509.299,"Have I not answered that, Mr. Justice Stewart?"
1979.78-1501,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3509.299,3513.452,"Well, we were talking about whether or not a commission has an effect on housing."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3519.42,3519.932,I'm sorry.
1979.78-1501,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3519.932,3547.295,"The question was If there were free competition among real estate brokers, and some of them might fix their rate at one percent or two percent or three percent or seven or eight percent, depending on the individual house to be sold, perhaps, or their economies of scale, or their efficiencies, or whatever, wouldn't free competition, at least arguably, make some housing cheaper than it is now under a price-fixed six percent rate?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3548.821,3554.404,"I think the answer to that is, there's a theoretical possibility it could."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3565.719,3576.918,"Well, supposes -- what should a trial judge do, for anti-trust purposes, when he's making a -- when he's going to resolve that at the beginning of a case?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3586.466,3588.443,"And your question is, how should he resolve it?"
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.443,3592.947,"And he should say, the plaintiff hasn't proved it, or what?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3592.947,3605.699,"I should think, Mr. Justice White, that if he gives the plaintiff an opportunity to prove it, and the plaintiff doesn't prove it, that he is justified then in resolving it adversely to him."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3606.426,3616.912,"Of course, even if you admit all this, it's irrelevant so far as the Federal anti-trust laws go if it's all in the intrastate commerce."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3616.912,3617.523,Well --
1979.78-1501,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3617.523,3630.331,"No matter how egregious the violation might be of the of the anti-trust laws if it were affecting inter-state commerce, it's no violation of Federal -- so far as the Federal laws go if it doesn't affect interstate commerce, or isn't in interstate commerce."
1979.78-1501,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3630.331,3643.282,But isn't the only way -- isn't the only way that--or is it the only way that the agreed-upon brokerage rate can affect the mortgage market by interstate travel is by affecting the price of the house?
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3643.282,3646.436,It's the only way that I can conceive of its doing so.
1979.78-1501,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3646.436,3646.713,Yes.
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3665.746,3670.012,That is where the record is completely devoid of any proof.
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3841.529,3844.593,"The Coronado Coal cases were criminal cases, weren't they?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3844.593,3848.102,"U.S. against -- yes, they were both criminal cases; both of them."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3899.943,3907.09,"Well, that, of course, was not the kind of restraint -- not a business-type restraint, rather than because the commerce power didn't reach it, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3907.09,3909.416,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, you say was that a business-type restraint?"
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3909.416,3914.636,"In the Apex case, it sort of went off on the theory that a labor dispute is not the kind of restraint that the Sherman Act is --"
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3914.636,3917.02,"No, sir, that was not the basis of it."
1979.78-1501,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3942.636,3943.87,"I believe it did, too."
1979.78-1501,2,27597,harry_mccall_jr,,3943.87,3947.198,-- I'm quite sure that that's what Apex Hosiery stands for.
1979.78-1501,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3988.804,3989.217,"Thank you, gentlemen."
