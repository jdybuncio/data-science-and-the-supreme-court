1978.78-776,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.01,-- Justice Stewart.
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,11.145,14.546,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-776,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,203.326,217.528,"Do you think that’s analogous to the discretion of the prosecutor whether he should charge a first-degree murder for example or second degree murder or manslaughter, or is there an alternative?"
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,217.528,220.432,"I think it’s very analogous, Your Honor."
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,245.765,256.16,"There’s also a difference is, unless I misunderstand it that the elements of the offense at least with respect to this defendant were exactly the same."
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,256.16,261.519,"Well, Your Honor I don’t think that is -- I think that’s the Court of Appeals conclusion."
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,264.746,266.799,"Well, I know with respect to other defendants, they might not have --"
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,266.799,276.144,"No, no even with respect to a convicted felon, there is a difference in the commerce clause element between these two statutes."
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.162,305.1,"Again in this case, it was stipulated that the firearm had traveled in interstate commerce."
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,305.1,305.398,That’s correct.
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,305.398,315.452,"So with respect with this defendant, the elements are precisely the same, aren’t they, unlike a first and second-degree murder or unlike the Bordenkircher against Hayes situation?"
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,315.452,316.181,Well if --
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,316.181,318.382,"Or was there a recidivist statute, as I remember it?"
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,318.382,319.552,"-- if, right."
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.741,323.508,Right.
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,323.508,341.16,"There is -- there are several decisions of this Court in which if one looks at what the proof of the Government is in terms of none contested elements of the crime, this Court has upheld the conviction under one statute or another, or found that no lesser included offense was necessary."
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.537,380.882,"Mr. Levander, as we all know, there has been kicking around the Congress for quite a while now."
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,395.433,419.01,"Well, it might eliminate some, however Section 1822 of S. 1437, that’s the current destination of the major provision of Title 18, contains both the equivalent of 922 (h), the five-year statute and 1202, and also continues to have a five-year penalty for the one and a two-year penalty for the other."
1978.78-776,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.65,443.494,I would assume that in any comprehensive criminal code in astute defendant could find some set of facts which would violate more than one provision of it?
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,443.494,457.023,"There are many in Title 18, as we indicate in the brief in a long footnote, there are just numerous Sections which violate -- which are overlapping to either similar or 100%."
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,469.375,474.238,"An astute prosecutor could do it at least as well, and that’s the point, isn’t it?"
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,474.238,490.511,That’s correct that traditionally the prosecutors had that discretion and a discretion to choose one statute or another is no greater discretion in the Government’s view than the discretion not to charge at all or.
1978.78-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.091,597.923,"Well, do you think the differences between the two statutes are -- would be sufficient to justify consecutive sentences?"
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,597.923,598.663,That’s a --
1978.78-776,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.663,599.817,On these facts?
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,599.817,602.145,On these facts?
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,919.183,925.637,What was the sentence actually imposed -- the punishment actually imposed by the district judge in this case?
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,925.637,929.816,"It was a five-year -- it was a five-year penalty, the maximum."
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,929.816,931.168,And no fine?
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,931.168,932.514,And no fine.
1978.78-776,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,934.388,935.957,"Right, then you would agree it didn’t."
1978.78-776,0,16416,andrew_j_levander,,935.957,936.997,That’s correct.
1978.78-776,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1348.221,1350.296,Very well.
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1351.28,1357.341,"Mr. Chief Justice, and Justices of the Supreme Court."
1978.78-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.027,1577.995,Well are you suggesting there’s something constitutionally infirm about the provision about someone discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions?
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1577.995,1591.621,I say these provisions are so ambiguous that serious consideration ought to be given by this Court as to whether or not both of them are constitutional.
1978.78-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.485,1608.97,Was your client -- is there any claim that your client was discharged on a dishonorable provision?
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1608.97,1613.004,"No, I’m just pointing out -- I’m just pointing out some of the problems --"
1978.78-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.004,1613.589,"Just run me through the statute, kind of a thing?"
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1613.589,1620.382,"-- that’s eventually have in both of these statutes, Your Honor."
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.757,1771.881,"Well, I suppose the prosecutor has some discretion in choosing whether to prosecute or not?"
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1771.881,1773.078,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.078,1776.391,And is this any worse in degree?
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1776.391,1779.273,Yes.
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1813.142,1817.931,You could say “I’ll charge you Mr. A but I’m not going to charge Mr. B.”
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1817.931,1818.624,You could say that.
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1818.624,1819.504,Something wrong with that?
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1819.504,1821.268,Yes -- no he could do that.
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.506,1847.563,Let me go back to your District of Columbia case.
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1850.944,1851.745,Under both.
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.745,1855.033,And was he then of course sentenced under both?
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1855.033,1855.184,Yes.
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.184,1857.778,Were the sentences concurrent or --
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1857.778,1858.762,They were concurrent.
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.762,1859.684,Concurrent.
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1859.684,1859.888,Yes.
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.888,1864.917,But the Court of Appeals applied the rule of lenity and held it to two years?
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1864.917,1865.605,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.605,1872.649,Alright.
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1872.649,1881.293,"Now, the Solicitor General argues that Congress intended that Section 922 governed related penalty."
1978.78-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.604,1922.707,"Well Mr. Bellows, a prosecutor faced with the decision before any charges made would be, or I’ll put it to you as a question."
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1939.424,1945.769,"No, when you have the same offense with two different punishments."
1978.78-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1946.89,1949.787,What if that’s within discretion at all?
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1949.787,1953.154,"I will say no, Your Honor."
1978.78-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1965.628,1967.859,The higher is just surplusage then.
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1969.512,1974.528,"Well, it’s -- it could be described as that."
1978.78-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1974.528,1980.192,"That’s the consequence of the decision of the Court of Appeals here, is it not?"
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,1980.192,1991.055,"Well, the court said -- the Court of Appeals said this “You have two statutes here that are ambiguous and apparently are void under the Fifth Amendment for being vague.”"
1978.78-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2008.159,2017.562,"Mr. Bellows, could you express -- explain precisely why these two statutes are “void for vagueness under the Fifth Amendment”?"
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2017.562,2025.667,"Well, vague because how do you know what to apply?"
1978.78-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2025.667,2028.108,"Well, five years is perfectly clear to me."
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2028.108,2028.286,Yes.
1978.78-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.286,2030.307,Ten years is perfectly clear to me.
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2037.717,2052.176,"Well, but when you have two statutes that cover the same offense of the purchaser or receipt of a gun, one says the defendant may receive up to five years and the one receives two years."
1978.78-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.885,2073.295,Well if your argument may be that the prosecutor ought not to be entitled to be given that discretion by Congress.
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2078.637,2088.83,"It’s my point and -- but despite the Court of Appeals that that makes it vague, because it -- there are no guidelines."
1978.78-776,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2126.0,2130.594,Really what you’re talking about are vague penalties in the -- to use the language of the Court of Appeals.
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2130.594,2131.554,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-776,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2131.554,2133.201,Not vague language --
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2133.201,2147.58,"No, language alone if you had just 922 alone or 1202 alone, it’s perfectly clear that when you put together two of them that conflict with each other then I say there’s a vagueness."
1978.78-776,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.58,2160.95,Has there ever been a case from this Court that held unconstitutional a statute which was perfectly clear as to its proscription but had the vagueness problem that you perceive as to penalties?
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2160.95,2176.644,Not that I’m aware of.
1978.78-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2225.779,2237.899,"But Mr. Bellows, is this really fundamentally much different from the inconsistent verdicts that juries sometimes render in which we -- the courts have said that inconsistent verdicts are an inherent part of the system?"
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2237.899,2239.839,Juries are entitled to that.
1978.78-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2239.839,2242.45,Well only because the courts have said they’re entitled to it though.
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2242.45,2243.831,Yes.
1978.78-776,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.004,2287.789,They do?
1978.78-776,1,18382,charles_a_bellows,,2287.789,2291.04,Yes.
1978.78-776,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2378.181,2378.828,Thank you Mr. Bellows.
1978.78-776,2,16416,andrew_j_levander,,2381.173,2384.343,"Just a couple quick points if I might, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-776,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2468.514,2469.195,Thank you gentlemen.
