1967.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,15.476,"Number 219, The Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma et al., Petitioners, versus the United States."
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,16.926,20.606,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,185.675,191.06,Did you say how many Indians there were in this group?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,191.06,192.151,"No, I haven't --"
1967.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,192.151,202.809,"It's alright I just thought you said something as to the number, it is important part?"
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,202.809,218.863,"Upon the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the non-Indians moved over into Kansas and squatted on the lands including the lands of the petitioner."
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,408.551,410.065,Which were those two cases?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,410.065,416.069,The Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa case and the United States versus Blackfeather.
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,416.069,416.869,Alright.
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,420.056,423.903,"Mille Lac, M-I-L-L-E L-A-C."
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,423.903,424.973,Thousand Lakes?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,424.973,426.74,That's right.
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,426.74,429.708,Thank you.
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,429.708,454.548,We believe the principle at work is that the Indians are entitled to the benefit of the bargain they made that they are -- that the purpose of a proceeding to enforce a contract is to put the Indians or any party who suffers by a breach of the contract in the position that he would have been had the contract been fulfilled.
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,454.548,465.69,"Well, do I correctly remember that the other two cases involved an obligation by the United States to pay interest."
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,465.69,466.957,It is true that --
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,466.957,468.005,Is that right?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,468.005,468.692,"Yes, that is correct."
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,468.692,490.229,"Now, this case does not involve an obligation by the United States to pay interest, but it does involve by your argument an obligation on the United States either to pay up money to the Indians or alternatively to invest in income producing stocks or bonds, is that correct?"
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,490.229,491.923,"That is correct Mr. Justice Fortas, correct."
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,491.923,496.57,So that -- now let me ask you one further question.
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,520.143,524.583,"No, the argument we are making here is based on Article 7 of the treaty in context."
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,524.583,541.452,"That's solely based upon on the language to which I referred mainly that the United States must either forthwith payout the money to the Indians or must invest the money, which you say is equivalent to an obligation on the United States to pay interest."
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,541.452,545.23,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,549.597,570.614,"Are you willing to state it in the negative that way or you insist on the affirmative of it that, the government isn't obliged to pay over all the money or isn't obliged to pay over -- to invest all of the money in bonds that it is necessary to do one or the other."
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,570.614,601.341,"Our position is that the Indians were entitled to have invested anything which was not paid over to them in 1857 by virtue of Article 7 of this treaty that consequently none of the $172,000 having been paid over in 1857 became subject to the provisions of this article."
1967.219,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,612.324,615.807,This is brought under a special act at the time?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,615.807,642.101,"This suit was brought under the Indian Claims Commission Act which is a general jurisdictional act giving Indian tribes in general a right to bring actions of any kind, that law and equity, some of which and some additional kinds, those which violate a standard fair and honorable dealings before a tribunal which is created by the Act called the Indian Claims Commission."
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.827,745.934,Incidentally whole you are on that I notice really before you -- in the conclusion of your brief you ask for interest at the rate of 6% from June 1857 through 1860 and the 5% from 1860 to 1934 and thereafter such rate of interest as the Court deems appropriate.
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,755.709,777.07,"I have not -- to answer you second question Mr. Justice Stewart, first I have not figured that count to the penny, but I believe that just for purposes of our discussion here that the judgment with principal plus interest would be in the magnitude of $1 million if the Court --"
1967.219,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,777.07,777.723,What did you say?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,777.723,782.207,I say it would be in the magnitude of $1 million.
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,803.947,805.295,If it doubles it in --
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,805.295,806.089,20 years.
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,806.089,806.736,Simple interest?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,806.736,810.763,"The simple interest that is what we are asking for, simple interest."
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,810.763,815.431,And it would therefore be something more than $1 million?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,815.431,818.981,As I say I have not calculated and I've made a rough calculation.
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,825.632,834.571,Well I thought you might have figured out --[Attempt to Laughter]
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,834.571,836.242,The reason --
1967.219,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.242,843.263,"I didn't quite understand the -- you gave the answer to my second question, why the differing rates here?"
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,843.263,847.567,"Oh yes, I was about to answer that Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.135,1113.907,Let me see how you understand the government's argument.
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1127.42,1131.941,"Well I think if that's all said, that I wouldn't be here claiming it Your Honor."
1967.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.941,1139.109,You would say that the government could promise to pay over and then not pay over and be liable only --
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1139.109,1140.423,Well --
1967.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.423,1145.114,And be liable only for the principal?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1145.114,1147.218,There are some cases --
1967.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.218,1152.19,Well how about -- what is your position on that?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1152.19,1156.043,I think the Indians would have -- would still have a strong claim.
1967.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1168.394,1172.121,But you have to take that position to win?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1172.121,1177.349,"Oh no, Mr. Justice White I don't think that I have to take that position because --"
1967.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1177.349,1179.388,Well no -- let me get to the other part.
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1186.718,1202.177,"Yes, in that case I think that we would -- that if the United States does not invest proceeds that the Indians would have a cause of action to recover what would have been received had the --"
1967.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.177,1203.392,So that includes interest?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1203.392,1204.293,And that --
1967.219,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.293,1208.431,Do you think the government concedes that much?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1208.431,1214.37,"Well, [Attempt to Laughter] no."
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1467.697,1476.094,"Only in Blackfeather though isn't it, the fact that there was an express agreement for interest?"
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1476.094,1492.453,"As Judge Davis points out, it was expressed in terms of paying the Indians an annuity and the Court looked through that and said yes what this means is that it is the equivalent of a covenant to pay interest."
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1492.453,1525.927,"Yes, and your problem here on the brief is what I think you said a little while ago you got to persuade this Court that we have to reach a conclusion, that this provision that you rely on amounts to a covenant by the United States to pay interest and I take it that you agree that the mere breach of fiduciary duty will not result in an obligation or on part of the United States to pay interest."
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1525.927,1528.06,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1606.398,1614.977,"Well that, they make new law, it's contrary to Indian heart to pay, isn't it?"
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1614.977,1616.325,I don't believe that it is Your Honor.
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1639.036,1642.433,Now that's different matter.
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1660.458,1661.731,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.219,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1661.731,1662.515,Am I right?
1967.219,0,31181,jack_joseph,,1662.515,1666.223,"Yes, Your Honor, you are right."
1967.219,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1716.711,1720.956,Mr. Rifkind?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1720.956,1724.405,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1874.67,1877.856,Did the Claims Commission expressly deal with this?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1877.856,1879.821,Yes it did.
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1879.821,1885.38,You know where in the record?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1885.38,1893.113,"Page 66, we find that petitioners are not entitled to interest on any award in this case."
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1895.258,1897.774,"Well, that's not all dealing with this?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1897.774,1899.161,"Well, the last judgment --"
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.161,1905.947,Stating the general rule that you began with that doesn't have very much to do with this case if I may say so.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1905.947,1906.676,But they say --
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1906.676,1910.143,"Interest doesn't run on a judgment against the government, everybody believes it."
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1910.143,1923.347,"There is no contract or statutory requirement for the payment of interest in this case and I take it that, that can only be a construction of Section 7 because that is the context it was asserted, I am sorry."
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.347,1936.636,[Inaudible] that if the money was paid out it was to be invested?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1936.636,1940.474,The commission didn't address itself to that as far as I can recall.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.968,1951.714,"I gather that your brief concede that, you had pay on --"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1951.714,1953.624,I think that right.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.44,2003.063,It is in this case a promise by the United States to invest this money.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2004.933,2006.236,That's right.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.236,2008.547,So if it wasn't paid out it supposed to be invested.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2008.547,2009.69,That's right.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.906,2011.296,Alright.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2020.826,2022.282,"Well, my first --"
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.282,2022.989,Isn't that right?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2026.587,2027.435,Well --
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.435,2030.829,And the interest needed to be annually paid to the Indians?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2030.829,2031.683,That's right.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.231,2050.399,"I understand that, but the point is against you that --"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2050.399,2052.295,It should have been received.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.295,2055.853,"The government should have handed $172,000 to invest, but it didn't."
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2055.853,2056.906,That's right.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.906,2058.13,And so it didn't invest it.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2058.13,2061.087,And obviously didn't invest what it had to invest.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.087,2064.445,In breach of its promise.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2064.445,2066.13,The sale was in breach of its promise.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.801,2082.935,"$172,000 more which it didn't?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2082.935,2097.698,"That's right, but the critical point we think is that there is a world of difference between a promise to invest money for someone and a promise to pay interest to someone."
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2102.928,2108.821,"This Article 7 says the interest to be annually paid to them, the Indians?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2108.821,2114.904,But it seems to me perfectly clear in the context to that language it means the interest received from the investment.
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2114.904,2116.706,Right.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2116.706,2121.443,"That could a lot of money, it could be a little money, it's not a bond of the treasury."
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2137.371,2142.494,This is what a mutual fund will do for -- [Laughter]
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2142.494,2143.864,It's the sort of undertaking.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2143.864,2144.602,I beg your pardon.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2144.602,2153.512,It's the sort of undertaking that I think Merrill Lynch or some investment broker would undertake.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2161.771,2171.47,Do you consider what the government has done here is doing equity to these Indians?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2171.47,2179.799,"Well, I think it's certainly equitable that we should pay them back the $172,000 for land that was taken."
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2179.799,2186.024,And after holding it for over 100 years?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2186.024,2193.516,All I can answer Mr. Chief Justice is that is the problem in every case that involves sovereign immunity.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2201.331,2211.931,Claims given some rights to adjudicate the rights of individuals when the government made an agreement to do something and then broke it.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2211.931,2213.662,That's right.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2213.662,2219.406,Do you think the government has lived up its obligation under this treaty unless --
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2219.406,2229.169,No I think that the government had made restoration to the extent that it has bound itself to provide a remedy.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2239.822,2242.701,Even though it delays over a 100 years.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2242.701,2243.017,I think so.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2243.017,2252.554,Fulfill the exact agreement that it made with the Indians?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2252.554,2278.897,"All I can conclude -- all I can suggest Mr. Chief Justice is that, if what you are suggesting is sound, then in every case wherever there has been a dereliction by the government on a contract with or without Indian, it's obliged to pay interest during the delay in providing a remedy and Congress at least has never gone that far."
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.897,2297.123,"But you say then it would been error of Indian Claims Commission to have said that in order to do equity to the Indians under our statutory authority, in order to do that we will pay interest on this claim you said that would be error."
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2297.123,2313.377,"Well, I would assume that this action was really under the more usual provisions of the Indian Claims Commissions' statue which provides for recovery on a contract or treaty."
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.767,2338.969,"Yes, but it had already said that the Indian Claims Commission may grant equitable compensation, to that extent it has authorized it to do equity as the Chief Justice suggests?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2338.969,2369.696,"Yes, but there are substantial number of cases of private -- before the -- even Tucker Act was passed, private bills, which said that the Court of Claim shall provide equitable relief in this situation and this Court in number of cases said that means according to the traditional rules of law fairly construed, but it has never been thought to mean an assent to the imposition of liability for interest."
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2369.696,2387.6,"Well, it's one thing to say the United States wouldn't have been liable to pay interest if it had actually gotten the money invested and hadn't received any return on it then if the Indians have sued perhaps United States would say, well all we have to do is to invest, but isn't it something else again when they didn't even invest the money?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2393.618,2416.788,"We can't -- I can't distinguish the situation in which the United States says we'll invest the money and the situation in which the United States says we'll build you a blacksmith's shop with the proceeds, that will be a value to you or we'll build you a school house with the money that will be of use to you, or we'll buy you fertilizer for your farms that will of value to you."
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.256,2439.995,Because of sovereign immunity.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2439.995,2441.587,I think that's right.
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.001,2459.127,"Except for this Act sovereign immunity would protect the government from any action for the value of the blacksmith's shop, except for this Act the Indians couldn't sue for this $1,72,000, could they?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2459.127,2473.78,"That's right, but this Act while remedying the principle wrong does not remedy the delay that it took Congress to get around to passing the Act."
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.78,2480.784,Well that depends on what you think the extent the waiver was in term of using equitable and that kind of --
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2480.784,2490.48,"Well, at least I take it that the petitioners don't suggest that the Claims Commission Act provides their remedy."
1967.219,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.424,2517.443,"Except for sovereign immunity though, a contract like this would normally result in type litigation and the recovery of interest."
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2517.443,2520.291,Absolutely.
1967.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2525.725,2535.29,"Or the contract between private parties, authorized private parties to wait a 110 years and then sue and get the hold of it."
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2535.29,2539.422,Well I'd suppose you'd have a statute of limitations which we -- which the government has –-
1967.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2539.422,2540.322,What I say is --
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2540.322,2547.537,Or laches that's right.
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2547.537,2575.869,"Mr. Rifkind there have been a number of cases in which various Indian Tribes have alleged under the Indian Claims Act that the United States has wrongfully taken their land and haven't there been awards made to those Indian tribes some of them very large amount, relating to takings back in the 19th Century, is that right?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2575.869,2576.984,That's correct.
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2576.984,2581.347,And in any of those cases has interest been allowed?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2581.347,2584.645,Except for the two cases that have been given –-
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2584.645,2587.429,"I'm sorry, that's not the kind of case I am putting here."
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2587.429,2589.854,"Yes, I understand, in the general case no."
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2589.854,2601.783,"Despite the fact that those are in the sense of the way cases where land has been taken from the Indians in breach of sort a fiduciary duty, is it right?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2601.783,2606.664,Unless the claim could be squeezed into the Fifth Amendment interest has been denied?
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2606.664,2607.841,Well at least --
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2607.841,2608.248,They were Fifth Amendment.
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2608.248,2610.191,Is Indian cases Fifth Amendment cases?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2610.191,2610.751,No.
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2610.751,2646.39,"Alright so taking case from that I put, kind of case that I put to you, the law has grown up so that the Indians are given a sum of money under this Act, but they are not given interest dating back to the time of taking despite the fact that there is at least something resembling breach of fiduciary duty and that's part of this whole what I may refer to as sort of a package deal enacted by the Congress to -- in an attempt to alleviate the wrong that's been done to the Indians in the past, is that right?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2646.39,2653.469,"I think that's right sir, indeed I think there was a fairly careful appraisal of what the likely costs of legislation regarding the case --"
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2653.469,2671.495,"Well that's why, as I understand it both you and your advisory agree that in this case if there is nothing that you can't just define or spell out the specific language of this treaty, an obligation to pay interest there is no obligation?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2671.495,2672.066,That's exactly right.
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2672.066,2673.47,To pay interest.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2673.47,2675.905,Thank you sir.
1967.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2675.905,2683.661,What would be an affect on the [Inaudible]
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2683.661,2688.435,I suppose that that the past cases are water over the dam.
1967.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2688.435,2693.6,So there would be [Inaudible]
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2693.6,2704.036,"Well I am not sure whether it would involve splitting a cause of action, that's just the breaks in civil ligations usually."
1967.219,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2705.49,2708.239,[Inaudible] allowed by the Congress?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2708.239,2712.987,Yes I suppose the special legislation.
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2756.941,2763.696,"I just have this case that Justice Brown's opinion in this case before me, it wasn't all that clear."
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2778.107,2779.912,Something like that.
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2779.912,2784.259,I think this case would cause you considerable trouble?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2784.259,2798.111,"But there -- I don't think so, the critical difference is that there everyone knew when the treaty was entered into that the treasury was going to pay out 5% per annum."
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2798.111,2799.497,During the pleasure of Congress.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2799.497,2803.612,"During the pleasure of course everything is sir, it ends up that way."
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2803.612,2805.8,"No, not as a contract."
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2805.8,2806.421,That's true.
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2806.421,2816.841,"Something on [Inaudible] I guess that's not the correct word, but it is hardly an absolute right to receive 5% that the Chief's had, wasn't it?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2816.841,2820.82,"Right, I suppose there is a condition or something to point that never occurred."
1967.219,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2820.82,2825.655,Yeah and yet the Court said nonetheless it was a right?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,2825.655,2826.648,That's right.
1967.219,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3070.83,3091.409,"Well, there weren't [Inaudible] There is of course is a default in duty under 7 because they didn't realize the proceeds that were supposed to be administered under and in accordance with Article 7, of course it is a breach of the --"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3091.409,3097.32,"There was no independent misconduct is what I'm suggesting under Section 7, no independent --"
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3097.32,3108.722,"What misconduct over the years and not giving the Indians any benefit to alter the provision with the treaty, isn't that misconduct?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3121.501,3124.078,All I'm saying is I don't mean to --
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3124.078,3131.645,"All you are saying is a question, what is it if it is any misconduct?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3131.645,3137.404,"I don't mean to suggest for a minute that these Indians were not badly treated, they were."
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3167.655,3169.443,As to that --
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3169.443,3169.986,That's what this case is about.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3169.986,3173.085,Wasn't it misconduct there?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3173.085,3179.193,Well I can't -- I don't know what it means to say that it's a misconduct of Congress not to have passed the Indian claims.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3179.193,3191.534,"But you chose the word misconduct and said there was no misconduct, what do you call it?"
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3191.534,3203.333,"I suppose that we can say that Congress ought to have to passed this Act a long time ago, but I don't find that illuminating as to --"
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3203.333,3208.625,Or the President could have sold the land then and invested the money?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3208.625,3211.531,The land had long since been sold.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3219.88,3222.877,There have been a lot of Presidents in 100 years.
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3222.877,3223.454,I beg your pardon sir.
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3223.454,3228.426,There have been a lot of Presidents in 100 years who could have remedied that situation?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3228.426,3245.526,"Yes, I suppose that the critical thing is that Congress could have appropriated the money that was the difference long ago and it didn't, and no doubt about it."
1967.219,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3321.077,3324.953,Are you talking about the rights arising under the treaties?
1967.219,1,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3324.953,3346.179,"No, that was rights arising under an Act of Congress undertaken to pay for a ship that it has destroyed. He said Congress undertook to have a Court find the value of the ship that was destroyed, but the fact that you haven't had that ship for the last decade is not what Congress undertook to pay for."
1967.219,2,31181,jack_joseph,,3451.147,3453.784,I don't think I have a reply unless the Court is interested --
1967.219,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3453.784,3455.929,Very well.
