1994.93-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.059,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-714, U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Company v. Bonner Mall Partnership."
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,62.662,68.253,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1994.93-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.72,162.481,"Mr. Anderson, when you say vacatur, are you referring just to the judgment below, or are you referring also to the opinion, if there was an opinion below?"
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,162.481,165.808,We are referring to what in essence is the judgment below.
1994.93-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.255,190.642,"And you would leave it to some other rule or set of rules to decide whether the opinion should continue to have precedential value in the circuit, and that sort of thing?"
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,190.642,191.906,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-714,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,191.906,192.906,Thank you.
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,202.668,207.072,"I don't believe it would be the law of the circuit, Your Honor."
1994.93-714,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,210.212,212.103,So it's just like an interesting law review article hanging out there?
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,212.103,213.336,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.93-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,240.293,241.371,"Now, you've confused me."
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,247.12,247.979,We do care.
1994.93-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.979,248.837,"Yes, you do care."
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,248.837,251.226,"But we would leave it to another day, Your Honor, although we--"
1994.93-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.226,253.398,"Well, your position is that it has not precedential effect."
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,253.398,253.773,--That's correct.
1994.93-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.773,257.755,But I thought you answered just the opposite to me a moment ago.
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,264.847,269.157,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I must have misinterpreted your question."
1994.93-714,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,278.059,296.803,"Is there any reason why, say, the Ninth Circuit couldn't... consistent with your position why the Ninth Circuit couldn't have a rule that said, even though a judgment of our court which has been vacated pursuant to Munsingwear, nonetheless we will continue to regard our opinion in that case as a circuit precedent?"
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,296.803,298.614,"They could have such a rule, Your Honor."
1994.93-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.052,307.171,One frequently sees cases cited at least where they are vacated on other grounds.
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,320.964,323.932,"I believe that could be the case, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-714,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,338.208,341.597,"Mr. Anderson, may I ask you a preliminary question about Munsingwear?"
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,362.604,379.441,"We would contend, Your Honor, that the mootness to the extent it was created there, was created by the unilateral act, and that the reference to happenstance by the court in Munsingwear was not a description of what had happened, but was rather more of an offhand reference to--"
1994.93-714,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,379.441,381.252,A misdescription of what had happened?
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,381.252,383.829,"--Possibly a misdescription of what had happened, yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-714,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,403.649,409.788,Do you think it's fair to say that the court in Munsingwear did not view it the way you have just described it?
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,417.175,425.22,"Well, the explanation, Your Honor, I think is reflected in the subsequent decisions of this Court after Munsingwear was decided."
1994.93-714,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,434.511,437.681,"Well, yes, but we're now in effect saying, should we be doing that."
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,445.772,446.631,"--Yes, that is correct."
1994.93-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,446.631,464.609,"May I just ask... you see, I'm not sure your argument tracks your position in your briefs... is it your position that there should, we should announce a general rule that when there's a settlement there will always be a vacation of the judgment below, or is it to be decided on a casebycase determination?"
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,464.609,472.528,"Ultimately, as we have argued in our briefs, the decision whether to vacate is bottomed on discretion by this Court."
1994.93-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.396,489.302,I'm still a little puzzled as to what you're saying.
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,499.907,505.108,"--Well, there may be circumstances, Justice Stevens, where the Court would have to look at the particular facts."
1994.93-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.446,522.414,Why would that make any difference?
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,522.414,544.171,"--Because ultimately vacatur is premised on the exercise of discretion by this Court, and the interests promoted by vacatur, which are fairness and the prudential considerations that we have outlined, would not be promoted, I don't think, in a situation where the settlement was in fact not a settlement."
1994.93-714,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.35,576.516,"No, but it's willing to pay in the particular case, but it still doesn't like the general rule that the court announced, and that's... that... I really don't understand your position, but go ahead."
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,605.707,618.172,"--Well, Your Honor, in this instance, as the Court said in Munsingwear, one of the purposes of vacatur is to prevent the spawning of any legal consequences, and that would include law of the case."
1994.93-714,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,646.115,664.824,"--indicated that a court could adopt, say, the Ninth Circuit, a rule that vacated opinions to have precedential value, so even though you might prevail in a subsequent quasi collateral estoppel, there would be no collateral estoppel but you'd lose anyway under this hypothetical rule, which seems to me a very strange rule."
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,664.824,669.855,"--If there were litigation outside the Ninth Circuit, Your Honor, I'm not sure that would be the case."
1994.93-714,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.072,672.588,"No, I'm talking about, assume you're back in the Ninth Circuit."
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,672.588,675.086,--We would be in that situation.
1994.93-714,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,677.055,680.569,"But no estoppel, even in the Ninth Circuit, because that requires a judgment."
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,680.569,681.101,That's correct.
1994.93-714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,692.47,709.541,"Well, under your theory that it's within the discretion of the court to decide whether to vacate the judgment or not, if the court were to decide not to vacate this judgment after the settlement, is that an abuse of the court's discretion?"
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,709.541,712.181,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1994.93-714,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,721.208,728.847,So you just leave it entirely open to the court to weigh the factors one way or another and decide what to do?
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,728.847,751.337,"Subject to the general rule that we suggest that vacatur upon mootness where the mootness occurs as a result of settlement is generally appropriate for the reasons that it promotes the values that we have described in our briefs... fairness between the parties, and the prudential concerns that the judicial system must have with regard to the development of precedent."
1994.93-714,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,751.337,756.647,"Well, in this case, what possible grounds, under your rule, would a court have for refusing to vacate?"
1994.93-714,0,17388,bradford_anderson,,756.647,759.693,In this particular case?
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1215.883,1230.938,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1994.93-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1243.511,1247.26,"You're talking, then, not just about judgments, you're talking about opinions also?"
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1247.26,1249.509,Judgments should be vacated.
1994.93-714,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1255.616,1258.568,"You don't agree, then, with your colleague who just spoke?"
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1258.568,1259.068,I do not.
1994.93-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1284.338,1293.664,"Mr. Kneedler, you're right that we've done it often, but almost all the times we've done it, we've done it by way of a per curiam opinion or summary disposition."
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1310.781,1314.42,"Well, several points I'd like to make in response to that."
1994.93-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1370.462,1373.553,"Has the issue been litigated before, as far as you know?"
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1373.553,1374.553,--I think in general not.
1994.93-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.003,1385.644,So this is really the first time we're confronting the issue in an adversary context?
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1385.644,1391.468,The first time the Court has certainly chosen to argue--
1994.93-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.468,1393.14,--standing up and arguing both sides of the case.
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1393.14,1410.68,"--Yes, but my point is that in Munsingwear itself the issue was litigated completely, and at that time the Court was relying on cases that involved settlement, and the Court's consistent practice since then has showed that it is in fact a settled rule, and we see no reason to depart from that."
1994.93-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1410.68,1412.99,What do you mean by litigated completely in Munsingwear?
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1412.99,1421.315,"Well, the question of what the proper disposition of a lower court judgment should be when a case becomes moot was--"
1994.93-714,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.315,1423.346,The parties took opposing positions on the question?
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1423.346,1424.111,--They did.
1994.93-714,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.427,1458.051,"Mr. Kneedler, I'm not sure I have your answer to Justice Scalia's question."
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1465.361,1470.733,"My understanding is the parties filed briefs on the merits, and it was heard on certiorari."
1994.93-714,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.356,1478.387,Is that not a case that became moot after we had granted certiorari?
1994.93-714,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1478.387,1480.245,--No.
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,1950.493,1956.319,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1994.93-714,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2064.995,2074.132,"What about when the winner throws in the towel, when the winner says I'm afraid what the Supreme Court might do with this, so I'm giving up?"
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2074.132,2089.11,"Well, in that situation, I don't think that would... if the winner caves in during the appellate process, I don't think that in any way moots the... well, you're saying if he just pays the judgment, or does the... does whatever the other party requests."
1994.93-714,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2106.869,2117.13,"And makes it a condition... then they have a settlement, and part of the settlement is that the winner is going to give up that victory, so that the case is not decided on appeal."
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2117.13,2142.34,"--Well, then I think you're getting right back into a stipulated vacatur situation, not as in the record of this case, but on the record of, for instance, the Izumi situation, where you have... as soon as you go down that road, you're getting to a stipulated vacatur between the parties, and that is not an external cause, or an external grounds that I believe would justify vacatur under those circumstances."
1994.93-714,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.34,2146.822,"Mr. Elsaesser, you mentioned a moment ago Karcher v. May."
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2155.818,2187.852,"Well, I don't disagree that that was a situation where there was a loss of standing, Mr. Chief Justice, but I do argue that there is no effective difference between the appellant in Karcher simply declining to proceed to go any further and a situation here where, as a result of the settlement agreement between Bonner Mall and U.S. Bank, the petitioner in this case, the appellant in a lower appellate court situation, simply declines to go any further."
1994.93-714,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2197.239,2206.814,"Yes, but certainly in Karcher v. May there was nothing consensual about it as to the party who was seeking to appeal, but it was said to have no standing."
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2206.814,2235.426,"No, there was nothing consensual in not having any standing, but when the appeal ends, there was no reason to go back down and vacate the lower court opinions, so in that situation I think that's the same result you gain in this particular case, where the bank makes a conscious decision that as part of the settlement, or by settling, by their act of settling they moot the appeal."
1994.93-714,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2238.035,2239.439,"Well, the effect may be the same."
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2241.283,2243.079,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, it is."
1994.93-714,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2243.079,2248.094,"As a practical matter, why do you oppose vacating the judgment here?"
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2248.094,2249.108,Your Honor--
1994.93-714,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2249.108,2250.951,Why does your client oppose it?
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2253.857,2261.9,"--Your Honor, we oppose vacatur in this setting, in the post mootness, essentially motion before this Court for vacatur."
1994.93-714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.083,2321.533,Is it clear that the petitioner here would not be bound by the decision below insofar as res judicata or collateral estoppel effect is concerned?
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2321.533,2335.573,"Your Honor, we agree with the Government in one respect, that if the Court grants the vacatur in this situation, it takes away the precedential and preclusive effects of the decisions below."
1994.93-714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.573,2335.948,I'm not talking about precedent now.
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2341.118,2345.521,"I think it would have to dispute of those, too, if there was a vacatur."
1994.93-714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.521,2345.708,"No, I understand."
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2350.27,2355.253,I don't believe there would be true collateral estoppel because it was a pure issue of law.
1994.93-714,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2358.157,2362.234,But doesn't preclusion apply to issues of law as well as of fact?
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2362.234,2363.64,"--Yes, they do, Your Honor."
1994.93-714,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.64,2364.077,All right.
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2376.994,2397.017,"I don't believe, Your Honor, that Mendoza would go so far as to preclude... if this Court vacates the rulings below, as far as they want them to have vacated, I don't believe that that would have a preclusive effect in another case in another State by a U.S. bank from raising a pure issue of law of whether that applies."
1994.93-714,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2397.017,2398.75,What about in this very case?
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2411.261,2434.517,"Well, certainly I think in that situation you would have the result that vacatur would allow them to argue the legal issue again and respond, as they have responded in argument, that the precedential value of the Ninth Circuit opinion was only... well, it really becomes advisory only, no different than any other kind of persuasive authority."
1994.93-714,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2434.517,2445.155,"But if you did have a litigation of fact involved here, what would be the res judicata effect if we go your way... collateral estoppel effect if we go your way?"
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2445.155,2449.386,"If you had an issue of fact, then I think it would have binding res judicata effect."
1994.93-714,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2451.23,2462.287,So you're not arguing that that is mitigated by the fact that a court later on could in fact consider the settlement as a reason not to give estoppel effect?
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2462.287,2465.286,--I'm not sure if I understand that particular point.
1994.93-714,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2471.096,2474.048,"And there would be no way to get out of it on your view, and there should be no way to get out of it."
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2474.048,2474.61,There should be no way.
1994.93-714,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2474.61,2476.36,They didn't have to settle.
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2476.36,2485.028,"They did not have to settle, but in addition to that, there are no extrinsic grounds to vacate the lower court decision."
1994.93-714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2511.376,2513.141,What if that happens?
1994.93-714,2,30193,john_ford_elsaesser_jr,,2529.338,2534.275,"--Well, that was precisely the case in Izumi, and I think that really is even worse."
1994.93-714,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.356,2572.29,"So it isn't just the parties' expectation that you're asking to be defended here, but rather the integrity of the process."
