1961.46,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.888,"Maurice A. Hutcheson, Petitioner, versus United States."
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,14.779,18.004,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.46,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,289.748,293.375,How was that different from Blaier's refusal of --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,293.375,299.028,"There are only two differences, this petitioner added in denial of due process of law."
1961.46,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,299.028,299.346,I see.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,299.346,305.283,"Now, there may also have been a difference, he was the president and the other fellow was the second vice-president."
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,341.7,343.813,(Inaudible)
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,343.813,346.861,"Yes, they were, Your Honor."
1961.46,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,397.797,401.265,Was that contemporaneous with the -- with the hearing itself?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,401.265,402.818,It was part of the hearing.
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,428.81,430.017,Where is that?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,430.017,436.402,That is at page 165 of the record.
1961.46,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,505.64,509.612,Doesn't the last question come first?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,509.612,511.851,Possibly so.
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,915.417,916.214,Where is that?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,916.214,919.868,That is at page 26 of petitioner's brief.
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,931.008,940.617,"Colonel Wiener, the -- the indictment which was actually pending involved a charge not of obstruction of justice, but rather of land fraud, did it not?"
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,940.617,960.611,"That is correct and the -- and the asserted conspiracy to obstruct justice was the effort to head-off in 1957 an indictment in the Lake County for these lands frauds, and that the indictment was returned about six months later in the adjoining County of Marion."
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,960.611,961.787,For obstructing justice -- the charge in --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,961.787,964.076,"No, on the substantive charges."
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,964.076,964.47,Right.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,964.602,968.82,The substantive charges were conspiracy and bribery in connection with a highway method --
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,968.82,969.979,Selling land to the state?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,969.979,978.316,The obstruction of justice was the effort to -- alleged efforts to head-off indictment for that offense in Lake County.
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,978.316,981.195,Now was there ever an indictment for obstructing justice?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,981.195,989.808,"No, there was not, but bribery which according to the Committee's report was involved, bribery is a crime in Indiana."
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1008.167,1021.416,"Now, the very purpose of the Committee, it's very authorizing resolution, created it for the purpose of investigating criminal activity among (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1021.416,1028.888,"Yes, and I will -- I will at the third point which -- now, two members of the Court think I'm taking up out of order."
1961.46,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1038.669,1040.06,That's an attack on the resolution?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1040.06,1041.797,That is an attack on the resolution.
1961.46,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1042.472,1047.175,"May I ask Mr. Wiener, has this -- the state indictment ever been tried?"
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1047.175,1048.494,"Yes, it has been tried."
1961.46,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1049.66,1053.516,And I -- your point is that -- perhaps I'm confused.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1053.516,1053.823,"Well, my --"
1961.46,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1053.823,1061.73,"That -- that -- while, the Committee you say, was actually trying an offense."
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1066.51,1066.677,That is correct.
1961.46,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1066.677,1072.332,-- that the facts might have been adduced at the trial on the indictment was actually was returned?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1072.332,1108.299,"Exactly and to that extent, they were pre-trying the pending criminal case because there's a common ground between the parties that affirmative answers, any of these questions as to the alleged Lake County activities would have gone in at the Marion County trial, and therefore, to that extent, if there was a pretrial of a pending criminal case, and when the prosecution says, page 40 of United States' brief, “It distorts the record to say that the Committee attempted to pre-try a criminal case,” I submit that if there's any distortion, it is not on the part of petitioner or his counsel."
1961.46,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1108.299,1110.012,"Colonel, may I ask you this question."
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1119.996,1120.197,The finding --
1961.46,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1120.197,1122.47,-- before or after the trial under the indictment?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1122.47,1127.775,"I'm pretty sure it was before, Your Honor, let me just check."
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1342.786,1347.166,(Inaudible)
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1347.166,1350.275,He did claim a Fifth Amendment privilege.
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1350.275,1350.643,(Inaudible)
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1350.643,1350.991,He did.
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1356.158,1362.866,I am asking you (Inaudible) --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1362.866,1363.517,"No, Your Honor."
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1369.66,1382.109,(Inaudible) -- the committee had to recognize?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1382.109,1386.653,"Well, the Committee recognized it as to the other witnesses."
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1431.809,1437.51,(Inaudible)
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1437.51,1445.946,That is the point I am coming to in a -- in great detail on -- on my next point and I'm practically there.
1961.46,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1482.187,1496.949,"Colonel Wiener, what difference would there be in pre-trying the issue in advance of an indictment over trying the issue before a legislative committee after an indictment?"
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1496.949,1499.551,I think both are equally bad.
1961.46,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1509.244,1521.899,"So then, this argument would mean that a legislative committee could not inquire a bad conduct or investigate it, if it was likely later to result in an indictment."
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1521.899,1523.21,"No, I don't say that."
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1589.276,1599.847,But wouldn't your argument Colonel Wiener lead to a -- the conclusion that the -- that this resolution creating this Committee was -- was improper that --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1599.847,1603.67,That -- that is one of my arguments which is my third point.
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1604.883,1605.872,Alright.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1605.872,1616.001,And that is that it is a violation of due process to force a witness before a congressional committee to subject himself to penalties.
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1805.592,1808.735,Do you think that would (Inaudible)?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1808.735,1814.86,I would say it was instinct with constitutional by someone who grew up with the constitution.
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1814.86,1816.283,Overtones.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,1816.617,1831.439,"Overtones, undertones, I say precisely similar because in the Saline Bank case, the United States sought a money judgment, it was a suit in equity because of fraud."
1961.46,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2010.815,2014.958,"Ballmann against Fagin was a claim of “privilege against self-incrimination,” isn't it?"
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2014.958,2017.564,Yes.
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2078.315,2079.239,What makes you (Inaudible) --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2079.239,2084.166,The content.
1961.46,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2084.166,2090.353,What do you rely on in the Saline Bank case (Inaudible) --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2090.353,2123.979,"Well, I think it expresses a general rule offense and it's -- to me very interesting in dealing with all these contempt of Congress cases that the basic unfairness of the Murdock rule that one sovereignty can force a person into the jail of a coordinate sovereignty is so unfair that most of the lower courts' reading sometimes between the lines and sometimes the line themselves would like to get away from it and I think that is an expression."
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2160.688,2161.767,Refresh -- refresh my recollection.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2167.006,2175.062,"Well, the Delaney case was a federal prosecution and a federal legislative committee."
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2185.736,2186.6,(Inaudible) --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2186.6,2187.693,-- asked for continuance.
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2187.693,2197.667,-- and no occasions of (Inaudible) if you just tell me whether in setting aside the conviction was on the ground of due process rather than the internal power that a federal court had --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2197.667,2203.642,I -- I am not prepared to say that it was -- it was definitely on due process ground.
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2263.936,2287.388,"But as you rightly indicated a little while ago to Justice Harlan's question that the Fifth Amendment has several prohibitions and several restrictions on governmental power, and when those framers put that in presumably, they didn't mean to be repetitive in having said self-incrimination, then go on and say, “Due process and due process equals self-incrimination.”"
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2287.388,2290.916,"Well, they were repetitive when they put in the guarantee of jury trial placed."
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2291.758,2293.188,Wouldn't that be (Inaudible) -- a different story --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2293.188,2293.922,"Well, I --"
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2293.922,2295.263,"But anyhow, within -- with the Fifth Amendment."
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2295.263,2296.479,Yes.
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2296.479,2299.26,"And in the Fifth Amendment, there are separate semi-colons (Inaudible) --"
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2299.26,2300.471,"Well, that -- I understand that."
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2300.471,2309.583,"And what you're saying is because due process has an element of fairness and self-incrimination has an element of fairness, therefore, they're two equally charged."
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2309.583,2309.733,Well --
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2309.733,2312.524,And that's lead them -- legal arithmetic nor arithmetic.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2312.524,2316.207,"Well, I think the basic unfairness here is --"
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2316.207,2318.455,I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not saying it may be unfair but --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2318.455,2319.672,No.
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2320.0,2325.283,-- and I'm suggesting that everything that's unfair isn't necessarily violative of Due Process --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2325.283,2334.647,"The unfairness here is by making him -- by making him invoke the privilege against self-incrimination to his own detriment, because what the Committee --"
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2334.647,2339.431,"Well, but what if a man doesn't choose to, he may go to jail or if he'd asserted that he wouldn't be going to jail."
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2339.431,2354.588,"Well, the answer here -- they -- what the Committee did here was to say to the witness, “Look, you either answer or you plead your privilege against self-incrimination which means to us that you're guilty, and which will hurt you.”"
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2366.862,2369.819,It all depends on whether the due clause there's difference?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2369.819,2381.939,"Well, I think due process includes -- properly includes self-incrimination, particularly where self-incrimination itself would involve efficiency."
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2381.939,2383.761,But you have to come to that point?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2383.761,2384.793,"Yes, definitely."
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2385.07,2386.264,"Yes, come to that point."
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2386.264,2386.657,No question about that.
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2386.657,2391.409,Not merely -- not merely circle around unfairness.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2391.409,2391.791,"No, I --"
1961.46,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2391.791,2397.104,“Life is full of unfairness for which the Constitution affords no protection.”
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2397.104,2414.131,The unfairness here is to invoke self-incrimination with itself be appended and that brings me to the question of whether these -- this inquiry dealt with any proper legislative purpose and there we say no on two grounds.
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2489.866,2503.501,"Well, it's certainly possible that they might find that activities which are criminal on the state law had been engaged in and that the object of a possible outcome of their investigation might be the --"
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2503.501,2503.915,"Well, if criminal --"
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2503.915,2506.264,-- legisla -- sponsorship of a federal legislation.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2506.264,2512.414,If criminal in that authorizing resolution means state criminal --
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2512.414,2512.591,Yes.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2512.591,2519.655,-- then of course the witness is free to plead state self-incrimination or denial of state due process.
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2546.379,2547.522,I don't quite follow that.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2547.522,2548.078,Well --
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2548.078,2550.844,Why you must make that assumption?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2551.997,2552.201,"Here, they --"
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2552.201,2552.948,-- the activity was criminal under state --
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2552.948,2553.945,-- the question here --
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2553.945,2555.921,"-- not -- state, not federal law."
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2555.921,2559.318,The question here is the state federal relationship as to --
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2559.318,2559.626,Yes.
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2559.626,2560.868,-- protecting the witnesses.
1961.46,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2567.821,2568.89,In the authorizing resolution?
1961.46,0,24788,frederick_bernays_wiener,,2568.89,2579.615,"Yes, then the witness can say, “Well look, if you're going to investigate state criminal activities, why -- I don't have to answer questions that are going to hurt me in state criminal prosecutions.”"
1961.46,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2829.19,2830.763,Mr. Solicitor General.
1961.46,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2830.763,2835.262,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.46,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3056.096,3073.008,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask whether this petitioner in any portion of the statement before the Committee did say to the Committee that his reason was the same as that given by Mr. Blaier?"
1961.46,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3073.008,3097.912,"I -- his counsel at the time petitioner was questioned, which followed the questioning of Blaier, did say that he wanted to correct the misapprehension which the press had gained, he didn't say the Committee had gained, but which the press had gained, and that Blaier was not invoking the privilege against self-incrimination."
1961.46,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3152.629,3167.686,"Well did he say in at -- at any place, that the reason he didn't want to testify was because it would compel him to give evidence that would help the prosecution in the indictment which --"
1961.46,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3167.686,3168.313,Yes.
