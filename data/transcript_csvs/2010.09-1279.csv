2010.09-1279,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 09-1279, Federal Communications Commission v. AT&T, Inc.--"
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,10.039,12.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1279,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,62.84,69.827,"Isn't it true that there are contexts in the law in which the word ""personal"" is used to refer to a corporation?"
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,74.648,81.802,"There are -- the term ""personal"" is sometimes used as a term of art, and I think personal jurisdiction is one of those."
2010.09-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,148.446,151.262,What about -- what about personal appearances?
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,151.262,157.183,"--A personal appearance, I think that -- that supports our position as well."
2010.09-1279,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,170.025,178.298,"Well, in ordinary speech, the term ""personal"" is not -- the term ""person"" is not used to refer to a corporation."
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,203.831,217.173,"Well, I think that -- that point actually reinforces our position, because although ""person"" is used in certain legal contexts to refer to artificial persons and corporations and the like, ""personal"" is not."
2010.09-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,233.866,237.718,"Mr. Yang, can we go back first to this."
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,260.314,260.964,--Correct.
2010.09-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,267.051,287.365,"How does the -- does the Commission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee, as distinguished from the corporation?"
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,287.365,289.066,How does it do that?
2010.09-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,289.066,289.6,Yes.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,289.6,293.535,"Well, I -- I don't think the touchstone is necessarily embarrassment."
2010.09-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.57,355.176,"Well, in that instance does the corporation have standing to raise that objection on the employee's behalf?"
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,355.176,374.672,"Well, I think the corporation to the -- in a reverse FOIA case, for instance, which what is we have here, where the corporation is alleging that the government's decisionmaking process is arbitrary and capricious, it has Article III standing to resist the disclosure of documents."
2010.09-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,381.076,386.647,"Well, as an administrative matter, can the corporation make a FOIA objection on behalf of its employees."
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,386.647,397.788,"--It can make an objection on its own behalf, which is to say that the government has not properly gone through the decision-making process."
2010.09-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,397.788,404.359,That's the next -- that was going to be my next question: So the corporation can raise FOIA on its own behalf?
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,404.359,410.013,It's actually -- let me take a step back.
2010.09-1279,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,516.949,522.584,"Privacy certainly isn't as limited as you argue ""person"", ""personal"", is."
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,532.042,543.147,"I think the term ""privacy"", its ordinary meaning, not the only meaning but the ordinary and the commonly used meaning, does invoke individual concepts."
2010.09-1279,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,553.122,555.824,You don't have confidential property or secret property.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,557.024,557.874,"--Well, true."
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.113,622.599,"Our cases assert, do they not, that the exceptions to FOIA should be narrowly construed?"
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,622.599,623.551,There are cases--
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.551,624.734,And we've said that on a number of cases.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,624.734,629.538,"--In certain contexts, this Court has indicated that exceptions are to be narrowly construed."
2010.09-1279,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,673.032,678.286,"Suppose Congress had used the phrase ""privacy of a person"", ""privacy of any person""."
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,679.721,687.125,"Our argument would be a little different, particularly in the context of Exemptions 6 and 7(C), where the phrase would be"
2010.09-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,713.659,715.228,What about the Privacy Act?
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,720.965,721.382,--Correct.
2010.09-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,721.382,722.365,--not artificial beings.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,726.317,728.519,"Well, it actually uses both phrases."
2010.09-1279,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,777.6,779.283,Can I ask you a question.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,811.671,815.873,"Well, I think we disagree, and I think this is why."
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.44,843.042,I don't understand that.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,871.792,877.096,"--Well, if you were to get -- after using all the normal tools that the court does and you're on--"
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.096,878.631,--That's what ambiguity means.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,879.714,883.933,"--That's usually a very rare instance, that you are exactly at equipoise."
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.403,889.787,--Okay.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,894.724,895.657,"Well, we think--"
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,895.657,899.544,--that exceptions to FOIA are to be narrowly construed.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,901.077,903.162,--We do not embrace that principle.
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.162,904.362,Even though we did?
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,904.362,910.983,"Well, we think that those cases -- there are two lines of this Court's decisions."
2010.09-1279,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,937.467,942.62,Your argument is based on a case that will come before us.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,954.512,962.666,"Well, the government has broader interests beyond a single case and we think that, again, we're not embracing strict construction in this case."
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.82,971.105,"Well, I'm not going to help the government's position if the government doesn't want to be helped."
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,974.474,996.672,"And we accept that in this case, and we think that the language of the text, particularly when read in context in light of the statutory history, and particularly when you take a look at what's gone on since 1974 -- I mean, in the more than 35 years since, there has been uniform agreement that Exemption 6 and 7(C) apply only to individuals."
2010.09-1279,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,996.672,1001.576,"I suppose -- I suppose families have rights of personal privacy, don't they?"
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1001.576,1011.515,"Well, in certain contexts family members, as this Court decided in Favish, can have a right to personal privacy."
2010.09-1279,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1043.67,1048.205,"So in some contexts -- in some contexts, personal privacy does go beyond the individual?"
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1048.205,1050.371,"--No, still it is individual."
2010.09-1279,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1053.173,1054.359,Aggregations of individuals?
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1054.359,1054.825,"Well, no."
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.284,1070.884,Excuse me.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1097.102,1097.419,--Correct.
2010.09-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.952,1099.888,"But as individuals, not as the corporation."
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1099.888,1103.44,"--As individuals, because the information pertains to them."
2010.09-1279,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1265.112,1284.506,"So if an individual has been -- individual human being has been investigated by the FBI and a FOIA request is made for records related to that investigation, would the name of the individual not be turned over?"
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1284.506,1291.762,"--Well, if someone is asking for an investigation of Tony Yang--"
2010.09-1279,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1291.762,1292.345,Yes.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1292.345,1307.003,"--Our -- I don't -- I can't say definitively, but I think I can probably answer that, that even answering the question of whether there is a responsive record answers the question."
2010.09-1279,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1307.003,1308.388,"Well, that's the point."
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1346.813,1353.217,"Well, the key point is that we don't deny that corporations have some interest in confidentiality that exists out there."
2010.09-1279,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1365.69,1367.456,It's hard to think they pled guilty already.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1372.424,1378.062,"--Well, to be fair to AT&T, there was a settlement agreement in which they did not admit any wrongdoing."
2010.09-1279,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1378.062,1381.43,--But that presupposes some sort of investigation.
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1382.716,1384.116,That is public knowledge.
2010.09-1279,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1430.362,1431.229,"Thank you, Mr. Yang."
2010.09-1279,0,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1431.229,1431.696,Thank you.
2010.09-1279,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1431.696,1442.004,Mr. Klineberg.
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1442.004,1445.556,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1279,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1479.11,1500.957,"Do you include in this the people, the persons that you say are shielded by this privacy exemption, as Mr. Yang said, foreign governments, State and local governments, those have all?"
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1504.595,1506.795,"Justice Ginsburg, they do."
2010.09-1279,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1535.114,1558.562,"Can you give us an idea of -- the corporation has been shielded by Exemption 4 for its confidential, financial information, trade secrets; and its employees have been protected under Exemption 7."
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1574.755,1580.143,"Justice Ginsburg, we -- I could give you two categories or kinds of examples."
2010.09-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1605.626,1606.41,Excuse me.
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1616.515,1642.599,"--Well, Justice Scalia, the -- the answer is simply that these were communications, conversations, that were occurring with an expectation of privacy by the individuals involved on behalf of their employer, and to the extent that they could be used to harm the reputation or the customer goodwill of -- of the company, they do indeed have a -- a personal privacy interest--"
2010.09-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.599,1646.134,Anything that hurts the -- the -- the image or the goodwill of the company?
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1646.134,1666.798,"--Your Honor, everything that with -- that is intended to be private is certainly subject to the balancing that we're asking for under Exemption 7(C), indeed that Congress provided; that if it is -- it's an interest in personal privacy, then it is to be balanced to determine whether the disclosure of that document is unwarranted."
2010.09-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.798,1674.053,"Mr. Klineberg, can you give me any example of -- your -- your brief talks a lot about the adjective ""personal""."
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1721.766,1735.942,"Your Honor, as Justice Alito asked my -- my colleague earlier, the -- the whole concept of -- of ""person"" as including a corporation would surprise many people, the proverbial person on the street."
2010.09-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.942,1736.376,Yes.
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1763.343,1768.294,"Your Honor, we're -- we're not aware of that phrase being used certainly in any statutory context--"
2010.09-1279,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1768.294,1779.333,"But you were about to give a second example of where, even though it hasn't, ""personal privacy"" hasn't been used in the media."
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1789.207,1812.739,"--Well, there's a -- there's a sub-example within that category which is the disparaging of an important customer, some unpleasant comments about an important customer of the corporation that could then be used quite -- quite clearly by a -- by a competitor to -- to harm the goodwill of the -- of the corporation with respect to that customer."
2010.09-1279,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1854.733,1856.666,Do you think it's -- how does that work?
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1877.496,1891.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe the answer is in most cases yes, that in -- that the identity of the -- the specific speaker and any identifying information corresponding to him or her would be protected."
2010.09-1279,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1891.589,1900.695,"Why is it such a big deal, then, to extend that to the organization as a whole, if the individual's privacy is already going to be protected?"
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1900.695,1912.836,"Indeed, Your Honor, I think that is -- that is our position, that -- that the personal privacy of the corporation is -- is affected by such disclosure."
2010.09-1279,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1912.836,1913.321,No.
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1927.698,1928.331,Right.
2010.09-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.124,1944.541,Are there any examples that you have?
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,1981.749,1989.772,"Well, Justice Breyer, one of the -- one of the things that has puzzled us in this case is why -- why it has taken 35 years--"
2010.09-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1989.772,2001.579,"Well, one reason might be that this has really never been a problem because all the legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these organizations that have interests in privacy are actually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here."
2010.09-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.579,2006.297,Another reason might be that personal -- nobody ever thought that personal privacy would cover this.
2010.09-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2006.297,2006.931,This may be the first.
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2020.207,2025.325,"--Your Honor, we haven't found anything specific to the -- in response to your question."
2010.09-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2063.181,2075.406,"One possible reason you don't find them is because it is very rare that a law enforcement agency is going to try to subpoena the top strategy of the -- of the NRDC, confidential strategy."
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2094.385,2095.185,--Right.
2010.09-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.185,2096.421,I'd like to know about the example.
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2097.354,2101.289,"Well, the -- the first one was comments about a regulator--"
2010.09-1279,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.289,2101.889,They're worried about saying something mean about a regulator.
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2110.912,2117.167,"--Your Honor, it is a -- I cannot point you to specific examples."
2010.09-1279,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.191,2162.696,Is that a reason to change what was the understanding of Exemption 7?
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2175.254,2188.197,"Well, actually, Justice Ginsburg, at the time of the '74 amendments the only existing attorney general memorandum was that of Attorney General Clark, which read ""personal privacy""--"
2010.09-1279,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2188.197,2193.649,I'm talking about the -- Attorney General Levi.
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2193.649,2201.738,"--Right, and that -- that was issued subsequent to the amendments in 1974, and that was an -- an interpretive gloss on the recent amendments."
2010.09-1279,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2201.738,2202.773,"Yes, that's what I meant."
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2202.773,2203.123,Right.
2010.09-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.735,2240.03,"But if Attorney General Levy's description, which was -- which was issued for the purpose of telling all the agencies of the Federal government what this new statute meant -- and it had a lot of ambiguities in it -- if that was wrong about -- about this subject, you would have thought somebody would have objected."
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2253.206,2262.329,"Well, Your Honor, the -- Attorney General Levy's memorandum did not go into a long discussion or description of the analysis."

2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2313.012,2319.082,"--Well, Justice Scalia, our -- our burden is to -- is to defend our view of the statute."
2010.09-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2319.082,2324.802,"Well, but if you're asking the government to show that the -- there was an intent to exclude corporations, I don't think that's their burden."
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2330.706,2338.645,"I agree, Your Honor, that we are -- our burden is to demonstrate to you why the words ""personal privacy"" in the statute apply to corporations."
2010.09-1279,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2344.949,2354.072,"Counsel, your central argument is that because ""person"" is defined to include corporation, ""personal"" in the same statute must include corporate."
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2388.126,2401.386,"--Mr. Chief Justice, let me try to explain precisely what our proposed rule of construction is, because I think there's been some confusion and I -- and I think the government has -- has not properly characterized it, and certainly in their reply brief."
2010.09-1279,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.989,2479.97,"Mr. Klineberg, you have read the brief of the Project on Government Oversight where they give dozens and dozens of examples to show that, overwhelmingly, ""personal"" is used to describe an individual, not an artificial being."
2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2484.123,2496.447,"--Justice Ginsburg, we do not dispute that personal is often, even many, many times, used to describe an individual and can only be understood in that context."

2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2566.693,2605.152,"Your Honor, we don't believe our reading does any -- any damage to this Court's jurisprudence in Exemption 6, and the -- the simple reason is that while the words 6 do mean -- and we agree with the Attorney General Clark in this -- do mean that -- the same thing as it means in Exemption 7(C), but because -- precisely for the reason you said, Justice Sotomayor -- the personnel, medical, and similar files limits the likely scope of that privacy interest to individual, natural -- natural persons."

2010.09-1279,1,25581,geoffrey_m_klineberg,,2635.004,2645.444,"Well, Your Honor, as this Court said in the Washington Post case, the understanding of similar files is defined by the two benchmarks that are expressly provided, right?"
