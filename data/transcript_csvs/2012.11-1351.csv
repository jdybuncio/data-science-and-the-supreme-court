2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,7.704,10.439,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,70.06,75.064,"Mr. Feldman, but it says first for purposes of this section."
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,93.324,95.009,"No, Your Honor, that's not right."
2012.11-1351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,181.865,184.733,"In the Veterans Administration, it doesn't say that, does it?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,184.733,198.16,"The Veterans Administration -- originally, the original Veterans Administration statute, which was from about 1965, doesn't have this 1089(e) intentional tort exception at all in it."
2012.11-1351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,249.526,273.724,"What would -- what do you do, if anything, about those of us, I hope more than one, who actually look at legislative history and the House and Senate Report, the Senate Report says subsection (e) would nullify a provision of the Tort Claims Act which would otherwise exclude any action for assault and battery."
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,293.522,294.605,Right.
2012.11-1351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,339.353,344.988,I don't quite understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg on the for purposes of this section.
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,371.638,373.99,"Well, I don't think that that's right."
2012.11-1351,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,441.134,451.776,One of the strongest arguments by your adversary has to do with the incongruity between these claims and the Westfall ruling by this Court.
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,473.622,474.055,Right.
2012.11-1351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.876,533.994,Why would Congress want to treat them differently?
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,533.994,534.68,Right.
2012.11-1351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.567,576.09,But why did they feel the need here to assure adequate remedies for tort victims where they did not in the Westfall Act?
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,587.481,587.915,Right.
2012.11-1351,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,638.663,642.132,"Well, maybe we could address this in slightly more concrete terms."
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,667.183,667.95,--That's correct.
2012.11-1351,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,667.95,669.017,Why would Congress want that?
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,669.017,677.472,"The reason they'd want it is this: In the first situation, that really arose -- that problem came with the Tort Claims Act when it was first enacted in 1946."
2012.11-1351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,757.874,777.404,"In law review commentaries and maybe in lower courts' opinion, is there -- is it fair to say that the weight of authority is to criticize the battery-negligence distinction as being productive of litigation and not really making a lot of sense?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,777.404,792.248,"--I think that is fair to say, and, you know, States -- a lot of States have dealt with this by dealing in statutory -- in statutes, not in the common law development, so they could kind of rationalize the system and say, look, this is the kinds of claims you're going to have."
2012.11-1351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,826.937,866.046,"Mr. Feldman, do I understand the mechanics of this right that if the injured person sues the United States directly, that suit would fail because the battery exclusion would apply, but it's only by suing the officer, the doctor, and then getting the United States substituted that the battery exception is abrogated; is that right?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,866.046,867.914,"No, I don't believe that that's correct."
2012.11-1351,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,903.069,905.137,Are there any -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,939.177,946.931,"If it would be an assault or battery that was committed by -- within the scope of the professional's employment, then it would be."
2012.11-1351,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,971.581,977.052,This exception you're talking about is regularly applied in the lower courts?
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,977.052,978.402,I beg your pardon?
2012.11-1351,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,978.402,981.087,"In the lower courts, this determination is regularly made?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,981.087,995.181,"The scope of employment determination is made every day, because that is made -- that is applicable throughout in any kind of respondeat superior situation whenever the employer of the medical professional is sued and that kind of thing, or nonmedical professional for that matter."
2012.11-1351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.181,1001.5,"When the government removes the case, it concedes that point, doesn't it, normally?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1014.442,1015.142,That's correct.
2012.11-1351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.435,1060.289,"What was that case, where no action against the United States is available?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1060.289,1062.206,"--That would be a case, for example--"
2012.11-1351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.206,1065.943,Not by reason of the battery?
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1065.943,1071.312,"--No, it wouldn't be -- if Congress didn't have this provision in the statute, it would have been by reason -- that would have been."
2012.11-1351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1071.312,1071.797,"Yes, yes."
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1071.797,1075.816,"Another one would be a foreign tort, which is also another exception under the Tort Claims Act--"
2012.11-1351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1075.816,1076.566,I see.
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1076.566,1078.918,"--a discretionary function case, and there are some in the medical context."
2012.11-1351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.918,1079.567,I got you.
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1079.567,1080.886,Or one of the other exceptions.
2012.11-1351,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1103.466,1113.091,"Now, the government has an alternative interpretation and I know you think it's wrong, but would you go further and say that it's not a plausible interpretation?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1113.091,1114.408,I would.
2012.11-1351,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1153.783,1159.151,"But it wasn't the interpretation adopted by the district court and by the Ninth Circuit, which you still say is implausible."
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1159.151,1160.27,--I think so.
2012.11-1351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1202.863,1236.853,"Mr. Feldman, when the Westfall Act, which doesn't abrogate the intentional tort provision, when that was passed, why -- was there any reason why Congress kept the five or six separate acts like the Gonzalez Act, instead of saying, Well, we did this piecemeal for particular agencies, and now we were dealing with Federal employees across the board, so there is no reason why we should have these five or six that go another way?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1236.853,1258.1,"Well, I can give you the answer that the government gave in its brief in Smith, which is the Gonzalez Act and the other four or five statutes continue to serve two, at least two vital functions, and one is specifically this, that they eliminate the intentional tort exception and, therefore, allow relief for victims of intentional tort in this medical malpractice context just like victims of other kinds of malpractice."
2012.11-1351,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1318.239,1318.889,Mr. Feldman--
2012.11-1351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.889,1322.626,Justice -- it's right on the same thing.
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1350.776,1351.728,That's right.
2012.11-1351,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1378.295,1398.257,"--Mr. Feldman, as I understand your argument and the differences that you have with the government, you have one set of differences about the meaning of 1089(e), but then another set about this question of, if it were true that the government was immune from suit, could you bring a tort suit against the doctors?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1412.6,1413.552,No.
2012.11-1351,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1420.206,1431.514,"So there is a lot of going back and forth about this question of what would happen if the government were immune, would the individual doctor be immune, but that is essentially irrelevant to the question before us; is that correct?"
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1431.514,1452.177,"I just wouldn't say it's irrelevant, because what the provisions that I have been talking about show is that Congress -- Congress was not trying in this Act, unlike in the Westfall Act, which doesn't have either of these two provisions, the reimbursement and remand provision that I've talked about -- unlike in the Westfall Act, Congress wasn't trying to save money or other -- do something else by just eliminating remedies for victims."
2012.11-1351,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1472.239,1474.524,"Saying it a different way, I don't have to accept your broader argument."
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1480.511,1481.061,Yes.
2012.11-1351,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1481.061,1481.53,Is that correct?
2012.11-1351,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1481.53,1482.58,"Yes, that is correct."
2012.11-1351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.487,1546.722,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1551.441,1554.459,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.254,1590.466,"Unequivocally -- we have a lot of cases that say you don't get -- you certainly get the benefit of the unequivocally standard when you are talking about a waiver of sovereign immunity in the first instance, but you don't keep getting the benefit over and over again when you are talking about in this case an exception to an exception to an exception."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1590.466,1597.322,"Well, Your Honor, I think the canon actually applies most strongly in this set of circumstances."
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1671.303,1676.94,"Well, but that was because at that point there was an exception to the exception of sovereign immunity."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1676.94,1678.257,--Correct.
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1678.257,1686.13,And you're going even a step further to say you get the benefit of the unequivocal test that you've set forth at even the next stage.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1686.13,1686.763,Here's--
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1686.763,1696.568,"You've already -- you've already used up your benefit of an unequivocal requirement when you've got the interpretation of the FTCA itself, which is the waiver of sovereign immunity."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1696.568,1701.805,"--Well, Your Honor, we haven't used it up because of the scope of interpreting Section 2680(h)."
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1723.533,1724.067,Wait a minute.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1731.104,1735.191,With the respect to the terms of 2680(h) as enacted at that time.
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.607,1742.094,But then the -- then the heightened standard of use sort of resurrects again when you get to considering an exception to 2680(h).
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1742.094,1745.78,"--The reason, Your Honor, is that you have a baseline of sovereign immunity."
2012.11-1351,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1766.812,1771.181,What do you need more clear than (h) doesn't apply?
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1771.181,1772.514,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-1351,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1772.514,1777.851,"I mean, I don't know how much clearer Congress has to get than to say it's nullified."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1777.851,1778.953,--Sure.
2012.11-1351,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1778.953,1782.838,What more does it have to say; the exception doesn't apply and then what's left.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1782.838,1792.677,"Your Honor, if all it said is that the intentional tort exception does not apply, I would agree with you that that would be enough, and that's exactly what Congress said in the 1988--"
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.677,1794.963,But it didn't want to say it shall not apply for everything.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1805.937,1812.941,"--That may well be true, and Congress, when it enacted the 1988 VA Act, did it in the most direct way."
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.744,1830.736,"It might have said that, but if it wanted to be more parsimonious in its language it could simply say for purposes of this section, which section applies only to these particular individuals."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1830.736,1832.771,"Justice Scalia, I think it might be helpful to take a step back."
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.469,1883.271,It was a -- it was a different Congress.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1885.473,1888.091,"--Well, Your Honor, they used the identical language--"
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.091,1891.543,You're -- you're lucky they even remember the earlier statutes.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1891.543,1895.929,"--Well, Your Honor, they use the identical language in every other provision of that statute."
2012.11-1351,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1901.415,1905.469,"Now, what do you do with Justice Breyer's point or with your adversary's point?"
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1925.531,1928.716,"--Well, Your Honor, it said the first part; it did not say the second part."
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.473,1978.416,"Well, listen, I -- you know, I don't -- I don't much care about legislative history, but -- but if I did, I wouldn't think that -- that you would say it is patterned after another Act where you change a very basic provision, whether suit can be brought against the United States or not."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1978.416,1979.85,"Well, Your Honor, it is patterned--"
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.85,1982.302,"I mean, that's sort of rudimentary and fundamental to it."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1987.271,1993.492,"--Well, Your Honor, it is patterned in the sense it does use the operative language."
2012.11-1351,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2011.47,2013.672,"Well, let's go back to the text then, Mr. Shah."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2038.473,2039.123,Sure.
2012.11-1351,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2039.123,2045.627,"But instead what Congress did was it enacted a kind of let's pretend provision, right?"
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2068.158,2073.027,"Well, Your Honor, I agree with you Congress could have written this provision in a different way and more clearly."
2012.11-1351,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2074.062,2074.662,I'm saying something more than that.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2074.662,2074.996,--Sure.
2012.11-1351,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2074.996,2076.848,It could not have written it in a worse way.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2076.848,2078.414,"Well, I would disagree with that."
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2139.089,2148.527,And you're -- you're -- I'm picking up from -- I find Justice Scalia's hypothetical interpretations of legislative history very useful.
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2151.312,2153.598,Thank you.
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.716,2169.691,"The -- the thing where we are in this -- we have a -- we have a statute, 1089 basically, and it says you can sue the government for the tort of an employee."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2256.749,2258.232,"--No -- no, Your Honor."
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2262.902,2263.636,Yes.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2263.636,2265.353,"--Justice Breyer, if you find it's not--"
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2265.353,2267.354,"Well, then you win as long as I find it confusing."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2268.639,2271.289,"--unequivocally clear, we win, and you don't look to the legislative history for clarity."
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2272.275,2273.991,"Well, I don't find it all that confusing."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2299.409,2305.729,"--Well, the for purposes of this section language I think is the key phrase and this section refers to the Gonzalez Act."
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2312.233,2314.335,I don't think those are the key words.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2321.858,2323.758,"Your Honor, I think when we are reading it--"
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.758,2325.143,It is not a hypothetical.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2329.962,2337.368,"--I think when we are reading it against the canon, the sovereign immunity canon, I think we would expect Congress to speak more clearly."
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2363.268,2363.785,Why?
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2398.691,2399.574,"Your Honor, I don't think that's true."
2012.11-1351,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2447.755,2450.224,"Mr. Shah, this is not always the Government's position."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2471.22,2472.572,"Sure, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1351,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2485.564,2487.582,"But this is not a side issue, Mr. Shah."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2511.614,2515.066,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't agree with that characterization."
2012.11-1351,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2518.785,2520.22,It was a supportive argument.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2526.291,2529.843,"--Your Honor, if you want to read it that way, I think that's fine."
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2530.693,2531.611,Why else was it there?
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2533.995,2534.263,"--No, I agree."
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2534.263,2536.863,It was obviously there to support your position.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2545.686,2546.371,"Your Honor, I agree--"
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2546.371,2548.205,And that was successful.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2552.191,2554.124,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2554.893,2556.81,We certainly -- we certainly cited Smith.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2556.81,2561.547,"--Yes, but the Court did not interpret 1089(e)."
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2593.351,2601.339,Your friend -- your friend says that in Smith -- I'm sorry for the confusion -- the Court addressed your argument on the meaning of the Gonzalez Act several times.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2601.339,2608.611,"--Your Honor, it did not address 1089(e) at all, and I think that's plain as day from the opinion."
2012.11-1351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2632.226,2639.297,"Well, you did say in the reply brief that the point of the Gonzalez Act, it says,"
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2643.618,2644.551,--You are correct.
2012.11-1351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2644.551,2646.653,I know you would have been disappointed if we didn't ask you about this.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2646.653,2648.436,"Yes, you are correct."
2012.11-1351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2653.974,2658.544,"And I -- and Justice Kagan indicated, this wasn't just an aside."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2665.198,2669.234,"--Again, I -- I disagree fundamentally with that characterization."
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2686.361,2689.48,I don't find that inconsistent with the position argued.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2694.734,2698.419,"--The two statements, the sole purpose of the Gonzalez Act is to confer immunity, not--"
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2698.419,2702.205,--I don't think it is the sole purpose even if you accept your friend's interpretation.
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2702.205,2702.657,"--But, no--"
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.657,2707.042,"No, no, the sole purpose is to assure immunity to these doctors."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2732.426,2734.809,"--Well, Your Honor, I would disagree with that."
2012.11-1351,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2758.124,2771.634,"Why would -- why would Congress, I mean, the Veterans Administration Act came after the four or five others and Congress thought it was patterning that act after the Gonzalez Act."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2785.644,2787.594,"--Of course, Congress doesn't say."
2012.11-1351,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2855.99,2877.153,"Mr. Shah, your basic theory of the case, which is that in order to make absolutely certain that everyone gets the benefit of the intentional tort exception, both the government and individual doctors, in order to make that absolutely clear, Congress writes a provision saying that the intentional tort exception shall not apply."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2890.878,2893.58,"Well, the provision that you describe, Justice Kagan, is not this provision."
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2958.905,2960.474,Would you -- are you finished there?
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2960.474,2961.224,"--Yes, sir."
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2961.224,2977.186,"Would you go back for a minute and think before this Act was passed, the Gonzalez Act, and think of the millions of government employees, and they're in different parts of the country, and some of them commit batteries."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,2998.099,3000.801,It was -- it was a common law absolute immunity.
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3000.801,3001.467,From what?
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3001.467,3003.753,One case is the Martinez--
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3003.753,3005.269,"I mean, what was the theory of it?"
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3011.59,3012.609,--Sure.
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3012.609,3018.763,"--and everybody else, you have to respond, and if liable, you'd have to pay damages for the battery."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3020.813,3021.731,The theory was--
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3021.731,3022.998,--if the employee did it?
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3022.998,3032.754,"--The theory behind the individual immunity was the same, essentially the same theory behind the Westfall Act immunity that this Court rejected in the Westfall Act decision."
2012.11-1351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3040.926,3041.259,Why?
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3041.259,3048.282,"It was a common law immunity that -- it was an offshoot of the sovereign immunity, and it conferred it on the individual employee."
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3138.59,3151.433,"So you want us to decide the case with the unequivocal question before us, in other words deciding whether that benefit to the government applies in this type of case."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3151.433,3152.383,Yes.
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3152.383,3163.157,"It seems to me that you are really upping the ante here, and it may well -- I have no idea why the government took the opposite position below, but that's -- that's putting a lot more at stake in this case than the particular statutory position."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3163.157,3172.763,"Well, Your Honor, there are four courts that have decided -- conclusively spoken -- to my knowledge, four courts in the history that have interpreted this provision, section 1089(e)."
2012.11-1351,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3245.741,3267.422,"Mr. Shah, does it make any sense to distinguish between a medical malpractice, negligence, and this un-consented operation, to split those two and say the government is liable for malpractice but not for this un-consented action."
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3267.422,3269.774,"Your Honor, I think it makes a lot of sense, and here's why."
2012.11-1351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.47,3360.117,"Mr. Shah, can I ask you why, if your interpretation is correct, subsection (e) did not read -- not for purposes of this section, but rather for purposes of subsection (a), the provisions of 2680(h) shall not apply?"
2012.11-1351,1,38316,pratik_shah,,3360.117,3360.984,"--May I respond, Your Honor?"
2012.11-1351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3388.634,3389.12,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1351,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3390.92,3395.29,I just wanted to make a couple of quick points.
2012.11-1351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3469.802,3480.527,"Mr. Feldman, the Court invited you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae, and you have ably discharged that responsibility, for which the Court is grateful."
2012.11-1351,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3480.527,3481.01,Thank you.
2012.11-1351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3481.01,3481.51,The case is submitted.
