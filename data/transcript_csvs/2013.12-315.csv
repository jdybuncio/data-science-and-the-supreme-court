2013.12-315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.67,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-315, Air Wisconsin Airlines v. Hoeper."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,7.72,11.056,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,63.34,71.862,I'm -- I'm not sure it -- you said it is conceded that -- that those things should have been brought to the airline's attention.
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,73.345,73.812,--I think they--
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,73.812,82.568,"I think -- I think they said if it -- if they were brought, they should have been brought in a different fashion, but I'm not -- I'm not sure they -- they have conceded that."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,82.568,89.74,"--I believe they have conceded, Justice Scalia, that those facts could have been conveyed, justifiably."
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,94.975,98.193,"Well, you could convey anything justifiably, sure, I agree with that."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,98.193,104.499,"And the question, Justice Scalia, is whether we framed or phrased the report in an adequate manner."
2013.12-315,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,154.932,155.599,"Well, Mr. Cohn, on the--"
2013.12-315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,155.599,161.086,Can -- can we go back to your response to Justice Scalia?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,177.045,178.131,"That's exactly right, Justice--"
2013.12-315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,178.131,180.997,"So it's -- it's the Colorado Supreme Court, not the Respondent?"
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,180.997,186.232,--I believe the Respondents have also acknowledged that a call could have been made conveying certain facts.
2013.12-315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,198.373,201.325,You had -- you're saying -- you're saying there were three critical facts.
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,208.195,220.219,"--The second point of context is that these reports are being made to TSA, other reasonable air safety officials, for the purpose of passenger safety and aviation security."
2013.12-315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.989,228.372,And then the third?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,229.072,239.964,--And the third piece of context is the consequences of a failure to make a report can be catastrophic for passenger safety and aviation security.
2013.12-315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,251.171,257.158,"In this context, it's not clear to me what the issue is that's before us."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,275.32,278.939,"No, the issue is not about the jury instructions, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,292.414,292.981,By the court.
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,292.981,294.648,By the court in our view.
2013.12-315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,296.716,304.056,What -- what position -- although they'll tell us in a minute -- does Respondent take on that issue that a determination by the jury suffices?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,308.024,308.957,I believe two things.
2013.12-315,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,336.707,341.928,But isn't that implicit in the instruction to the jury that it has to be defamatory?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,349.951,355.671,"Well, the jury -- and this is a question of the jury instructions, which are not being challenged, are not before the Court."
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.482,380.47,But does defamatory require that it be materially false?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,391.944,397.498,"Under the common law, Justice Scalia, the statement has to be materially false."
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.3,404.186,Has to be materially false to sustain what?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,404.186,406.371,--To sustain a defamation judgment.
2013.12-315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,412.174,414.024,Material to -- to what?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,414.024,415.226,In--
2013.12-315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,415.226,422.98,"I mean, you can have a defamatory statement about a pilot that's not material to, you know, air safety."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,428.301,442.377,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that's a very important distinction, because in the common law context you're concerned about the effect on the person's reputation, his general reputation in the community, whereas in the ATSA context you're talking about a very particular listener."
2013.12-315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,447.948,466.576,"So you're saying you can't defame -- someone gets immunity for a statement that would be defamatory in the common law context if made generally, but because it's made in the context of information about flight safety that's somehow immune?"
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,466.576,468.444,"--Correct, Mr. Chief justice."
2013.12-315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,476.784,481.269,"So you call some TSA official and say this pilot, you know, is having an affair."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,482.621,492.143,"That would not be immune because that would not be relevant to a suspicious transaction, suspicious activity, or passenger safety, so--"
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.143,495.678,"But it would still support a defamation, wouldn't it?"
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,495.678,495.995,--Correct.
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.495,499.028,Because it is material to the person's reputation.
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,499.028,499.278,--Correct.
2013.12-315,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,509.317,524.576,"--Well, on the report that was made here, suppose that the report said that the Respondent -- we believe the Respondent is mentally ill, or we believe the Respondent has serious mental problems."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,527.628,530.48,"With those words, I think I would, Justice Alito, because--"
2013.12-315,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,530.48,530.847,You would?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,530.847,532.432,"--The same argument, yes."
2013.12-315,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,548.042,558.317,"Well, the facts as I understand it were that he became very angry during a test, during a flight simulation test."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,576.711,578.594,That's a fair characterization.
2013.12-315,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,578.594,578.996,All right.
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,582.198,603.345,"Justice Alito, I'm keeping in mind the first important piece of context, which is these reports are being made by tens of thousands of aviation employees on the ground that could have different educations and socioeconomic backgrounds and might not all speak the way we do, especially in an uncertain context in which the facts are rapidly evolving."
2013.12-315,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,603.345,603.678,I'm sorry.
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,617.369,619.887,"A couple things, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-315,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,628.741,631.443,"Well, yes, but from facts."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,640.149,641.599,--I think--
2013.12-315,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,641.599,644.951,--has a mental problem or is mentally unstable?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,648.585,655.074,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think that different people express the same thought in different ways."
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.164,669.699,"Yes, you could say he's nuts, but the question isn't whether could say it."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,679.738,683.124,"--Justice Scalia, a couple things in response."
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.241,724.867,"The point is that somebody ought to determine whether the exaggeration or whatever it was was material, whether -- whether it would have made any difference to TSA if it had been described otherwise."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,744.18,747.132,"Correct, Justice Scalia, absolutely correct."
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.132,753.536,"So that's what we're confronted with, simply the -- the need for somebody to make that factual determination, right?"
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,756.321,756.821,"Oh, no, no."
2013.12-315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,764.324,765.241,Where did it say “ material ”?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,778.817,779.917,They had to say it.
2013.12-315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,779.917,780.2,Okay.
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,873.862,879.514,"Justice Breyer, the lower court recognized that the ATSA immunity question is for the court to decide."
2013.12-315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,888.386,891.924,But did the jury -- did the jury find falsity?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,900.527,902.729,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-315,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,904.995,906.781,And how did -- how did they make it?
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,911.333,913.601,--Correct.
2013.12-315,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,927.877,935.131,"There are two -- there are two different issues of falsity that we're talking about here, of materiality."
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,1000.82,1002.589,"I agree completely, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-315,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1007.56,1007.726,I do.
2013.12-315,0,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,1011.778,1017.599,"--My answer, Justice Breyer, to your question is that the jury answered a different question."
2013.12-315,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1040.114,1042.164,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1056.057,1058.759,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-315,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1101.77,1102.02,"And, Mr. Feigin--"
2013.12-315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1102.02,1115.761,"Do you think that the statute, 44941, was intended by the Congress to incorporate the New York Times-Sullivan standard, the Masson v. New Yorker standard?"
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1130.437,1135.007,"Well, Your Honor, I think there's a distinction between Masson and this case."
2013.12-315,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1179.02,1190.242,So -- so you want us to write an opinion to say that the -- that the statute here is to be interpreted differently than if it were a New York Times and Sullivan case or Masson-New Yorker case?
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1190.242,1193.546,"Well, Your Honor, I think the only reason real difference is the context."
2013.12-315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1249.03,1251.049,"I accept that for the moment, accept all that."
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1295.743,1304.198,"--Well, what you're supposed to do in this case, Your Honor, is that the jury -- the finding that the jury made -- first of all, the jury wasn't actually instructed on materiality."
2013.12-315,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.198,1305.283,"They may have waived it, you know."
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1305.283,1314.056,"But assuming for the sake of argument the jury found the statements were materially false, it only did so in the context of the State law defamation verdict."
2013.12-315,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1325.864,1334.385,"--My understanding of what the Colorado Supreme Court did is this: On the issue of ATSA immunity, it said very clearly that is for the court."
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1362.137,1364.922,"--That's my understanding of the Supreme Court of Colorado's opinion, Your Honor."
2013.12-315,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1364.922,1374.878,"And are they right that in determining ATSA immunity the jury has no role, doesn't make findings of historical fact, who said what, anything like that?"
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1374.878,1388.037,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think this is encompassed within the question presented, but our view, as we explain in Footnote 6 of our brief, is that under ATSA, questions of historical facts, such as what was actually said on the call and what actually happened, would be submitted to the jury."
2013.12-315,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1407.249,1409.451,So you disagree with Justice Scalia?
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1432.9,1435.668,"--Again, Your Honor, we don't think the Court needs to address it here."
2013.12-315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1439.47,1441.672,You'd give the jury two different instructions?
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1471.775,1479.364,"--We do think the court should give the jury separate instructions on ATSA and then if it passes the ATSA bar, you'd go on to defamation law."
2013.12-315,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1485.601,1493.355,"I -- I actually would like your opinion, the SG's opinion, on whether this is an issue for the court or the jury."
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1498.193,1502.478,"--Your Honor, we are comfortable with the Court saying that it's a question for the court."
2013.12-315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.455,1527.542,"Of course, you don't -- there's no reason, and presumably a good trial judge wouldn't instruct the jury on those two separate questions using the same word, right?"
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1543.635,1544.92,"That's right, Your Honor."
2013.12-315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.491,1573.17,"And you'd -- you'd feel snug and comfortable in making reports to airlines, knowing that whether you're going to be held liable is going to be up to some jury who is going to see that this person, his career was ruined, and it's going to be up to the jury to say whether he can recover or not?"
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1573.17,1574.856,"Your Honor, we're comfortable--"
2013.12-315,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1574.856,1577.458,That doesn't give me a lot of comfort.
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1600.071,1616.599,"--Your Honor, I think what's going to provide the adequate good feelings that airlines have making these reports, to make them feel safe making these reports, is for this Court to emphasize the very wide scope that the ATSA gives to how airlines characterize--"
2013.12-315,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1616.599,1627.557,"Well, Mr. Feigin, they have that wide scope because of the actual malice standard, that somebody needs to show that there was actual knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to falsity."
2013.12-315,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1641.564,1647.97,"--Well, Your Honor, I don't think we're doing anything different from the actual malice standard except taking account of the context."
2013.12-315,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1663.73,1664.48,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1674.538,1676.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.337,1714.947,"So suppose I'm the trial judge and I conclude that if Air Wisconsin had said to the TSA, along the lines of Justice Scalia's earlier question, We have an employee who was terminated today."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1741.763,1743.347,Let me unpack that.
2013.12-315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1800.817,1805.285,The Masson reporter for the New Yorker Magazine spent months on this article.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1813.891,1816.593,I'm saying the same standard of material truth applies.
2013.12-315,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1840.739,1847.143,Can we go back to the “ who decides ” question.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1884.532,1900.026,"--I think that the answer to the legal question is that you have the same division that you have in qualified immunity, that material disputes of facts are resolved by the jury and then the court reviews those -- those findings under the normal--"
2013.12-315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1900.026,1905.178,"So under my question I first asked you, I'm the trial judge, I have made the determination that TSA would have acted the same way."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1906.864,1915.634,"--If -- if you think that there's no disputes about those facts, that no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise on those facts, and you think--"
2013.12-315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1915.634,1923.39,"No, I thought that even if the facts had been reported much more accurately than they were, that the TSA still had a duty to investigate."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1923.39,1925.009,--All right.
2013.12-315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1925.009,1927.242,Can't I make that determination as a matter of law?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1927.242,1937.316,"I don't -- I think the materiality question goes to the jury, subject to review by the court on the motion for directed verdict, whatever."
2013.12-315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1974.072,1981.512,"I guess I'm not sure what you just said, because even the way you just phrased that, you're asking what TSA would have done."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,1990.701,1996.172,"You apply the Masson test, which is would a truer statement have a different effect on the mind of the reader?"
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2003.942,2013.048,So you're saying if it made a difference in their mind whether to send one officer to his house or a SWAT team somewhere else that's material and you lose immunity?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2013.048,2018.452,"That's materially false, yes, if the difference would have made a difference--"
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.452,2024.605,"If the difference -- if the difference in the language causes TSA to do anything differently, then you lose immunity?"
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2024.605,2026.374,"--I think you would, but that's not the question."
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2030.509,2033.194,A different effect -- a different effect on who?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2033.194,2034.977,"The listeners, the TSA."
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2034.977,2035.51,The TSA.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2055.64,2056.357,I think so.
2013.12-315,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2063.813,2076.121,"Well, before you get to that, before you get to that, to finish up on the point you were making earlier, suppose that the report is he ranted for 10 minutes, and then suppose the jury found he ranted for 7 minutes."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2082.791,2091.147,"I think it has to make a difference in the way that they would evaluate the existence, nature, or extent of the threat."
2013.12-315,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.478,2114.128,Where are you reading?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2114.128,2115.578,--Page 30a of the Red Brief.
2013.12-315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2150.601,2151.687,"Well, I think you're right."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2156.839,2157.774,That's correct.
2013.12-315,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2179.604,2181.389,What are the factual issues?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2199.168,2206.605,"--So the materiality consider compares what was said -- and you're right, there's no dispute about that -- and what was true, and there's a lot of dispute about that."
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2219.847,2224.816,So am I right in understanding that there be two -- you would view these two scenarios differently?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2238.226,2239.293,"No, I think you'd lose in both."
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2239.293,2240.428,You would lose in both.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2240.428,2240.895,Yes.
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2242.411,2250.515,"So a layperson -- a layperson who, you know, just looks at this and said he's acting crazy, they're not immune from that."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2256.169,2258.437,"--Well, let me be clear about that then."
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2273.611,2276.663,But they would be -- the airline would be immune.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2276.663,2278.598,"The airline would be immune, correct."
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2279.531,2279.881,"No, no."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2291.422,2293.441,I don't think there's a difference between that.
2013.12-315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2304.479,2322.275,"So other than proving at trial that these statements were misleadingly false, or false, how did you prove that the statements would have had an effect on a reasonable security officer?"
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2322.275,2324.641,"--Well, let me -- sure."
2013.12-315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2324.641,2334.849,How do you -- what's the evidence that you expect parties to present and what was it you presented to show that their response would have been different?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2334.849,2353.577,"Well, let me ask -- answer the second question first, which is we had an expert witness who was formerly in charge of writing security regulations for TSA and the FAA before that who testified that in light of the truth, a call wasn't even warranted, but that he perfectly understood why TSA acted the way it did given the contents of the call."
2013.12-315,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2359.981,2362.333,But we have granted cert on this question.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2410.331,2421.055,"--I definitely think that it would be appropriated for this Court to write an opinion that says, look, to the extent Footnote 6 suggests that some true statements aren't protected by ATSA, that's wrong."
2013.12-315,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.055,2421.989,"No, it doesn't say that."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2431.746,2436.981,"Well, I think you can say, look, we don't know what it means, but to the extent it means that ATSA doesn't affect all true statements, that's wrong."
2013.12-315,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2481.26,2491.368,"Well, on two of the -- on two of the three statements, the difference between the literal -- the very strict truth and what was said is very slight."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2499.139,2501.007,I think that there's a huge difference.
2013.12-315,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2503.443,2504.493,That's literally true.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2508.412,2518.118,"Suppose I were to know that there is a lawyer in town who has a concealed carry permit, and I know he has a hearing at the courtroom -- at the courthouse down the road later today."
2013.12-315,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2540.898,2541.983,What would be a true statement?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2541.983,2543.633,True statement would be--
2013.12-315,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2543.633,2546.918,Not with respect to the lawyer; with respect to your client.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2546.918,2561.761,"--I think it would have been true for them to say, look, we're calling to let you know because Mr. Hoeper's an FFDO, we don't have any reason to believe that he has gun with him, but we can't tell for sure, so we just thought we would tell you in case you have any questions and want to investigate further."
2013.12-315,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2602.838,2607.389,But you're talking about a very subtle implication of the statement.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2617.597,2619.597,"Well, again, I don't think it's that subtle."
2013.12-315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2626.537,2631.255,"Well, just pursuing Justice Alito's point about the other statement, the other that he was terminated today."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2633.974,2636.659,--We acknowledge that that is not an important part of our case.
2013.12-315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2636.659,2637.093,--Okay.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2642.13,2643.73,Mentally unstable.
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2656.239,2661.541,"Well, you're not suggesting it would be a different case if they just said he's unstable as opposed to he's mentally unstable, are you?"
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2661.541,2666.345,"No, because I would understand that they're not saying that he might fall over."
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2666.345,2668.111,"Well, that's what you were saying."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2676.181,2676.665,"No, it doesn't."
2013.12-315,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2688.889,2693.791,"Well, they didn't -- they said we were concerned about his mental stability."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2693.791,2695.993,"They said that, but they also said he is unstable."
2013.12-315,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2713.171,2715.54,"Well, do you think it makes a difference we're talking here about a pilot?"
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2737.454,2739.321,I think you could take that into account.
2013.12-315,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2759.402,2762.271,"But maybe for ordinary people, but how about for pilots."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2762.271,2763.487,I think even for pilots.
2013.12-315,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2825.711,2834.383,"All of us have had the experience, at least I have, if I get very angry at something, one of my children will say: God, he's mentally unstable."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2854.631,2855.047,I understand.
2013.12-315,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2855.047,2867.272,"So why isn't the best thing to say is, look, there is leeway here, considerable leeway on the part of the airline or anyone else who's reporting, that are reporting things to TSA."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2869.557,2873.959,There is enormous leeway already and that is in the actual malice standard.
2013.12-315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2919.321,2924.225,"Mr. Russell, weren't you yourself suggesting the twist on the materiality standard?"
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2941.237,2946.807,"--Well, I think that's -- that's an application of the Masson standard, which is if you know who the reader is."
2013.12-315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2954.245,2957.113,"Well, how do we know about the reasonable TSA officer?"
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,2976.76,2979.376,"--Well, you have the same problem with figuring out what he's going to do."
2013.12-315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3012.849,3013.683,I'm sorry.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3025.924,3029.309,"--Well, the difference is -- I mean, what Mr. LaWare was saying is it calls--"
2013.12-315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3029.309,3030.228,I'm more upset--
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3030.228,3030.961,--I'm more--
2013.12-315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3030.961,3034.63,"--but -- I'm more concerned, but I'm going to take the identical action?"
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3034.63,3037.482,"--Well, I'm saying that you don't have to figure out what they would have done."
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3052.924,3056.878,"Well, but it affects your belief is different in a context like this."
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3081.76,3087.081,Certainly what they do with the information is reflective of the effect it has on their minds.
2013.12-315,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3154.459,3156.426,So what are the other things TSA could have done?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3192.248,3196.05,So one possibility is -- it depends very much on when the call was made.
2013.12-315,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3233.659,3239.912,"So you want us to say the call has to be made right away without reflection, without talking to supervisors, without some quiet discussion first?"
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3241.347,3242.08,No.
2013.12-315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3259.792,3275.817,I thought I read somewhere that after this incident there was a discussion between or among Mr. Doyle and various government agencies to figure out how to avoid something like this in the future.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3275.817,3277.836,"He did testify to that fact, yes."
2013.12-315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3277.836,3278.519,Who testified?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3278.519,3279.369,Mr. Doyle did.
2013.12-315,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3279.369,3284.004,And what was your sense -- I don't remember the testimony now.
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3284.606,3288.125,I don't think he gave any details about the content of that discussion.
2013.12-315,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3459.17,3476.714,How do you add to the question -- the question in this case was put by the Court -- the question whether ATSA immunity may be denied without a determination the air carrier's disclosure was material and false?
2013.12-315,2,33970,kevin_k_russell,,3476.714,3485.318,"The answer to that question is no, with the caveat that an appellate court has no obligation to resolve materiality objections unless they're actually raised by the defendant."
2013.12-315,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3485.318,3486.836,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-315,3,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,3489.022,3494.107,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-315,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3512.553,3517.705,"Well, how do we decide what a reasonable security officer would do?"
2013.12-315,3,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,3517.705,3518.874,--How do we decide it?
2013.12-315,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3518.874,3521.493,How does -- how -- how do we as judges?
2013.12-315,3,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,3529.932,3531.315,"We had experts, too."
2013.12-315,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3548.226,3553.045,"Yeah, but we don't decide whether it was reasonable force if we think there's a question about that."
2013.12-315,3,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,3553.045,3555.661,"If there's a question of historical fact, if there--"
2013.12-315,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3555.661,3556.08,"No, no."
2013.12-315,3,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,3564.617,3565.703,"--Well, the--"
2013.12-315,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3565.703,3573.373,And there are some levels of -- of force that we can say as a matter of law don't qualify as excessive.
2013.12-315,3,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,3582.814,3586.349,--According -- Nellis said the ultimate question is for a court to decide.
2013.12-315,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3632.747,3641.853,"Well, Mr. Cohn, what if I think that a TSA might have reacted differently to what was actually said and to what really should have been said?"
2013.12-315,3,29403,jonathan_f_cohn,,3653.66,3657.628,I would say it matters on whether that different thing is material.
2013.12-315,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3673.138,3673.755,"Thank you, counsel."
