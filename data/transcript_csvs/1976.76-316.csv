1976.76-316,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,68.667,"We will hear arguments next in 76-316, Bates and others against the State Bar of Arizona."
1976.76-316,0,44229,william_c_canby_jr,,75.353,80.118,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.76-316,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,360.554,364.615,"You mean the files, Mr. Canby, or you mean the potential clients?"
1976.76-316,0,44229,william_c_canby_jr,,364.615,367.228,"Potential clients, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.76-316,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2355.007,2358.096,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.76-316,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2358.096,2367.717,"Mr. Friedman, before you commence, let me share with you at least my primary concern of this case."
1976.76-316,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2451.544,2457.659,"Well, let me address myself directly to that question, Mr. Justice Powell."
1976.76-316,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2631.745,2634.648,May I interrupt you just a minute right there?
1976.76-316,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2663.351,2668.969,"Well, that, it seems to me again, would depend on what is said."
1976.76-316,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2689.549,2704.938,"Suppose in this case, a competing lawyer had published an ad saying, “The partners in this clinic have been practicing divorce law on a part-time basis for four years."
1976.76-316,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2713.341,2718.137,I would think the derogatory thing would present problems to me.
1976.76-316,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2728.708,2733.13,What is derogatory about that comparative statement if it is true?
1976.76-316,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2733.13,2745.193,"Well, it seems to me it is derogatory, Mr. Chief Justice, because the suggestion is somehow that we are better than they are, and it is the negative suggestion against them."
1976.76-316,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2753.01,2756.977,"Well, does the First Amendment prohibit derogatory communication?"
1976.76-316,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2756.977,2758.516,"No, no."
1976.76-316,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2781.362,2785.783,"Well, what about simply saying, “Anything you can do, I can do better”?"
1976.76-316,1,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2785.783,2789.116,"I do not think that would be permissible, Mr. Justice."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,3614.876,3630.15,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.76-316,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3630.15,3633.069,Mr. Frank?
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,3633.069,3637.513,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.76-316,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4283.092,4287.336,What is inherently misleading about the ad in this case on Page 409?
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4287.336,4291.162,"This is a good example, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1976.76-316,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4383.793,4391.326,What is it precisely that you feel is misleading about the divorce and $175 plus $20 court costs?
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4391.326,4397.926,The point that is misleading is the suggestion that somehow this is some kind of a grand public-service bargain.
1976.76-316,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4397.926,4401.878,"Well, where do you get that out of the ad?"
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4405.601,4416.763,"I am saying that given the standards of these people, who are purporting to be entitled to special dispensation because they are being so generous to the lower middle class, that the answer is, no, it is not."
1976.76-316,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4416.763,4419.123,"But that is not in the ad, is it?"
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4419.123,4427.071,It is when you connect it with the notion of the legal clinic and the special service and that somehow we are prized and special.
1976.76-316,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4435.835,4437.476,That is my initial question.
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4437.476,4438.255,Yes.
1976.76-316,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4441.894,4443.475,"We need to get there, Mr. Frank."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4443.475,4443.84,All right.
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4499.288,4502.271,They do not even say that it is a bargain; they just say it is reasonable.
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4502.271,4507.032,"They say it is reasonable; but I think, Mr. Justice White --"
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4507.032,4508.592,Better you stay close to that.
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4508.592,4509.088,"I am sorry, thank you."
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4509.088,4511.372,…and watch your embarrass-able words before you say them.
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4511.372,4514.178,"All right, posterity will not be let down."
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4514.178,4516.318,Good.
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4516.318,4531.866,"Mr. Justice White, I think that it is fair to say that the whole tone of this advertisement, the whole tone of the brief, is that somehow we are doing something very special for the community, we are being just great folks, and we are giving you wonderful bargains."
1976.76-316,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4561.237,4569.859,"Mr. Frank, what is the prevailing fee in this community for an uncontested divorce?"
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4569.859,4576.34,"Let me answer by saying first that the difficulty arises because the term ""uncontested divorce"" is a sliding term."
1976.76-316,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4595.848,4602.892,"Judged by the standards of the community rather than their own hourly charge, it is a reasonable fee, is it not?"
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4602.892,4607.027,It is certainly a moderate fee.
1976.76-316,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4607.027,4608.674,Then what is so misleading about the rest of it?
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4608.674,4624.75,"Well, again, I come back to the fact -- and this is simply the best I can do with it, Mr. Justice Stevens -- that I think that even in this simple ad they are trying to suggest some extra-special, and there is not anything that extra-special here."
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4686.315,4711.179,"Well, Mr. Frank, what if the United Mine Workers or the United Transportation Union published this same ad, and at the bottom it said the United Mine Workers Legal Clinic and then, under it, it gave the name of the lawyers, otherwise published the same ad, and they just circulated it in their union newspaper, published it in their union newspaper to all of their members or to anybody else who wanted to buy it."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4711.179,4727.43,"Mr. Justice White, you have, in effect, raised the question of a series of cases which have come up here which have upheld group legal services and permitted effective advertising communication through them; and the answer is that that would not be a violation in the State of Arizona, either."
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4751.078,4770.891,"Well, you are saying that is something that we would not call a group legal service exactly; but the Union… well, your answer is that you would not say that the Arizona Rules would forbid this advertisement published by a union."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4770.891,4785.148,"What I am saying, Your Honor, I am being brief because of the exigency of time; but if you will look at our Rule 2-101, Subparagraph 7, you will find --- I hold it in my hand -- that that kind of thing would be allowed."
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4820.581,4830.444,"Well, do you think the ad that I spoke about published by the union would be constitutionally protected under our cases or not?"
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4830.444,4832.591,I am in doubt.
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4835.062,4836.422,"Well, isn't that a --"
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4836.422,4841.75,"I do think that it is permitted, at least under the Rules which we have."
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4841.75,4842.415,I understand that.
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4847.957,4852.146,I am in doubt as to whether there is constitutional protection.
1976.76-316,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4874.005,4888.382,"I must admit, Mr. Frank, I am puzzled by your being willing to admit that may be constitutionally protected, but this clearly may not be, and the only distinction is that there is pecuniary gain as a motivation for the person who publishes here."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4892.286,4899.153,"As I say, in respect to the ads which are the ads for the group services, whereas, for example, the union wishes to tell its members --"
1976.76-316,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4899.153,4902.005,"Well, precisely this ad by a union."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4902.005,4922.188,"Yes, and the answer is that, for example, you have one of the briefs before you is the brief of the Arizona Credit Union League, and what the Arizona Credit Union League says expressly is, “We don't want to be associated with the argument that Mr. Canby is making”."
1976.76-316,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4968.13,4972.649,"Well, you would not permit the credit union to do that, would you?"
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,4972.649,4981.94,"All we permit the credit union to do is, first, to arrange for legal services and, second, to tell people that they are there."
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5293.707,5315.754,"Mr. Frank, getting back to the present time, if there is a person in Arizona who wants to devolve and he is a perfectly ordinary person, I want to compare him with the well-educated, extremely wealthy person who has an antitrust matter."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5318.599,5319.786,That is right.
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5319.786,5330.808,"Now, the poor man who has got $195 to get a divorce, how would he go about finding a lawyer in Arizona?"
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5330.808,5335.329,"The first thing that he would do, Mr. Justice Marshall, is go to the Legal Aid Society."
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5359.126,5363.032,How would the man find the lawyer referral service?
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5363.032,5370.952,"He will find the lawyer referral service, because the Bar is able to advertise that this institution exists."
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5370.952,5371.963,And where is that advertised?
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5371.963,5375.517,It can advertise it in a newspaper or on the radio or in any way it wishes.
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5375.517,5375.88,Good.
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5376.916,5379.076,"It is done, and there are --"
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5379.076,5379.789,Regularly?
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5379.789,5380.534,Yes.
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5388.005,5390.615,"Well, it did not get to this man."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5390.615,5396.249,"Yeah, if it does not get to this man, then he may have to do what people have traditionally done."
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5413.468,5417.341,Then they are just wasting their money with this ad.
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5417.341,5419.693,These people think they are making money.
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5421.118,5423.133,They are making money from this ad.
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5423.133,5428.851,"They may or may not; it depends, obviously, on how many do it."
1976.76-316,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5447.725,5466.907,"Well, Mr. Frank, there was a … at least when I practiced in Phoenix, the County Attorney would do adoptions; but people who could afford adoption would go and have a private lawyer do them, and I am not at all sure that every private attorney who was consulted necessarily said, “Well, you could do just as well with the County Attorney”."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5466.907,5484.616,"I am satisfied, however, that those who sought to be conscientious, as you were when you were in practice and, I must say, I and Mr. Louis as practitioners, do not sell people services that they do not need, and we're mighty scrupulous and invariable about it."
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5606.752,5609.871,"Of course, Mr. Frank, I suppose this is arguable in a way."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5617.609,5618.223,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.76-316,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5752.244,5764.354,"I suppose one answer to one of those questions about Michigan is that Michigan has elected to experiment in one way, and Arizona has elected to experiment in another way."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5764.354,5767.851,"You said it, Mr. Chief Justice, better than I, and it is exactly what I want to say: they are entitled to do it."
1976.76-316,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5767.851,5781.751,"Well, precisely, the reason I made the observation was because of your parade of horribles; that all I asked was whether it was not arguable because one state goes one way and another state goes the other way."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5781.751,5787.276,It is; but you will notice that all of these proposals are very sharply limited to date.
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5815.943,5826.591,"Hundreds of years ago, you had law offices with a maximum of three lawyers with an income of about $10,000 a year, and now what are we talking about?"
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5826.591,5833.959,"Well, I am delighted to report to you that at least the incomes have gone up; and some of the offices are bigger, some are not."
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5838.27,5841.973,"Therefore, (inaudible) for nothing."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5841.973,5852.093,"Frequently, sir, for nothing and frequently took $10 cases; but Abraham Lincoln never made but one ad in his life, and that was to put an announcement in the paper when he returned from Congress to say that his office was open."
1976.76-316,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5852.093,5856.745,"But that was a different day and age, obviously."
1976.76-316,2,30403,john_p_frank,,5856.745,5867.206,It is a different day and age; but it is an age in which professional tradition has a contribution still to make.
1976.76-316,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5987.094,5988.034,"Thank you, Mr. Frank."
1976.76-316,3,44229,william_c_canby_jr,,5992.072,5997.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, just two points."
