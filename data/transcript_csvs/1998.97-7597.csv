1998.97-7597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.648,"We'll hear argument next in No. 97-7597, Patrick Knowles v. Iowa."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,33.765,37.028,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-7597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.705,65.285,I'm not sure that's what the statute does.
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,112.679,130.791,"--Well, the Iowa Supreme Court has construed this language that says otherwise lawful search to extend the search incident to... excuse me... search incident to arrest exception to encompass those circumstances where a citation is issued and there is in fact--"
1998.97-7597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.791,143.131,"Well, I thought what the court below did was to say that a full search on the occasion of a traffic citation was lawful in their view."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,145.32,145.501,--Yes.
1998.97-7597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,146.342,146.562,Yes.
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,160.072,161.454,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,185.692,193.628,"Mr. Rosenberg, could you just back up for a minute because in your answer to Justice O'Connor, you said something that I didn't understand you had challenged."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,222.337,226.21,--We didn't raise the question of lawfulness of the arrest.
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.662,244.812,"Well, then your answer to Justice O'Connor was not right because she asked you if you were contesting the authority to make a full custodial arrest on the basis of a traffic violation, and you said you were."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,263.285,268.268,"If I answered that way to Justice O'Connor's question, then I misspoke."
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,289.572,297.677,Arrest and make a full custodial... make a full search.
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,297.677,298.058,"Yes, under--"
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,298.058,309.057,"So, all that we're talking about is if they don't exercise that authority, authority you're not challenging, and merely issue a citation, can they nonetheless go ahead."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,310.947,311.979,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-7597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.97,458.456,Do you think it's... it's clear that a stop or a traffic offense committed in the officer's presence is not an arrest?
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,458.456,460.877,--The actual--
1998.97-7597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,460.877,461.387,Is that clear?
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,461.387,463.698,--The actual stop would not be an arrest.
1998.97-7597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,463.698,465.751,Is the person free to leave?
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,465.751,466.101,No.
1998.97-7597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,481.413,482.785,Handcuffs are required?
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,482.785,486.007,"--All arrested persons are handcuffed, yes."
1998.97-7597,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,486.007,508.04,"Well, would you agree then if the officer made the valid stop and exercised the... the option, which... which it is understood I think clearly that he has, to require the driver to get out of the car, the officer at that point could at least have... have gone to... to the... to the point of a Terry kind of pat-down search?"
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,509.572,512.664,If he had the necessary suspicion--
1998.97-7597,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,512.664,513.054,No.
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,529.706,532.667,--He could have conducted a Terry pat-down.
1998.97-7597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.667,532.998,Okay.
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,541.335,552.454,"Well, as recently as Minnesota v. Dickerson, the... this Court has reaffirmed the requirement of Terry, that there be some articulable basis to believe this person is armed and dangerous."
1998.97-7597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.454,554.567,That's why I don't understand your response to Justice Souter.
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,566.254,568.766,"No, I don't believe that simply speeding--"
1998.97-7597,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,568.766,572.198,"Then your answer to me should have been different, shouldn't it?"
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,576.289,577.481,"--Yes, that's correct."
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,577.481,594.221,"Well, you've... you have conceded that he could have been arrested, and what is it under Iowa law that it takes, you said, handcuffs going to the station?"
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,621.099,629.204,"If he had done that, then it would have been a valid search incident to a lawful arrest."
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,629.204,636.52,"So, the whole thing turns on whether the officer says you're under... you're under arrest or here's a ticket."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,636.52,641.315,"Yes, but that is a distinction that... that--"
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.315,643.936,Then what happened to the handcuffs and the station?
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,665.28,671.455,"--Well, Your Honor, an arrest in Iowa does not differ in terms of the seriousness of the offense."
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.967,699.073,"Well, then you're giving a different answer to the one you gave before when I asked you, is it enough that the officer says, you're under arrest."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,717.616,722.849,"--I didn't mean... I just meant to say that when the officer says you're under arrest, that would commence the arrest process."
1998.97-7597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.519,750.38,"Your basic argument here, as... as I understand it, is that while there is a justification for a full search when you have an arrest, take the person into custody, the... as we said in... in Robinson, those facts are not present when you simply issue a citation."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,750.38,751.722,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.97-7597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,751.722,759.727,"Suppose the police officer said, look it, I'm entitled to arrest you and take you to the station, and I'm not going to do that."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,762.191,778.09,"I think under Bumpers v. North Carolina, that would be a legitimate reason for questioning the voluntariness of that consent because that would be... just be an acquiescence and a claim of lawful authority by the police officer."
1998.97-7597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,778.892,784.595,"Well, if the officer had the right to take him into custody, why couldn't he give him that choice?"
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,784.595,793.77,"--Well, I think that would... that would simply be an issue of whether the consent would be... would be valid."
1998.97-7597,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,806.149,818.588,"Mr. Rosenberg, you... you pointed out that historically the distinction seems to have been recognized between searches incident to arrest and the consequences of a mere citation."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,828.558,839.305,"I would like to answer that question by quoting from United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. at 234, note 5."
1998.97-7597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,908.095,910.556,"Of course, that's just one of the justifications that it would express."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,919.732,921.295,"Yes, that is--"
1998.97-7597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.295,924.266,"I mean, if he's arresting somebody outside the car, why should he be able to search the inside of the car?"
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,931.172,931.762,--That's correct.
1998.97-7597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.762,945.12,"--Could I ask you, in your... in your researches on the common law, did the common law draw a distinction between a... what you've called a custodial arrest and a non-custodial arrest?"
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,963.836,974.991,"Justice Scalia, I am not aware that the common law had any other means to prosecute a criminal offense... to commence the prosecution of a criminal offense outside of arrest."
1998.97-7597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.682,992.154,I think you mistook my question.
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1010.106,1017.442,I... I do not know that the common law distinguished between a... a simple seizure of the person and an arrest.
1998.97-7597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.722,1037.905,"Well, if that's the case, then... then... and if it didn't, then the long history of... of allowing searches of this sort only in connection with an arrest could be a long history of allowing searches in connection with a traffic stop, whether you give a citation or not."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1037.905,1060.21,--The only common law history that I'm aware of is that which was referred to in United States v. Robinson where the Court indicated that the common law authority or historical sources in this respect were scarce.
1998.97-7597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1061.45,1067.634,"Well, I guess we didn't have a lot of cars and trucks back in the 1600's and the 1700's."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1067.854,1068.375,--We didn't have any.
1998.97-7597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1068.375,1081.063,"If we move forward from the common law to cases decided by this Court, Berkemer against McCarty you cite in your brief I guess for the proposition that a traffic stop is not an arrest."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1081.063,1096.753,"That's correct, but I believe later this Court clarified its decision in Berkemer and said if the officer had told this individual that he was under arrest at the inception of this particular encounter, then the Court would have considered that an arrest."
1998.97-7597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1096.753,1098.523,That was a clarification?
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1098.523,1099.635,"Oh, it was?"
1998.97-7597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.635,1100.196,I assume--
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1100.196,1102.356,I don't know if it was a clarification or not.
1998.97-7597,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1155.333,1161.33,--That was Justice Powell's argument in... in Robinson.
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1191.449,1201.157,"--Well, because the... the right to make the greater intrusion, for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, is a hypothetical situation."
1998.97-7597,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1207.11,1208.222,"No, but you... maybe I misunderstand you."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1211.746,1217.011,"I have conceded that an arrest could have been made... made for the traffic offense, but an arrest wasn't made."
1998.97-7597,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1217.832,1232.741,"No, but if... but my question is, if the... if the right to commit to the greater intrusion, the arrest, is assumed, why doesn't it follow that there is a right to commit to the lesser intrusion, which is the mere search?"
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1232.741,1249.812,"Because... and I would refer to United States... Whren v. the United States, that the Fourth Amendment is concerned with the actual events and not those events which could have happened or normally would have happened."
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1276.441,1299.566,"Mr. Rosenberg, in your... you made some rather graphic comparisons in... in... in your briefing in some of the others that if you say every citation can trigger a... a full custodial search, then the jaywalker is in danger, the person who's walking a dog without a leash."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1318.116,1324.701,I don't believe that those specific examples were brought up in briefing to the Iowa Supreme Court.
1998.97-7597,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1324.701,1329.005,"Because there is no limit in Iowa, as I understand it."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1337.31,1350.988,"Every traffic offense in Iowa is an arrestable offense, and therefore every traffic offense in Iowa, for which somebody is cited, is the basis for a full search of their person and vehicle--"
1998.97-7597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1350.988,1355.703,Do you count driving under the influence as a traffic offense?
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1355.703,1355.933,--No.
1998.97-7597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1355.933,1378.299,"Because there, it seems to me, the officer might have a reason akin to those given in Robinson for wanting to search for more evidence, but it seems to me also that with speeding, the offense is complete in a sense when the car is brought to a stop, and you're not going to find anything inside the car that is going to help you prove the person has been speeding."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1378.299,1384.473,But most traffic citations are... produce no need to look for evidence.
1998.97-7597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.306,1424.3,"And if I understand it correctly, it's not the State law that... that... that you can search whenever you issue a citation."
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1433.867,1434.718,That's correct.
1998.97-7597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.219,1443.506,"So, walking a dog, failing to curb your dog and some of those other examples really... would they be a problem under Iowa law?"
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1443.506,1444.037,--No.
1998.97-7597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.5,1448.022,They are arrestable for failure to curb your dog?
1998.97-7597,0,38269,paul_rosenberg,,1448.022,1448.443,--Yes.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1624.368,1630.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1674.364,1678.785,May I just be sure that you agree with what your opponent said on the scope of the citation?
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1681.096,1685.851,"--In Iowa, almost every ordinance--"
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1685.851,1687.781,"And therefore your... so, it does--"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1687.781,1688.863,"--It does, generally, yes."
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1688.863,1691.113,--Because you could arrest him for jaywalking.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1691.113,1691.374,Correct.
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.374,1695.785,"And therefore, if there... if somebody jaywalks, the police could search him."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1695.785,1698.887,"Correct, because they could make a custodial arrest and search incident thereto."
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1698.887,1700.359,And that would include a strip search.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1703.341,1703.582,No.
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1703.802,1705.224,A strip search for jaywalking?
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1705.224,1705.444,--No.
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1726.909,1731.341,But your argument is there would be no constitutional objection to a strip search for a traffic citation.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1731.341,1731.542,--No.
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1760.79,1768.416,"Do you acknowledge that the rule you're asking us to confirm today, the Iowa opinion, is an extension of our previous cases?"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1768.416,1789.237,"The... it's the State's position that in interpreting Iowa Code section 805.1(4), the Iowa court simply says that statute authorizes whatever the Fourth Amendment authorizes and then went on to decide that the Fourth Amendment does authorize search incident to citation."
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1790.119,1790.579,Well--
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1793.321,1796.263,We think it's... it's certainly an issue that hasn't been decided before.
1998.97-7597,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1805.43,1819.237,"Well, but Cupp v. Murphy certainly didn't speak in terms of a broad right to conduct searches even with the presence of probable cause."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1819.237,1819.457,--Right.
1998.97-7597,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1860.327,1868.602,"Well, your... there's no reason to expect evidence to be produced by virtue of this search of the traffic violation, is there?"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1868.602,1871.253,"--The State does not concede that point, Your Honor--"
1998.97-7597,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1871.253,1871.724,Really.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1871.724,1872.784,--for a couple of reasons.
1998.97-7597,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1886.364,1890.945,How can you say that at the point that the decision is made to issue the citation?
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1900.655,1904.408,--It's certainly true that the... the person will likely have produced some kind of identification.
1998.97-7597,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1904.408,1909.453,"Well, would the officer let him go with a... with a citation if he didn't have any identification?"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,1912.743,1913.715,"Right, likely not."
1998.97-7597,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1984.405,1988.849,"Well, I think you're... I don't know whether that's... I'm from a small town too."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2037.96,2055.455,"--Well, of course, the State's second response to the issue of whether there's evidence in a... in a speeding case, for example, is that in Gustafson and Robinson, the Court said because such a search is reasonable, we don't look in a particular case to see whether there would, in fact, be evidence or weapons to search for--"
1998.97-7597,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2055.455,2057.989,"Okay, but that goes back to another one of the justifications in Robinson."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2100.608,2109.823,"--Well, certainly one would normally expect that a search based on a concern for officer safety might be made at the initiation of a stop, but I would point out a couple of things."
1998.97-7597,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2109.823,2110.483,But it's... but it's not.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2125.435,2125.532,Correct.
1998.97-7597,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2156.377,2168.945,"Well, can infer that the officer always intended to make the search because he was relying on State law and he realized that he might very well want some extra protection while he was searching a car."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2197.704,2211.471,"--If by extend Robinson, the Court means apply it to a situation where the officer subjectively did not fear the suspect, then the State does not agree with that characterization because I think the Court noted in Robinson--"
1998.97-7597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2211.471,2212.673,I was going to... go ahead.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2212.673,2217.365,--I think the Court noted in Robinson that that officer did not have a subjective fear of the defendant.
1998.97-7597,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2217.365,2218.347,"Well, but that's because--"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2218.347,2218.487,Certainly--
1998.97-7597,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2218.487,2220.878,--Robinson said we're going to establish general rules.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2220.878,2221.278,--Right.
1998.97-7597,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2221.278,2221.779,Okay.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2221.779,2225.984,And it's the State's position that similarly a general rule should be established in this context.
1998.97-7597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.984,2240.981,But... but in a way you... you would be going beyond Robinson here because you're saying that there's an authority to search that would not be the same basis as was set forth in Robinson.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2258.973,2285.432,"We certainly agree that although there are studies that say that... that show that officers are not objectively able to accurately predict which offenders are likely to be dangerous and while there are... are statistics that indicate that traffic offenders do pose a threat, certainly common sense would tell us that on a continuum of danger, in most cases most offenders are less likely to be dangerous--"
1998.97-7597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.432,2292.475,And the officer has it his power under Iowa law to obviate at least a part of that danger by making a custodial arrest.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2292.475,2305.886,"--And... and that, Your Honor, is why we... we make the statement that it's not really an extension of Robinson or Gustafson because in every case where the officer can search under the Iowa statute, the officer can already make a custodial arrest--"
1998.97-7597,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2305.886,2309.536,How many other States have a policy like Iowa's?
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2315.242,2322.305,"--There are a handful of States who either by rule, statute, or judicial decision have a practice similar to Iowa's."
1998.97-7597,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.318,2350.816,Are these all States that say that any... all these traffic offenses... that all of those are subject to full custodial arrest?
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2350.816,2361.442,"--Colorado makes a bit of a distinction in that there they were dealing with a statute... an offense for which the statute specifically prohibited arrest, and so some of--"
1998.97-7597,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2361.442,2372.637,"I'm asking you about how many are like Iowa because, frankly, it startled to me to think that... that a police officer could make a full custodial arrest for the pettiest infraction."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2372.637,2372.957,--I'm sorry.
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2389.98,2393.913,May I ask another question about the routine procedure that police follow?
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2411.814,2413.326,That's normal--
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.326,2414.698,In the States except for Iowa.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2420.83,2421.001,--No.
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.655,2448.652,"So that now that... if... if we affirm the Iowa court, presumably the practice would become much more prevalent."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2448.652,2456.106,"Well, certainly as one would expect prior to Belton, there were probably few auto searches under that... that doctrine."
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2461.558,2470.535,"Doesn't that also indicate that the Iowa officers do not consider it, in the usual case, necessary to search in order to protect the officer?"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2470.535,2477.581,"--That's... the second ground is that I think that officers do exercise a great deal of discretion, and... and are careful about when they use this."
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2477.581,2483.413,But... but you're asking us to have... have a rule which presumes that there's a danger to the officer.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2485.626,2487.787,It's certainly one of the two--
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2487.787,2491.18,But that presumption doesn't accord with the facts even as Iowa officers now understand.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2491.18,2508.121,"--Well, certainly just as the law currently allows custodial arrest and search in every situation, which is unquestionably constitutional and conceded by... by Knowles, and officers currently are not searching in all those cases, they would... they would behave presumably similarly under search incident to citation."
1998.97-7597,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2529.214,2542.632,"Ms. Chambers, there's another side to this too because the person who's apprehended, if in fact there's arrest, there's a warning light that will go off because that person will get a Miranda warning."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2570.912,2576.345,"Well, of course, if a custodial arrest, Miranda would only have to be made if the officer wished to interrogate."
1998.97-7597,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2594.047,2599.342,It does seem an enormous amount of authority to put into the hands of the police.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2613.802,2627.57,"--But taking this back into the... a practical example, the officer in the Knowles case could already have made a custodial arrest and searched, and unless the officer wished to interrogate Mr. Knowles, he would not have been required to give a Miranda."
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.026,2676.072,But it's a lot of trouble not just for the... not just for the suspect but for the officer and for the system to arrest somebody.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2676.072,2676.793,It certainly is.
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.793,2684.968,And it's a deterrent against conducting... conducting searches where there is genuinely no reason to conduct a search.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2688.64,2689.131,That would--
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.131,2692.683,Police don't like to do paperwork I gather from watching television movies.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2693.925,2695.326,--We will certainly concede the latter.
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.326,2695.496,They don't like to do--
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2695.496,2704.612,"That would be true if it were not for the fact that under Iowa law officers can arrest, search, and then subsequently release on citation."
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2711.486,2711.626,--Excuse me.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2715.998,2716.389,--Yes.
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2716.389,2717.61,Wow.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2718.532,2721.134,"And in fact, the form that they would use--"
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.134,2722.694,I really only did this arrest so I could search.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2724.877,2725.107,"--Well, that's--"
1998.97-7597,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2725.107,2725.848,Let's forget about it.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2725.848,2726.878,--That's certainly one take.
1998.97-7597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2775.24,2778.152,"That's not entirely true, I don't think, Ms. Chambers."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2794.213,2798.265,But certainly there would not... that would not meet the needs to preserve evidence.
1998.97-7597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2802.729,2809.304,And what evidence do you need to... to search for when you've stopped a person for speeding?
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2809.304,2819.028,"Again, identity, but there also might be... speeding is... is probably at the lowest end of the continuum."
1998.97-7597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2819.028,2821.349,"If you'd come here on second burglary, it might have been different."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2821.349,2821.999,"Certainly, and of course--"
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2821.999,2824.752,"Actually in this case, he knew the defendant."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2824.752,2825.243,--He did.
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2825.243,2827.944,He knew that he was Knowles when he stopped... before he stopped him.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2827.944,2832.918,"He did, and certainly in this case the officer made no bones about the fact that he suspected that there were drugs."
1998.97-7597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.254,2845.697,"And under Whren, we said there's no such thing as a pretextual search."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2851.922,2864.951,"Yes, and under Robinson and Gustafson, the Court also said that the fact that the officer didn't believe that he would, in fact, find evidence or a weapon did not defeat the need for the search, the search being reasonable under the Fourth Amendment."
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.599,2896.982,"May I ask you about your statement, requires initiation of prosecution?"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2916.425,2916.775,--No.
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.617,2918.215,They could give a warning.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2918.215,2918.416,Yes.
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2918.416,2921.708,Could they give a warning after initially arresting the person?
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2921.708,2927.603,"Yes, if... if by arrest, you mean saying, you're under arrest."
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2927.603,2928.234,Yes.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2928.234,2929.176,Or certainly they--
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2929.176,2933.958,"They could... so, in other words, they could arrest, search, find nothing, and then say, well, I'll just give you a warning."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2933.958,2934.639,--Yes.
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2934.639,2935.07,They could.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2935.07,2946.146,"The State, however, does not believe that the Court needs to go as far as deciding whether search could be conducted where only a... only a warning is issued."
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2946.146,2963.407,"Could... could they arrest... under Justice Stevens' hypothetical, could they arrest, search, then give a warning, if the arrest were simply a pretext for a search and they had no intention at the time of arrest of doing anything other but giving a warning?"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2963.407,2964.919,The--
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2964.919,2966.091,Absent finding something.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2966.091,2968.371,--Did you assume arrest?
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2970.061,2976.997,"Could the... could the... could the officer arrest, having the intention at all times simply of giving a warning?"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2979.658,2984.341,"--Of course, that's not this case, and it raises I think the question of pretext."
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2984.341,2985.803,"Well, but you were the one that said we have the right for a lot--"
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,2985.803,2986.023,Right.
1998.97-7597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2993.25,2995.572,"--Well, it's not... it's not... it's not a pretext."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,3004.127,3005.557,"I think he could do that, Your Honor."
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3062.346,3064.85,I don't understand why it would require that.
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,3080.038,3101.462,"There is an argument to be made... and it may be a good one... that probable cause to arrest alone would be enough, but the State has recognized the Court's concerns in Robinson, Gustafson, and other cases that the... the scope of the search and the immediate need to search is related to custody or an equivalent of custody."
1998.97-7597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.624,3135.706,"Yes, and I know you say that, that it would... that's the rule you propose, but it seems to me that if we adopted the rule you propose, there would be nothing to prevent the officer from conducting all the searches he wants to and simply giving warnings whenever he finds nothing and going ahead with the prosecution whenever he finds something."
1998.97-7597,1,17549,bridget_a_chambers,,3136.967,3141.192,"It could happen, but let me remind the Court that it could also happen with custodial arrest--"
