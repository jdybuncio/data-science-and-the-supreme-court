1976.74-1263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.531,"We will here at arguments next in 74-1263, Brewer against Williams."
1976.74-1263,0,40779,richard_n_winders,,58.326,61.159,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.74-1263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,456.711,461.114,"Mr. Winders, how far is it from Davenport to Des Moines?"
1976.74-1263,0,40779,richard_n_winders,,461.114,466.645,"Your Honor, it is approximately 163 miles."
1976.74-1263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,466.645,468.582,"I am sorry, but Grinnell?"
1976.74-1263,0,40779,richard_n_winders,,468.582,478.364,"Grinnell is approximately 60 miles from Des Moines, so it would be roughly a 110-120 miles."
1976.74-1263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,478.364,487.011,"Mr. Winders is it correct that Mr. Leaming statement that he knew the body was in the area, whatever it was, was a false statement?"
1976.74-1263,0,40779,richard_n_winders,,487.011,490.186,"Your Honor, the testimony is conflicting."
1976.74-1263,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,509.134,511.629,"Well, it was incorrect that he knew."
1976.74-1263,0,40779,richard_n_winders,,511.629,513.081,"Well, he did not absolutely know."
1976.74-1263,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.979,516.191,So that was a false statement.
1976.74-1263,0,40779,richard_n_winders,,516.191,519.029,"Well, he did not know for sure absolutely."
1976.74-1263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,521.24,529.126,"State’s position as to why he made the statement, if it was not for the purpose of try to in effect interrogate the defendant?"
1976.74-1263,0,40779,richard_n_winders,,529.126,539.436,"Well, Your Honor, we would not call an interrogation but we do concede and the testimony has fairly certain that Leaming wanted to find and locate the little girl before they got to Des Moines and midnight, he stated of that."
1976.74-1263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.436,544.92,Or more narrowly would it be correct to say that he wanted the defendant to reveal the whereabouts of the child?
1976.74-1263,0,40779,richard_n_winders,,544.92,550.498,"I think you could say that and it is the same thing, I think, Your Honor."
1976.74-1263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,552.481,556.201,The seven minutes that you indicated you wish has been consumed.
1976.74-1263,0,40779,richard_n_winders,,556.201,557.231,"Alright, Your Honor, thank you."
1976.74-1263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,571.476,571.626,Mr. Attorney General.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,571.626,574.898,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1976.74-1263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,588.375,608.81,I think we have atlases available if we need to check that counsel.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,608.81,635.866,"When I found out we had only a half hour to argue this, I felt like the poor guy that sat down in one night near income tax time to do his income tax return and reading the instructions that it will only take the average tax payer a half hour and he said to himself oh! My Gosh it will take me longer then that to find my wife’s social security number."
1976.74-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,933.686,939.108,Is that sort of an agreement enforceable as if it were a contract under Iowa Law?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,939.108,940.713,I should think not Your Honor.
1976.74-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.343,962.366,"But it could raise constitutional overtones, but I would not be surprised if any state as a matter of public policy would say, you treated just like you would a contract to buy some potatoes."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,962.366,970.929,I think too Your Honor that you would not treat it the same way that you would treat an agreement between defense counsel and the prosecuting attorney.
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,976.486,980.363,I thought we had to expect that there was an agreement.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,980.363,982.175,"Your Honor, perhaps we do."
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,982.175,985.824,Whatever that means as my brother Rehnquist said it might not be…
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,985.824,988.671,He raised that in a previous case and perhaps…
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,988.671,996.254,"We just ask you this question, am I mistaken in believing that the trail judge in your state found that there was an agreement?"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,996.254,996.671,He did.
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,996.671,1010.671,"On Habeas Corpus, on federal habeas corpus this was submitted by stipulation between the parties on the trail record and if the District Court accepted the fact if there was an agreement, and therefore, that we have to accept that as a fact in this case."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1012.308,1019.322,"Well, Your Honor, I know the rule on that actually I think…"
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1019.322,1022.216,Well the answer is yes or no?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1022.216,1025.092,"No, I do not think you absolutely need to accept."
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.117,1045.494,"And so did the Federal District Court, is it not?"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1045.494,1048.955,"Well, the Federal District Court did so, on the basis that it was bound by the finding of the trial court."
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1048.955,1053.035,"Well, this could be a way that it should make its finding on, do you not?"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1053.035,1054.013,Yes sir.
1976.74-1263,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1054.013,1057.761,How did the Supreme Court of Iowa treat that point?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1057.761,1064.544,"They too found that there was an agreement, I believe."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1064.544,1069.64,"So, as the record stands now everybody agrees there was an agreement but you…"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1069.64,1070.705,"Well, Your Honor."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1070.705,1071.851,Is that right?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1071.851,1077.592,"That is correct, but I stand here -- that is true."
1976.74-1263,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1093.822,1107.187,"Mr. Attorney General if we are bound by the finding that there was an agreement, what is your view as to whether or not it was broken by the questions that were asked by officer Leaming?"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1107.187,1114.346,"Well, Your Honor, Officer Leaming testified and he was un-contradicted that he did not really ask any questions."
1976.74-1263,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1131.289,1144.558,"I think you indicated earlier that the Officer was anxious by the questions he asked to lead Williams into stating where the body was located, did you not?"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1144.558,1147.884,Yes he was and he made a statement for that purpose.
1976.74-1263,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1147.884,1150.184,Would you regard that as interrogation?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1150.184,1157.702,"Well, it was not interrogation in the customary sense of thinking of interrogation has been questioning."
1976.74-1263,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1157.702,1159.82,You mean he had not been put under the oath at that time.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1159.82,1161.869,"Well, he had not asked him a question."
1976.74-1263,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1180.854,1189.543,But it is not implied really Mr. Attorney General what you indicated earlier and that is that the officer wanted to elicit information for Williams.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1189.543,1189.988,Yes sir.
1976.74-1263,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1189.988,1197.152,"Whatever techniques he used, I would suppose a lawyer would consider that he was pursuing interrogation."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1197.152,1199.64,"It is, but it was very brief."
1976.74-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1209.873,1211.478,But you do concede…
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1211.478,1213.778,This was volunteered two hours later.
1976.74-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.778,1221.278,Do not you concede though Mr. Turner if it had been a prosecuting attorney who made assuming it was an agreement that he would be bound?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1222.97,1225.679,"So matter of ethics, he would be Your Honor."
1976.74-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.521,1231.552,"Well it was a matter of ethics as so as police officers bound, but what significance do we attach ethics in this."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1231.552,1234.314,"Well, I think the Court’s attach it."
1976.74-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.314,1236.001,Let me rephrase the question.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1243.758,1246.839,"Perhaps, because yes…"
1976.74-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.839,1250.801,That your position depends on the fact that it is a police officer rather than prosecuting attorney.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1251.128,1266.884,"In a plea bargain, for example the Courts have held that the prosecuting attorney is bound and later set aside his agreement and I think yes, but not; the law has never extended to a police officer in this regard."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.884,1269.291,What is the sense of having a lawyer?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1275.338,1291.712,"Well, I have not conceded there was an agreement, but even though you have a lawyer, you say that this is your life to the lawyer even a trial, the Court has held that in the Faretta case."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.712,1294.025,When did he waive his right to the lawyer?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1297.02,1298.067,I think he did.
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1298.067,1299.078,When?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1299.078,1301.688,"As he drove down, as he approached Grinnell."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1301.688,1304.227,Did he say anything about lawyer or waive?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1304.227,1306.746,"Well, in the first place he called Mr. McKnight."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1308.545,1310.261,But did he say anything about waive?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1310.261,1313.091,"No, and it is no required under the cases."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1317.96,1326.582,"Is the man going for one lawyer and he asked the lawyer go along with him, he is on his way to another lawyer and in between the two lawyers, he waives lawyer."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1326.582,1329.813,"Well, there is another dispute in fact is to whether that Mr. Kelly asked…"
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1329.813,1333.082,"Well, why not assume that this is disputed?"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1333.082,1334.843,It is disputed Your Honor.
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1334.843,1335.971,It is disputed.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1335.971,1343.496,It is disputed and the trial judge did not make any finding on that point of lawyer.
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1346.941,1351.04,He needs too because he found that there had been in an agreement.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1351.04,1355.56,"You mean to go along, to ride along in the car."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.651,1360.451,He said he could not.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1363.082,1368.29,It is disputed whether he was asked Steven to ride -- was he not asked to right along in the car.
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1368.29,1375.117,"Mr. Attorney General, I think the peer was knowing, that you are not allowed to ride in a police car with a prisoner."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1375.117,1379.186,Yes sir.
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1389.107,1396.289,"Yeah, but when did he waive his lawyer, he was still on this (Inaudible) the record that has waived."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1396.289,1400.672,"He never said, expressly said that I waive."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1402.523,1407.999,Anything he said that anybody can interpret that waive…
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1407.999,1410.494,Did you find her shoes?
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1410.494,1412.968,And what did he say?
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1416.138,1421.595,"Yes, I think it is."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1426.054,1428.955,Absolutely asked for a cup of coffee that would have been a waiver.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1428.955,1447.422,"When he directed the officers to go to look for the shoes, he waived his right to counsel while going to look for the shoes and he did the same thing when he went to look for the blanket and again when he went to look for the body."
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1447.422,1449.921,And when did it get it low as that.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1449.921,1452.202,When he got to Des Moines.
1976.74-1263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1455.544,1457.152,That is one of these often --
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1457.152,1460.021,"Yeah, perhaps, he knew his rights."
1976.74-1263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.787,1500.942,"He waives that by talking, is that what you are telling us."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1507.778,1526.536,"Yes, I think he does, and in fact, I think the cases hold that no express statement of the waiver is required that he can simply waive it by proceeding and without his counsel."
1976.74-1263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1548.048,1572.938,"Would it not be more accurate to say in this context that he knew he had a right not to speak, not to speak to the officers about anything relating to the crime and he had been told that by several police officers and several lawyers and that that is the known right that he waives, the right not to speak?"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1572.938,1579.135,"I think he waived both at that point, because he had already had a lawyer."
1976.74-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.328,1593.247,"Mr. Attorney General, how do you distinguish the Escobedo case in which Judge Hanson relied so heavily?"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1599.318,1603.544,"Well, in Escobedo in the first place, I think there were no warnings."
1976.74-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.389,1611.702,That is what judge Hanson found happened here too.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1611.702,1612.913,But in this case he…
1976.74-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.913,1617.211,"Is the distinction that you disagree with the finding or, let me ask you this way."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1625.159,1635.193,The finding was that he had said that he would wait and tell them the whole story when he got to Des Moines and talk to his lawyer.
1976.74-1263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.193,1636.948,Let me make sure you understand my question.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1665.078,1675.873,"Well, I think I can, yes because in the Escobedo case even or in any case, the lawyer has no right to ride along or to get into the jail cell or anything."
1976.74-1263,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1710.168,1714.543,"Well, may I ask you a question."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1734.664,1736.676,"Yes sir, I think it would."
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1833.055,1874.641,"May I ask you this is as you know the very threshold point that your adversary makes is that there was a finding on this case that the respondent statement was a matter of fact and as matter of law involuntary and that that finding has not been challenged and if That is true then all this talk of Miranda and Escobedo and everything else is wholly irrelevant because that would decide this case and that was a factual finding, that was affirmed on appeal and its not been challenged by you in this Court."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1882.429,1885.288,"No, I think I reply brief handles that."
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1894.731,1907.746,"No, it is you who petitioned this Court to upset the judgment of the Court of Appeal and if that judgment rests upon a claim, rests upon a foundation that you have not challenged then it should be affirmed on that foundation."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1907.746,1914.678,We contend that we have challenged that Your Honor throughout our argument on Miranda and…
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1914.678,1923.495,"Well, Miranda does not have anything to do with voluntariness at all, in fact that is the volunateriness in fact in everything that triggered the case"
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1923.495,1929.069,"Repeatedly through our argument we say that his statements were voluntary, there is no evidence."
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1929.069,1934.969,"That you say so, but there is been a finding of the contrary that your opponent says you have never attacked."
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1934.969,1949.98,"Well, Your Honor I can say the case is indicated that this Court can and that type of situation where these questions are the very foundation of the whole matter consider those things, even know they were not specifically raised and we have cases cited in our brief to that effect."
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1949.98,1954.708,And you have nothing to say beyond what you said in your reply brief to that on this question.
1976.74-1263,1,40609,richard_c_turner,,1954.708,1958.522,"Not at the moment, but I think we have fully answered it on three different aspects."
1976.74-1263,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1958.522,1964.392,"Right, thank you."
1976.74-1263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1964.392,1967.566,Mr. Bartels.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,1967.566,1970.97,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2058.713,2062.688,"Now, you say that that is forever irrevocable?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2062.688,2078.167,"No, Your Honor though I can conceive of circumstances in which the defendant could clearly state that he had changed his mind about that, where that he was rejecting his Attorney’s advice about that, but there is nothing even remotely resembling that in this."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2078.167,2084.011,"Other way about the rights of the defendant, not the rights of the lawyer."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2084.011,2089.183,That is correct Your Honor and I guess that brings me to the agreement.
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.051,2168.42,Let me ask you a question about the treatment of the Supreme Court of Iowa of the Polk County District Courts finding on that point.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2190.271,2214.382,"No, Your Honor I do not think the Supreme Court of Iowa really made any finding either way on that, really relying on the finding of the state trial court, which I guess is the finding really That is referred to in Section 2254 (d), that is the finding on merits of a factual dispute that has the initial presumption of correctness under 2254 (d)."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2214.382,2224.51,Presumption of correctness and the existence of something called an agreement by all the courts and by the parties.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2231.146,2239.487,"Well, Your Honor, clearly the and it is my view is that the client is the master and that the attorney is the servant."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2252.643,2254.643,It has been argued to some extent as though at were.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2264.521,2269.267,"Your Honor, I think it is not perfectly clear what the judge Denaro meant by an agreement."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2280.673,2290.564,"But your client Williams, the defendant in the case, you have agreed is the master or the principle."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2301.718,2303.569,"Well, he could have done that Your Honor, but he clearly…"
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2303.569,2304.503,Hypothetically I mean --
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2304.503,2315.782,"Hypothetically Your Honor, what could have happened in this trip is that the defendant could have said Mr. Leaming, I want to reject everything my lawyer has done."
1976.74-1263,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2325.531,2337.887,"But suppose he had said instead of that, without anything at all he says I want to tell you where the body is because I killed, the only thing wrong with that is…"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2337.887,2364.362,"Your Honor, if that had taken place before what has been referred to as the Christian Burial Speech and a priest then I think there still would be no problem in this case, except perhaps the fact that Mr. Kelly was denied permission to go long in the squad car and I think that was probably proper also as long as the police were not going to interrogate while Mr. Kelly was not in the police car."
1976.74-1263,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2364.362,2373.811,Had they ridden 120 miles in complete silence and suddenly the defendant had said that he may misbelieve me that I were to tell you.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2378.348,2380.984,"I assume I would not Your Honor, no."
1976.74-1263,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2382.567,2391.87,"I gather then what you emphasize is that Leaming, what he had to say all along, which led finally to the defendant saying what he did."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2391.87,2411.033,"Yes, Your Honor, the most important piece of interrogation here is the Christian Burial Speech and I think Mr. Turner has conceded really that it was an obvious attempt to induce the defendant to provide this information and it is also quite clear from the record that I guess the reason he succeeded."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.963,2441.239,"Well, what is the objection that you see to the Christian Burial Speech?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2441.239,2462.316,"I know for one thing it is an interrogation and beyond being interrogation, Your Honor, I think it was a particularly offensive in course type of interrogation because obviously the references the Christian Burial were designed to play on the defendant’s known religious background and this history no long."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2462.316,2464.553,What is the matter with that?
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2464.553,2465.887,Wrong with playing on it?
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.887,2477.829,"Yeah, presumably there is a privilege against compulsory self incrimination, but suddenly the law does not frown on incrimination that comes voluntarily."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2482.14,2494.167,"No Your Honor, but I think the point is that what detective Leaming did and the way in which he made that Christian Burial speech was psychologically coerced and this Court has recognized in the past that there could be such --"
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2494.167,2497.816,"Well, how does it coerce somebody?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2497.816,2517.846,"Your Honor, I think that the detective Leaming was trying to play on the defendant’s psychological weakness to make him do something that he would not have done under any just ordinary question and answering the case and that to play on those kinds of weaknesses amounts to psychological coercion."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2521.468,2547.17,"Given, the record as it now here Mr. Bartels, if the only evidence introduced against your client, the defendant at all was his statement, did you find the shoes, that is assume nothing else beyond that, would you say that should have bend excluded under the exclusionary rule?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2547.17,2571.288,"Your Honor, I doubt it, and I think there are might have been, there had to be some further enquiry then by the trial courts, both federal and state, in terms of whether that question was somehow connected to the Christian Burial Speech, but I think on this record, we really do not know that and I am perfectly willing to conceded that that statement alone could have been admissible."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2583.674,2593.232,Do you think that it would not be incriminating evidence to have that introduced?
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2593.232,2599.918,"Your honor, I think that would have been probably admissible as barely relevant on the issue of whether…"
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2599.918,2600.941,Incriminating…
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2600.941,2607.851,"Well, Your Honor, I think if it were not incriminating, it would be relevant so my answer is yes because I think it might be regarded that somewhat incriminating."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2607.851,2614.793,"I am assuming that a situation would prevail on that, that he would not take the stand."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2633.631,2637.127,"Your Honor, I think someone might make something out of this question about the shoes."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2663.312,2664.97,"That is conclusive, that is conclusive."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2664.97,2675.976,"I think the question here is whether the admission of the other statements about the location, the body was harmless beyond reasonable doubt."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2675.976,2682.945,How about the search for the clothing and the blanket? Would that be -- do you think that would have been admissible?
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2682.945,2685.84,"Your Honor, I doubt that."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2726.364,2731.794,And you think all of that would necessarily be barred along with the body of the victim?
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2731.794,2737.331,"Your Honor, I think that is further interrogation, yes."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.677,2749.541,Let me ask you one question about the agreement if I may Mr. Bartels along the line I asked the Attorney General about your theory.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2773.606,2777.794,"Your Honor, I think it is in essence, not because of the $1000."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.175,2817.799,"Well, you think in agreement between parties like this is enforceable; this is it or a contract?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2817.799,2819.647,Your Honor let me clarify.
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2832.812,2840.555,"Then what you are saying is it is improper because it is a violation of a constitutional right, not because of Iowa contract law?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2840.555,2841.601,"You are right, that is right, Your Honor."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2861.025,2865.813,But then the agreement itself is not separately enforceable to bar the evidence.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2871.419,2873.43,"I think that is true characterization, Your Honor."
1976.74-1263,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2873.43,2882.472,"Mr. Bartels you keep raising the point about not let him in the car, was he not told that it is against police regulations, it was impossible?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2882.472,2884.52,"He was told it was impossible, Your Honor, and…"
1976.74-1263,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2884.52,2886.421,"Well, is that true?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2886.421,2888.283,"Your Honor, I do not know."
1976.74-1263,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2892.041,2898.699,"Well, any police regulations you read will tell you that lawyers cannot ride in cars with their client."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2898.699,2904.807,"Your Honor, we are not against saying that Mr. Kelly had an enforceable right to be in the car."
1976.74-1263,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.807,2908.373,(Inaudible) I thought you put too much emphasis on it; that is what I thought.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,2908.373,2931.324,"No, I think the point of it Your Honor is that when the police were going to have the defendant isolated from his counsel in that way for whatever reasons, that they were then required not to question, not only because of the agreement but because of the other indications that the defendant should not be questioned or provide information in the absence of his attorney."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3039.245,3042.838,"Well, it is the only basis the Eighth Circuit rested on this, is it not?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3042.838,3043.593,"No, Your Honor."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3050.325,3051.117,You think so.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3051.117,3058.639,"Yes, Your Honor, and clearly the District Court’s decision rested on several grounds."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3063.276,3064.323,"(Inaudible) it all, did it?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3064.323,3071.449,"No, Your Honor, it simply affirmed and its discussion of the grounds for affirmance did not include any discussion of voluntariness."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3076.702,3086.601,"Well, if the District Court’s decision on that had stood in the deal with the Eighth Circuit, why would it had been necessary to get into issues like Miranda and the right of counsel."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3090.264,3107.686,"Well, Your Honor, I think that Eighth Circuit was faced with choice of several equal theories, any one or two or three of which it could have discussed and there was really nothing about any of them that said that this issue or that issue should be the one that we rely on primarily."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3122.584,3142.697,"If we should, if this Court should reject the Miranda and the Sixth Amendment grounds and be unwilling to pass upon the involuntariness grounds, I suppose that the case should be sent back to the Eighth Circuit, so that it could consider whatever the state had to say about the involuntariness finding being clearly erroneous."
1976.74-1263,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3157.272,3160.669,There is not sense in the Eight Circuit is opinion that it was first a voluntary.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3160.669,3162.057,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.74-1263,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3162.057,3163.738,Except in the dissent.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3163.738,3174.354,"In the dissent, Your Honor, it is raised and then challenged at that point, and I think that reflects the fact that it was litigated and considered."
1976.74-1263,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3180.857,3183.853,Up to now you have not been talking.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3189.024,3189.999,"No, Your Honor, I think it…"
1976.74-1263,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3189.999,3195.441,It is rely rather on the Massiah and Escobedo and basically on the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3195.441,3197.17,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3318.01,3327.664,"Well, here is another question, the question of waiving the right to remain the silent on this very crucial subject."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3331.298,3349.473,"That is right, Your Honor, I think the second problem with the state’s view here is supposedly the statements come after the defendants’ right not to be questioned in the absence of his lawyer has already occurred, and surely Your Honor, the waiver has to precede the violation in order to take care of it."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3349.473,3354.852,"That right stems from Miranda that you are arguing now, is it not?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3354.852,3369.999,"Your Honor, I think it stems both from Miranda and from the Sixth Amendment right to have Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment, the right to have the assistance of counsel during this kind of critical stage after a charge has been filed."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3370.382,3380.441,We will resume after lunch if you have anything further.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3385.933,3388.238,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.74-1263,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3416.47,3419.903,"It could not be, because Stone against Powell had come down in a long while."
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3419.903,3435.443,"Your Honor, I think the issue could have been raised as it was by the litigant’s stand in the Stone case, but more significantly, I think Your Honor, that even in the reply brief that was filed last week, there is simply no mention at this issue by the state."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3435.443,3440.516,"But you have to say about Stone and Powell, would you think that could control here?"
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3440.516,3442.069,No Your Honor.
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3442.069,3443.118,Tell us why.
1976.74-1263,2,38785,robert_bartels,,3443.118,3452.167,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the rationale in those cases was carefully limited to the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, the exclusionary ruling."
1976.74-1263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3572.737,3575.637,"Thank you gentleman, I think the state has used its time."
